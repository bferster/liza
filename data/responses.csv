110.1,Farrah,,alright class ,hi how are you 
110.1,Farrah,,good how are how is class ,great we're so excited for your class 
140.1,Farrah,,that's awesome that's awesome before we get started i want to ask if you class can come up with a name that you want me to call you in the collective so i don't like to say boys and girls and i don't like to say you class so do is it a school mascot do you want to be the jet eyes the eagles the ketchup packets what can i call you as a class ,okay how about how about the wildcats because that's our that's our school class 
140.1,Luis,,awesome wildcats i love it okay wildcats so we yes student your question ,yeah i'm okay i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Farrah,,that's awesome if you're then you can help us figure out these couple questions so we're so glad to have you in this class and you can you can kind of help us to follow the prompts of the the question that we were that we were answering so i'm so glad you're here all right so we all as wild cats were talking about water on the moon right all right yeah student what what was your response to the prompt you remember ,yeah okay um i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
110.1,Farrah,,that's that's totally correct i think we'd all agree with you that if you had a microscope you would use it to look at water really closely although let's think about what happens before that point right and student i think you said this did you say the same thing is that right yeah yeah same thing as student awesome so student and student get awesome points for circling the parts in the text prompt because that was the the direction so a direction for following points so let's think about before we actually look at water with the microscope what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water they found on the moon so they use the microscope after they had found it but what did they use to find it do you remember hi student i see you've got your hand we're going to wait because i'm i'm talking to student and deb because this is specific to the question that they that they asked is that ok ok i put a pin you i'll come back to you ,as well okay you said what do they use before the microscope and i guess i guess i don't really know i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
130.2,Jazmin,,"Can you and Oliver work together to go back to the text and figure figure out what that machine was called, is that cool? yeah yeah we can work together we work together really well awesome awesome okay student and student will pair up and and find the answer to that question thank you folks okay student ",okay well okay i said nasa sent a small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,that's right you totally did and nasa did send a small machine do you remember what they called that machine science has all sorts of wacky names for their machines so that's what we're looking for we're looking to see if we can find the name of what that small machine was do you remember i don't know if i could remember but ,i have to look so yeah 
210.3,Farrah,,yep totally yeah look at the text look back i think it's close to that same line about the small machine i'm not sure but let us know okay and nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter nailed it yes student high five hashtag awesome lunar orbiter is the name of the machine great student and student are you ready to come back to us with an answer or do you want me to to investigate some other answers first ,okay well um so we we saw where it said lunar orbiter and we also heard you tell student that lunar orbiter is the right answer and so i guess i guess i know that now but i don't know um how i how i would have picked lunar orbiter instead of microscope does that make sense 
210.2,Farrah,,i yeah totally um so the microscope if you look at the are three sentences here are three paragraphs in paragraph three it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you would need a scientific cool tool called a microscope to look really closely so there's the part with the microscope but if we go before then we see where you found it called the lunar orbiter and paragraph two right it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and so that is the question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon not to look at it afterwards does that make sense ,oh yeah okay okay so first they find it with the orbiter and then then also it's like they then they like study it they study it with a microscope 
130.2,Oliver,,totally you got it student are you are you on board with that ,um yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense it's like they use one then they use the other 
130.2,Chris,,you got it awesome student do you want to talk about your answer do you have a different question ,oh well it's kind of a comment 
130.2,Chris,,let's hear it ,i went to nasa yeah i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.4,Chris,,you nailed it they absolutely do they use so much equipment in science and nasa and they get to play with like lasers all day and i am jealous of them yes thumbs up so let's see student what answer did you put for the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,oh man oh i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for coming in and bringing so much energy and helping us learn in such a fun way i didn't know that this was going to be so fun looking at this article and i just wanted to say thank you for listening and explaining but also making it fun 
220.1,Luis,,awesome thanks student have a good lunch hello um i think these are all really great starting answers and i just want us to really work on looking at this text a little more so that we can make our answers more complete and built on textual evidence that we see in the reading and so can i get a yes student you have something to ask her sure ,yeah um so i i should it be and this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,i love that you know you have so much prior knowledge about space yeah i appreciate that i'm you know i think you'll bring a lot to whatever class that you're in i think we all have different strengths here and i just want us to really practice not just like knowing the content but also being able to use the skill of backing our responses up with text with evidence from the text does that sound okay ,yeah okay i'll i'll stick around 
230.2,Farrah,,i'm glad i'm glad to hear that i think you will have a lot to contribute with your knowledge um so i was wondering if i could get them volunteer to share their answer and what they were thinking like where where they found their answer in the texts yes student ,ok so my answer is that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely on and about my my thinking so i found it in part three and it talks about how the water is microscopic and you can't see it without a microscope 
130.2,Oliver,,yeah awesome so you identify and equipment now um can i get someone else let's build on samantha's answer can i get someone else to talk about how this microscope would allow us to discover water so then we got the first part of the question right the equipment and now can we get someone to think about how that connects to the discovering waterpark yes student ,um yeah i can do that because i had the same answer student about the microscope and so in terms of discovering the water the water so small that you can't discover something you can't see so i would need a microscope to see it to discover it 
230.3,Jazmin,,"Even better answer So yes, great so you have this microscope and we're saying that we need it because to discover the water, because the water is so small that you wouldn't be able to see it otherwise awesome yes Jazmin. ",so i have a different answer on my necessary such a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.1,Jazmin,,your answer is not wrong i think that there are multiple answers here right so we've identified one equipment you actually i'm glad you brought this up because i was just about to ask what other answers people had so why don't you share a little bit about what you were thinking with your answer ,okay so i found that in part two and it's in the very first sentence it says nasa center small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah and what does the machine call ,a lunar orbiter 
130.2,Luis,,awesome a lunar orbiter now let's have someone else add to that answer so how did that allow scientists to discover water on the moon yes student ,okay so the lunar orbiter i think it's kind of like a robot thing and it can go into the craters the dark the dark moon graders and that's how it can find that that tiny tiny water 
210.4,Luis,,tiny water well can yes i love that so we have this lunar orbiter and it's going into this polar crater and it's looking for the small water and where's the small water located in ,and greater 
210.4,Luis,,and what form so so is it like we're looking for a giant lake so we're looking for what can we yeah well for me what form is the water in what is the same the text in part two yes don't ,fit as a water as ice 
110.1,Chris,,yes ice and ice deposits yes student ,okay well so i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
150.1,Farrah,,"yeah i did i am so happy to hear that you already know so much about or like you went to nasa that's really awesome i've always wanted to go check out like nasa's and facilities and museums and i think you and student probably have a lot to talk about feed both share the interest in space thank you for sharing yeah so definitely a lot of different equipment and even in this reading right we've already identified two different equipment that allow us to discover water on the moon i love that you class are really using the reading and pointing to specific parts and sentences in the reading to help Add on, you know how exactly those equipment were used to discover water on the moon right, so I think each of you had like a piece of it, and then we just had it to we just needed to add on to that, so we have the microscope. and that microscope was used so actually sorry um let me just stop pause for a minute and see if you class have questions yeah student ",okay well so my question is is it okay if i just say the microscope or do i have to less like all of the equipment like the microscope and the orbiter and the oxygen tanks and masks and things 
420.2,Oliver,,you can focus on really building that answer out by identifying the scientific equipment and then explain how that equipment was used to discover water on the moon and then once you've gotten that you can add that to your answer ,i'm i'm so sorry i just looked up a clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for encouraging us to build on our answers but also build on each other's answers on and make them way better that was so helpful thank you so much 
120.3,Farrah,,you class enjoy your lunch hello so um i pulled you class together i want to take a look at the question that we're answering again as a class um let's see we pull this question up and student would you mind reading for us again the question that we're going to be answering together ,okay it's what equipment that scientists to use to discover water on the moon 
120.3,Luis,,excellent and student could you read what is the second part of that what are we circling ,excuse me i have my hand up 
120.3,Luis,,oh i'm so sorry i had you blocked with my half of my screen was blocking you i apologize yeah student ,well i just wanted to say before we go too far i shouldn't be in class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,oh good well that means that you can help us i think that your background knowledge is going to be very helpful for us in this class student ,reacher every reader possible 
120.3,Chris,,okay i think part of what we're doing right now is this isn't just about our knowledge of what we're learning we're going to think about the evidence we're looking for in that text to ok so the background knowledge is going to be great and it's going to help us to understand a little bit what we're reading but we specifically also want to look for evidence right and that's deb that's what i was going to ask you to read is that second part of the question there you see where it says circle ,yeah i can do up um it says circle the evidence and the text that we can use to answer this question 
120.3,Chris,,excellent so we're looking for equipment that they use to discover water on the moon And to recap we're going to look for that evidence so let's let's do a quick reread as a group of this so to keep going around student if you wouldn't mind reading the first paragraph there where it says one for the name of the equipment they use ,yeah okay um part one scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the rooms polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines 
120.3,Jazmin,,excellent student could you read the second paragraph for us ,yeah i would like to because this is where i found my answer it says okay nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these isotope posits are very small and so my answer was from this park it's a nasa scientist small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,how can we work in the text can we find something that's going to give you even more specific information about that small machine ,oh well in the part i just read it says they use it to investigate and look for iced deposits 
230.3,Farrah,,"yes good the investigation part is good let me look at the question again what equipment did they use okay so i'm i'm looking for a name to what's the name of the small machine and he came name is does so, what other folks think about this now is that where we want to agree as an answer go ahead Farrah. so okay we might have found our answer in the second paragraph we're thinking that perhaps the equipment that they used is this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ",and so i found my answer and part three i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and that's evidence from the text also 
120.3,Luis,,yeah and you pulled out something very specific and you found another piece of equipment that was mentioned in the text which is very good as well student just to get your voice in here let's take a look at that last paragraph real quick would you mind reading number three for us ,yeah you got it okay that means that the moon estelle drier than the driest desert on earth water they found as a microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.2,Chris,,thank you so much okay so the question is asking us what equipment and scientists use yes student ,well since we're talking about equipment i wanted to say i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.2,Farrah,,nice yeah they do use a lot of equipment yeah that is yeah and i think there we can see even in this very short text that we see two different pieces of equipment mentioned right we sad the lunar orbiter and we're seeing this thing about a microscope so even just in a few sentences we're seeing multiple pieces of equipment but how do we decide which one is the answer to this question right did they did this third paragraph tell us that the scientist used the microscope to find the water so what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon ,oh well i guess if something is so small that you can't even see it how can you discover it don't you need to see it 
230.3,Farrah,,but do we know for sure does the paragraph tell us that they they had to does it say the scientists used one yeah so you're you're you're thinking they might have needed to use a microscope to see it ,it says you need a scientific tool 
410.3,Oliver,,i think you're raising a good point that they might have needed to use something like a microscope but we don't know for sure because it doesn't say that the scientists definitely used a microscope go ahead ,oh yeah i just want to lock on and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us go back into the text and look for evidence and look really closely at all of the words even just where it said you'd need even that was important and so thank you so much for helping us learn that today 
120.2,Luis,,thanks student all right i'm ready to start simulation hello class welcome thank you so much for being here today teacher hi student so today we are going to dig more into our question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon so thank you all for sharing your answers yeah student what's up ,i'm excuse me i should be in this class i already know all about speed 
150.1,Luis,,yeah so student we're learning about space a little bit but we're also practicing our good science thinking skills so we can all learn more about our science thinking skills student ,okay 
230.1,Luis,,student why don't you tell me more about your answer what made you say what you said ,that scientists use oxygen tanks while cuz i know that's something that they have to do is if they're ever going to go to space 
420.3,Luis,,i love that you brought in that background knowledge student that fact about the scientists and astronauts needing those oxygen tanks that's really awesome background knowledge i am wondering if you can pull out some information from the text that we used so can you find a specific piece of equipment mentioned in this text student ,oh okay let me see now they know it's not water deep craters small machine that's equipment lunar orbiter that's probably equipment i suppose it your microscopic scientific tool that's equipment microscope that's clear but ok so there's four four times they mentioned equipment in the story 
210.4,Luis,,awesome student and which piece of equipment do you think is the most important here ,oh i don't know 
110.1,Luis,,all right i'll let you think about that question while i work with someone else and then i'll come back to you okay ,okay 
230.1,Jazmin,,all right student can you tell me more about your answer what made you say nasa sent a small machine ,yeah i don't understand why my answers wrong 
230.1,Jazmin,,i actually love your answer a lot student um my question for you you mentioned the small machine but a better answer would tell me what the machine does so can you look at the text student and see what the machine does would be can you tell me more about this small machine ,it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater and it lands at the moon south pole 
210.4,Jazmin,,awesome so this little machine it lands on the moon ,uh huh 
210.3,Jazmin,,awesome so student how could you rewrite your answer to include that piece of information ,i'm okay um nasa sent a small machine to land on the moon and look for ice deposits analyze polar crater 
110.1,Jazmin,,yeah that's a great answer student oh ,okay that's pretty easy i can just add that part to my answer and then i'm done 
130.2,Jazmin,,yeah and when you're done why don't you and student talk about luis's new answer and compare your new answers while i work with other people ,i just need to write something down and so we don't need to write anything just so we have to talk about it 
130.2,Jazmin,,yep that's right you don't have to both write you can talk when you're done writing student okay ,okay 
230.1,Farrah,,awesome alright so student and student you said you will have the same answer so why don't we work together and student i'll be with you in just a second so student can you tell me more about your answer and why you said what you did ,oh yeah so my answer was i'm a scientist you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely why did i say it all cuz i think that was the answer to the question and it was in the story and we had to find our enter in the store 
230.2,Farrah,,okay so you read it in the story i love that you found it in the story so student can you read the line for me again where you found it in the story what does it say ,yeah i'm okay so it says well i mean that's the same it's this that's what it says it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.3,Farrah,,okay and our question is what equipment did the scientists use so does that sentence mentioned that the scientists actually use a microscope student ,oh um in that sentence no i guess you need us oh no i guess i don't know 
230.1,Chris,,yeah so i love that you picked up on the microscope in relation to the word microscopic in the text but when we look back at the question it's only asking specifically what machine they used to find the water not all the other machines okay so student you had the same answer is student can you tell me why you put that answer as well ,um yeah yeah i can tell you oh you know what while he's looking did you i went to nasa and i do know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and 
230.1,Chris,,yeah so student you're right those are all great examples of equipment so you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon can you tell me more about that answer ,yeah i'm cause i was looking for where they were talking about looking for water because that's what the question was asking about discovering water and in the first paragraph they they say that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters 
310.1,Chris,,can you read the question for me what is the question actually asking student yeah so student i love that you used your background knowledge about nasa and that you're using evidence from the reading ,oh yeah it says or what equipment at times is used to discover water on the moon 
310.1,Oliver,,yeah so what did important word yeah student ,oh well i'm sorry to interrupt teacher i just was looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go so um thanks for working with us bye 
230.1,Chris,,thank you class have a good recess or lunch or whatever bye bye okay start simulation all right hi class welcome so thank you so much for those answers student i want to start with your answer so student can you tell me more about what made you say your answer ,yeah i was looking for the keywords about like discovering water on the moon and in the first paragraph there's a part where they say water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters so that kind of felt like it 
120.3,Chris,,yeah i love how you summarized that student student can i have just a second alright so i love how you summarize the article student one thing i want to ask you to look at is the first part of our question so can you read the first part of the question for me student ,just the first one 
210.3,Chris,,did scientists yeah so we're thinking about equipment student student does your answer mentioned equipment ,it doesn't 
420.3,Luis,,awesome so student i want you to go back to the text and i want you to find me a piece of equipment that the scientists use okay ,yeah okay um i don't think i'm a should be in this class i already know all about space 
230.1,Luis,,yeah so why don't you tell me more about your answer let me just say your answer ,and i will because i know that scientists use oxygen tanks to read 
210.3,Luis,,"We are trying to use this text, so does this text mention those oxygen tanks at all Luis. ",um okay to be honest i didn't really read that whole thing cuz i figured i already knew the answer 
420.3,Luis,,awesome well student i have a job for you i want you to look at this text and find me a piece of equipment that the text mentions okay student ,okay 
230.1,Oliver,,awesome alright so student and student you had the same answer so dave i'm going to ask you to start student what made you say your answer ,oh well maybe i think that's the answer to the question 
230.1,Oliver,,say more why is it the answer to the question student ,i'm cause the questions asking arm what equipment data scientists used to discover water on the moon and i'm in this in this part of the story house they're talking about water the found and then they also named a piece of equipment which is a microscope so it's got science water they found and the microscope in 
230.1,Farrah,,student was your reasoning similar to olivers for why you said this answer was it different ,um i mean i guess he was pretty similar yeah i don't understand why my answers wrong because if it answers the question about a science equipment the microscope has the equipment and they are using it to look at the water 
210.3,Farrah,,yeah so i love that you were able to pull information out of the text to find that microscopes are used to look at small things can you reread that chunk of the text for me my question for both of you is did the scientists actually use that equipment when they were working on the moon ,let me see this means the moon is dry the water they found us microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it we need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i mean i guess i don't say bye all of all there are looking i thought microscope alone 
210.4,Chris,,"yeah that's right it doesn't really say that the scientists are using that All right, Jazmin. yeah student oh yeah ",cuz i was just listening to the conversation and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and 
120.4,Chris,,yeah they do student student did you find the piece of equipment in the text yet oh ,yeah sorry i got distracted i was listening um yeah i think it's the lunar orbiter 
230.3,Jazmin,,oh okay student you said something like that didn't you ,yeah i said nasa send a small machine 
230.2,Jazmin,,yeah so student can you say more about where you found that in the text or why you said that because i think it relates to chris's answer here yeah ,i found it in the second paragraph and it's the very first sentence yeah that one was mine too 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah so that's awesome so it's in the text you both found this in the text so my question for you is what does this small machine do student what is the machine doing ,it lands at the moon south pole and looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
210.4,Jazmin,,alright um and does that sound like scientists could use that to discover something ,it looks for well yeah yeah cuz it's looking for ice so that's something 
210.4,Jazmin,,they could yeah so we have to look for something to discover it ,yeah yeah 
120.4,Luis,,yeah so student what did you find you were reading what did you find for me ,i'm the same thing that they found that the lunar orbiter 
130.2,Oliver,,yeah student and student have you class were both reading did you find something similar or something different to harris and student and student ,well i mean that's the only other equipment that they have in the story is the lunar orbiter 
530.1,Oliver,,great job class so how has your thinking changed ,um you know what teacher i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch on but i was just thinking i wanted to say thank you for helping me use evidence from the text in my answer and arm and it made me feel valued when you asked me kind of questions about my answer sometimes teachers just tell me about how wrong i am and so i i appreciate it 
530.1,Oliver,,well thank you for putting in hard work today ,okay bye teacher see you next time 
120.4,Luis,,i'll see you next time hi so can you class repeat your answers to the question for me real quick and we'll go down the line from student all the way down to student from right from my right to from my left to my right yeah student do have a question ,yeah yeah before we do that excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Farrah,,well i'm really glad that you feel like you have a good understanding of space but we're just gonna we're just gonna talk really about that answer real quick i'm excited to hear what you have to share though at the at the end whenever we get to your turn student repeat for me what your answer was real quick ,yes okay i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.4,Oliver,,great thank you and you student ,yeah i'm i circled the same as student 
120.4,Chris,,wonderful student ,okay well i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
120.4,Jazmin,,nice and student ,okay well i said that nasa send a small machine 
120.4,Luis,,great and student ,yeah okay well i'm scientists they use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks 
210.2,Oliver,,absolutely so so let's first like talk about that question when we say the word equipment what what do we mean what does equipment mean can somebody can somebody answer that question for me yeah student what's equipment ,okay um as like a tool or something you use to do something 
210.2,Oliver,,absolutely so let's say i asked you to write down your answer on a sheet of paper what kind of equipment will you be using for that ,oh like a pencil 
420.3,Jazmin,,absolutely absolutely so you class all i think should have an understanding of what this word equipment means so now let's look at the second part of this of this question we want you to circle the evidence in the text so when we say that we want you to circle a specific maybe word or words vecause we're thinking about this this word evidence evidence is basically just it just means proof i want you all to circle a word or two from the text about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon student yeah ,so i circled two words i circled small machine and i don't understand why and i answer is wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,"So if we're talking about what the equipment, maybe the equipment has a name right So what does that small machine have a name does anybody anybody circle what that small machine is called. ",i can i can look 
210.4,Jazmin,,that'd be great ,okay um nasa such a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
120.4,Jazmin,,great so if i were to ask you again what kind of equipment do they use what would you would what would you circle ,so so i just need to circle then maybe i just need to circle lunar orbiter 
420.3,Farrah,,yeah that'd be that'd be that'd be a great thing a lot of times you might look for keywords student yeah so for saying what equipment did scientist use discover water on the moon maybe you can look for keywords like like the name of the equipment ,okay well microscope that's also equipment so um why is it the lunar orbiter and not the microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,well that's the great thing this answer has multiple answers and sometimes you want to circle as many as you can so microscope is a great example of one piece of equipment that they use but they also use this use this this thing called the lunar orbiter to investigate and those things work together so if we're looking at both of those sentences if you class want to look at your sheet of paper if you're looking for those two words that lunar orbiter and that microscope are there any words that kind of signal to you what the equipment is how the sentence is structured is there anything is there anything there ,yeah well it says that there's it's a scientific tool so that tells me it's equipment 
420.3,Chris,,absolutely who remembers when student asked what equipment was and student said that it's like a tool right so you can look for keywords like that ,yeah well actually it's a comment um so i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
150.1,Chris,,A lot of times you can use background knowledge to to answer questions. student was telling us that he knows a ton of stuff about about space and you seem to also have a good understanding and those are definitely things that some astronauts use but if we're reading this article we want to draw specific examples coming from that to answer the question instead of just personal experience or background knowledge does class have any questions about about what i mean when i say specific examples ,oh so it has to be from the story 
150.1,Oliver,,"absolutely yes that is what evidence is it's called textual evidence it means you're drawing your answer from that source sometimes you'll have to deal with multiple sources like we might watch a video and then read an article So like a couple people just circle microscope and that's a great example, but there are multiple tools like you just pointed out  that come from these things. does that make sense to class does class have any clarifying questions that that they have yeah def ",oh well actually i i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but before we go i just wanted to say thank you so much because your explanations were were really specific and that really helped us understand why each one of our answers could could be even better so thank you so much 
220.1,Luis,,absolutely thank you so much for for being willing to learn today really appreciate hard work going into that lunch hey class how's it going um the first thing i want us to talk about when we're here in this class is i want you to think what is this question asking what what does it mean to circle evidence yeah student ,um excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
510.1,Farrah,,"um i'm glad you're really excited to learn about space um student and i noticed that your answer um you definitely say a lot of equipment that scientists do use so i'm assuming you've probably done some sort of independent research or reading on this so can somebody tell me, and I want to see your hands raised, what does it mean to find evidence. yeah student ",okay um evidence means like a word or a sentence that's in the story that you use when you answer the question 
230.3,Jazmin,,when we're talking about evidence we're thinking about what words do i see in this text or reading that help me answer this question okay so now we're looking at this first part of the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon alright so we're talking about the sort of evidence or the sort of equipment that scientists use to get to that water or to find that water not the evidence that sort of looks at it and while a microscope is part of the process we're trying to think about the equipment that scientists need to get to that so a couple of you put that they would need a microscope right Jazmin yeah. ,i think i found that equipment in my answer i said nasa sent a small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
150.1,Jazmin,,but where i'm a little concerned because you didn't find that textual evidence right so like student said evidence is the kind of thing that we circle in an answer or in the text to help us discover that answer so while nasa does send a small machine we're looking for a certain word or class of words that tell us exactly what that machine is called or what it does so we're trying to circle maybe a sentence or a few words that can help us answer the question with details from the text does that make sense ,um yeah but i did that um the first part the first sentence in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,and is there a second part of that sentence that tells you maybe what it's called or like the name of an equipment ,called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
510.1,Chris,,absolutely so when we're trying to find like the name of an equipment like this question asks the what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon we're looking for the name of something right we might look for cue words or leading words like called like you notice how called is before that so that's a great example of a word that we might that we might use is class still unsure of what evidence means or is that something we all understand raise your hand if you know what evidence is alright student can you explain to me what evidence is ,okay um so like student said it's like um something um from the story that answers the question 
210.3,Oliver,,absolutely so student if i asked you what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon how would you answer that using this textual evidence ,okay well i mean i guess it sounds like the right answer is you know lunar orbiter um and that's in the text but i kind of think there's evidence that um the microscope's the right answer too 
430.2,Chris,,absolutely sometimes there's two parts right you can be half right but sort of be be missing something right you know sometimes you want to look for multiple things so you might want to circle all of the text in the answer that gives us that just because an answer is right doesn't mean it's a full answer so student and student both circled microscope that is a half the answer but you should also include something that helped them get to the water and how they were able to look closely at it ,will i um i went to nasa so i know that scientists use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
510.1,Chris,,"right so um I want you guys to whenever you're  thinking about finding evidence to be circling things in the text. right, you can use your prior knowledge to sort of help guide you. does that make sense when we're looking for evidence we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help us ",so i have to find the equipment in the story 
530.1,Oliver,,you want to look in the story for where you can find these answers alright so can somebody tell me how maybe they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation yeah student ,um okay so um i guess what i learned is that um i should read the story really carefully because um even if i have part of the answer i might be missing part of the answer 
110.1,Jazmin,,absolutely what about you student ,um i learned to make sure that i read the whole sentence or or that my answer is really clear 
110.1,Chris,,absolutely student what about you ,okay um i learned that if it says evidence you have to say something in the story 
230.3,Oliver,,"right all of you guys were missing a little part of your answers, none of you guys were completely wrong. but there was like a little parts that concern me and i wanted to help you class sort of find that you can fix those answers by looking for things like evidence and complete answers student yeah ",um i'm sorry but it's time for us to go now 
120.3,Farrah,,um great fantastic you can you can class can head off to lunch i think okay class so i really like the way that you answered those questions and i can tell that you look back in your text to find your answers but let's all look back at our question let's look back at number one do you want to if you class want to read this question for me student do you want to read it for me ,oh yeah yeah okay so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on moon 
420.1,Luis,,all right class i want you right now to look at this question and i want you to underline in this question what you think the most important word or the keyword is in this question ,yeah so i kind of know like all about space like i don't think i really need to be in this class because i already know like all this stuff 
110.3,Luis,,well i completely understand that and i can tell from your answer that you do know a lot of things about space because you talked about oxygen tanks and so i can tell that you do know a lot about space but i just want us to help drill in on this specific answer for this question okay ,okay 
420.1,Luis,,do you mind reading this question for me and finding this word that you think is really important in it ,yeah like the question on the text 
420.1,Luis,,yeah ,um yeah okay so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon um any you said that question like we can you say it again 
420.1,Luis,,yes i can i want you to look back at this question that you just read to me and i want you to find the most important word or the keyword that you think is most important in this question ,oh i got it okay um equipment 
110.4,Chris,,equipment is a great word did class else put equipment it's not what class else underlined okay awesome so that is a great word to underline did class else underline anything else student what did you underline ,okay so i was saying that you know scientists found craters full of water on the moon and i i was i was underlining um i i was underlining wait in the question or in the text 
420.1,Chris,,in the question which most important word did you pick out ,oh yeah okay so i i underlined water 
110.4,Farrah,,okay okay good so we have some people that underlined equipment and we have some people that underlined water and those are both very good those are both very important yes student ,i just was wondering because it seems like okay so we said equipment i was just wondering like why my answer was was wrong because i like i feel like microscope is equipment 
120.4,Oliver,,"i want us to look in our question and i want us to find an action word because so far we've underlined equipment and we've underlined water but we haven't underlined our action word An action word is like a verb, and it tells us what you're gonna do with that equipment to that water. okay does class want to raise their hand and tell me what they think the action word is student ",um yeah so it looks like the action word is discovered as that's yeah that seems like the one 
230.1,Jazmin,,that is absolutely correct and does class know can someone tell me what discover means student ,discover basically means to like find something like to discover buried treasure 
410.2,Farrah,,"so we're specifically looking for a piece of equipment that was used to discover the water or to find the water So Farrah with your question, you tell me about a tool which was great. But when you tell me about the tool. You told me about a tool that's used to look at the water and we're not looking at the water really closely. What are we trying to do to the water, guys. ",discover the water 
210.2,Chris,,we're trying to discover it we're not trying to look at it student did you have something to tell me ,um yeah i was just thinking like well i went to nasa with my dad so i know that scientists use a lot of other equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and i guess i was like that when we talked about like what equipment it feels like that's missing from the from the reading or i don't know like that seems like it's important 
210.2,Oliver,,yeah all those things are really important and i think it's really cool that you got to experience that but in this article what is it it's specifically asking us about water right so in this one it's going to tell us about the equipment that's used for water so what does equipment main class student ,it's like machines or or things you use to help you do something 
120.3,,,so we are going to look back in our passage so i will class to get back into their passage ,so right now we are trying to answer the question what equipment good so it's like a machine that we're going to use or like a tool 
210.4,Oliver,,we are going to be in paragraph two and i'm going to read it to you and while i'm reading we are looking for yes student ,i'm so sorry i'm unfortunately we have to go to the next class and have to end this session but thank you so much 
420.3,Luis,,so i want class to look in your text at paragraph two and look for any keywords that may help to identify the equipment that was used to specifically discover water ,um yeah i just wanted to say my dad's an astronaut 
140.1,Luis,,oh that is so awesome has he told you about these kind of thing ,yeah he he talks about it all the time and like that's how come i know so much about space 
210.2,Jazmin,,"So we're going to look at, paragraph two, okay. So I just want you to listen while I am reading and if we find a particular equipment we might stop and talk about it. Okay. now they sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so what is a small machine what's another word maybe one that's in our question that means the same thing student ",so like a small machine it's a piece of equipment right like it's something you could use use 
110.4,Jazmin,,good that is exactly right so a small machine is a piece of equipment and what is this piece of equipment called ,it is a lunar orbiter 
110.4,Farrah,,so what investigate mean does class know student exactly and they're saying that they're using the lunar orbiter to investigate ,yes so investigates like when you're a detective and you're like getting clues and finding out the truth 
210.2,Oliver,,good does class know a synonym for the word investigate student ,yeah um okay so synonym is like something that's like the same like a word that means the same thing right yeah exactly awesome yeah um a synonym for investigage is like is find the same 
420.1,Chris,,so now let's look back at our question and see if we can find a word in our question that is a synonym for investigate ,oh oh oh 
120.1,Chris,,student do you think you know it ,yeah yeah discover 
120.1,Luis,,"discover that's great This lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposit in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one top of the one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water. So what is an ice deposit does class know student ",i yeah yeah i know an ice deposit's like on a planetoid or like a rocky planet or a moon on that it's like like ice like frozen water that's that's like on on the surface of the planet 
310.1,Jazmin,,"Great, I can really tell you use your background knowledge with that. So you're absolutely right and ice deposit is a piece of frozen water that's on a planet. ",I think I know the answer. 
210.1,Jazmin,,okay do you want to share your answer with us ,so i think i was really close it's the lunar orbiter the lunar orbiter's what discovered the water 
110.4,Chris,,that's great that's absolutely right so class i want you to think so we found this time that that's our specific answer that it was the lunar orbiter Chris. ,um i actually forgot what i was gonna say 
110.4,Oliver,,that's fine student ,um yeah so scientists found the craters full of water on the moon so i was wondering like um did they use they use the lunar orbiter to find it but did they not use a microscope 
210.4,Oliver,,i understand what you're asking me yes there let's look at what this sentence says so let's look at paragraph three okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific toll called a microscope to look really closely so what is that microscope helping them do class ,it's helping them see it when they study it 
210.2,Oliver,,yeah they're looking at it really closely they're not looking they're not discovering it yet what in order to look at it really closely they have to have already found it right ,i understand yeah so they they found it using the lunar orbiter and they and they studied it using the microscope so it was like two different things they say i understand 
230.1,Oliver,,yeah and what are those two different things we had discovering it and we have looking at it what are those two words what kind of words are those that we talked about earlier in this lesson ,um synonym 
130.3,Oliver,,no what is the type of word we used but remember way earlier at the beginning of this lesson when we talked about action words ,and that's how we discover discover 
510.1,Chris,,the next time you're reading a tough question it can help you to look for the action words in the question because that's going to help you know specifically what you're looking for ,so we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for working with us and like specifically like you you really helped us clear up some misconceptions we have like you helped us to understand the meaning of the word discover and you also helped us make sure that we were using evidence when we were talking about stuff because we had to justify it in in the stuff that we were reading and that was really cool so i don't know like i feel like i understand like the question much better now so thank you so much 
510.1,Unclear,,no problem you class are welcome ,um hi hi ms teacher name hi hi what's your name 
510.1,Unclear,,um ms teacher name i'm sorry i have a question am i supposed to be seeing you or the virtual class ,you can't see us 
510.1,Bennett,,okay no i can't no yeah ,okay ah you're seeing me okay give me one moment 
510.1,Bennett,,okay ,let's try this again um hi okay 
510.1,Chris,,yes ,now do you see me student okay great 
150.1,Luis,,hi i'm ms teacher name and we're just going to be talking about your question today so in this article we heard a lot of things about nasa and the moon as a desert and let's just talk about your answers so we have a lot of different answers so let's look back in our texts and let's see if we had the best answer let's think about it ,um excuse me um i shouldn't be ni this class i already know all there is to know about space 
150.1,Luis,,okay well we're just going to work on making sure we have the best answer for the question okay ,um okay 
150.1,Jazmin,,so when we look back at our text we're trying to figure out what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon and we had some really great responses so we're going to make sure that our answers can be proven from our text so if we look back it says that they used a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so did class talk about that let's see ,well um i it's me student i said that they used a small machine that was my answer 
210.4,Jazmin,,so did class say like a title you did you did say that but if we look it says what equipment so i think it's asking us to say like the title of the object because it's in our passage so let's look back and see if we can find it so it says nasa sent a small machine called a looper lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater so what is the name of that machine called ,um well i talked about the polar craters because i said that they found a lot of water in the craters um the small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,you're right but if we look back at our question it's telling us to talk about what equipment so they did use it to find a lot of water in the craters but what tool where they using yes the small machine but let's look back and see what that's called so let's read the sentence okay so we're on number two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so ,oh it's called a lunar orbiter 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah exactly so good so to make our answer better we could say nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter you get it ,oh i don't understand why my answer is still wrong yeah yeah me too i circled the same thing as student 
210.4,Farrah,,okay well if we look back in the number three which says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you are looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close now let's look at our question and let's remember what our questions said so our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon now what does a microscope do what did it say a microscope did in the text ,um you use it to look at the water 
110.4,Oliver,,right you use it to look at the water ou have to discuss ,yeah 
110.4,Oliver,,yeah so you have to ,sorry sorry 
210.4,Oliver,,so you have to find the water before you can look at it right does class know what discover means ,yeah it's like um it's like um you said already it's like when you find something 
210.4,Farrah,,so do you understand how we could improve your answer right so discovers when we find it so we have to find it first and we're going to use the lunar orbiter to find it before we can look at it ,um we have to say that need a scientific tool microscope to discover the water instead of just to look it 
210.4,,,okay but can we do we use the microscope to discover the water ,because let's look back at our passage and see what a microscope does 
210.4,Chris,,you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely ,yeah student she said discover means to find it and and we we thought the thing said to to look at it which is different from finding it well i know a lot about space too i went to nasa with my dad and i know that astronauts um they have like oxygen tanks and um they have suits and they have masks 
110.1,Chris,,okay so we're talking about the equipment they used to discover water that's really cool but let's get back on topic all right ,okay okay well well i talked about water in my answer too 
210.3,Chris,,so we asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon you're right you did talk about the water but let's look at our discussion question So look back at your answer. does it say anything about the equipment that they used ,oh no no it talks about the craters not the equipment 
210.4,Farrah,,right so we need to find the equipment that they used so look back in your passage what equipment did they use to find the water if we look at number two nasa sent a small machine called a loomer lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small and what is what is ice ,oh oh yeah ice is the same thing as water oh right yeah yeah oh yeah i see that ice is like it's the same thing because we learned that in science class about how like the three states of matter 
210.4,All,,thank you ,bye 
120.2,Luis,,alright so the discussion question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon go ahead ,uh excuse me yeah i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Luis,,okay so what is your answer to the discussion question ,um let me see i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks i already know that equipment that they use 
110.1,Chris,,go back to the text that you read need you to narrow down your answer more specific but what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon um well you're right ,um um what did they use to discover water on the moon um i don't know um like maybe oh well i said that they found craters full of water on the moon 
210.2,Farrah,,okay then not full of water let's go back to our text we have these specific answers from the text what equipment did they use they did find water but the question wants to know what equipment did they use ,well in my answer i i talked about the equipment it's me student i said that they they used a scientific tool called a microscope to to look really closely 
210.2,Oliver,,right ,i 
210.2,Oliver,,go ahead ,i was gonna show you that i have the same answer as samantha 
120.4,Oliver,,okay so what's your answer ,um that they use the microscope to look closely at the water 
120.1,Oliver,,okay is that all that they used ,um well i mean that's what it says it says here the water they found is microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it 
120.1,Farrah,,right ,yeah the um the the next part of that says you know that you'd like let me look at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i mean i don't understand why my answer's wrong 
120.4,Luis,,i didn't say it was wrong so but what did they use to discover the water that they used a microscope microscope to look at it once they found it but what equipment did they use to find it go back to the text and look student what do you think ,well i think that because they they really like to have to travel around a lot that they probably use their like their their their like telescopes to look at the water um well like when they were on earth you know because that's how you can look from earth on 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay ,and mine came from the text too but i don't know why it's wrong um well i i had a different answer 
410.2,Jazmin,,okay you need to be more specific in your answer what small machine what was it called ,nasa sent a small machine called a lunar to investigate um a lunar orbiter 
150.1,Jazmin,,yes so nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it looked for ice deposits and the craters and then they use that microscope to see it because it's so tiny you can't even see it you had to use a microscope so that makes sense ,um i mean i guess so i guess 
150.1,Farrah,,class have any questions about that question ,um well i mean i guess i don't know i mean i guess it's like but i still think like the microscope is is equipment too 
130.3,Chris,,it is but they didn't use it to discover the water ,i went to nasa so i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too 
110.2,Oliver,,yeah yeah they do but we were just discussing this question you're all right ,okay um but but but but okay so but i read it and it does say it such that they talk about the water in paragraph three they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i understand that you said that student has the right answer but but why cuz that's a tool too 
130.3,Oliver,,it is it is i didn't say it was wrong but they use the machine the lunar orbiter to find it to discover it but then they use the microscope once they found it ,oh 
150.1,Oliver,,that make sense ,okay they use the lunar orbiter to um they use the lunar orbiter to find the water and then i use the microscope to look at the water 
110.4,Oliver,,right once they found it ,okay um okay class i so i get it because you you you told student what it is but i guess i i don't know like how how you got there like i know i can say it but i don't know how how um okay oh look student i think well it's time for us to go to lunch but i think what she was telling us is that we just have to keep looking at the text right cuz that's where you said a bunch of times like you gotta go back to the text you gotta go back to the text so so okay yeah thanks thanks i think we gotta look at the text more student that was the problem okay bye thank you 
110.4,Luis,,yes student ,um yeah so i'm not sure like why i'm here because i already know like all sorts of stuff about space 
410.1,Luis,,alright so i have gathered you all here today because i'm concerned about each one of your answers to the question and you each talked about equipment or tools needed that are used on the moon but we need to figure out exactly which piece of equipment they use to discover water on the moon so we need to go back into the text and find specifically where it states what equipment they used to discover water on the moon and student you talked about a specific tool a microscope this piece of equipment is used for a different purpose also student your question or your answer had to do with equipment as well but you talked about oxygen tanks and we're trying to figure out which equipment they used for discovering water not oxygen on the moon ,now it's so they don't need the oxygen if they're going up to space 
210.2,Luis,,they need oxygen but we're specifically talking about which piece of equipment they used to discover water on the moon ,ah ok gotcha yeah 
210.2,Farrah,,student ,um yeah i guess i was just wondering like what my answer was because i'm i'm still not quite sure like i can understand that they were looking for the equipment but but they didn't use the but the microscope wasn't the right answer 
130.3,Farrah,,they might use the microscope is used for a different purpose they didn't use a microscope on the men they use something else to discover water on the moon ,oh what do you do you 
210.4,,,let's go back into the texts and look if ,you want all of us to look at the text or are we just waiting for the vamp 
120.4,Chris,,class look back into the text and find what did they use to discover water on the moon student did you find the answer ,um yeah i guess i well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like when like oxygen tanks at masks and shoot 
210.4,Jazmin,,they do yeah but all of those pieces of equipment are used for a different purpose we're trying to figure out which what equipment that they use to find water on the moon it yes is a specific tool or equipment that they used it says it in the text if we go back and look and the question it talks about equipment but there can be another word for equipment in the text go back and look what's another word that we can use student you ,another word is a small maching 
210.4,Jazmin,,still yeah ,a small machine right 
130.3,Luis,,yes a small machine all right and what was the name of that machine and he yeah the scientists use the lunar orbiter to investigate and discover water on the moon that makes sense awesome so the equipment that they used is the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon start simulation student ,um yeah i just wanted to let you know my dad is actually an astronaut 
210.4,Jazmin,,that's cool alright so the next question is talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable and i brought you here together because i'm concerned about your answers the only person student is the only person that said yes that it was valuable and kind of told why she thought it was valuable but in a text it tells why astronauts are using water from the moon and we need to go back into the text all of us to figure out why we think that the water on the moon could be valuable so let's go look what what he says can the astronauts to use the water on the main for data student ,is there anything that you missed it 
210.4,Jazmin,,what do astronauts use the water for ,you that like the water 
210.4,Jazmin,,yes student ,you could use the water on the moon in a garden and they could be like a moon garden out of it 
210.4,Jazmin,,i'm sorry i didn't hear your response ,i'm sorry i said that you could like you could go and use the water and you can see 
210.2,Chris,,that would be really cool but what does it say in the text about how astronauts use the water it should be under the bottle of water is a valuable source so why is it a valid valuable so resource what does it say what are the ways that it's being used or how can it be useful student ,um yeah so you could basically be like i also waters so you know it's really good that they don't have to carry it in ships 
230.3,Luis,,all right student what do you have right okay that can be one way that can be so they don't have to use a travel with it there they can use what's on the man ,um well water can be the said water can be broken down into two parts like hydrogen and oxygen 
210.4,Jazmin,,what do astronauts use it for student all right and how do they use the hydrogen and oxygen ,well and use oxygen to breath and the water to stay hydrated and feel like they have to have water 
110.1,Luis,,right a then what were you gonna say ,well well i was gonna say like they use it for like rocket people they can use hydrogen and make make food for the spacecraft 
130.3,Farrah,,right and that's going to be very valuable for the astronauts right they're going to use the water yeah oxygen and then they can use the hydrogen from the water for rocket fuel right and also student was saying that they wouldn't have to travel with it from earth to the moon and then i'll back right the indices what's there is there convincing evidence that it's a valuable resource student yeah so can we all agree that water is a valuable resource ,i'm still kind of you know like i i saw the parts that they were saying where they were like you could use the hydrogen fuel and you can use the oxygen to breathe but i don't think it's like convincing evidence mostly because i didn't think that it would be possible for a long time so like i guess evidence doesn't seem very convinced because they say like in really they said i use the moon water scientists need to come up with a plan for extracting getting out of the polar craters making this plan will take a lot of time and money 
110.1,Farrah,,yeah ,it would be you know like it would take a long time 
130.3,Oliver,,it would take a long time but eventually it would be very very very valuable resource for astronauts to use student do you have something to add ,well i guess i sort of agree with student i got it kind of depends on like that time so if you're looking at it are like like immediately then yeah it's not very useful but i guess in like theory but that's kind of a question like i i guess i don't know if i see that like even if it's useful someday if it's really valuable you know 
310.1,Jazmin,,okay yeah i can see the way you're thinking about it student ,and yet i just wanted to say and we have to match the lunch i just want to thank you for working with this and like in particular like something i really wanted to thank you for was like we were really able to understand like you explain what we need to work on and you know etc and how to improve you also really clear with like what you were concerned about and like what you wanted to work which is like able to get you gives us a chance to like go forward and figure out like what like i better today so much for all your work day was great working 
310.1,Chris,,absolutely thank you hi class ,um hi 
120.2,Luis,,so you answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon um student your answer was you need yes student ,um excuse me i i shouldn't be in this class i already know a lot about space 
150.1,Luis,,well we're gonna learn some more you ready ,okay yeah 
130.3,Oliver,,okay back to student your answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely yes we do need a microscope to look really closely at things but that is not what the scientist used to find the water on the moon if you go back to the i think it's the second paragraph you'll see that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit and a large polar crater and so that is how they discovered that there was ice on the moon or water ,um i had the same answer as student 
230.2,Farrah,,yes you do but did you read the article because i'm not sure that you really need that answer because you circled the same as her ,"Oh no, I would never do that. I know a lot of stuff. I like to watch stuff on YouTube and I like to read about space too. Um, I circled it, I circled that because I know that um that a microscope is is like a tool and this says, this says, if you look at the whole thing . It says that the moon is drier than the dryest desert on Earth. Why did they find ice microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you look straight at it and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. oh yeah well that is why "
110.1,Farrah,,you did some great reading student ,"Oh, well, well, it's just that you know, um, me and Farrah both found the same thing right, Farrah? yeah yeah i mean like when i was i was looked at it and i saw that the question was asking about equipment and so um it said a scientific tool and a scientific tool like a microscope that's the same thing as equipment "
130.3,Jazmin,,but even you did circle if you circled the same thing as student you are at you at you were both actually not correct with that answer so if you would have circled about the lunar orbiter you would have been correct ,um but okay well i don't understand what why my answer is wrong um me student right here 
110.4,Jazmin,,who is speaking okay student student you put nasa sent a small machine yes they did they did send a small machine it was called the lunar orbiter ,"yeah But then why, my, here, if I was right "
110.4,Jazmin,,i'm sorry ,this table is for class who got the wrong answer you asked us to come over here because you wanted to talk about our answers so is my answer right or is my answer wrong 
130.1,Jazmin,,it is semi right you could have went into more detail you put that it was a small machine and it was a small machine but um it is called a lunar orbiter ,um okay so the answer is is it's called a lunar orbiter 
120.3,Jazmin,,the equipment was called a lunar or orbiter that nasa sent to investigate ,okay okay but didn't i 
120.3,Jazmin,,do you have any other questions student ,well well i just mean like okay so i have the first part of the sentence i just i just didn't have that one word or like those words so that's all i needed 
130.3,Jazmin,,it says nasa send a small mach small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that should have been your answer ,oh okay well okay now i know the answer 
130.3,Chris,,who's speaking ,um well i went to nasa and i know th oh sorry that's that's me student excuse me um okay so the answer is is it's called a lunar orbiter 
130.3,Chris,,okay that's okay yes student ,yeah i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
410.1,Chris,,they do but that's not what the um that's not what the question is what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon it said that those things are not what they used to discover water on the moon it was the lunar orbiter ,oh oh okay okay so i get it like i know that that's the answer like the lunar orbiter is the answer but but i thought that i had the right answer you know because i talked about the water in my answer about like how they they found the water because i know that you know to discover stuff means to find stuff and so i saw in paragraph one where i was looking for like okay they find some water and it says that scientists found evidence that water can be found deep within a moon's polar craters so so like that's that's how i got my answer and so i 
210.2,Oliver,,if you would have read unintellible see where it says nasa send small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate because you have to understand what the question is asking what equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon that would be your question so that question didn't ask anything about what they found as what did they use to find it ,um oh okay okay um excuse me it's it's me student hi 
210.2,Oliver,,hi student ,um i just wanted to say that it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for coming to work with us and to really telling us to keep keep looking at the text because i heard you say that to class over here like that we have to like we have to look look at the text some more to try to find the answer so 
210.2,Oliver,,yes ,um okay thank you 
210.2,Luis,,you're welcome ,bye hi 
210.2,Luis,,yes student ,um yeah so i was just gonna say i kind of know like all about space already so i don't think i really need to be in this 
110.1,Luis,,let's just hang out for a minute let's talk about some things okay ,yeah i could do that 
120.4,Farrah,,so and you class had varying levels of understanding okay thank you very much okay and so the first question that what you were to answer was what experiment designed what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon and which is a good thing because we can help each other grow nd first i'd like to address student student would you like to read your answer to us ,yeah sure okay so my answer was you need a scientific tool calle a microscope to look really closely 
310.1,Farrah,,yes and um if you refer back to the question it did mention equipment you did mention a specific piece of equipment and although that may not be the best answer and you still address the equipment part of the question and i appreciate that ,thank you 
230.3,Oliver,,you're welcome and and student you said that you had circled the same thing as student so i'm assuming that you address that you were thinking that it was the microscope as well ,yeah i had a microscope and i kind of thought same thing as student 
230.3,Farrah,,okay yes student ,i guess i still don't really understand why my answers wrong 
410.2,Farrah,,look back at the question and take your pencil and maybe circle any important words in that question that you may see okay student which what what where did you circle or words okay so i circled equipment and discover okay and in your answer you said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and yeah you would need a microscope to look really closely closely but does your answer tell what discovered the water ,oh interesting so well i guess what i thought was that you couldn't discover the water unless you saw the water maybe there's another way that another machine could find the water 
130.2,Oliver,,look in paragraph two of the passage to see if you might find another machine reread paragraph two of the passage okay yes why don't why don't you look back you and student work together since you were you had the same answer ,okay 
120.4,Chris,,and you can talk about it and i'm going to speak with student for a moment okay okay student would you like to read your answer ,yeah okay so i said that pre scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
210.3,Chris,,And they did. That's very specific and I appreciate you being really specific in your answer. did what important word or words did you circle in the question ,so i circled water that was the main word that i circled 
210.2,Chris,,okay is that the only one that you circle yeah i'm going to read the question so listen closely okay what equipment did scientist used to discover water on the moon so do you think one of the important words could be equipment ,yeah and it's okay so it's asking what equipment yeah i was thinking about the craters 
210.4,Chris,,mm hmm yes and that's where they found it i think right ,i you know my dad took me to nasa and when we were there we saw that like the astronauts used like suits and oxygen tanks and tasks and stuff yeah like it wasn't in the reading did they use those to discover the water 
130.3,Chris,,no they might have used those when they discovered it but they were not use to discover the water ,okay gotcha 
120.4,Jazmin,,yes okay and student would you like to read us your answer ,nasa sent a small machine 
120.4,Luis,,and that is very close and can you be more specific and look back in paragraph 2 to see if you can find the rest of the or the more detailed part of the answer and student that would you like to read as your answer ,um yeah okay so basically what i said i was saying that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that 
210.3,Luis,,and they do use that but i'm just like with student i asked him did they use that to discover the water ,i guess not like i guess they must have used they used it but they didn't use it to discover the water like that's not the job of like the tank or the mask 
110.4,Jazmin,,exactly yes student ,fortunate we have to go to our next class but before we go i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us this was really interesting it was really fun to work with thank you 
110.4,Luis,,thank you okay class we're back yes student ,um yeah so i got all this stuff figured out so you know i think i'm all good 
150.1,Farrah,,okay hold on just a moment okay all right um student and student did you class get a chance to finish reading paragraph two and revise your answer ,so we did look through paragraph two we saw you know a couple different things in there i think that we have a new answer but we're still a little bit confused about like you know i'm still kind of like i i think the answer is the lunar orbiter right 
230.1,Farrah,,why are you confused and then we'll talk about the answer ,yeah so i think when i'm confused by is um i guess that they have the microscope and they said that that's like a piece of equipment it is and i just i'm just wondering like if the waters microscopic could they find it without a microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,yes it is very hard to say without a microscope but the lunar orbiter is very powerful it landed on the moon south pole that's where they found it and it looked for ice deposits so since it was ice and it wasn't necessarily water it is but frozen water and and they look in the large polar craters i guess it was really cold the ,it seems really cool 
110.4,Chris,,yes it does and i'm but yes you are you two are correct it is the lunar orbiter so you are right there And you're welcome and Chris. ,but that's okay um can i share my answer with you yeah i saw my original my original answer was that scientists found craters full of water on the food and then i think we were talking about how that wasn't really answering the question right 
230.1,Chris,,right so did you say you have a new answer ,yeah i think so i'm like i think that i could see like student and student said the lunar orbiter was the thing that that found it like that sounds like that's the answer 
230.2,Jazmin,,yes and student did you have a chance did you go back and look and find the same answer or did you find something different ,although i see actually that confused because it kind of makes sense that all i was missing was the name of the machine right so i said like nasa send this small machine but i have to say like what evidence is i have to say what it is right 
230.3,Luis,,"Yes, if you look through there and then circle your answer. You should be able to find your evidence in there to support your answer. it student and we see here and we were talking about using all the other equipment right ",yeah 
150.1,Luis,,and i don't think you had did you have a chance to go back and read paragraph two ,um no i didn't take a look yet 
120.3,Oliver,,okay go ahead and do that for a moment yes student ,um so i i read something interesting would like is connected i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and so maybe they could use these things like i'm like the water pretty soon 
120.4,Luis,,well that would be awesome i didn't know that you taught me something okay student what do you think ,so i looked at paragraph two and what we see and like what i was listening to class i'm like they said that the lunar orbiter was the thing and so i guess that makes sense that it was the lunar orbiter i'm like that's the answer to the question i guess i just keep thinking like they must have used other stuff but you said that that they didn't use the suits and the oxygen to find the water they used it to help them beyond the moon if they were on the moon 
210.1,Luis,,right to help them survive ,yeah yeah exactly 
150.1,Jazmin,,yes they did guess that's all that i have unless you have some questions yes student ,i know i think that we all understand and i think that we just wanted to share so we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i really wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i really do thank you for like making sure that our answers were really accurate and you really encouraged us to use evidence from the text and you also asked us like why we were like saying the things that we were saying so we got this think about like our own thinking and how that led to our answer like right class um yeah like i think class feels like they got to do something really interesting and i think that that like working with your class was really cool and like we also had time to explain all of our ideas and finally i think class really value so like everybody's answers like you were so like like supportive of our answers even even if they were right and that was really cool thank you so much for working with us it was really fun 
120.4,Luis,,thank you thank you for joining me at the small class table class i appreciate the answers that you gave let's go ahead and review some of the things that we've talked about our question that we have was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so let's talk about some of your answers would one of you like to volunteer your answer student ,well i was just gonna say like i already know like so much about space and like i don't really think i need any help i don't think i should be in this class 
120.4,Luis,,you don't think you should be in this class well i'm glad you're in this class because maybe you can help us all out with some of our questions we have and how we answered so i'm glad you're here with us can we start with your answer student ,yeah sure so basically what what i said was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that 
230.2,Luis,,yes they do have to use a lot of equipment you are right and i'm sure there's a lot more than just oxygen tanks and a lot more than what we know about here since we are not an astronaut or we don't go out into space help me understand if you don't mind what equipment they might use just to discover water on the moon i really like the fact that you have a lot of knowledge about it because it tells me that you're probably really interested in space so student can you help me understand maybe other equipment that they might have used to just find oxygen or excuse me just to find the water on the moon what some other points that you made for us in our passage we read what were some other points they made ,well i have to be honest i don't think i read it very close because i thought i knew all this stuff but it sounds like there's other equipment that maybe i didn't know and so i'm kind of looking through now and i'm seeing other equipment and you were saying like i need to think about like how like what is really finding the water is that right like not like maybe what they use also but like what really binds it is that right 
120.4,Jazmin,,not exactly but i like your thinking of what keeps the water together that is in our passage but let's specifically focus if we can on just how they discovered water on the moon what equipment did they use to discover that water and in your question if you can take a look at your passage all of you can take a look at the question again it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what's a really important word in that question that could help us find our answer can you take your pencil and just underline the really important words that could help us find our answer great can somebody volunteers for me to give me a word that you might have underlined that can help us find an answer student ,yes in the way that i underlined was well action like two words equipment and discover 
210.4,Jazmin,,so you underlined equipment and discover great so tell me just reading our passage student can you tell me what the word equipment might refer to in our passage what kind of equipment did the scientists discover water on the moon with ,yeah so that's like something that you use to find or do you use like if you need something they have to discover certain equipment has the evening mean i use it to discover and so i said that it's the small machine 
310.1,Jazmin,,excellent excellent thank you i see your line of thought and i really appreciate that you're telling us that they sent a small machine which is the equipment and they used it to discover which is to find out or to see ,i was wondering why my answer the question my answer was wrong you know why i was in the class it sounds like this small machine was was maybe a right answer 
210.3,Chris,,It was a right answer. That was one of our right answers. And I appreciate that answer. You did a great job using your background knowledge and using all the information that was in our text student could you help us out a little bit more maybe with finding a different piece of equipment that they might have used also chris's answer he told us that scientists found craters full of water on the moon so student when we read deeper into that passage and the answer that you gave us how else could they have found or what other oliverices could they have used to find water on the moon in the craters ,ah well i guess that's i kind of was thinking about what he was saying because i went to nasa with my dad and we saw that they use masks and suits an oxygen text to explore them so i guess i was thinking maybe they use that stuff to go in the craters 
230.3,Chris,,so you were thinking they use a lot more equipment on their body to go into the craters like he was talking about oxygen tanks ,yeah like maybe you know like i guess i'm not yeah like i was thinking like did they use that to go into craters and see like i i understand like it's not as much water like but like you know if we went in the crater like there's they find the water by like walking in with their space suits 
120.3,Chris,,with their space suits by walking into the big craters because your response said they found craters full of water on the moon but can you look at your passage with me take a look at paragraph two and your passage can you look at your passage with me but the ice deposits are what can you tell me what that says the ice deposits are very small and made it says nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate now the lunar orbiter will land on the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in large polar craters ,very small 
210.4,Oliver,,very small so if they're looking for something very small and they're having to take that lunar orbiter in there we also read in paragraph three yes student ,i'm i'm so sorry but unfortunately we have to go to our next class i hate to interrupt but we have to run but thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with you thank you bye bye bye 
210.4,Luis,,class thank you ,my answer was that you know is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable i think no and i think that because i don't think it will be a long long time um yeah and i i agree like i think know as well i don't think that's very convincing because it's not really ready so even though we think it could work like we don't know yeah i said basically the water is so good that ships don't carry it what if you don't have to carry anymore so basically i think yes that there's really convincing evidence because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated and you class are fine without water and also i was just going to remind class that my dad is actually an astronaut which is pretty cool on yeah and i really like was gonna say like water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
120.4,Farrah,,all right thank you for your answers i wanted to just student if you remind me of your answer ,so no not for a long time i don't think that the evidence is 
230.2,Farrah,,and what makes you think that way student based on our passage what makes you think that the evidence is not convincing ,yeah that's a really interesting question so when i look at the like here's what i saw i was thinking that okay a paragraph six it says to use the water scientists need to come up with a plan for extract or getting out of the polar crater the water and it says making this plan will take a lot of time and i was thinking like honestly that like it doesn't work yet so i think that maybe it would be valuable sure and i think it's very valuable right we don't even know how to how to do it so we could use 
210.3,Farrah,,and i really like the fact that you used those contexts clues and explained to me what extracting meant excellent reading you told us that extracting was getting the water out and i see where you use that evidence saying that it might take a lot of time and money so i appreciate that your opinion is that no you don't think that it's it's going to be convincing or or it's going to be valuable teacher and i'd like to take a look and read in paragraph four if you will student and and the class if you look at their paragraph four that word could that's in the second sentence can you circle that word could with your pencil if you will in the second sentence of paragraph four it says it could be useful in lots of ways so would you think that the word useful iss also the same as maybe valuable if we look back in that paragraph and it's telling us it could be useful then the question two says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable student do you think that could be is an important way to express that water can be valuable in the future ,yeah i think what's interesting because i do think that it could be valuable maybe sure i see that in the reading it's not really valuable like that the evidence is it because we haven't seen like them build like a winner waters and we don't even know they can like they can we haven't seen 
120.4,Chris,,that we haven't seen it yet i appreciate that i do agree with you we haven't seen it yet because it is something that may take a lot of time and money for us to see but um let's see who was it that told me that the water is heavy and carrying the water was maybe not a good idea student was that you ,yes that was me i was saying that you don't have to have water anymore get it from the moon 
230.3,Chris,,i see what chris's thinking was when he said that water is very heavy and so carrying all that water may not be very may not be a very good idea if we can find water and a way to use it on the moon am i correct student is that you're thinking ,yeah 
230.3,Chris,,"I'm sorry, go ahead. ",oh i just said totally 
230.1,Oliver,,"Space and on the spacecraft, it would be valuable to not have to carry all that weight if we had access to water on the moon. And that would make it valuable to us. We could carry more equipment or more astronauts instead student and were you a person who said no can you tell me your answer and give me some of the thinking that you had in mind ",yeah i would love to unfortunately we do have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to share with you some really cool stuff like i wanted to thank you so much for working with us and like in particular you really helped us to focus on like certain words in the questions so that we understood like what we were looking for and i think that made things a lot more quicker and then like on top of that like you helped us to understand like you help us clarify our answers you know what i mean and you asked us about our thinking and like when we started like thinking about like what we were saying i think class right like class kind of had a moment of like you know like everything makes a lot more sense when we're like trying to you know what i mean like like we can understand and we can hear each other and we can think about like what class else's and then even like beyond that like you really help us to feel value like once you like heard about what we were thinking i think that like class felt like you really respected us and that was so cool because that's not like every teacher so i really appreciate that and thank you so much for just like giving it a try though thank you bye 
120.3,Luis,,thank you so can one of you would one of you like to volunteer to read the first paragraph ,yeah sure i'll read it um me student i'll read it but but i do want to say i don't think i'm supposed to be in this class cuz i already know a lot about space 
110.3,Luis,,well you know what because you do know a lot and that means you can help the rest of us out that don't know as much as you ,oh yeah okay cool yeah okay um first paragraph scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines 
210.4,Chris,,okay is would someone like let's stop for a second and what did that first paragraph tells us do you know ,that scientists have found evidence of water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines well like the craters on the moon are really dark um well 
210.4,Chris,,okay um yes ,um well also that that's where they found the water 
120.3,Chris,,okay would you like student would you like to read the second paragraph ,yeah sure okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar creator these ice deposits are very small 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay can someone paraphrase that paragraph for me ,"Um, well, I'm looking at it and um I think it says, like okay, NASA sent this whole machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar creator. These ice deposits are very small. okay so it's saying like they sent they sent the lunar orbiter to look for ice deposits "
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah what would i deposits be what do you think they would look like ,um i don't know like like ice i guess 
140.1,Farrah,,okay when you deposit something how much do what do you deposit do you have a deposit a really large piece of something or smaller pieces ,um well i go to the bank with my mom sometimes and she'll deposit her paycheck but i don't know if it's like a lot of money or like a small amount of money 
140.1,Farrah,,well when you think of a paycheck every week that would be a smaller amount for what you would make for the entire month does that make sense ,um i guess so but i don't i still don't understand why my answer is wrong well it's not wrong but i'm just wanting you to look at it and different views so in one week that might be a lot of money but when you look at it over a whole month that's only a partial of the money 
150.1,Farrah,,does that makes sense ,i mean i guess so because i don't have a job and so like so i don't really get like you know for grownups and and how much money they have um 
110.1,Farrah,,that's okay ,but but i actually i was talking about like my answer to the question because cuz i i wrote that let me see what did i circle okay i circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely like i don't get why is that a wrong answer 
130.3,Oliver,,well they didn't send a microscope they sent a machine called the lunar orbit orbiter right ,but the microscope is a machine um yeah 
150.1,Farrah,,it is is a tool that they use because the deposits are so small you can't see it with your eyes you have to use the tool of a microscope to be able to see it they had to send this machine called the lunar orbiter right so you were partially correct that you do need a microscope to see this however that's not they didn't just send a microscope up to the moon does that make a little bit more sense ,um i mean i guess i mean i guess cuz you're you you did tell me like i hear what you're saying like they sent i sent this lunar orbiter um but what okay i had it's me student i have the same answer as savannha right um cuz i looked at the the the story and i looked at the question and the question says what equipment did scientists use so i was like looking and to discover the water i was like you know i was i was looking at the um story to for for equipment and look for like i'm looking for water yeah i did the same thing and i was like okay a microscope is like a tool and tool is like equipment and they said that they they use it to look for the water and so yeah that's the same 
130.1,Chris,,well you are you are partially correct but the the equipment that they sent was this machine called the lunar orbiter and that was able to go across the ground the surface the moon surface to check for these deposits yes student ,um yeah i went to nasa with my dad and so i know a lot about this stuff too in space like the astronauts need oxygen tanks and they need masks and they need suits too yes they do 
120.3,Luis,,so would someone like to read me the third paragraph ,um i can read it 
120.3,Luis,,teach okay ,okay um that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you are looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely oh yeah that's where you that's where you got your answer student and student 
140.1,Luis,,yeah so have you all you seen frost in the wintertime or in the fall have you seen on your mom's car windows or the grass ,um um yeah like on a car 
210.4,Luis,,okay that is moisture but that's still bigger than the moisture they found on the moon we can see frost with our naked eye but what they found on the moon we would not even be able to tell that it's there without the lunar orbiter and the and the microscope being able to see that ,okay i'm a little bit but i just looked at the clock and i realized that it's time for us to go to lunch so um i just want to say thanks for for coming to our class and really taking some time to listen to all of our ideas because sometimes the teachers don't always listen to everything that we have to say and trying to help us with a question 
230.2,Luis,,okay i think i'm ready we can start the simulation hello okay we've just answered what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon right student can you tell me can you read the paragraph where it says the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks where did you find evidence that ,okay well yeah i i can read it i also want to say that i don't think i should be in this class i already know a lot about space 
110.3,Luis,,well that will really help us by you knowing some things because you might be able to teach us some things we don't know okay why ,okay okay what did you want me to read 
230.2,Luis,,where paragraph does it talk about the scientists use a equipment like oxygen tanks ,okay i'm walking well i guess i don't really see oxygen tanks in here i was just something i know i know 
110.2,Luis,,okay um we definitely need oxygen when we go to space don't we because we don't have oxygen up there like we do here ,yeah scientists can't breathe the astronauts can't breathe out oxygen tank 
120.3,Chris,,that's right so let's look at our passage and see what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon let's look at our passages and let's see what paragraph that that might be can class tell me ,i found my answer paragraph one because they were talking about the water there about how there's a lot of water in the craters 
120.4,Farrah,,okay but we're going to what equipment did they use to find that what about number paragraph two could class find that answer ,yeah i found the equipment but it wasn't an aircraft to i found the equipment in paragraph three because yeah 
230.2,Farrah,,great can you tell me where what you found ,yeah so in paragraph three it says that the water they found is microscopic and they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.1,Farrah,,excellent why would a microscope help us see the water ,because you need a microscope to look at things 
230.1,Farrah,,because it's so it's so big or it's so small ,because it's so small 
210.4,Farrah,,okay do you think the water on the moon looks the same as a glass of water that we would drink ,i don't know 
210.4,Farrah,,in paragraph three what does it say about when when it says we're not able to see it what does it say right after that ,okay let me see you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it 
210.4,Farrah,,good yes so if we're having a glass of water with our lunch we can see that can't wait we can see that there's something in our glass so what does that tell us that the water on the moon is what compared to the water that we have here ,it's like really really small 
110.1,Farrah,,yeah ,like not a lot of it maybe 
210.4,Farrah,,well they might have a because i found it in the in the crater so there might be lots of it there but it's so small we can't see it with our naked eye do you know have you turned before naked eye yeah ,my mom says it a lot but i i just i still don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Farrah,,your your answer is not wrong you need a microscope to be able to see it but they also use the lunar orbiter to that's what they use to find the water that there was water in the crater then they had to go and use a microscope let's look back at the text okay okay says and and paragraph to the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so how do you think that lunar orbiter is being able to do that ,how's the lunar orbiter able to do that well um they they taught it how to fly and it flew to the moon 
120.4,Chris,,you're right you're right but how can that equipment find the water on the moon student maybe ,yeah well i know that all that and i know that well i went to nasa with my dad and so i know that our scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
150.1,Farrah,,your right they needed their lunar orbit orbiter to get to the moon and see the surface of the moon then once they figured out that there was deposits a very small water then they had to get the microscope out to make sure what they thought was there okay the microscope actually gave them the evidence that there was water on the moon you understand that ,i'm thinking about okay so what you're saying is that they sent the lunar orbiter and then they found the water and then they use the microscope to to look at the water 
210.4,Oliver,,yes because remember in paragraph three it says we wouldn't be able to see the water ,yeah yeah that's why i said that that the equipment was the microscope um yeah i said that to me and i said i said the same thing that the equipment was the microscope um but i think miss donna saying by the answers in paragraph two and not in paragraph three 
130.1,Luis,,yes they took the lunar orbiter was the equipment that they used then the tool they used was the microscope isn't it nice ,and it's kind of confusing and i am sorry to interrupt you but i just saw the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i know this was short but thanks for taking the time to work with us 
110.1,All,,i appreciate you class coming in today you've all done a very good job ,thank you okay bye 
110.1,All,,bye ,okay hey miss teacher so know that class has told you our answers on what do you think 
110.1,All,,i can't see you class i still see a picture ,okay let's see 
150.1,,,oh hi how does class feel after you read that passage do you feel pretty good you feel a little confused ,i feel like i had the right answer i thought i thought 
150.1,Luis,,okay ,yeah i think so i don't even know why i'm in this class because i already know everything about space or 
110.3,Luis,,even that's the nice thing about it because we all know different information and where you know in a little bit more maybe you can teach us some things along the way okay ,that's cool 
230.2,Chris,,student let's talk about your answer you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon uh huh what paragraph does that tell us that that happened ,in the first paragraph it says that scientists have found evidence that water can be deeper than the polar craters 
210.4,Chris,,so they can be found did it say that it was there ,scientists have found of water can be hmm well i guess because it said that they found evidence about the water that i thought that that meant that they found the water 
230.2,Luis,,yes sometimes we have to read this passage maybe more than one time to really understand what it's saying to us right yeah yeah you did a very good job going back and finding the evidence you did a good job thanks you're welcome student let's talk about your answer so someone says use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks can you help me find in the passage where it talks about oxygen tanks ,i'm sure sure sure sure okie oh okay um well i don't see oxygen tanks in here but i know i already know that they need oxygen tanks to breathe in space 
210.4,Luis,,right but this passage was only talking about what they found on the moon so is there anything in the passage that talks about oxygen ,i'm okay i'm gonna have to look again 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay ,excuse me 
210.4,Jazmin,,yes ma'am ,i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.1,Jazmin,,well it's not completely wrong it was they will did send a small machine but it really doesn't it was more than the lunar orbiter that they use dry because it wants to know what equipment and so they sent the lunar orbiter but what else what other kind of equipment or tool did they have to use ,oh oh i didn't even i didn't actually say that they said i just said that they sent a small machine 
130.1,Jazmin,,yeah which that really isn't telling us what the machine was right So that's why I said you're you're on the right track. ,okay 
210.3,Luis,,yeah student did you find anything was talking about oxygen ,um yeah yeah okay um well okay no it wasn't about oxygen it was just about ice and ice and water in this first part 
210.3,Luis,,okay ,yeah so so i guess it wasn't it wasn't 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay and who can tell me what tool that what tools did they use ,is it the one that i said that we were just talking about the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Farrah,,the lunar orbiter helped find the water but i want all of you to look in paragraph three what does it say about the water in paragraph three ,it says that you you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight 
210.4,Oliver,,very good so what do we need to do how do we find that we can't see ,that that was my answer i said that you need a microscope to see i'm not true um yeah but our answer was wrong 
120.3,Oliver,,well the tool they had that the equipment they had to use was the lunar orbiter to find the water then to actually make sure that they see it they had to use a microscope if you look in paragraph to the fourth sentence can you look down at the four sentence can who can read that for sentence to me ,i can read it okay i suppose it's a very small that one 
120.3,Oliver,,i'm the one right after that ,scientists set up one top of a layer of amount surface let me see oh i don't think i can read it 
210.4,Oliver,,okay it says the scientists said that one ton of a top soil there's a lot of work this would hold only 32 ounces of water my cup right here is 30 ounces mall would though the word water have to be to take a ton of surface which i couldn't even describe that would be trucks and trucks loads of topsoil okay the upload of the moon and it still would only fill this glass ,oh ok ok ok i see that now oh wow okay i don't sorry to interrupt our class but i just realized it's time for us to go to lunch by i wanted to take thank you for for helping us to understand some of the meanings of some of the words and and really helping all of us kind of use use evidence from the text in our answer and how are you asked us to keep going back to keep reading and look for it 
210.4,All,,i enjoyed my time with you class have a good lunch ,bye 
210.4,Luis,,bye okay yes yes student ,um yeah so i was just thinking like i already know like all that there is to know about space so i don't really think i need to be this class 
120.4,Farrah,,well it's great that you know a lot about space but we're going to specifically talk about the moon and the water that was found on the moon and we're going to look at these questions that we that we have okay i want i just want you class to look at them together with me so we can get a deeper understanding of our reading passage ok ok ok so you class did really good writing down an answer i'm very proud that you tried and read the pair the paragraph and that question and you answered it but i want us to look deeper into that the question asked us okay because we all struggled a little bit with giving a specific answer to the question okay so can we go ahead and look back at the question and i want you to circle or underline two keywords that you think are important in the question all right did you class circle a word who would like to tell me what word they circled student let's start with you what word did you circle in your question ,oh my circle two words right 
130.2,Oliver,,student did you circle those two words ,Yeah I circled the same one. 
120.4,Chris,,good how about you student ,oh i did as well 
430.2,Farrah,,good okay so the two words that we really want to focus on is equipment and discover yes student so some of your answers did involve equipment but what what you didn't do is use the word discover ,i just i was just wondering well my answer was wrong 
210.2,Farrah,,okay so you said that you'd meet a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and you are right the microscope is a piece of equipment that scientists use but remember the second word that you circled or underlined in the question was discover so they in the paragraph it says that they use this equipment to discover water to find water on the moon okay good so blessed ,to be get the microphone because they probably use the microscope to discover i guess i'm still wondering i did 
420.3,Chris,,okay well let's look back at our reading passage and student and student since you class had the same answer of microscope i want you class to look back at your reading passage and if you finish before i come back to you go ahead and work on the next question and remember your two keywords equipment and discover and look back to see if you can find a paragraph and the passage that uses the words discover and equipment yes student ,um well i was like dad took me to nasa and i was thinking while we were there we saw excited to set us basques shoot and stuff like that so i guess i was wondering like it like is that something that is that an answer 
210.4,Luis,,To discover the water. So would you like to go ahead and start looking back through the passage to see if you can use the word discover and equipment defined your answer. yeah sure okay and student you also were right that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks but we said when we circled in the second keyword so would you like to look back in your paragraph to see if you can find in our question that we need to also look for the word discovered what they use to discover discover is an action word it's something that they did that answer ,yeah i can look 
230.2,Jazmin,,okay and student you are correct nasa sand a small machine but can you look back in your paragraph to see if you can find the name of that machine that's right good job it is the lunar orbiter can you tell me what paragraph you found yes yes student ,oh yeah i can tell you but it's my for the next class but before we go i just wanted to thank you so much for working with this yeah it was really awesome thank you so much 
230.2,Luis,,thank you class okay class yes student ,um yeah i was gonna say i just wanted to remind class that um my dad is an astronaut 
420.1,Farrah,,that's great so our second question that we answered um was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable so again let's look back at our question and look for two keywords that will help us understand what we're looking for in our reading passage ,should we should we circle the words this time 
120.4,Jazmin,,yes you can circle or underline them yes Everybody finished. Okay. can someone tell me what two words that they circled right jack student what's what's a word that you circled ,okay so basically what i said was i said that okay so i circled water and i circle value 
130.1,Farrah,,valuable okay yes i agree that valuable is a keyword that's right but we're going to look for one more thing one more other keyword in the question so student could you tell me what word another word that you circled ,oh yeah so okay i should actually i had a question because i circled valuable and then i also circle evidence but i thought i should circle convincing too 
210.2,Oliver,,that's a very good point yeah that's a great idea but yes the two keywords that i was wanting you class to find was evidence and valuable yes def ,oh i think to answer my question 
210.2,Jazmin,,okay good student ,so i was just thinking that you could use the water to make a garden on the moon 
120.4,Chris,,that is true you could if there's enough water so let's look back at our question it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable so now that we know the two keywords that we need to look for in our reading passage is evidence and valuable can class look back at the reading passage and underline what you think a good answer would be okay did class see that in paragraph four the word valuable is actually at the beginning of the paragraph good so who would like to share what they circled on their paper or on their breeding passage student what did you underline or circle ,okay so what i circled up all right what i was looking at was i was thinking like that water can be broken down into two parts and that was where was that oh yeah in paragraph by water can be broken down two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
120.4,Farrah,,so student i want you to take a moment and look back at paragraph four where we see the word valuable because we're looking for evidence that water is valuable it's important good okay okay student you know what did you underline or circle ,so okay be what i was looking at well basically i was thinking that it's valuable so the stuff that i was focused on like i was doing the reading was i was looking in the past paragraph paragraph six that are making this plan will take a lot of time like i think it would take a long time and i don't think it would be valuable for for a long time you know what i mean i think it would be valuable maybe sure but i don't think it's valuable right now 
120.4,Oliver,,"so let's look look back at paragraph four, and see how, in the future, water would be valuable. Can you do that. Okay. All right. Then what did you underline or circle. ",so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for like making sure that we all felt valued and like also you made sure that we were using evidence really clearly like that we were going back to the text to make sure that's where we brought our evidence so that was really cool thank you so much for working with us 
310.1,Oliver,,i love that student used the text when she found her answer ,No problem 
150.1,Luis,,but we're trying to figure out what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon student scientists found craters full of water on the moon that is absolutely true and that's absolutely something that was in that reading so can you look a little deeper and try to answer that question ,i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
230.1,Luis,,you know all about space can you tell me more ,i watch a lot of sure sure i watch a lot of youtube videos so i know that astronauts need like um they need oxygen masks and often because there isn't any way to breathe there's no oxygen space and there's no gravity in space so they have to wear these really heavy boots to help them to walk on the moon um and then there's like a space shuttle that takes off but it has like two parts to it and one part falls off and then the other part like shoots them off into space 
150.1,Jazmin,,student that is such awesome information and i'm so proud of you that you go out and look for that information on your free time and i can't wait to share all of that information with the rest of the class when we get back with them for right now i love that you know that there's oxygen tanks oh nice thumbs up that's awesome i love that you know about oxygen but we're going to talk a little bit about the wate can you look back in the reading and there might be youtube videos on this too that you can look at a little bit later when you get back home but can you look back in the reading and can you tell me it just the same way that you found out about the oxygen can you look back about the water and see what it says about that because i think if we use our brain just for a little bit and we read that reading you're going to have all those same answers about the water too ,"okay Okay, because I don't understand why my answer is wrong. so i'll look and see "
420.2,Jazmin,,well student don't think that your answer is wrong sweetheart i just want you to get a little bit more specific with what you tell me ,okay 
120.1,Chris,,all right student did you find that answer in there ,yeah about the water 
120.1,Chris,,yes ,yeah i did it's in paragraph 1 it talks about how the scientists found evidence that the water can be found in the crater to really dark craters 
230.2,Oliver,,all right well that's awesome so in paragraph one it does tell us scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters i wonder maybe student can help us out because i sent him on this mission to find this answer i wonder it's asking about the equipment so that's kind of like the machine that was used to discover it so we know where it was but now we're asking about the machine so student did you find that answer in the in the text ,yeah yeah i when i looked on and to find the answer and i had circled the part that's the very last sentence of the whole text it says you'd need scientific to the tool called a microscope to really closely and because a microscope is a tool and like yeah like like a tool is like equipment you know so that's how i got it 
130.2,Farrah,,i love that you cited where you found it in the text student would you agree with what student said ,yeah yeah cuz that that was the same i had circle too student i had circled like you know you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely because they were looking at the water and that's what the question is asking 
420.2,Jazmin,,did you hear how they gave it a little bit more of a specific name so instead of just saying a small machine they called it a microscope ,no sorry i wasn't i was i was reading again i wasn't paying attention 
420.2,Chris,,that's okay sweetheart ,sorry to interrupt i just wanted to say that i know a lot i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.3,Farrah,,i'm sure they do and i bet that student could probably tell you more and you can share that information together ,yeah i can oh yeah sorry student was before student interrupted we were um i was trying to figure out like what was the problem with my answer too cuz i mean an equipment as a tool it's the same thing 
310.1,Farrah,,"you right equipment and tools the equipment is another word for a tool so when we have something that's the same word for a tool we would call it a synonym so they're synonyms of each other And that's perfectly because they're synonyms, which means that they're the same or they mean the same thing. ",great yeah exactly but then so so so what why is my answer wrong 
110.2,Oliver,,you told me and you gave it to me from the text that a microscope is what is needed to look really really closely your answer is not wrong honey you're you're right ,oh oh okay well then why i'm sorry i'm sorry to interrupt um it's it's but i was i was looking at the clock and it's actually it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just i really appreciate how how you like each of us question and and look again and you're also you're really a nice teacher thank you 
210.2,Luis,,well thank you student and i appreciate that start simulation hey class student i loved your answer but i want to challenge you a little bit you said that you use the microscope to look closely but take a look at the question and what it's asking it's asking us what was used to discover water do you know the difference or can you explain the difference between discovering and looking ,excuse me ms teache while she's thinking i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
210.2,Farrah,,student then you'll be able to help us as we as we explore a little bit more about what we what we've read about so when you discover something have you ever seen it before ,i guess like i'm when i discover on i was thinking more it's like when you find something i guess 
230.2,Oliver,,finding it but planning it for the first time looking into and finding it for the first time that's how i would change your answer just a little bit to make it a little bit more clear now student you told me that you circled the same answer as student but i want you to challenge you and see if you can find in the text where it says or where it talks about a microscope because ,i circled it in the last paragraph but it was just hard student said her answer before mine and she have the same answer as me well yeah it's the last the last sentence and the last paragraph 
120.3,Jazmin,,okay great i'm glad that you had some place that you could reference back to because that's really helpful in showing me that you know where the information came from student scientists found craters full of water on the moon you are absolutely correct but i do want to challenge you to go back and would you actually read the the discussion question for me again ,"what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon Yeah, I don't understand why my answer is wrong. "
420.2,Jazmin,,"I asked Farrah over there who could go deeper into the text and find her answer, you should be able to pull it right from the text. So a small machine is great, but there's more specific information in there that could give a more specific answer. can you look for that for me ",okay oh nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so i just have to write the whole stuffer sentence 
120.3,Luis,,Luis you've been super patient with me. and i know that you know a lot about space so i know that you can really help us out here scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and i want to challenge just like student take a look at that question can you read the question for me ,um yeah okay um what scientists used to discover water on the moon 
210.3,Luis,,now did scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon ,well i mean no they didn't use them to discover water on the moon but they use oxygen tanks to breathe on the moon 
130.2,Chris,,"and that's awesome and i love that you know that because it's very very helpful and necessary for all those astronauts up there So let's hop back to Chris for a second and see if he was able to find what answered, or the answer to this specific question. ",okay so i saw in the first paragraph where they're talking about the water and the water was found deep within the moon's polar craters um but then i remembered that you told student that finding isn't the same thing as discovering so now i'm not really sure you know 
150.1,Chris,,whoa okay so finding a finding and discovering are really similar words and i totally understand why we could get confused with them so that's okay student it's totally okay when you just ,i mean i know stuff about speaks to like student i went to nasa so i know that our scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks in suits but i just don't know which equipment they use to to to find the water or i guess discover water on the moon 
120.3,Chris,,let me point you in the right direction okay i'm going to point you to paragraph three look at paragraph three ,uh huh 
210.2,Jazmin,,and remember we're looking for equipment ,but you said my answer is right my answers in paragraph two 
120.4,Jazmin,,student would you remind me of what you had told me before ,yeah i said the lunar orbiter because it says and nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,a lunar orbiter is doing a different job they called a lunar orbiter to what ,Look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. 
230.2,Oliver,,hmm so is that again we're coming back to what student had told us about look and discover and how that's a little confusing which verb are they using in that paragraph look or discover ,okay its got look and its got investigate miss victoria 
230.2,Oliver,,yes student ,i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch so i'm sorry all but thanks for taking the time to work with us 
220.1,Luis,,hey class so i want to challenge you to think about the answer that you have right now and see if you can find evidence in the text that supports that answer student what's going on ,execuse me ms teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.3,Luis,,i am so excited that you are excited about space but i do challenge you to go back into the reading and think about that response that you gave me can you read the discussion question for us again student can you read the discussion question for us again student ,sure um what scientists used to discover water on the moon 
210.2,Luis,,and i think student that you had told us about oxygen tanks did they use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon or did they use it for something else so we're discovering water on the moon ,i might use oxygen tanks to breathe 
420.2,Farrah,,"okay so we know we know that much but we still don't know what they used to to discover the water on the moon student i want to go back to your answer you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and that is very very true Can you change or think about your answer and change the way that you say it, so it answers that question. ",whispering to herself you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close 
120.3,Chris,,student you have found some specific evidence in the text you pulled it right out scientists have found craters full of water on the moon and that is absolutely true and i'm really proud of you for finding that Look at that question again. can you read it out loud for me ,yeah what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
110.2,Chris,,but that doesn't tell us what equipment they used to discover it so we're looking for equipment they definitely found craters full of water ,"Okay, okay. Yeah. "
230.2,Farrah,,student where in the reading you did you find some evidence to answer our question ,in the third paragraph oh ms teacher i still don't understand why my answers wrong 
130.2,Oliver,,let's see if we can figure it out because student had the same answer is you so let's talk with student and see if we can work together on that one ,yeah in paragraph three the last one it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Oliver,,you need a scientific tool to look really closely and that's exactly what student had said yeah we are looking for this specific tool used to discover water on the moon did they discover water with the microscope ,did they discover well it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely um so i guess they they looked at the water with the microscope 
120.3,Jazmin,,hmm let's look back at paragraph two for a second student do you know what that means nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate what does it mean to investigate ,i watch sometimes umthis cartoon with a police dog and he's always investigating crimes 
140.1,Jazmin,,what what is he doing when he's investigating crimes does he does he just leave them unsolved at the end ,no no he goes around and he looks for clues and then he talks to people um yeah to kind of find it out 
210.4,Jazmin,,student can you can you keep reading in that second paragraph so they sent the orbiter to look for clues they didn't talk to class on the moon but they sent the lunar look for clues and what did they find with the lunar orbiter ,yeah um okay the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater nice ice deposits are very small st to set that one top of the top layer of the surface will in total 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day 
210.3,Luis,,you're okay thanks student student did you find any evidence when you were looking to answer that different question ,to two pieces of equipment the small machine that student was reading about and then the microscope that student and student were talking about 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay so there's two pieces of equipment that we're actually looking at here we're trying to figure out which one they used to discover water but plot twist one is kind of a version of the other slits think about it a lunar orbiter discovering orbiting looking around used to investigate student remind me what investigating means again ,look for clues 
210.4,Farrah,,good so they had to look for clues in order to figure out if there was water on the moon they also had to see the water firsthand what did they use to see the water student ,the microscope the microscope 
130.1,Chris,,so wouldn't you say that they needed to use not one but two pieces of equipment to actually figure out that there was water on the moon ,you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits um so yeah it makes sense that they would need other equipment too 
130.3,Oliver,,yeah so they had to use the lunar orbiter and they also had to use the microscope student ,miss miss teacher this is pretty cool i was just looking at the time and it's it's time for us to go to lunch um but i like how you kept asking me talk talk back after i'm at the tax to try to find that information because i know that i'm student and student know a lot of stuff but then you kept saying us okay well go read back in this part all read back in this part and i think about was helpful to 
130.3,All,,i'm glad you think so student ,okay bye bye 
130.3,Bennett,,bye class okay start simulation ,all right 
130.3,Luis,,alright hi class so yes student thank you for raising your hand ,um yeah so i just was gonna say i don't think i should be in this class because i already know like all about space 
110.3,Luis,,you do that's wonderful well maybe you'll be able to help us answer our question a little bit differently so do you think you could put your listening ears on and maybe you can help us answer this question better does that sound okay ,oh yeah yeah i think i'd be great to help on this question 
120.4,Farrah,,wonderful i'm so glad you're ready to help so um i want to know from you all maybe each one of you can tell me something that you remember or that you found interesting about the reading so i'd like to start with student can you tell me something that you found interesting about the reading ,yeah so i think one thing that i thought was really interesting was when i was looking for the for the equipment but to see like how much equipment they have to use it there's a lot of it 
120.4,Oliver,,you're right yes there is a lot of equipment that gets used okay student what about you was there something interesting that stood out to you about the reading ,um yeah i think what was really interesting to me about this one was like the fact that there was just like you know the fact that there's so little water like it's all spread across the surface but they were still able to find it using the microscope 
110.1,Chris,,okay and um student what about you is there something really interesting about the reading nice yes that was really interesting ,yeah i think for me what was most interesting was looking at like was i think the fact that i've not been to nasa a couple of times with my dad and so i was connecting to everything they were saying on because i i had kind of known some of it but not everything 
120.4,Jazmin,,wonderful how what a fun experience hi student thank you for raising your hand would you like to share something interesting about the reading ,yeah i guess the thing that i had was that i was kind of confused about why my answer is wrong 
230.1,Jazmin,,okay well was there something else about the reading that you found interesting aside from the question itself ,okay a lot of it was just like what was really interesting is that like with water you could do like so much magic stuff plant and you do all kinds of stuff with water 
120.4,Luis,,yeah what a good observation i love that all right student you said you knew a lot about science was there something interesting about this article that stood out to you ,hi yeah i was really cool and i think for me like the thing that was so interesting is like seeing that like you know how they use the equipment they have this equipment and then they have to use all these different pieces in order to like find the water and study it that's really cool 
120.3,Oliver,,wow that is really cool i love all of those answers okay so could i have someone raise your hand if you would like to volunteer to read question number one out loud for us okay student i saw your hand first will you read question number one for us please ,um yeah okay so question one is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.2,Farrah,,okay i saw savannas hand first what do you think student can someone raised their hand and tell me what is the question asking us for what are we trying to get the answer of someone raise your hand what is the question asking us for ,i think the questions asking us okay so it says scientists discovered the water and then like what equipment did they use to do that 
120.4,Chris,,okay what equipment did they use to discover the water that's what student is saying student do you have something you'd like to add ,on class because i was just thinking that because i went to nasa and i just know that scientists use like lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots and that wasn't in the reading 
230.1,Chris,,you didn't find that in the reading is that what you said ,yeah like i know they use it but like it wasn't in the reading when i when i read i was wondering like should it have been there you know what i mean 
210.3,Chris,,gotcha yeah so that's a really good question um remember that in the question we are being asked to determine like student says the equipment that's used to discover the water so do you think student that if we're asking about the equipment that's used for water we would need all of the different equipment or only just the parts that would help us discover the water ,that's a really good question 
110.1,Chris,,yeah that was a big question ,you could use all of the equipment but like specifically you said to discover so i guess that's a like you don't use a suit to discover you'd have to use something else right 
230.2,Chris,,right that's a really good observation i love that okay so we know that the question is asking us for the equipment that the astronauts use to discover the water so where do you think we can find the answer to that if you will refer back to your article back to your reading i would love to know where you think you might find the answer to the equipment that we use to discover water student i see your hand up yes ,and i would say that it's in paragraph two and that's where you would find that like where you will find the equipment used to discover the water and i just want to say that i think it's important for me with the microscope but unfortunately we just have to go to lunch to wanted to thank you so much for working with us but but we have to go look 
230.3,Farrah,,okay so student just gave us an excellent answer she said that she thinks she can find the answer in paragraph two and then i heard from student he said he thought it was in paragraph three i'm sorry would you raise your hand so i know who said that yeah ,okay i'm sorry 
230.2,Jazmin,,that's okay thank you for raising your hand so student thought it was in paragraph three and student thought it was in paragraph two so student could you please read us in paragraph to read us the sentence where you think it answers the question about what kind of equipment we were using to discover water ,in the first sentence in paragraph 2 it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
230.2,Farrah,,wonderful okay student does student answer change the way that you would would answer or do you still believe it's in paragraph three ,well i guess i can see how the small machine or i guess the lunar orbiter is the small machine like i could see how that was used to discover so the water you see is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close so i guess i guess what i was thinking is like you can't see the water without the microscope so like how could you discover it 
130.2,Luis,,okay that's a great question can class tell me what they think would be the answer to farrahs question which is wouldn't it be the microscope that discovered the water or can student support her answer with evidence that is the lunar orbiter okay student what do you think ,um yeah so what i was thinking just like on the question that you're asking is like you use lots of equipment and you don't need a microscope to to detect it you can detect water using other tools 
110.1,Chris,,okay i like that answer a lot and student would you like to add anything to that ,um yeah so i guess i wish to keep kind of the same thing that basically there's lots of equipment you you could use so like you don't the microscope isn't necessarily the quick you know what i mean like it could be sensors it could be other things 
110.1,Jazmin,,yes that's very true okay student what would you like to add ,he said that i support my answer right so okay yes here's how i would support my answer so the question was what equipment it scientists use to discover the water i was thinking that the word discovers like the word investigate so like it seemed like the best answer was like what was the word that matched the question right and even though you might use the microscope study the water like you use the lunar orbiter to discover the water 
210.4,Farrah,,"Farrah, are you able to relate to what Jazmin was saying where the lunar orbiter is what we use to actually discover the water, but the microscope is what we use to study the water. ",yeah actually okay that does mean a lot of sense i still like i guess i'm not like 100 sure but i do understand like that that matches the word keyword 
210.4,Luis,,right to discover the water is the lunar orbiter okay so someone raise your hand and tell me some of the other equipment that we've talked about in this reading what we've talked about the lunar lunar orbiter and we've talked about the microscope was there any other equipment that they've talked about yes student ,um well i guess okay you said what they talked about so not like what we were saying 
210.4,Luis,,what we read in our what we read in the paragraphs was there other equipment that was discussed in the paragraph that we read ,you know i guess not like there really isn't other it's just a microscope and the lunar orbiter in the text 
150.1,Jazmin,,okay class else have a different answer than that let's go to question two is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable just those two pieces of equipment okay wonderful what is the question asking us for please raise your hand if you think you know what the question is asking us student ,we have to go to lunch but before we go too much i just wanted to take a moment and i really wanted to thank you because there's a couple things that you were doing that like really helped us understand like the question and get to the answer first that you've really helped us to clarify like how you were asked like you know the ways that you asked us about our thinking and like what we were saying and like in order to like use evidence to justify our answers like you really gave us a chance to explain it and that was pretty cool because like we don't always get to like explain what we were thinking and also that you really value our thining even though it looks like lunar orbiter the right answer like you really valued what we were thinking about ans where they were coming from and i also you know like we're really beginning to ask us like you know like what we needed to work on and like we're giving ideas for how to improve it so like that was really cool to be able to begin that but especially to like be looking at all that stuff so thank you so much 
120.1,Farrah,,hi class so could i please hear a little bit more about the scientific tool like a microscope that you think you might need ,yeah sure okay so i had said that you know like you need this microscope in order to look really closely you know like at the water 
110.1,Oliver,,oh let's wait your turn please ,i said the same thing 
210.3,Oliver,,do you think ,sorry sorry 
230.1,Farrah,,do you think that they took a microscope with them to the moon ,i don't know but but it says tt says that they put they had a microscope in the story 
230.1,Oliver,,oh i see what you're talking about i like the connection you made there all right i like the connection you made there all right hey student can you tell me a little bit more why you like farrahs answer ,it's not that i liked her answer you know it's like like i had the same answer as her or like she had the same answer as me you know like we had the same answer but it doesn't like like i had her answer you know 
110.1,Oliver,,something about her answer that you really liked that you thought made sense ,well i mean yeah what i liked about you know like my answer um which student had the same one true um was that the question asked her about um let me see the question asked her about equipment and a microscope is like a tool you need a scientific tool yeah so like that's a tool and equipment is a tool so like that's why i think i think we had a good answer 
230.1,Chris,,gotcha okay thank you for clarifying that student you're doing a great job of listening can you tell me more about what you think about the craters full of water on the moon ,yeah yeah it was like okay so the scientists found found water in the crater so like that was my answer 
230.2,Farrah,,yes thank you that's great i'm so glad that you could clarify do you think that the moon is wet or did it say that the moon is very dry ,i don't know they found water deep in the craters they sent a machine to look for ice i don't know i don't know if it's wet or dry excuse me 
230.2,Farrah,,student thank you for raising your hand yes go ahead ,i still don't understand why my answers wrong 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay let me let me talk with student for just a moment and i'll come back to you okay student can you tell me or maybe how about with with student he's not sure if the moon is wet or dry can you maybe help him out and and see if you can give a different answer ,i don't know either if the moon is wet or dry 
130.2,Luis,,okay student are you able to help ,well i know i know a lot about space like and i know a lot about the moon like i know that the astronauts like to go to the moon and i know that you can't breathe there's no oxygen on the moon um and i know that um that so they have to wear like space suits so that they can breathe on the moon and then they can walk on the moon and i know that they found some water on mars but but i don't know if i don't know about the water on the moon yet 
120.3,Farrah,,okay can you can class look back at number three on your document so let's see student can you read the first sentence of bullet point number three on your document please just the first sentence ,oh yeah sure okay scientists have found evidence that water can be foudn deep within 
120.3,Farrah,,i'm gonna stop you there we're looking at number three not at number one can you try again ,oh yeah yes sorry okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth 
230.1,Chris,,okay thank you so much for reading so student did we discover that the moon is wet or dry ,yeah we know that the moon is dry okay i get it 
230.2,Chris,,so did they find craters full of water or were they just looking for the water to find ,see what you're saying okay okay yeah um well cuz you know i went to nasa and so i know that the scientists like they use a lot of like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff and so i didn't know that it was like really dry there 
110.3,Chris,,yeah that's great that's a great connection how neat that you've been to nasa before i love that ,it's really cool 
120.3,Farrah,,all right so student we're gonna stay on number three but i would like you to keep reading can you do that for me ,yeah sure sure sure okay um okay we're still in number three yeah oh cuz this is where my answer came from the water the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely yeah that was my answer 
110.2,Jazmin,,that's right so you weren't wrong at all they would probably need a microscope if they're going to test the water ,but then why is my answer wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,student i'm sorry student what was that ,then i don't know why my answer is wrong because i said a small machine and they asked about equipment 
120.3,Jazmin,,you're absolutely right so student will you go to number two and read the first sentence on your document ,yeah nasa sent a small machine called a lunar to investigate orbiter 
150.1,Luis,,that's right what that word that starts with an o lunar what orbiter good job okay so you said they said a small machine and you're exactly right here what does this small machine do and they go up on the moon ,excuse me maam 
150.1,Luis,,yes ,i'm sorry yeah i know that was really short and we just met but it's time for us to go to lunch right now but i really i really do appreciate how you you took time with every every single one of us to kind of like you know help us to to keep looking looking at the text and and you're really patient thank you bye 
150.1,Luis,,bye have a good lunch see you later ,hi hi hi hi excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,there's always things you can learn ,um oh i guess okay 
150.1,Oliver,,so i saw some of your responses to the discussion question ,yeah i think that's why that's why the teacher asked us to come over here for for you to talk to us about our answers yeah that's what they said um yeah yeah 
120.2,Farrah,,all right so student the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,uh huh 
120.4,Farrah,,do you remember put for that ,i'm i'm trying to remember i don't remember what i put let me just see because i circled it on my tablet oh yeah i circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
110.1,Oliver,,right um student ,yeah 
120.4,Oliver,,what did you put ,on well i circled the same thing as student on the bottom of the page we i didn't like circle it because she circled it but we had we had the same answer what i circled the same thing um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.4,Farrah,,all right do you have anything else you want to add ,well i it's meet student here i just want to say that i don't understand why my answer's wrong 
110.2,Farrah,,i don't your answer isn't wrong ,but the teacher said that we're all here because we we needed to have a more complete response to the text and have a deeper understanding Okay. 
110.2,Chris,,um let's see student ,yeah yeah yeah ah i found that in the first part yeah and the first part of it cuz it talked to all about the water in the first part of it 
110.2,Farrah,,right but our discussion question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so student and student you class said they use the scientific tool called a microscope which that's answering the question right ,yeah that's why i it circled it says equipment you know like that's equipment on tool and equipment that's like the same thing yeah yeah cuz a microscope is a tool a scientific tool so that's equipment 
120.2,Chris,,so can you class look back at paragraph two right and then it says what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon ,i went to nasa i know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits a lot a lot of different equipment 
210.1,Chris,,right so they wouldn't you would need more than just a microscope to look at it right ,right yeah 
210.3,Chris,,right so that's why i was looking at jazmin's answer and she said nasa send a small machine and what else could she have put instead of just a small machine ,ah i'm not sure 
120.1,Jazmin,,student what else do you think ,me what do i think 
210.3,Jazmin,,well yeah what else could you have put in your answer instead of just saying a small machine how could you have made that more in depth answered it more in depth ,nasa sent a machine to discover water on the moon 
120.4,Jazmin,,i'm sorry say that one more time ,i guess put more of the question in my answer so i couldn't have said a small machine to discover water on the moon 
210.3,Jazmin,,bus a small machine that could be anything couldn't it ,yeah i guess so 
120.3,Jazmin,,so let's look back at paragraph two that first sentence ,okay 
120.3,Jazmin,,what does it say student ,it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.3,Jazmin,,so what else could you put in your answer ,a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
150.1,Luis,,mm hmm you class see that ,i'm sorry i looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short but i really appreciate you took so much time to really help us and ask us questions i must look back at the text again to try to find our answers um thank you 
150.1,Farrah,,okay hey class how are you ,hi good how are you 
150.1,Luis,,i'm good so i brought you all back here into a small class because um i want to talk with you class about your answers that you class put for question number one yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already corrected my answer 
120.4,Luis,,um what what did you correct it to what did you write down again ,um well i didn't i already submitted it i don't remember what i wrote down um let me see if it's on my slide 
110.1,Luis,,i have written i have that you put scientist use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks is that what you put ,um no i corrected that let me see i'm looking to see if i can find it 
420.1,Oliver,,okay while are you looking for i'm going to talk with the other four ok I want you guys to figure out or underline Or pick out one or two words in that question that you think our key words important words that might help us answer the question a little bit more in depth. Okay. i give you class just about 30 seconds ,i'm scared right now we're looking at keywords in the question 
120.4,Farrah,,yeah i want you class to just look at the question i'm really proud of you class for answering the question and reading the passage and answering the questions but i want you to look at question number one and see if you can find a keyword or two keywords that are important that might help you answer the question and let's just see what you class got student did you find one ,i did and i already corrected my answer too but the keyword that i found was discover and equipment 
130.2,Oliver,,perfect yeah and how many of you class picked out equipment or discover ,i picked out equipment and discover too equipment and water i said equipment of water 
130.2,Luis,,student what did you get ,i said equipment discover and water 
110.1,Oliver,,equipment discover and water good job so you class picked out some really good keywords the two keywords that i looked at was equipment and discover student you put the same thing i student correct so i'm student what i have that you have written down as you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really to look at it really close ,yeah yeah when you asked us all a say or answer so first i'm not i heard hurts and it's the same thing that i found too 
230.1,Farrah,,awesome okay well i'm student or student let's do student first why did you write down the answer that you did ,well because i was looking at the word equipment and i remembered in science class miss smith always calls a microscope equipment when she says we're going to use the equipment today and also for discover i think that's like you know when you're looking at something you discover it and so i saw that they were talking about finding the water and looking at it in paragraph three and the microscope which is 
230.1,Oliver,,ok and student why did you why did you put down the same thing in student was your mind going the same way as hers ,oh well kinda cuz yeah i'm in the same science classes her so when it said scientific tool i was thinking about how we use tools for different things and so i thought equipment and tool was the same thing so that's why i set the microscope 
210.2,Oliver,,good okay well equipment is the same thing as a tool right but we're trying to figure out the equipment that they used to discover and do you class know what discover means ,it means like when you find something 
120.1,Oliver,,yeah so we're trying to figure out the equipment that they used that the scientist is to find the water on the moon okay so student and student while i'm talking with student and student and student i want you to to look back in the passage and see if you can find a different equipment that they used can you gues do that ,uh huh 
110.1,Chris,,okay and i'm going to talk with student and student and student ,i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and mask and suits 
110.1,Jazmin,,they do they use a lot of equipment don't they uh huh yeah but there's usually in in this passage that you class read i didn't see a lot of equipment that they used but you are very very right that's a good connection student good job student in your answer i saw you that you put nasa sentma small machine ,uh huh okay um 
210.4,Jazmin,,and you are exactly right they did send a small machine but they you know what that small machine was called ,no i don't remember 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay i want you to look back in the passage and see if you can figure out what that small machine was called ,oh oh it's called a lunar orbiter 
150.1,Oliver,,it is called a lunar orbiter isn't it and i want you to keep that in your mind just a minute okay yes student ,excuse me it's i'm sorry it's been a short time but it's time for us to go to lunch now 
150.1,Oliver,,okay well thank you class you class did really really good ,thank you okay bye 
230.1,Luis,,okay all right class just looked at your revised answers and i do want to give you class a little pat on the back that your answers do look a lot better than your initial answers so very good job um i saw where student where you revised your answer what made you change your mind what made you change your answer ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already corrected my answer and so i know mind correct now 
230.1,Farrah,,"you did correct your answer but your answer um you said using a small machine student Uh, we're gonna figure out how to look back in the story and figure out a more in depth answer. ok ok ok so student what made you change your answer ",you had told me before that that the microscope looked at the the the water but but it didn't discover the water so then i was trying to find another machine in the story 
120.4,Oliver,,very good and the other machine that you found was the lunar orbiter correct all right um and then student did you get the chance to revise yours ,oh i couldn't figure out what was wrong because i thought the microscope was right 
230.1,Chris,,okay so we'll talk about that here in just a minute okay okay student and you revised you're in so you put that the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic and we talked a little bit about that what made you change to change your answer ,when it said that the water was deep in the craters that that meant was like a poll that was really deep in there was a lot of water but then you had told me that deep in the craters didn't mean like like like a pool but just made like really low so and and i realized there wasn't any equipment in in paragraph one okay 
210.2,Farrah,,student we just talked about yours student and i'm sorry so i want us to look at the question and it said the question asked what equipment did scientist he is to discover water on the moon so we're trying to figure out what equipment so what what sort of tool did scientists to use to find the water on the moon yes student ,oh nevermind i didn't realize you were you were gonna read that part nevermind 
210.2,Jazmin,,okay student ,i changed my answer too 
230.1,Jazmin,,what did you change your answer to ,i added the name of the machine i said nasa some to small machine called a lunar orbiter 
230.2,Jazmin,,perfect and student where did you um can you tell me what paragraph you found that in ,it was in the same sentence as the one that i i had my my first answer in paragraph to um but i just added the name of the machine 
230.3,Luis,,perfect so answering that student answered it perfectly she said that um let me see if i found it nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate correct ,Okay. 
150.1,Luis,,does that make sense ,yeah i'm not sure it's just that i didn't say enough 
130.2,Chris,,your answer was that scientists found i see using smaller machines but class did we know that ice is water right q ,yeah for for me that's why i was i was confused because i was looking for water in the story and so i didn't see the pardon about paragraph two about the ice cuz i was looking for the word water 
210.4,Chris,,okay how many of you class were looking for the word water in the in the passage yeah and that's that's understandable because that's what the question asked was what did they use to discover water on the moon so whenever we're looking in our passage we have to be able to read and understand that ice on the moon is the same thing as water ,you know teacher i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like tanks and masks and suits 
110.1,Chris,,yeah nasa does have ,yeah um but i didn't i didn't know anything about the water 
230.1,Chris,,you didn't know anything about the water so you didn't know that water meant the same thing as ice ,well i mean i remember we learned that in science class but i wasn't thinking about it i was thinking more about like the just water water you know when i was reading i was looking for the word 
520.1,Oliver,,right okay okay so whenever we're reading we want to fully understand what we're trying to look for in the question so as we're reading if we're not sure we need to be able to understand what the question is asking ,reach every reader thank you it's time for us to go to lunch must go but thank you for for all i guess it's telling us what we're looking for question to really try to understand what it's asking and not just look up the keywords because i guess that's what me and student and student detlef look at some keywords but we didn't really understand 
520.1,Chris,,you class did good ,okay thank you okay bye hi 
120.4,Luis,,hi okay so we just read the passage about finding water on the moon the question we just responded to is what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon okay student would you remind me of your answer again ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i know all about speed 
110.1,Luis,,thank you for your input student but i just asked student a question would you mind letting her respond ,oh yeah sure 
110.1,Farrah,,thank you ,can you repeat the question please 
120.2,Farrah,,yes what equipment then scientists use to discover water on the moon ,oh yeah um so i circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.3,Oliver,,okay so i've got a microscope really closely now student can you read the first sentence in paragraph two for me ,oh yeah sure okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
120.3,Chris,,ah there we go okay let's see student could you read the second sentence in that paragraph paragraph number two ,yeah sure this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
120.3,Jazmin,,very good thank you and student would you read that last sentence and paragraph number two for us please ,yeah sure these ice deposits are very small 
150.1,Luis,,so student our science expert out of paragraph two how do we answer this question what was your response very good so i had you read paragraph number two because it's really where our answer is ,i'm not really sure 
140.1,Luis,,could you tell me some equipment that they took up there that they used in general while they were in space ,oh yeah i know a lot about that equipment um they they use okay so because there's no oxygen in space they use like oxygen tanks and they use like i'm their space suits and they use a rocket like to get up into space you know like as a rocket goes straight up like all way into the way into the orbit of space 
150.1,Jazmin,,absolutely thank you for sharing now so let's look let's start at the top then let's start at the very top the moon is a desert right ,excuse me but i still don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,i'm sorry i couldn't hear you can you repeat that ,i don't understand why is my answer is wrong 
110.2,Jazmin,,your answer is not wrong so you you're right they did say that they used a microscope to look very closely okay you're right about that ,that was farrah's answer mine was about the small machine i thought that that was be the right answer 
210.3,Jazmin,,oh right so it is a small machine that is correct do you know what the small machine was called ,lunar orbiter 
110.1,Jazmin,,there you go very good that is correct so that is the answer that we're looking for student thank you ,i'm sorry what's the answer 
210.4,Chris,,so we were looking for they said so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and the lunar orbiter it in paragraph two it says it looks for ice deposits in large polar craters the ice deposits are very small so do you see how that is our answer does that help student ,well i know the answer cuz cuz you just told me it is but um i guess i don't know i mean i went to nasa and i know that there's lots of equipment and scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and like lots lots of stuff like that lots of equipment because i'm using the word in the question lots of equipment like that 
120.2,Chris,,absolutely this is specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water on the moon right so if we go back and look in that text is that so they did have to use all that equipment to get to space you are correct but this question specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water does that help ,yeah i think you're saying like that yeah so i know a lot of equipment but the question is asking about the equipment that we use to find a water so i was just talking about equipment but not equipment to find the water 
210.4,Oliver,,so let's look back in the text so where in the text can you find the word um let's see let's look for the word um machine machine in there ok machine isn't it yeah ,yeah cuz student answer had machine in it but my answer and um farrahs answer well our answer had a scientific tool and and and scientific tool is is equipment too 
150.1,Oliver,,very good so what did we what did we look at and very closely ,i'm i'm i'm sorry to interrupt but i just looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to a lunch i know it was really really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you really took the time to like listen to all of us and really try to help us take our time to find the answer right class okay so thank you and bye 
150.1,Luis,,bye hi class thank you so much for your responses taking your time and reading the text and rotten a response yes student ,um yeah so i i think i need to be in this class because i know all about space 
120.4,Farrah,,oh well student and that's exactly why we need you in here we need you in here to help help us out so let's look at your responses so the question was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon right so who can raise their hand and tell me what equipment yes student ,okay so i said basically it would be a scientific tool called a microscope 
130.1,Farrah,,but let's look more at that question so it's asking for equipment what kind of equipment searches for what what are they looking for and and that is an equipment a microscope is a piece of scientific equipment you are correct ,they're looking for the water 
210.4,Oliver,,and i think student you had said the same thing is student right exactly exactly now let's go back and look at that text ,yeah i said the same thing 
120.1,Farrah,,okay perfect so how about you two kind of work together and go back and look at the text and look specifically for what piece of equipment they used to look for what were they looking for again was it what were they looking for again was it okay perfect so how about you two kind of work together and go back and look at the text and look specifically for what piece of equipment they used to look for ,water 
150.1,Chris,,perfect awesome how about student and student you class look at that together okay student let's look at that did you have questions let's see ,um so i said that scientists found craters full of water 
110.4,Jazmin,,exactly and i did and that's in the text very good for looking at the text and pulling that out awesome job and student once look at yours and nasa send a small machine which you are correct about that as well and student then they used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right you listed some equipment that astronauts use awesome you all refered back to the text so let's look there they did find water on the moon that is correct yeah you student ,i'm still looking like why my answer is wrong 
430.2,Jazmin,,so your answer they did send a small machine but the question was asking for specifics so a little more in depth so could you be a little more specific about what type of equipment and what that piece of equipment's name was ,it was the lunar orbiter 
420.2,Chris,,exactly exactly so i think you the three of you you read this question and you understood the text you just needed to go just a little bit more in depth right yes student ,um well i i don't really know which equipment it might be because i just i think there's a lot of craters there's a lots of water 
130.2,Luis,,okay student did you have something right and that is correct how about you and student kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you class can help each other look at the text how about you and student kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you class can help each other look at the text ,while i was just gonna say like i know that like scientists use a lot of you know equipment so like i said oxygen tanks and stuff like that 
130.1,Luis,,but we look back at the question for me student it will you read the question back to me yeah and that's right they do use that ,um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.4,Luis,,awesome okay so yeah they would have used that equipment they would have to use oxygen if they're on the moon if it were astronauts on the moon right so it is asking in the text field like back in the text there's one piece of equipment that they used looking for that water right ,well i saw on you know orbiter and microscopes that was the equipment i saw like in the reading 
210.4,Luis,,right exactly so do you think the microscope to help them look for water while they're physically on the moon ,um yeah i didn't really think about it because i haven't really read about microscopes before i'm not totally sure like did they use that like which one they use 
210.4,Chris,,right so if you look in the text this is it they use the lunar orbiter right and microscopes it has both of them there that but when it's talking specifically about finding water see if you can look back in the texts and find where it says film equipment used to find water on the moon yeah student ,so we were talking and i was saying oh so like i was saying i know that like because i went to nasa with my dad so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment oxygen tanks and masks and suits and i really think that's the answer 
120.3,Chris,,but in this question specifically it's asking what piece of equipment did they use to search for water on the moon specifically right well enough that's right the astronauts use all that you are correct in that so if you go back in the text and you look in that first part where they're talking about the piece of equipment they've talked about the moon being a desert right and they think that there's no water and then in the second paragraph right there if you could go back and reread that second paragraph for me ,to read aloud 
120.3,Jazmin,,yes please ,okay i'm reading it right now well chris's meeting unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go it just wanted to thank you so much for working with us thank you 
150.1,Luis,,hey class thanks so much for reading that text and responding rotten those responses for me yes student ,um yeah so i've kind of already like i know all about space so i don't think i really even the be in this class 
110.3,Chris,,student awesome student well thanks so much for joining us we we really need you in this class today since you know a lot about space okay thank you for that ,oh no i was just 
150.1,Farrah,,okay so but before we do that can student will you read the question aloud to the class please okay awesome so let's take a quick look at our responses ,yeah okay the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
110.1,Luis,,thank you very much student so student let's discuss your answer real quick okay you said that they use lots of equipment right ,yeah 
230.1,Luis,,can you list off some equipment that they used ,yeah okay so they use like they use oxygen tanks and they use masks and like they must have us rocket fuel and like rocket ships and all that kind of stuff you know 
120.3,Luis,,thank you for that that's awesome prior knowledge about pieces of equipment they use student how about student would you go back and read paragraph two for us would you read it aloud place ,"Okay. Um, let's see. okay nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar or will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a barge pole or create these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one ton of top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 30 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day "
110.1,Farrah,,very good student thank you for reading that again for us yes student ,just wondering i'm still confused why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Farrah,,well that's okay let's let's take a look at your answer student so you had said that microscopes is what they would use to look really closely right but so we reread the question right so what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon they're looking for specific piece of information are specific piece of equipment i'm sorry and then we're looking for what ,he was looking for microscopes 
150.1,Oliver,,well they were looking for water on the moon right and deb you had the same answer student didn't you i think you may still be confused student right ,yeah i have that same answer 
410.2,Chris,,maybe be a little more specific with that question right so looking for a specific piece of equipment which one which piece of equipment helps them search for water okay how about you two get together and you reread the passage together and talk about your answer now student let's see let's see what you've got water on the moon craters full of water then yeah that is the text very good for finding that pulling out all the texts student I think what Chris Jazmin and Luis I think you guys you read the text and you understood the text. so all those facts are right that you class had but they're wanting a little more specific answer okay yeah ,so i went to nasa with my dad and we saw that like you know scientists use like oh suits masks like stuff like that so i was thinking maybe that was part of the answer 
110.3,Luis,,but in this specific case they didn't need any of that right they sent the lunar orbiter up well okay so those are pieces of equipment that they use it in so that is correct and it went so instead it it checked for water on the moon so maybe student and student if you class want to look over that text again together starting with paragraph one two and three i think that may help if you reread that okay now student our science expert ,yeah 
120.3,Luis,,so let's look at the question again student we read it to me one more time ,"Yeah. Um, okay, so what equipment Did scientists use discover water on the moon. "
210.2,Luis,,they're looking for quick the equipment right ,Wow. Let's see only equipment in paragraph two is the Lunar Orbiter. 
110.4,Luis,,and what does it say about the lunar orbiter right that is exactly right ,um it says that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and then it says like it'll land at the moon south pole look ice deposits so is the lunar orbiter the right answer 
530.1,Luis,,exactly student so how's your thinking changed since the very beginning ,i'm not totally sure i that i'm like looking at the paper it says that it's like the lunar orbiter is in paragraph two but i guess not totally sure why that's the answer 
530.1,Chris,,yes student ,fortunately all happy to watch but we just wanted to thank you so much for working with us in particular and really wanted to just like taking the time to help us understand the question and make sure that we were reviewing like that and then you're asking us to make sure that we really like you know like we really thought about our eater so thank you so much for working with us it was hi 
530.1,Chris,,hi ,hi the teacher said that you were going to give us some feedback on our our answers to the question 
530.1,Luis,,oh okay i think ,excuse me 
530.1,Luis,,yes ,i shouldn't be in this class because i already know all about space 
230.3,Luis,,you think that you know everything about space you don't have to learn everything more ,well i mean not like everything but i know a lot a lot a lot about space 
110.3,Luis,,okay but maybe there is something that you don't know and you would like to learn or you will be grateful after the class to learn that thing what do you think ,yeah i think yeah i think that makes sense okay yeah okay 
130.1,Oliver,,okay i read all of your answers and i think that you have very good points class but you have to think a little bit more about what is the question about for example the question is what let me see the question again ,i can read the question if you want me to 
120.2,Oliver,,okay please can you please read the question again ,what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.4,Farrah,,okay so you have to think a little bit more about these questions because it says two words that are essential for your answer and one of the words is equipment and one of the words is water so you have to think about these two words before you try to make an answer and let me read this um you said it student you said that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks but the question is not asking you about what they are using to be on the moon you have something to say savanah ,on yeah i was i was going to say that in my answer i did talk about the equipment i talked about the microscope and they use a microscope to look for the water so i have both of those so i don't know why my answers wrong 
220.1,Farrah,,your answer is not wrong your answer is right because you were talking your answer was especially talking about the equipment and you said that they need some microscope to look for water on the moon so you are right but i need to do with every one of your classmate right now to explain them why they need to look for another answer okay ,um okay 
130.1,Jazmin,,student says that nasa sent a small machine and that was right too but that was not enough for that question they sent a small machine but you have to look for a better word to answer that question ,a better word 
130.3,Jazmin,,a better word like microscope because the reading says that they need a microscope to find water on the moon ,i don't understand because it says oh what did they use to discover the water and so in paragraph two they talk all about like looking for the ice deposits and we we learned in science class that ice and water are the same thing ice is just frozen water right 
130.3,Jazmin,,mm hmm yes and the small machine i think that you wanted to say that that is small machine is a microscope right ,okay let me see 
120.1,Jazmin,,number three read again number three the paragraph number ,number three okay i'm not really sure i don't know 
120.1,Jazmin,,okay we will talk about your answer again okay student ,okay 
120.1,Chris,,let me find the reading again ,i went to nasa so i know that they use the scientists use a lot of equipments like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and lots of equipment like that 
110.3,Chris,,oh you were there ,yeah i went with my dad and we saw the rocket ships and we saw with all kinds of cool stuff 
110.3,Chris,,that is really cool maybe you should tell us about in another class about everything that you did see there ,okay okay cool yeah i can tell you all all about how the space ships take off and like how you know it's a little bit hard people think they're they're covered in like i'm like just the same kind of metal as an airplane but they have to have thermal tiles on them and that when they go like way up into the orbit you know it gets really really hot so the type of aluminum that's on the spaceship it protects it 
110.3,Chris,,wow that seems really awesome ,yeah 
120.2,All,,and student you can you please read the question again ,yeah sure the question is what equipment did scientistis use to discover water on the moon oh excuse me student i i'm sorry to interrupt i was i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you listen to everybody's ideas and what they had to say well i hope that we see you again bye 
120.2,Chris,,afternoon how are you ,hi glad to see you 
120.2,Luis,,glad to see you too again yes student ,um yeah so i was just gonna share that i already kind of know all about space i don't really even need to be in this class you know what i mean 
130.2,Jazmin,,mm hmm okay but there is always something more than we can learn what do you think student what do you feel about what student said ,um well i think yeah like he knows a lot about space and she knows a lot about stuff so student then you should just like even i mean you should just share with us what you think like your background 
120.4,Chris,,yes that would be an option to maybe student can share with us something that he knows of of the space that is not in the in reading that you have to read student what do you think about the reading was it informative for you ,well i think it was informative because i realized that there was all this water in all these craters on the moon like it sounds like there's overflowing water 
120.4,Oliver,,that was something super interesting right what do you think about the article student was it interesting for you ,well that's a great question i think what was interesting was mostly the fact that i'm like well i guess if you think it's like i thought it was interesting like the article that they talked about like you know what i mean like these different things that you eventually do on the moon and it made me think about like wanting to be like maybe i want to be an astronaut like luis's dad 
110.3,Luis,,ooh that would be awesome that would be really really great student your dad is an astronaut that's why you know a lot about space ,yeah i know all about it 
120.4,Luis,,that's good so maybe today or in another class you can share something that you have learned from your dad will you like to do that student ,um yeah like there's a few things that i should are that i've learned from like i learned that like well like you have to use all this equipment and stuff like that 
120.4,Farrah,,good awesome amazing student what do you think about the article that you learn something with the article today ,yeah i learned about how you use microscopes different ways i think that the thing i want you to the question i have is like why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Oliver,,your answer let me see okay let's talk about the questions one of my first question was what equipment did scientists used to discover water water on the moon so what's the thing that was the equipment that they use to find water on the moon student thanks for raising your hands there ,um yeah so i thought the equipment i think that the microscope i agree with student 
110.1,Farrah,,good and student ,yeah i think microscope as well and it sounds like yeah i think i and i can prove it from the reading 
110.1,Chris,,student what equipment do you think that they use okay thank you yeah that's a really good question and answer ,well okay so one thing that i noticed is i been to nasa with my dad and i love space and i noticed that the astronauts use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that you know what i mean so i was wondering if they use that for this too 
120.4,Jazmin,,maybe maybe maybe we can read another article the next class about that topic but i think that yes it's a very good topic thanks student what do you think student what equipment did they use ,i am convinced that they used the lunar orbiter and i think that that's like because that's the small machine that they set and unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go too much i just wanted to thank you for working with us so much and i think we'll see you again so thank you so much bye 
120.4,Oliver,,alright hi how are you all ,we're good we're excited to see you 
120.4,Luis,,yes i'm excited to see you to so let's talk about the reading student you want to say something to the class ,um yeah i was just gonna say that like i already know all this stuff about space so i don't think i need to even be 
120.4,Farrah,,okay but i think that we always can learn something or maybe you can share something that you know with the class so let's talk about your answers you already read the article the moon and we are going to share our answers okay so student what equipment do you think that scientists used to discover water on the moon ,oh so i think it's the microscope 
110.1,Farrah,,microscope ,yeah because you need it look really closely 
110.2,Farrah,,now what do you think that they use a microscope look really closely what do you think that they need to look things really closely very good that's a very good answer ,good question he said in the reading that paragraph three that the water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you will look straight at it so you have to use a microscope want to see it 
140.1,Farrah,,that's a very good answer thank you student have you ever seen something through a microscope ,yeah 
140.1,Farrah,,yes what thing that you see ,we plant cells in science class 
210.4,Farrah,,yes that's amazing so you really know what something microscope is something really really really small right ,yeah 
120.4,Oliver,,thank you student student what was your answer ,um so my answer was basically that i had i you know i circled the same thing as as student and i think the same thing that the microscope was was what they used to discover 
120.1,Oliver,,okay do you have something to add to farrah's answer ,i'm not sure like what would i add 
210.4,Oliver,,for example why do you think that they you a microscope ,oh well yeah i think the same reason like cuz they said it in the in the reading they were like you have to yeah like student said you have to use like a microscope to see them microscopic particles 
110.1,Jazmin,,student you want to add something good good answer thank you ,i wasn't sure like why my answer was wrong 
120.1,Jazmin,,okay so you said that nasa send a small machine and that is right but um i think that may be you can read a little bit What do you think this Jazmin? ,like what is the machine 
120.1,Jazmin,,uh huh that they used to discover water on the moon ,small machine is it's called a lunar orbiter 
120.1,Jazmin,,again please i didn't hear you ,sorry the machine is called a lunar orbiter 
120.1,Jazmin,,lunar orbiter that is the small machine okay that's right but what did they use to find actually water on the moon ,well i was wondering because when i think about it i think it you know they use the lunar orbiter and they don't really talk about like having class on board they had to use some kind of tool so i guess they could they have used it seems like they use the lunar orbiter the to find the water in your enemy and then they studied with the microscope 
110.1,Chris,,yes that's a really good answer thank you yes mean you are right student you said that scientists found craters full of water on them on linkedin that that is a good answer to the question what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon ,i don't know is it not a good answer 
210.4,Chris,,yes that is an answer but if the question says what equipment did they used to discover what water on the moon what do you think that should be a good answer to that question if you read the text again ,oh i guess like i guess i would have to say a piece of equipment right like not is that one my answer was what okay so what i was gonna say is that basically you know like i went to nasa with my dad and when we when we saw that scientists use masks and oxygen tanks and stuff and i was thinking that was missing fromt he reading 
110.2,Oliver,,yes and yes and actually they use oxygen and all the things that you say to be there in the moon to discover water so yes that's something really good to add student thank you student ,um yeah so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and thank you so much for working with us and like in particular it was really cool how you asked us to connect like our our responses to like our experiences and like share with you what we thought about them beyond just our answers and that was really cool because it helped us to both like clarify what we were kind of thinking a little bit and then also was like helping us to think about like what kind of evidence like maybe we should do so like i think class by like talking to class you asked class like you know what i mean like who should like who should talk and like you can share and that was really cool well thank you so much for that 
110.2,Chris,,okay thank you for being here ,hi 
110.2,Oliver,,hello class my name is mister a ,hi mister a hi mister a 
220.1,Luis,,so we just finished up our reading today and i'm interested to know and i think i've just got your responses back here and i wanted to kind of dive into these here i want to make sure we're all on the same page and kind of understanding that test to text to its full extent oh yes student ,excuse me um but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Luis,,you know all about space let's see so even if i remember correctly you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks ,"Um, i okay well i have to look back and see um i'm not really sure i'm come back to me because now i gotta read it and i gotta look look for "
210.2,Oliver,,"that's a okay remember it is always find to go back and look at the text that can only help you so if class else wants to take a look back feel free to do that now so while we're letting you take a look back let's dive into another response so i think the one that stands out to me the most is going to be you student i noticed that your response didn't tell me anything about what went on in the text let's get even a little more basic there so um what equipment do they talk about in this text what do we see what what's getting used let's say, you know, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on Mars. ",microscope that was that was my answer it was the same one i savannas but like it's only cuz you asked her first if you would have asked me first then maybe student would have said i have the same answer as student right yeah so it's the microscope 
110.2,Oliver,,and i see it's the microscope very good very good um are there any other equipment you noticed in there other than the microscope ,um i'm not sure um i have to read it through again okay i see something in paragraph two 
110.4,Luis,,that's right ,yeah right i see that too i see that too 
210.4,Jazmin,,very good very good i'm glad you're seeing it so let's take a look back student noticed paragraph two could have some insight for us so let's take a back and see what sort of equipment do we see mentioned specifically in paragraph two ,mister a my answer came from paragraph two but i don't understand why my answers wrong 
150.1,Jazmin,,all right all right let's then switch track let's take care of that let's see here so student you said nasa sent a small machine and that's true in fact you kind of took a took some some liberties that were there so we have to think um why might that not be hitting right where we needed to ,Well as sentences NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that this specific machine is the Lunar Orbiter. 
430.2,Jazmin,,that's very good that's very good that's very good that's very good so right both a small machine and a lunar orbiter would be correct but if i was only reading the answers to this specific question i might not have the context needed to know that so by saying lunar orbiter instead of a small machine you allow whoever read that response to know exactly what you're talking about ,oh ok ok i think i think i understand that 
120.1,Luis,,phenomenal that's good that's good i'm proud of you um so let's see student um we gave you a little bit of time did you have a chance to look back over would you like more time ,oh no i read the whole thing i was gonna say the same thing that student said like when you're asked me to look for equipment i found two pieces of equipment the lunar orbiter but also the microscope that that student was talking about 
110.2,Chris,,absolutely absolutely you class seem to be hitting a lot of this um and i think another real benefit here student you've knocked it out very well being able to read all through that and noticing both there as well as most of you here student student did very good with that and student knocked it out of the park and i think student did really well in the kind of identifying a part of it that we haven't talked too much about and that's that oh you know they found craters full of water on the moon um and that was an important part of this so very good job in identifying kind of like the main idea of the article we're reading it's just the question might have been not necessarily trying to hit there so student talk ,yeah well i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit stuff 
140.1,Chris,,that's really good well it sounds exciting did you enjoy yourself and nasa ,yeah oh yeah me and my dad we when we saw like all of these different space shuttles and all of these like different astronauts suits it was the coolest ever 
110.1,Chris,,that's wonderful student and i'm really glad to hear you had a good time there and i can tell that you've got some background knowledge just like student had there and ,yeah 
150.1,h,,and you like i said you hit a very important part of the article but we got to make sure when we're answering these questions we really read and we really try to figure out what does this question want from me so this question remember it said what equipment did scientists used to discover now they discovered the water you got that right on the nose but for this one answer wasn't quite there is because we needed to focus more on that equipment than what the equipment was finding so you kind of see where we went wrong ,um yeah you said that i was right on when i was talking about the water but i didn't talk about the equipment right 
410.2,Oliver,,i see where you're coming from by the way that you answered that and you offer a lot of insight but it's still wrong and it doesn't really tell us what the question is trying to get at we want to know about this equipment so we have to make sure we talk about the equipment specifically ,okay okay yeah i just want to say i'm sorry to interrupt but i was looking at the clock it's time for us to go to lunch i know this has been really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you really took the time to really help us look at all the different words in the question and the words and the answer and give class like some positive feedback that seemed really nice thank you 
410.2,All,,thank you for your kind words and thank you all i hope you all enjoy your lunch ,bye 
410.2,All,,good morning class ,good morning good morning 
410.2,Luis,,i'm happy to see you all here today oh yes even ,excuse me i shouldn't be on this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,good well even i'm happy to hear that you sound confident in your knowledge there and a lot of us here do have a lot of good knowledge to share so being in this class doesn't mean you don't necessarily know about it maybe you're going to be helping your classmates learn about ,how okay 
230.1,Farrah,,thank you for your help today student and hopefully we all can grow and learn a little bit from what we're going to be doing today so we should look at our responses and kind of see where we can grow and where we can improve with our understanding of the article now we got to read about something really cool and i'm really excited to get to talk to you class about it we're trying to find or rather we did find some water on the moon but sounds crazy sounds like something it's out of a sci fi novel so i first want to hear what your what your answer was and sort of how you got there so i'd like to start with student so let's hear your answer and how do you think you got to that answer ,so i said i'm you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and um i got their cars that was a piece of equipment and they were talking about looking at what 
130.2,Oliver,,absolutely very good student i like your use of detail there i think that definitely gives a lot to whoever's reading that answer to include them in i think that's very good um to kind of build off that student could you remind me of what the question was what question are we answering here ,yeah sure okay the question was whatequipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
120.4,Oliver,,absolutely very good thank you and so what was your response to this ,well i mean i had that same as student because i circled the last what she thought was the last sentence and i i circled the last sentence do you need assigned a tool called a microscope to look really closely 
420.2,Oliver,,"As a, as the teacher, you know, if you want to put yourself in my position a little bit when I see response like that. It's hard for me to know what you meant, because maybe what if I grade your paper before I grade Farrah. so if we were able to come to that same sort of answer but give more details you might be able to better inform your reader who's me the teacher ",oh yeah yeah yeah i can see that 
150.1,Farrah,,thank you so that's good that's an area we can improve and like i said i appreciate your analysis there so student what was the oh pardon me student student yes question ,yeah i still don't understand why my answers wrong 
410.2,Farrah,,"yes okay so there's definitely some room for improvement there and you gave some good information but If we're looking at the the story as a whole, we see that we're talking a lot about space and a lot about the moon, do you think your answer invoke some ideas of the moon or invokes ideas of space. ",um okay yeah cause i know we're supposed to pull something out of the story and they talk about the microscope and they talk about looking at water really closely on the moon so yeah 
210.4,Farrah,,yes yes they do they absolutely do but i think that answer might leave out some important parts of the story you give really good strong details on that very specific part but we also have the part of that getting to the moon about searching them all there we've got this whole elaborate backstory right what makes it very interesting to read ,Okay. 
120.4,Chris,,thank you for that understanding today so student i'd like to hear your response ,well i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits went to nasa 
120.4,Chris,,that's very exciting it sounds like you have some first hand experience and i'm really glad we have you in our little circle here because that's great getting some more perspective like that um so uh and i'm so sorry student i might have dismiss heard you could you repeat your response for me word for word just an i make sure i know what i'm dealing with ,oh yeah sorry i've never actually i didn't see it on so i said scientists found critters full of water on the moon 
430.2,Chris,,"Kind of letting our reader who is answer reading our sort of responses here, kind of get a better idea of what's talking about there. So in the article. Did they find a whole lot of water on the moon, or was it closer to a little bit of water. ",oh i thought it was a lot of water 
210.2,Chris,,"While there is some water there. It might not be a whole lot of might not be buckets and buckets and buckets and oceans of water. I'm glad we're able to see that. But then we also have to remember right, we're looking for equipment, we're looking for, you know, these mechanisms that help us get there because that's what the questions answering. Right. Can you remind me what the question says, ",what equipment all yeah okay what equipment scientists use to discover water on them yeah 
530.1,Oliver,,so how can we approach that question a little differently now that you've looked at it ,"i guess they used o equipment well i don't know i don't know what the what the equipment is that they use Now I'm trying to what I just looked at the clock and that's our time for us to go, so we'll have to talk to you again and see you later. "
530.1,Luis,,that sounds good thank you all for your time i appreciate you being here bye okay hello class can you hear me ,yeah okay i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
210.3,Luis,,you got it all figured out student i'm excited to hear so let's take a look right now we had your response as scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and you think you've got it out so there were some room for improvement and tell me what changes did you make ,okay so um i heard that you when you're talking to student and student and you're asking them to think about the idea of the story so i took out the oxygen tanks and i just had that scientists use a lot of equipment on the mode 
420.2,Luis,,"Um, I think that we can do even better. I think that's a great response, but I think we can make it an amazing response. So with our question we're asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. so because at the end of that right they get a little more specific right what did they use to discover i think we can be a little more specific in your response so you said oxygen tanks and yeah absolutely they're gonna use oxygen tanks there could you tell me maybe another piece of equipment that nasa used in this article to help discover water on the moon ",okay um well um i know it's not the microscope because you already told them that they were wrong so i'm the only other one that i see only in the first three paragraphs right we're only looking at the beginning part of the article 
420.2,Luis,,right i believe so ,okay um so the only other thing that i can see as the lunar orbiter 
110.4,Jazmin,,absolutely absolutely i think a lunar orbiter is really key here right they can't get any of their equipment up to the moon without that sort of orbiter right ,well i'm still confused i am yeah 
230.1,Jazmin,,that's okay student absolutely you can you could give me one moment student talk to me about why you're confused what's going on ,"the answer i mean i use i said i'm not too small machine but i'm in this class so why is my answer Yeah. Yeah, you did. "
210.3,Jazmin,,um depending on size could a lunar order maybe also be a small machine ,yeah yeah i think that fast the probably the one that i was talking about i guess ah so what i think we could do to improve is maybe make your answer be a little more specific so that way when i read it i know exactly which piece of equipment you're talking about i don't have to leave things to be ambiguous does that make sense yeah so i just i just got to add the name that i sent a small machine called lunar orbiter okay 
210.2,Luis,,that's absolutely one of the pieces of equipment that was used to send there and Include in our answer multiple pieces of the equipment we heard about microscopes and we've heard about lunar orbiters but the way they use equipment here means it could be plural it could be more than one so maybe a good response could be talking about you know including multiple ones that we read about it there a student do you think that's a good idea it talking about more than one piece ,um yeah so i felt like that's what i did i took off the oxygen tanks and so i said a lot of equipment so that it would include more than one but you said that's not i wasn't i wasn't right 
410.2,Luis,,that's right student so what we can do is you can kind of learn from student here and she can learn off of you were looking for a middle ground between the both of you you both pretty much gave me a good answer you gave me something that's right on the cusp of being just what i'm looking for in this case student was a little too vague ,"Okay, so I just got to add the names like how Jazmin did a lot of equipment like arbiters and microscopes i think i think that "
420.2,Luis,,i would say that a lot better answers the question and if we wanted to make sure it was perfect we might include how those it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon Things like the microscope. and the lunar orbiter right we could say they use the lunar orbiter to reach the moon and a microscope to find the water there specifically those kinds of things let our reader or the person that's looking at our answers know exactly what we're we mean and we're very specific when we're writing ,oh man that's like a lot of words you're saying we got to write all that down 
420.2,Chris,,a lot of words can seem tough but making sure that your reader knows exactly what you are saying can go a long way that way you don't get any confusion so they know you're just as smart as i know you are ,you know i've heard that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
210.3,Farrah,,that's incredibly exciting i would hope that that's the case and with water here that could help us in our future exploration i'm glad to see you class are listening to the topic and trying to expand on that knowledge we know that student did visit nasa we're very excited to see that um i want to see just to kind of circle back a little bit i think a student now that we've kind of talked to some other people in the class there how do you feel about your answer if you were giving it another shot at it what might you say instead ,okay um so like you told student and student that they had to have more more more details and that there's two answers so um but then like even more details about the question who okay um so i say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close on so if i was going to say ah i say you need a scientific tool called a microscope or a lunar orbiter to look really closely i'm not sure 
430.2,Farrah,,"you got a lot closer there i like the growth and i see that we're definitely getting closer there so we're starting your sort of response with you need right and i think we can kind of change how that sets up So instead of starting with something that says you you would need this to do that. You can use this to do that. Why don't we change the subject. Here, why don't we change that to be NASA, how would we rearrange that sentence if we were talking about NASA specifically well ",oh hey why would we change it to start with nasa 
420.2,Oliver,,oh so let me make sure i'm speaking yes so nasa they're the ones that sent the lunar orbiter right and they're the ones that use the microscope to look at the small small you know particles of water when we find those on the moon so we know that they're kind of the subject they're kind of who this article was talking about right and so when we're giving our response to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water right we kind of want to let our readers know that we're talking about the scientist specifically so you could say nasa or you could say scientist used if you want to do either one of those i think would convey your meeting ,okay okay that's good i think okay i'll try it out um okay scientists use a microscope ah lunar orbiter talk really closely 
150.1,Oliver,,student that was really really good we're almost exactly where we want to be we can still make a couple of improvements on the end there but we're so close now so thank you for your addition there so you started off really powerfully and then up when you end your response there you talk about a to look really close now that's true you do use a microscope to look really close but remember this article and this question are both asking about the discovery of water so maybe instead of focusing on the looking really close we can change the end of our answer to say to find or to discover water does that make sense ,class you know i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch 
150.1,Oliver,,time slips away from me thank you so much class i hope you enjoy your lunch you all gave very good responses today ,thank you but mr obama had a whole i wanted to say but i was less than i and i i really appreciate how you you help us keep thinking about the evidence from the text and and putting the details from the question and our answer i feel like that's something i can do next time ma'am it's still hard i don't i couldn't figure out how to do it but i mean i guess like i know that's what i'm supposed to do 
150.1,Oliver,,that's good i'm glad we have a direction we can move forward ,okay bye see you next time 
150.1,Unclear,,bye class all right hi class ,hi 
230.1,Farrah,,all right student you said that you use a microscope to look closely at what you found in the crater what were you looking for ,um so i was saying like that you can use a microscope to see the water 
230.2,Farrah,,right good that's what i was trying to get out of you really want to look and be specific about what you're trying to look for when you respond to something right so you just provided the i'm gonna use a microscope to look really closely so but what are you looking closely for good job though ,um well like you are looking closely for the water like the astronauts would have to use a microscope to like look at the ice crystals that make up the water 
210.3,Luis,,perfect now what was the microscope attached to ,i'm not totally sure i know i know i know i know i know 
210.3,Luis,,all right who said i can't let me pop over here all right who else all right student go for it ,alright so here's the thing so um i don't think i should be with this class because i had i always get my answers right like when i'm when i'm talking about space because i know all about space already so i don't even have to be here 
130.2,Luis,,oh well i'll see here student and i appreciate your feedback but what was the microscope attached to help student out ,well i guess i didn't really read that part because i didn't think i had to read the part cuz i already know man 
130.2,Oliver,,well i mean won't you go back and reread it and help savannnah out and student what do you think you said you circled the same answer as student so what was the microscope attached to how did they find the water in the crater ,was um was a microscope attached to like to the astronaut 
130.2,Chris,,not really but that's a good guess student what do you got ,um so i guess like i kind of know a lot about nasa and i know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and like you know like masks and suits and stuff so i don't know i think that oliver's guess is pretty good like you could look and say like the microscopes on like like what if you attached it to the hand of the spacesuit 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay i'm one of these are really good guesses but we're still missing the point student i'm calling on you what do you got ,what i said was it it was a small machine 
110.2,Jazmin,,a small machine right perfect what is that small machine called ,well i guess if i look at it like it says like the lunar orbiter right that they sent up in space 
110.4,Farrah,,that is correct you did very well it's the lunar orbiter that's how they actually examine the water and the craters yes student ,um so what i'm confused though is is my answer wrong or is jazmin's answer wrong i said the microscope and student said the lunar orbiter 
110.2,Jazmin,,that's right see you had one piece of the puzzle right you had the that's what i was talking to you earlier as you mentioned the microscope but and that's the part of that actually goes down and looks very closely but we need to figure out how they found the water in the the craters correct so you're both right so which is a good thing that's great about working in groups we all participate and contribute ,so am i like more right because i was saying about the orbiter and like student is like sort of right but you know i'm like wondering 
110.2,Jazmin,,all right well let's think about it this way student should you look very closely at the water molecules without the microscope right here where you couldn't because you wouldn't have the ability to look closely and student good couldn't get it up to the moon without yours so you're both right you just didn't have the so but good see that's a great thing about having a class collaboration we can all work together yes student yes student ,i just wanted to say unfortunately we have to go but i just wanted to say to you because i know we just met you but i wanted to thank you because you were really warm and positive with us and the thing is is like sometimes we like really drive science teacher crazy and like i feel like you were so patient with us and you've really listened to our answers and you really helped us to like hear each other's answers because we don't always pay attention to like each other so i just wanted to say thank you 
110.2,Luis,,you're very welcome and i'm glad i could help out hello class how are you ,i'm okay i'm good 
110.2,Luis,,good ,excuse me i should be on this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,that's awesome you can help me out with the other class how about that once you just chill out for a minute so hey class reason i brought you together is i was looking at your answers these questions on this text we just read and i just wanted to maybe help you out with some stuff that's okay ,i guess i'll 
120.4,Farrah,,all right so yeah so student let's start with you what was your answer to the question number one ,okay so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.1,Farrah,,and you know what that's correct statement that you wrote down you do need a microsoft skype look at something that's really small but we when we go back and look at the question what is the question actually ask us ,oh the question says what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon right so if we look at the passage we need to start comprehend here here's what and this goes to all you class right so i'm going to give you a really quick reading strategy to help you out all right 
510.1,Farrah,,"when you read something it's a three step process when you're trying to answer a question And then you go look at your question and you look at what it's really asking you, and then you've read it again. Right. So it's three steps skim it read it fast go look at the question and then you read to find the answer to that question. Does that make sense. oh yeah okay so i don't want you to try so what equipment decides this you discover water alum of you've already read it one so we're going to assume you've already a skin right does that sound good ",yeah right i did it Okay. um but i mean i got my answer right from the text do you see in paragraph three the last sentence you you that's where it got it okay i circled that 
120.2,Farrah,,okay so let's look at the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,well i don't understand why my answers wrong 
230.1,Farrah,,well let's look at what made you think of that that the microscope ,cuz cuz in science class the teachers always like okay we're going to use microscopes today let's get off the equipment and so so i know that microscopes or equipment on and then the question asks about discovering the water and in in this paragraph it says that you'd need this to look at the water so 
120.4,Farrah,,ah say that statement one more time was the last part ,oh you need this to look at the water 
210.2,Farrah,,keyword there is look in the question asked you to see what you need to look at the water ,oh oh no it is to 
210.4,Farrah,,discover the water right so it rereading the passage what would you think led the scientists to discover the water once you take a quick glance at it ,okay 
150.1,Oliver,,alright so student while she's doing that you circle the same as savannas does that help you any ,well okay so yeah cuz i i i kind of had the same thinking i said man i was like okay a scientific tool is equipment on the water okay but yeah i see what you're saying about looking it's not the same as discovering okay 
110.1,Chris,,okay all right so student what's up man how are you ,yeah i'm feeling good i know a lot about this stuff 
110.2,Chris,,what did they find these with well good i liked your answers scientists found craters full of water on the moon so they did using what they ,oh well i mean i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Chris,,right but what is the text tell you about it ,oh text 
420.2,Farrah,,yeah so remember that's what we're trying to get the information pro is what ring correct ,yeah right right okay oh okay mister mister fortune i see on there's a small machine one in paragraph to 
210.4,Oliver,,that is correct and what's the small machine called ,okay i found out to it's a lunar orbiter but it doesn't say anything about water and that paragraph 
210.4,Oliver,,"It's what NASA sent it will look at the tax. I'm going to help you read it. Okay, NASA send a small machine. So what does that just that first little bit of text tell you ",i'm a fan for machine 
210.4,Oliver,,right and what is it called ,oh the lunar orbiter 
420.1,Oliver,,right so now let's look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water so if you read the text and you read the question what words are kind of synonyms for each other ,i'm okay equipment is machine 
210.2,Jazmin,,very good so putting that together ,that equipment is machine 
420.2,Jazmin,,but you didn't you didn't actually name the machine right so maybe next time when you're doing that you could you could be more specific you said nasa sent a small machine but you could clarify your statement a little bit more right well that'd be a good strategy ,yeah yeah i can add i can add a little bit more 
420.2,Luis,,okay and student ,yeah 
130.1,Luis,,so let's look at your answer use scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they do so why don't you read that question for me again when we read the text and we read the question we need to correlate or we need to put them together to see what they're actually asking that's very knowledgeable of you point that out ,okay why equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
120.4,Luis,,okay so now let's look at your statement now once you read your statement again ,yeah i said all scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank 
210.3,Luis,,so if you look into your statement does that answer the question ,i guess 
510.1,Luis,,You the strategy I talked about ,oh oh you mean like reread it again yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean i already know the answer student student said it angers intended and deaths at it 
120.4,Luis,,okay so what is ,the lunar orbiter 
110.1,Oliver,,awesome good job that means just paying attention i appreciate it ,no problem all excuse me mr fortune arm i just looked at the clock and i'm it's time for us to lunch um but thanks for working with us we'll see you next time 
110.1,Luis,,have a good day class see ya was lunch ,it was really good we got to chocolate chip cookies i got this all figured out figured out so good now 
120.3,Luis,,okay so what what why don't you use this new strategy then and let's look at second question from the text so student wants to read the second question for us ,okay it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable 
120.3,Luis,,so ,i read the question i read the story you said read the question read the story and then 
120.1,Luis,,okay so using this strategy how would you answer that question no ,okay so i found the answer unless story um it says that water can be while it has water can be broken down into two parts but i wrote it in my own words water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and we learned that those are valuable and finance class 
120.4,Chris,,"What specifically remember post to a look at what the questions asking and what the text is Is it saying about the value of water on the moon, why is that very valuable. once you read that to go back to student student what do you think about the answer to the question is ",okay i also kind of like student i definitely feel like i knocked it out the park this time because last time you said i didn't have anything about the equipment but this one is asking about water and valuable and so i think i answered it and i got it from the story 
120.4,Chris,,also let's hear ,ok ok so here we go um water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore valuable 
210.3,Chris,,you are absolutely correct errors and you are that is very valuable when you're talking about spacecraft because it takes a lot of force to get stuff up in the air right and if you don't have the heavy water so that's going to be very valuable so what else can be valuable there it talks about in there how are you going to is that all of the information or just one part of it oh ,ok ok i guess i mean i guess since you're asking me it must be one part of it okay 
120.4,Jazmin,,all right good job that's very smart picking that up student what was your answer to this question well ,okay i'm still confused cuz i thought chris's answer was a good answer and my answer is a good answer but you're probably going to tell me that my answer is not a good answer till 
120.4,Jazmin,,well i'd say it's not a good answer i just say it might be some improvement there so student what you got okay ,yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water 
210.4,Jazmin,,and what does it say about water can be split into ,the thing that he said hydrogen and oxygen 
210.3,Jazmin,,that's right what else what other purposes does this takes point two for that answer ,oh there's more 
120.4,Oliver,,want to trap on and on and they have had you do today on this question how are you what was your answer sorry ,i mean was different from there so i don't know they said yeah but i said no i said no it's not ready yet 
230.3,Oliver,,it's not ready yet your answer isn't ready yet ,no i set up a water it's not ready yet cuz that's what i got from the story 
230.1,Oliver,,so i just wanted to clarify that so you said the water is not ready to eat to us yet is that what you're trying to say yeah and what led you that answer ,"i'll pass that says i just kind of take a long time Oh yeah okay okay um and start convincing evidence that water in a moment can be valuable. So I said no. Now, commenting evidence because it's not ready. "
210.4,Oliver,,okay and i know that's that's so but if we look on down in paragraph that's you know that's interesting way to think about that question bob what does it say that could possibly be the water can be used in ,other ways 
120.4,Farrah,,why why he's reading or student sorry well he's reading that what was your answer ,okay well i i thought that it was kind of similar to deaths where it was like not for a long time because it said making this plan will take a lot of time and money 
120.4,Luis,,right and again like he said you know that's one way to look at it but the question is actually specifically pointing toward what's the potential value does that make sense so potential that means it may it that is going to be valuable right it has the potential to be valuable so why don't you let's go back to student and student over here while you're looking at that did you class did you have any luck searching for more stuff over there ,um yeah we found some stuff okay so um i took luis's idea about the hydrogen and oxygen because it says that they could breed the oxygen and also it says oxygen hydrogen can be used as rocket fuel 
110.1,Oliver,,boom very good so ,far tomorrow 
230.3,Chris,,yeah so you have nothing i can't remember who said it but you have saving way i think it was student right ,yeah yeah i said that 
120.4,Luis,,right so it can be used for what else you just said it does know what was your answer right student what's another use ,rocket fuel all 
210.3,Oliver,,right and they have what do you know there's one more i think ,i can help help cars malls own could be stopped for spacecraft it could be a gas station 
210.3,Farrah,,very much and student there's one more yeah ,i thought class said everything 
210.3,Farrah,,right ,oh yeah yeah student student so 
210.3,Oliver,,so there's also ,with the right 
230.3,Chris,,i mean it's it would be a good answer to the question right let's look at the question again is there convincing evidence that water on the so are all these things we just talked about that have value moon could be valuable right are all of these things able to be done with water right it might be expensive and take a long time but yes so these are all the things that you should listen ,okay um you know i read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024 
110.1,Chris,,oh that is just around the corner that'd be pretty cool huh ,oh 
230.2,Chris,,where did you read that in the text ,hey oh yeah that was it 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah you know they're working on it thank you on musk is doing great things so alright class any more questions can be any other way do you understand what we're doing now that you need to specifically look at the question ,"That makes the high. Yeah, it makes sense. I think about. We all felt like we did at this time, but you're like, Hey, go back again. it's like "
510.1,Oliver,,if you want to be good at something you keep doing it over and over and over ,yeah yeah okay well thanks for helping us i do appreciate that you you had us keep going back to the question and back to that question back to the question and back to the text back to the text to find evidence 
520.1,All,,that's right and shout out thank you okay so student do you feel like you've changed your your process for working through text and questions ,okay bye 
120.2,Luis,,hi class so our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question yes student ,um yeah so i kind of know all about space already like i don't think i need to even in this 
230.2,Farrah,,okay so awesome what you have student is a lot of background knowledge which is going to help you answer the question because you have background knowledge and already understand the topic that's great so let's look back at our question it says circle the evidence in the texts that we can use to answer this question i have your responses in front of me but i'm curious to know what evidence did you circle in the tech so we're going to go around and i would like you to share with me the evidence that you used student let's start with you ,okay so basically so what i circled in the text was that the the microscope know what i mean like that the microscope was the equipment that they used to study the ice basic 
110.1,Oliver,,student what evidence did you use okay so you you focus on microscope and circle the microscope ,i pretty much use the same thing like i looked at the third paragraph and that was where i found like what i was mostly looking 
230.2,Chris,,And that's a very critical tool when we're learning together as a group that's awesome dead student what evidence did you circle ,so basically what i looked at what's up well actually i guess i didn't really circle well no i looked at the craters and they said how the craters had water 
110.1,Jazmin,,student what evidence did you circle to help you answer okay so you found that the craters are full of water so what the scientists are really looking for are the craters where the water is found right awesome ,that the first sentence or two and i was like i basically was looking at like the small and i just want like i still don't understand why my answers 
230.2,Luis,,okay and student your answer is not wrong okay you are on you are on track to find the right answer and we're going to dig deeper to get more specific with our response and i want to hear from student really quickly student what evidence did you find were you able to circle specific evidence in the text to help you ,um you know i actually was thinking about all that i knew about space and i kind of knew that you know the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that and i guess i just thought like i kind of know this though i mostly just wrote down on the side 
420.1,Luis,,"awesome so student used his background knowledge and he was able to infer based off of information that is coming from our passage that yes scientists do need lots of equipment so that's awesome student i love how student student student and student were able to look specifically in the text and that's a good skill And our question even asked us to circle evidence in the text, but even when questions don't prompt us to do that. The first thing is to always find evidence in the text. So let's look at your evidence so Farrah and Oliver looked right towards the microscope Chris looked at the craters on the moon and student was looking at paragraph two at a small machine all of these are good pieces of information from our passage What might be a key word in that question that we can use to help us answer the question, what's a key word. student ",um yeah so i'm i'm thinking from how you said it that discovery like it's a question of like how how do we discover how did we find 
110.1,Jazmin,,okay how did we discover how did we find the water student what was going to be your keyword yeah ,i basically had the same thing i said discover and like it was something that like how you know it made me like how stuff 
110.1,Farrah,,yes and survey anna ,um i actually i was thinking based on what you said i was thinking maybe it was discovered well so i'm still kind of not totally understanding but i think i'm beginning to understand that that maybe the microscope was you to to discover the world like if that's a keyword maybe it's a different piece of equipment 
230.3,Chris,,awesome so student says that maybe if our keyword and our keyword is discover maybe if our keyword is discover i'm trying to find something that helps me locate where the water is found student what did you want to add ,well i just i i kind of like okay i was thinking about out my dad took me to nasa and when we went like you know what even said like scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and i was like how could they how could they not use i was just wondering like you know what i mean 
210.2,Jazmin,,awesome student so you're also able to reference your background knowledge to help you dig deeper into this passage so i want to go back to what student was saying she was saying that maybe if the keyword is discover what equipment right equipment can name several different things okay what equipment did they use to discover the water on the moon so when i think of that word discover and when you think of the word discover what are some things that come to mind when i'm discovering something what am i doing when i first discover something what are we doing student ,you're finding it like you're you're seeing it for the for the first time 
110.1,Oliver,,awesome does class else have a different response than student okay so you all were the same so when you def ,yeah unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us um it was really cool to have you like helping us so thank you so much 
530.1,Farrah,,okay so susanna you were just telling me about our keyword discover and you were thinking about how that was changing your thinking can you go back to that ,oh well so basically like okay so at first i thought like okay you're gonna discovers you have use the microscope to see because we know that the ice is microscopic so if i figured well you'd have use a microscope to to discover but it sounds like we can i think you use the word or it sounds like we get it or that that they they use like other and it sounds also like because we don't see the feeling that you know what i mean that that the astronauts are on the lunar orbiter they must have some kind of other do you you know you know what i mean 
110.1,Luis,,yeah so let's go back to what student do you have a question ,well i was gonna remind class that my dad is actually an astronaut so that's pretty 
210.2,Jazmin,,awesome yes so and student was able to use his background knowledge to let us know and to infer from everything that tells us in our passage here that nasa and our scientists are using a lot of equipment can we all agree on that so student is realizing that maybe they didn't use the microscope tool to to first discover the water on the moon so what what might they have used to first discover i remember student said when we discover something i'm finding it i'm looking for it i am seeing it for the first time i'm able to locate it so what might the scientist have used to first initially locate that water student ,so basically nothing stops and it's not like i shouldn't do that it's the lunar orbiter that's the small 
430.2,Chris,,"yes student so earlier you asked you didn't understand why you were why your answer was wrong your answer was never wrong jazmin's original answer was that scientist or the nasa said a small machine and she pulled that from the second paragraph so if class will look back at the second paragraph in their paper with me it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so when we are discovering something we are locating it for the first time we're finding it right scientists aren't sure if there's water out there or not they are going to investigate okay so student you are right they they set that small machine and that's what they were using to discover where the water was So that means that I can't just stop at NASA sent a small machine. I need to dig a little deeper. And what else does the passage. Tell me, so it says that that small machine was called a student ",it says lunar orbit 
210.2,Chris,,so what equipment did the scientist use and send out to the moon to first discover and locate water on the moon ,the scientists use the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Chris,,just discovered yes yes now student later on they're going to use other equipment right now that they've discovered the water later on they can study deeper into the water right they want to look closely at it and that's what our passage says they tell us that if we if we want to look really closely in paragraph three we're going to need another tool called a microscope microscope so are scientists using a lot of equipment yes or no are scientists using a lot of equipment ,yeah they're using i mean they're using a bunch of 
210.4,Oliver,,yes so they are using a microscope but what is the microscope helping scientists do student ,like the microscope is helping the scientists to it's helping them study the water like after its bow right so they they use it sounds like the lunar orbiter to find it and then they they use the microscope to study the microscopic water right 
510.1,Oliver,,right that is correct so they are using the microscope to study and look deeper into the water but they first had to find the water with the equipment the small lunar orbiter and that's what our passage is about so whatever you think it's okay if your response hasn't changed it's okay if it has changed i'm just curious what you all are thinking so take a moment before our conversation i thought this and after our conversation i thought this remember when we looked at our question we found a keyword ,"A, keyword, keyword "
510.1,Farrah,,keyword to help us and to answer the question student ,so the keyword was up okay so it was like discussed right so it was equipment but it was also discussed 
420.2,Farrah,,"so so we needed to find the equipment but the key was what equipment did they used to discover because remember there's lots of equipment that is used for lots of different things so the key was what equipment did they use to discover so always locate the keyword right we had to figure out what they used to discover the water which means to thirst locate it to first find it and then later on in the passage we learned they they used other equipment to study the water deeper always find and identify a keyword so you really understand what you're looking for and go back in the text However, we also have to use specific text evidence and just like Jazmin learned I can't just stop at NASA said a small machine, right. keep reading what small machine get very specific with your answer and be sure to answer every single part of the question using evidence from the text student ",yeah so we have to go to our next class but before we go to class i really wanted to bring up like first up i really wanted to you for helping us to your meaning of the word discover like at first it was a little music i think for us but i think that we all understand now like basically what it means and why it was so and then you help this like use evidence from the text to like you know answer our question that we made sure we were looking back at what we read and then even beyond that like you really asked us to use like like how what are the key was behind you know what i mean our answer so we like i think class understands clearly 
420.2,Jazmin,,hi okay ,hi 
130.2,Farrah,,so i would like to know i would like to hear from student and why you found what you found and then why your elbow partner agrees with you ,okay well so i found the like microscope to be really important because like that's something that like the astronauts would have to look like if they wanted to see the water 
130.2,Luis,,yes ,okay so here's the thing um i don't think i should be in this class because i already know all about space there's no way that i got any of these questions wrong 
120.2,Luis,,well what was your answer to what equipment id scientists use to discover water on the moon ,well so my answer was like they had to use like oxygen tanks and spacesuits and like all the stuff that astronaut would need if they were going up in space 
230.1,Luis,,and how did you gather that information ,well i knew it already 
130.2,Farrah,,would class else like to build on his response ,oh yeah so i think that he's right about equipment but i don't think that like i don't think he was i don't think he was reading ma'am i think she was just saying stuff like that he knew like i looked at it and i said like i think it's a microscope because how could you even see the water if you couldn't see the fragment like if you didn't use a microscope you know what i mean like i don't understand why my answers wrong 
110.2,Chris,,that's a very good point you would need something to help you find what they were looking for when they were looking for the water but we are wondering what equipment did they use to find this i would like to see if student you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon and they did ,like okay so like i went to nasa like with my dad and like i like know already that like you have to use spacesuits and oxygen tanks and like kind of like what student was saying like i saw it in the exhibits like i i just already knew that that you have to use all that stuff 
230.1,Chris,,so student did you read our passage ,ah um sort of 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay student i would like you to go back when you get a chance and look back over the passage and i would like for you to underline where the scientists work and what they're using to help them find the water student i would like to hear from you ,what i said was that scientists is used a small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,and where did you find that out in the passage ,so it was in paragraph two the first sentence nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
230.1,Oliver,,she used the passage that we provided to find her answer she didn't just use her background knowledge she made sure to go back and find something in the text and student then actually student you agree with student will you tell me where you found your answer ,um yeah so basically um okay so where i found my answer was the same place that student did in paragraph three that they said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.3,Chris,,so i'm student or student are any of you ready to dig deeper and tell me another answer very good so student also is able to go back and tell me the paragraph and where he found that in the passage ,well i guess like it makes sense that like you would have to use those things but i guess i'm confused like it sounds like the answer of jazmin's is like kind of right but it sounds like student and student like i don't understand like did the astronauts who saw the water did they use a microscope 
230.1,Chris,,what do you think ,i'm um i don't know cuz i feel like they it doesn't say that there were astronauts but how could they be in space if there weren't astronauts 
130.2,Chris,,why don't student you talk with student i want to see what you two can come up with together ,okay 
230.1,Luis,,student what are you thinking ,i'm like i'm like i'm kind of thinking that like i understand i gotta look at the paragraph so i gotta see so if i look at it after i looked at it and listen to jazmin's answer like yeah i guess so lunar orbiter and i guess maybe they had astronauts or maybe they didn't but i guess yeah that's kind of what i think is that one 
130.2,Oliver,,okay student and student you did think that the scientists used a microscope to look very very closely okay student and student are looking back and they're thinking about jazmin's answer i would like for the four of you and student can jump in try and combine your answers and see what you come up with so student was looking in paragraph two they sent a small machine and student and student thought that they needed a microscope so why don't the for the five of you talk together and combine those answers yes ,so i just i just wanted to say um because we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to take a moment and thank you for coming into the classroom today and working with us like sometimes we get really are like we really frustrate our science teacher and i feel like you really took the time to listen to what we were saying and like really thought about like what our answers were and you also like really helped us to like work together because sometimes we get a little um we get a little irritable with each other so i think that it was really nice to like work together so like thank you a lot for like making that happen hi 
130.2,Chris,,hello ,hello 
130.2,Oliver,,how are you doing ,well doing well we're excited to work with you today 
230.1,Luis,,awesome okay let me see student i noticed that you answered that need a lot a oxygen tanks why do you say that ,um well okay so first off i feel like i should even be in this class like i know a lot about space and i know all this stuff like i don't have to do the reading to know that you need like oxygen tanks and all that other stuff i already know that 
120.1,Luis,,yeah that's a good point that you do need oxygen tanks whenever you're in outer space but we're talking about the different pieces of equipment that you need to be able to see what's on the moon you remember what we were talking about on the in the story about the equipment ,yeah so i guess like well do the astronauts need those tanks like when they're looking at the water on the moon 
120.2,Luis,,well they will need it to help them breathe but what is the equipment that they used to see the things on the moon ,gotcha okay that makes a lot of sense 
120.4,Farrah,,the small things on the moon was having to be looked at through a what student ,so i said microscope but i'm not quite sure like why is my answer wrong 
120.4,Farrah,,why is your answer wrong ,yeah like cuz we're all here to like work with you and like away from the class so i figured like maybe like i did something like i said like it's like i feel like my answers wrong but like i don't know why 
110.2,Farrah,,no your answer was correct it you do need the microscope in order to see things that are very very small that are smaller than what you can see with your human eyes ,oh okay great 
230.1,Oliver,,and student i noticed that you circled the same thing is what student did why did you choose that ,yeah so um i said that because on in paragraph three it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
110.2,Jazmin,,that's good that's correct yes student ,i guess my question is like so if farrah's answer is right like is my answer wrong just like the small machine like is that not like is that not the thing that like you used to discover the water like i'm confused like if my answers wrong 
210.2,Jazmin,,well your answer was correct it was that's one of the machines that they use was the rover to explore the moon's surface to be able to locate the particles of water which we would have to look at through a microscope ,okay 
210.2,Chris,,and student what was your answer again ,um so like i was saying like i went to nasa and i know like a lot about like what the scientists use and like the equipment they have to use and like i know they have to use like oxygen tanks and like masks and suits and stuff like that 
110.2,Chris,,right that's correct they wouldn't need all that in order to protect them while they're in outer space or on the moon ,so did they send the astronauts with the machine or did they just send the machine student i don't know 
110.1,Farrah,,you don't know oh that's something that we can look at together in some of our other stories whenever we start studying a little bit more on this ,okay gotcha okay that makes sense so i guess like i think that student and i are so are both of our interest correct or is one of us were correct 
110.2,Farrah,,both of you are correct on what machinery is needed to to locate and find and to be able to see the particles from the moon ,okay that makes sense 
110.2,Oliver,,yeah yes there ,um yeah so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to take a moment and just thank you i'm like you were very patient with us and like sometimes our science teacher gets a little frustrated with our class but like you're so patient and you really like listened to our answers and like tried to help us to like put our answers together and think about class else's and we don't always do that so i just wanted to thank you because that was pretty cool 
110.2,All,,thank you student i'm glad that you enjoyed the lesson with me today let's start simulation hello class ,hi 
110.2,Luis,,how are you doing ,i'm good but mr teacher excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,ok what all do you know about space let me know and that way you can help me with the rest of the class ok what do you know ,i know that astronauts have to wear spacesuits cause they can't breathe on the moon and in space and then they also wear gravity boots so that they can walk on the moon and i know that they have boosters that get them up into space and then they have to wait for a window in order to come back to earth 
140.1,Chris,,ok that is a lot of good information does class else have anything to say about that any input on what you think about space ,yes yes my dad me and my dad went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to 
140.1,Chris,,ok why would why do you think that they would need the oxygen tanks ,because they can't breathe the atmosphere on the space shuttle and on the moon isn't the same as the atmosphere here 
140.1,Jazmin,,that is right that is a good job student thank you how about student can you tell me something that you know about space that can also add in with what student and student is telling us ,well i don't know a lot about space but i know that our environment is really bad and so we might have to live on mars or something if they keep destroying our earth 
140.1,Oliver,,that is a good point because if our atmosphere which is the air that we breathe which is in the oxygen tanks that we are talking about going into space if that is messed up then we won't have any air here on earth so we would have to look for some other place to possibly live how about you student do you have anything to input ,i'm not really into space so 
140.1,Farrah,,ok well that's ok a lot of people aren't into space some people are more into the environment like student was talking about some people are into the oceans and stuff which is very interesting too to learn about how about you student do you have any input to go with the class ,well i read i read this book a wrinkle in time which is about going to different universes so they didn't go into space but they traveled through space and time 
140.1,Farrah,,ok is that what you would consider a fiction or a nonfiction story ,laughs that is pretty cool fiction but if you look back in the older books from the past a lot of stuff has come out that people thought was just science fiction and would not happen and with science we have brought it about we are able to do a lot of things like back in the 1930s is that a long time ago 
140.1,Farrah,,oh laughs yes they didn't have phones back then the cell phones like this they didn't have anything like that they had to wind on the wall gasps and there was cartoons and books about phones ,really 
140.1,Farrah,,and people thought that was just going to be that was science fiction and that was not realistic but do we have it today ,oh wow yes yes we've got lots of phones yes i don't have one but i know student does 
140.1,Chris,,right right and it used to be science fiction that we would be able to go into space which is what we've been studying about is space and going to the moon and being able to do all these different explorations like have you seen the latest results and stuff from titan the moon on saturn ,oh man no no when me and my dad went to nasa we saw about that the whole controversy about when pluto was a planet and then it wasn't a planet and then it was a planet but i didn't know anything about saturn 
140.1,Jazmin,,yes saturn has a lot of moons that are floating around it and there's actually a moon that's called titan and they think that they may have found life on it gasps well they're microscopic aliens that live in the very very cold because it's really really cold on the moon on that moon it's like 200 below zero so it's really cold there but they think that with their equipment like what they had on the moon that was that they used to find the water on the moon they think that they found some lifeforms that may have existed on titan ,huh oh wow that's pretty cool 
140.1,Luis,,yes that's pretty good stuff what do you think about that audio out you know there and outer space and stuff yes ,no i didn't know anything about the saturn stuff and the moons and like teeny-weeny aliens that's like wow i mean that is pretty cool stuff i didn't know that 
140.1,Luis,,yes yes and we'll go into more of that as we study on about outer space and the different equipment that they're using with the rockets and the satellites and stuff that they're using out there ,ok cool 
140.1,Oliver,,ok do you have anything else do you have any interest in that student about the aliens on the moon of saturn ,i mean i think aliens are kind of cool so yes i'd be down to learn about that 
110.1,Jazmin,,yes that's very good yes student ,mr lawrence but i didn't understand why my answer is wrong 
140.1,Farrah,,your answer wasn't wrong you were talking about the atmosphere which that is something that we are exploring in space to find different atmospheres that would hold life from earth which that is very good that you said ,no i meant on the story my teacher said that we all had to come and work with you in a small class because we needed more help with our answers but i told her that i think that i have the right answer oh well i thought i had the right answer too student but we're in this class i guess because our answers are wrong 
150.1,Farrah,,they're not necessarily wrong but you had a really good answer student all of you had really good answers we're just looking at the way that we are seeing our answers in different ways and what perspective that we're coming from ,oh ok so then my one about let me see what did i i know i circled a part of the story oh yes ok so i said 
110.1,Oliver,,you were talking about the microscope ,the microscope yes yes but i the teacher had us all come over here and she said class else's answers were right yes yes well i had the same one as you student so i thought that the microscope was the right answer i don't know 
210.4,Jazmin,,now the specific question was what kind of equipment they used to dig up the water or find that water with and that was the rover remember that hmm well they do use the microscope to be able to look at the microscopic things on the moon to find the water that they were digging with the equipment ,yes but that's what i said i said nasa sent a small machine and that's the one right there so what's wrong with my answer 
110.2,Chris,,There's nothing wrong with your answer. ,"oh ok well so i just had to add the name to my answer and then i'm good to go OK. But Mr. Lawrence, I had something completely different, cause I took my answer from paragraph one. So I mean, I don't know what's wrong. I don't know why I'm in this group either. You know? "
150.1,Oliver,,phone alert right well we've all been separated into a different class that way we can learn from each other and get some more perspectives on what we answered for these questions ,ok mr lawrence i just looked at the clock and it's time for the next class so we'll have to see you later 
150.1,All,,ok that would be great ,bye 
120.2,Luis,,bye and i've looked over your answers student what was your answer again and why do you think that's a good answer what's all right all right class we're moving on to question number two which is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ,ok so i said that water could be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen because remember my dad's an astronaut laughs 
210.3,Luis,,right so what would the use of being able to split the hydrogen and oxygen apart what benefit would that give the astronauts ,well i don't know i just saw it in the story and that looked like that was the important thing and i know i learned about it in science class 
210.4,Luis,,right that is an important thing so it can be separated out you can use the oxygen the astronauts could use that to breathe and they can also use that for fuel with hydrogen and the oxygen if they separate it out into the atoms they can make fuel out of it ,ok 
210.3,Luis,,so that's a good answer student you just need to go in a little bit more detail on that ok ,so i just have to write down what you said 
150.1,Luis,,in your own words you can do that ,ok i have to think about it then 
150.1,Jazmin,,ok and let me see student ,uh-huh 
110.1,Jazmin,,you said that astronauts can drink the water ,yes yes 
110.1,Jazmin,,yes ,because 
110.1,Jazmin,,that's a good answer ,we take a bath here and we drink water a lot and i was remembering what student and student were talking about and yes you need water to live and so yes that's what i was thinking yes 
230.3,Jazmin,,yes which would also go in with what student was saying about water is so heavy if they had water on the moon they could use that to drink and they wouldn't have to carry the water all over the place and save up some room for their stops what do you think about that student ,yes yes i think that's why i said that because i got that from the story and you know what else mr lawrence 
230.3,Jazmin,,what's that ,they could use the water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon too 
110.2,Jazmin,,they would have to make a what would they need in order to be able to do a really good garden on the moon there you go they could ,i guess they'd have to bring the plants with them to plant on the moon 
210.3,Jazmin,,yes they would have to do that but they would have to work on their atmosphere right ,um um 
210.4,Jazmin,,remember the atmosphere is what you breathe the oxygen and ,oh yes yes yes yes 
140.1,Jazmin,,so the moon doesn't have oxygen on it so they would have to bring in an artificial greenhouse or something like that possibly maybe ,oh yes yes right i forgot about that 
130.2,Oliver,,what do you think about that student ,i mean i guess it would be fine to grow stuff on the moon you know i guess i mean i'd probably want to have video games or something up there i think 
110.1,Farrah,,what do you think student what was your answer on that do you remember mhm yes the water on the moon can be all kinds used for all kinds of different things ,well i had said i answered no 
110.1,Farrah,,right ,cause they said in the story that it was like they need to study the moon's surface and making this plan will take a lot of time and money so it's like it would take a long time for that to happen so that's why i said no not for a long time 
110.1,Farrah,,but like i was discussing in the last session about what we thought was science fiction a long time ago like with wrinkle in time it can actually happen possibly in our lifetime to where they're able to do that ok that's a good answer it may not happen for a long time ,oh so is my answer wrong 
130.3,Farrah,,you need to go into a little bit more detail on it your answer is not wrong but it's not totally right either and actually the water would be valuable in the future ,ok 
150.1,Farrah,,ok ,ok ok 
210.3,Chris,,right now you may not see a use for water being on the moon but in the future as we continue with our space journeys and explorations then possibly water will be very very valuable on the moon ,mr lawrence 
210.3,Chris,,yes ,i was thinking about what student said and you know how water could be broken down into two parts you know like hydrogen and oxygen i was like yes so then they could breathe right and then student could have a moon garden but i don't see how they could have fuel out of that 
210.4,Chris,,well the rockets the hydrogen will break up into it breaks down and it's able to make rocket fuel which help the spacecrafts move and like in the story it's like the cars you know how you put gas in a car ,uh-huh 
210.4,Chris,,and that helps your car to go without the gas your car won't go just like the rocket fuel which is made out of different strands of the hydrogen and also some oxygen that would fill their gas tank so they can move out and go throughout space ,ok ok 
310.1,Chris,,that's a good question ,and is my answer did i get it right when i said that the water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore 
210.4,Jazmin,,the water is heavy and if there was water on the moon then they wouldn't have to carry it which would be a lot of drain on their fuel supply and it would also take up a lot of space in their spacecraft so being able to stop somewhere and pick up water is a lot better than having to carry it around with you all the time and water is heavy ,"Excuse me, Mr. Lawrence? "
210.4,Jazmin,,yes ,i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch 
210.4,Jazmin,,ok ,but i wanted to say i appreciate that you helped me understand the meanings of some of water with the hydrogen and oxygen and what will be necessary and i guess also helped me and student kind of if we put our answers together then we'd have one right answer is that right 
210.4,Luis,,i think if you added student in there too you would have a complete answer because each of you took a segment of the story different parts of the paragraphs and put it in together ,ok oh cool so yes you've got to put me in there too student 
210.4,All,,yes ,ok bye mr lawrence 
210.4,Oliver,,bye have a good day ,hi 
210.4,Farrah,,hello my name is mr teacher name how is class ,oh well we're excited to work with you 
140.1,Luis,,i'm excited for this opportunity as well how did class like the reading student do you have a question ,yeah so like here's my thing like no offense but i don't think i should be in this class like i know everything about space already so like i don't know why i should have to be here 
220.1,Luis,,well we're all in this together we are just looking at this article closely together just to see what we can take away from our just our reading and then our discussion so we're just in this all together just looking at this little reading together ,okay okay okay i'll give it a try 
120.2,Jazmin,,all right thank you student alright so our question was what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon ,yes i think it was a small machine 
230.2,Jazmin,,a small machine that is correct that a small machine did collect the water on the moon but what was the name of that small machine does class know ,i don't know where would i let's see i guess it's like the lunar orbiter is that the machine 
110.4,Farrah,,that is the machine that collected the water ,um okay so here's what's interesting like okay so i think like the microscope is something that the astronauts used to look at the water but i don't understand cuz like you you wanted us to come and work over here so i'm kind of thinking like on maybe like okay so like why is my answer not quite right 
110.2,Farrah,,your answer is so you said you think of the scientific tool is called a microscope to look really closely at it right student ,yeah yeah 
130.3,Farrah,,so student you are you are correct with the microscope alright so the lunar orbiter is just a machine that collected the water but then the the actual equipment to see the water was the microscope ,oh okay okay 
150.1,Chris,,does class else have any questions on why it is the microscope student ,i think like the thing that i think so like okay so i kind of went to nasa like my dad took me to nasa so like i kind of feel like i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like they use oxygen tanks and masks and suits but i guess like i wonder if like the astronauts were on the lunar orbiter or if it was an unmanned aircraft 
230.3,Chris,,so you're thinking it was an unmanned aircraft meaning that there was nobody on the moon but they sent just a machine correct ,yeah 
210.3,Chris,,okay so it looks if we look back on our reading it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so according to that do we think they people were actually on the moon at that time or did they just send that machine called the lunar lunar orbiter ,not sure 
210.3,Jazmin,,not sure okay student do you have anything to add to that ,okay so two things like i think like the lunar orbiter like probably like okay so if you do the reading and you look at the reading if you look like it doesn't say that like there are astronauts it just says that there's a machine it doesn't say that there are any astronauts it just says machines 
110.4,Jazmin,,so say if there isn't they said if they didn't clearly say that there was people on there i would assume as well that it would just be a machine called that lunar orbiter correct i would i would agree with that ,so i think what i'm wondering is like okay so if the lunar orbiter was this machine and it went up there did the lunar orbiter like discover something and like was it the thing that like kind of found the water um i wonder like i feel like i feel like are both student and my answer correct 
410.2,Jazmin,,i would say that you are almost there student i would say because the question is very specific meaning what a piece of equipment you said a small machine but i think it was wanting to be a little bit more specific and getting a little bit more detail from the reading about the microscope and lunar orbiter so you're on the correct track student we just need to push it a little bit more into detail ,yes we have to go to lunch we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say before we left for lunch that it was being nice just having you today and it was really nice to like talk to you and i think like one thing like sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher but you really have to listen to each other and you really asked us to like rethink our answers and you were really patient with us and sometimes our teachers aren't as patient and so i just wanted to thank you for like really just like spending the time to like listen to our answers because that was really cool 
410.2,Luis,,well i'm glad you enjoyed it good afternoon class hope you're doing okay today good good good ,yeah well excuse me i shouldn't be ms class i already know all about space 
120.4,Farrah,,well that's awesome well i just want to kind of talk to the small class just to have a little bit more extra time with you to go over a few things i'm looking at your responses for the first question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon i want to talk about that question real quick before before we go to lunch so would class like to share one of their responses for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon s student ,yeah okay so i said um let me look back at my paper i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely yes you do need a microscope to look at things that are really small now the question let's look at the question again the question says what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon now what are some keywords that kind of help us to find the answer in in the text equipment 
110.4,Oliver,,equipment i ,water and water 
210.2,Chris,,yes definitely we need to know that we're looking or what's where we find and what equipment was used to find water anything else class ,i thought i thought water was an important one too 
210.3,Jazmin,,alright so student thought the same thing as student student or student did you have any other keywords ,i said equipment and i thought i circled discovered in the question for me 
210.2,Luis,,oh yes student yes i believe equipment discover water those are all three keywords that we need to look at for this for answering this question alright so what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon so when you discover something ,well i think moons pretty important you know i mean that's where they are 
210.2,Oliver,,yes now with them what the moon right there did they when they were on the moon looking for things on the moon for sure now when you discover something have you looked at some when you discover something new does that mean you've already looked at it before ,i don't i guess no i guess not 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah so when you discover something it's the first time you see something so you're really not being able to really dive in and examine and look at it and so when we go to discover something it's it's the first time we've seen it so what was the piece of equipment that was used to find water right now on the moon we've seen water before but they people haven't seen water on the moon yet so not to look at water but to discover water on the moon if we can look back at paragraph two so take a moment look back at paragraph two student ,okay oh oh wait nevermind i just realized you said paragraph two cuz i found my answer in paragraph three 
210.4,Jazmin,,go ahead ,i found my answer in paragraph two but i don't understand why my answers wrong 
410.2,Jazmin,,student you said that nasa sent a small machine right they did send a small machine but what i'm looking for is what is also the name of that small machine ,oh lunar orbiter 
150.1,Jazmin,,yeah so though small machine was named the lunar orbiter that was the machine that discovered ice or discovered water on the moon's surface so they did use a microscope but it wasn't the item or the piece of equipment that discovered water on the moon and then on paragraph threee it says that they found the water that they found was microscopic meaning it was super small that they had to use a microscope to use it to look at it does that make sense ,yeah so i just have to add the name of it and then my answers fine 
130.3,Chris,,where you would add the name of it and then you would add what type of water or what was the size of the water of what that they found so they would add that so the answer like a complete answer that i'd be looking for would be that the lunar orbiter was a small machine that found microscopic water on the earth or on the moon ,"okay okay I, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits. "
410.1,Chris,,and for this particular reading the biggest piece of equipment that they use was that lunar orbiter that they used to discover yes they use all all of those are examples of equipment and just for this particular moment but yes student you are correct that those are all different types of equipment that astronauts use but for this particular question it was the equipment that they used to discover water ,so but ok but they don't actually say anything about water and and paragraph true they only talk about water in paragraph i mean i say they say like you can drink water um but it doesn't say that like i didn't i didn't see discover or water in that paragraph 
210.4,Oliver,,okay so with water now in paragraph two okay now what is a different form of water there's different forms of water there's a frozen form what is that called student ,oh oh yeah ice 
210.4,Chris,,yes so ice is just a different form of war it's just water in a different form it's frozen solid ,oh oh okay okay okay um so it talks about ice and it talks about the lunar orbiter but it doesn't say anything about discover and and i know we're supposed to look for the word discover and i don't see it in there 
120.3,Oliver,,okay let's look back at the text real quick now when you discover something you're correct it doesn't it doesn't say discover but in that first paragraph it says that scientists have for long time that the moon is a desert because it is it has no atmosphere like we have on earth however they used to believe there was no water on the moon student ,sorry to interrupt mr teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch so we'll have to see you again later okay 
230.3,Luis,,alrighty enjoy lunch alrighty class welcome back from lunch we're going to start with a new question all right so is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable now i noticed that student and student noticed that there is they said that there's not any evidence right and then student student and student did say that there is some evidence student what did you have to say ,i think i got this figured out so i'm all good 
210.2,Luis,,okay now with this question it's a new question so is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable now there are some keywords in this question ,"Okay, I think that it was evidence "
110.1,Chris,,Evidence. So what so evidences one. ,i said water again this time because i think that's what the whole thing is about 
230.2,Chris,,yes so that's our topic is water for sure okay now student what was one piece of evidence that you thought about this that some evidence that said water could be valuable ,yeah so um info which paragraph was it okay yeah in the first one because it's the whole the title is water is a valuable resource right so i said the thing about water is heavy so it's it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore 
310.1,Luis,,yes right so if we look back you were us used an example from the text from paragraph five all right or excuse me paragraph four and it was saying that since water so heavy it would take up a lot of space and then if we didn't have to bring it it would save some space so way to use that evidence there for for a reason for water being valuable to us all right now student what did you say about what student go ahead ,wait yeah so a my answers is good but i don't understand why i gotta be in this class because i did that i did everything right right 
150.1,Jazmin,,yes you did a great job on that we are just wanting to i'm just pulling people together just trying to get different ideas because there's difference of opinions on this question so we're just trying to get a sample size of different answers ,okay yes still can yeah i'm still confused 
230.1,Jazmin,,what are you confused about student ,well because if if he got the right answer then i thought that i had the right answer 
310.1,Jazmin,,well there can be multiple and there are multiple answers for a question can't there it's this is kind of there's multiple reasons or multiple arguments or convincing evidence that you could use to say why water is valuable so student just listed one there's a couple more in there and what in your said that astronauts can drink water and stay hydrated you can't survive with water alone right yeah and so if you look back you found your answer in paragraph four and it says for example future future astronauts could drink this water right so we know as people on earth we have to have water to live and so if they have water on the moon they don't have to worry about bringing that water and so they could just drink the water on the moon and they can stay hydrated so yes that's another great example of convincing evidence ,wait i have to i have to write down all the other stuff that you just said 
420.2,Jazmin,,we just need to add on to it that because you can drink water no ma'am you can keep your answer the same and waters on the moon that's convincing evidence that it is valuable so we just have to rework your answer ,okay i have to add something about convincing evidence you can't survive without water that is convincing evidence okay is that good 
230.2,Luis,,yes ma'am okay student said you said that water can be split into parts hydrogen and oxygen right yep and that can be water can be split in those two different elements all right now student where did you find that in the text ,oh there it is there it is okay your paragraph five in my second sentence yeah 
210.4,Oliver,,second sentence that is correct right so water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen now that is important but what's the reason why they would want to break down what was the reason why they wanted to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen what could they use hydrogen and oxygen for ,well i read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024 
210.3,Luis,,yes there could be and that would be great for for another reason but let's look back at if we have people on base don't they need oxygen to breathe ,yeah yeah okay so then that's so okay so then that's my answer so that they can breathe 
210.3,Luis,,so they would use the oxygen breathing now what about the hydrogen part of it why would the hydrogen be useful for ,look back at paragraph i don't know 
210.4,Luis,,look at paragraph five ,oh rocket fuel rocket fuel 
210.4,Luis,,we could use that have they split that water and they use that hydrogen oxygen for rocket fuel and that's how they could get to the moon and they can leave from the moon right so that's another reason why water could be such a valuable commodity teacher student ,teacher i gotta write down i gotta write down all of that stuff that you just said that's a long answer man 
420.2,Luis,,it's a long answer but what we can do for your answer is just that we can add that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen because it allows people to breathe and you can make rocket fuel with it ,How come. How come I have to add all of that and Chris Chris and Jazmin didn't have to add all that to their answers. 
210.3,Farrah,,you found another good piece of evidence because we chose to do a different piece of evidence and so your piece of evidence was just a little bit bigger and so you just have to add on a little bit little bit more than them student and student have your answers changed at all after discussing chris's jazmin's and luis's ,oh i mean i can see i can see where they're coming from but i still think that i was right i said not for a long time you know 
210.3,Farrah,,what what can you go into a little bit more detail for that ,i'm here yeah they're not gonna be able to have water for like a long time so so the answer's no 
230.3,Farrah,,okay so since you said and with no so that means there's is there small amounts of water on the moon as what we believe ,okay yeah yeah cuz we read that in the first part it says they're small amounts yeah 
210.3,Farrah,,yeah and so since they're small amounts are we going to be able to use it as use it like the amount of water that we use on earth ,nope 
420.2,Oliver,,"nope because we've got a lot more of it But you just need to add a little bit more to it, just so that way, we have an idea. ","Teacher, it that looks like our time for the next group took out, but I know I heard you're telling everybody that they have to add more details to their answer so i'm sure that's what you were going to tell me too is that we have to have more more evidence from the text and our answers "
420.2,Oliver,,yes sir not used to that was the common thing ,okay well we'll see you next time 
420.2,Oliver,,i yes all right hi boys and girls how is class ,we're doing great we're really happy to see you 
420.2,Luis,,good i'm happy to see you class too so i pulled us all back here yes mr student ,i don't think i need to be in this class you know cuz i already know like all about space you know so i don't need any help 
220.1,Luis,,okay so what i wanted to pull us back here about is because even though we might have a lot of information that we've learned in other places about space we were reading a text specifically on a mission and finding water on the moon correct and our question was what equipment was used to find that water now mr student a lot of us found different types of equipment or we used background knowledge but that's not exactly what the question was asking us to do okay so can we look at deeper into that question is that okay yeah ,that's that sounds great 
210.4,Jazmin,,perfect okay so i want to start by us all looking over at question paragraph two okay so let's look at paragraph two in our passage paragraph two i'm going to read and i want you to follow along it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater ok now i'm going to stop there can class tell me if they heard something in the two sentences we just read that sounds like it might answer the question what equipment was used go ahead miss student ,basically it was this small machine i think that's how they found the water 
310.1,Jazmin,,what i'm concerned about is we're not getting the whole picture there okay so can we look where it says small machine and figure out what that small machine was called good i see where you're going with that ,that makes sense okay i didn't really answer the question so lunar orbiter 
110.4,Farrah,,good job student thank you so much miss student ,um yeah i wondering like i think i'm still confused like why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Farrah,,okay so can you tell me your answer again ,oh yes so basically my answer was just that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.1,Farrah,,okay and i want to ask you do you know what we use a microscope for ,i'm like you know you use it to like look at small things like in science we look at like bacteria and stuff like that 
230.2,Farrah,,good okay and where did you find in the text that it talked about microscope ,um let's see it was i think it was in paragraph three 
110.4,Farrah,,words in paragraph three can i yeah ,oh sorry 
210.4,Farrah,,that's okay could i read to you the sentence that i'm thinking and you tell me if that's where you found your answer okay so what i'm seeing is that in paragraph three the second sentence starts out by saying is that where you found your answer the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ,yeah right there 
210.3,Farrah,,good okay so you did you found a piece of equipment you found a tool that was used but did it say that this microscope was used to find the water to begin with was this the first machine that they use to find the water ,well i guess i'm guessing not do you have any ideas for how i can find like or like you know what i mean like how i could tell the difference because it seems like they would have to look through the microscope to see the water how could they find it if they couldn't see it 
120.3,Farrah,,so that's a very good question and what i'm going to ask you is have you considered to look back a little bit further before the microscope so if we look at paragraph two i just want you you can read it to yourself or you can read it out loud could you read the first sentence of paragraph to to me ,that's just a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Farrah,,perfect okay and now i'll read the second sentence to you after you tell me what did nasa send to investigate can you tell me what that was called ,yeah a lunar orbiter 
210.4,Chris,,good a lunar orbiter and it said that that was a small machine so now i'm going to read the next sentence it says that this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater okay so i know that the scientists back in paragraph one they found out that there was water on the moon because they had craters that had ice in them but how did they find out that the craters had ice in them do you remember how that happened we just read a little part of it go ahead mr student ,um yeah so like um well i went to nasa and and i saw like exhibit so i was thinking that you know they would have to use oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that 
410.2,Chris,,okay and they do use that and nasa and that is a good point but i have a question mr student did you consider that those machines were not mentioned in our text ,oh okay oh yeah okay okay 
430.2,Chris,,but we have to look at the tools that are inside of the text because every time we have a story that we're reading and questions about it our answers are always going to be in that passage okay so even though we might have prior knowledge which is what you have because she went to nasa that's amazing and that's awesome to bring to the table but i want you to try to find the answer in the text okay ,gotcha okay that makes sense 
150.1,Oliver,,okay and student i just wanted to touch back with you and student i know you had the same answer is student are you class feeling a little bit more comfortable with going back further into the text mr student ,um yeah i think that we are getting more comfortable unfortunately we have to go to lunch but thank you so much for working with us 
230.1,Oliver,,perfect thank you class okay so class has just given their answers to our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon i see a lot of good thinking and student i really loved how you dug in the text and student it looks like you dug in the text to you're saying that you said the same thing as student you circled the same thing can you tell me a little bit more about how you got to that conclusion ,um yeah so basically like i circled the same thing like in the paragraph three where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
110.2,Luis,,good good job all right student you have a question ,um yeah i guess this is kind of a question um so here's the thing like i know all about space like i don't think i should be in this class because i don't really get answers about space like wrong and like i know like everything there is to know about space so i don't think i have to do any work on it 
210.4,Luis,,okay mister student and that's a good point i'm glad you know a lot about space however when we're given a text we do have to look at what it talks about in the text i know that you answered saying that they used equipment like oxygen tanks but that was not mentioned in the text About oxygen tanks. So can you find maybe another type of equipment that they might have used to help find water on the moon. ,so i gotta find something that's in the text like not like from my own like memory like i gotta read the text 
120.1,Luis,,absolutely you always have to dig into that text and just pretend like you don't know anything else at that point you've just got to find it in there when you find something in the text could you let me know perfect ,yeah definitely 
130.2,Chris,,okay all right student i know that you were talking about a small machine which is what equipment is right yeah what did you say student do you think that equipment might possibly be a small machine as well ,um yeah i think it could be um i just feel like also like for me like i went to nasa and i know that scientists have to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to go into space 
120.1,Chris,,they do and they have to have that stuff to keep them alive and well while they're out there that's a very good point but just like we were telling mr student we have to find it in the text so what's a piece of equipment that's inside the text that they might have been able to use can you look for that for me ,yeah i can i can take a look 
120.1,Farrah,,perfect yes miss student ,oh yeah okay so here's what i was wondering um so i said that the the microscope was how they studied the water but i don't understand like why my answer is why my answers kind of wrong 
210.3,Farrah,,hmm why do you think your answer is wrong ,like i'm thinking about like who cuz you know how we're all here together like to to like better find our answers and our thinking so like i think the microscope like they definitely used it and i think that's how they discovered it but maybe my answers wrong 
230.2,Jazmin,,well let's take a look i want you class to look i know a lot of you that found your answer for microscope found it in paragraph three and i'm going to read that to you real quick okay it says that that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it even if you're looking straight at it Did they go up there with their oxygen tanks and a microscope to see if it was on there. That's not what it says. why don't we back up let's back up a little bit more to paragraph two okay so i want class to just look at paragraph two and i want you to read along with me okay it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small ok so that's paragraph two does it talk about a piece of equipment that they used class want to raise their hand does it talk about one miss student ,i think what's interesting is that it was kind of like my answer but there was like there was more to my answer so i said they sent a small machin but the small machine is the lunar orbiter so that's how i think they discovered the water 
130.2,Jazmin,,that is absolutely correct good job student okay i want you class to give me can you give me a thumbs up if you agree a thumbs in the middle if you're not quite sure or thumbs down if you disagree with student can you class do that ,well we can't quiet do the thumbs but we could do raised hands if we agree and then no raise hands if we disagree is that okay 
110.4,Jazmin,,that would work perfect okay so student agrees student and student agree student agrees good job class all right you can put your hands down Yeah. yes student ,we have to go to lunch we have to go to lunch but i just i just wanted to take a minute to thank you for working with us like like sometimes our science teacher gets kind of frustrated with us but you were so patient and you really like helped us understand like the difference between like discovering something and the difference between like studying it and also like i feel like student and student like they it seems like they understand better like that you have to really use the text you can't just use like information from your life you have to study the text so i just wanted to thank you cuz it was really clear and it was really interesting to hear other people's answers so thank you so much 
110.4,Luis,,thank you student you class were wonderful start simulation hey class all right so let's talk about yes student ,um yeah i think like i need to be in this class because i already corrected my answer 
120.4,Luis,,okay student what did you create your answer to ,um so basically what i was saying was that scientists found ice using a small machine 
130.2,Farrah,,okay so the class get a different answer for student did class get a different answer from student um student what did student what do you get ,yeah i actually did get a different answer because i was still kind of thinking that it was the microscope i feel like you know like that was really the equipment that they use to find the water okay so you know initially that's what i thought too but then i revise my answer to scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of water in craters on the moon 
230.1,Farrah,,student how did you get to that answer ,that's a really interesting question like i got to the answer partially by listening carefully to student and her answer and to our discussions together but really think that i got to the answer by reading the text more close because i think that i missunderstood the question because they didn't use the microscope to find the water they used the microscope like afterwards to study the water but it was the lunar orbiter that really found the water 
150.1,Farrah,,student and student does that help clarify that question ,um yeah i think that that makes sense because yeah okay that actually makes a lot of sense so like student you're saying that like basically like that you know if you use like a microscope to see the water after you find it you have to find it first is that right yeah 
150.1,Chris,,so student yes student ,oh um i actually didn't mean to raise my hand up sorry 
150.1,Jazmin,,okay what about you student ,and i just wanted to say that i changed my answer 
230.1,Jazmin,,what did you change your answer to student ,basicallt my answer was incomplete and i was just saying small machine instead of like that it was the lunar orbiter you know what i mean 
530.1,Jazmin,,and how did you find that instead of small machine it was the lunar orbiter what did you do to make that change ,yeah that's a really good question i sort of thought about it first i looked more closely at the text that was thinking why was my answer wrong at first and i was trying to figure it out and basically you know if if the lunar orbiter was the small machine so i kind of had the answer but i just i just wasn't complete in what i was saying 
120.4,Chris,,i think what we all need to take away is that when we're answering reading comprehension questions we really need to focus on going back and reading the article in detail and maybe highlighting the text or annotating the text so that we can really understand in detail what we're learning and why we're learning it okay um what other questions do you have student ,i guess like i went to nasa and so i i know that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and suit and i guess i'm wondering like why that wasn't right 
420.3,Chris,,student why don't you go back and look at the text and maybe reread it and highlight some keywords or helpful passages then see if you can come to that answer yourself ,okay i'll take a look 
420.3,Oliver,,yes student ,unfortunately we have to go to lunch but um i think we'll see you again soon 
420.3,Chris,,hello ,hi how are you 
420.3,Luis,,i'm good how are you ,doing well 
420.3,Luis,,it's good so i have student student student student and student yes student you have a question ,um yeah so here's what i was thinking um i know all about space so like i don't think i have to be in this class because i feel like i know everything there is to know already 
110.1,Luis,,oh really ,yeah 
120.2,Luis,,okay so why do you what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon student ,um so i think that the what they used was oxygen tanks and um space suits and all that kind of stuff because otherwise they wouldn't be able to be on the moon and like run around 
230.2,Luis,,"Well, that, that's correct. They have to have certain equipment to get to the moon. but how did they discover water on the moon was there any other equipment that you think they used to discover water by could you look back on the text and think about what they actually use to discovered water on the moon ",i didn't really read it so i can read it i guess 
120.3,Luis,,so why don't you take two minutes and read over the passage and tell me what you think that scientists used to discover water on the moon ,okay i'll do that 
150.1,Farrah,,does class else have any questions yes student ,okay so here's my main question i'm trying to understand like why my answer is wrong 
410.2,Farrah,,okay student so um your answer is about how the kind of water that they found was microscopic but it doesn't really say how they got the water ,yes so like so okay so the question was like how did scientists discover water on the moon and like so they use a microscope for like something for like to like study the water 
410.1,Farrah,,yes so the water they found you would use a microscope to study it but it doesn't explain how they found the water ,oh ok ok gotcha 
150.1,Jazmin,,okay thank you student for your question any other questions ,student do you know how scientists discovered water on the moon basically the scientists used a small machine 
230.2,Jazmin,,you know what the small machine was called ,i can look it up 
230.2,Jazmin,,yeah why don't you do that student ,it's paragraph two it says nasa small machine called lunar orbiter to investigate lunar orbiter 
130.2,Chris,,very good student does class else agree with her answer or class else find anything different yes student yes student ,yeah so i think like i kind of disagree like i went to nasa with my dad and we like looked at like the stuff that they use to like fly around and i feel like the scientists like would have to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits like when they're out in like the space like they'd have to you know use all that stuff so i'm still confused like why luis's answer was incorrect 
150.1,Chris,,but what this article is talking about is how they discovered water on the moon and i use a lunar orbiter to find water on the moon okay luis's answer was about how they got to the moon okay so astronaut have to have things to fly around and have oxygen in order to get to the moon that is correct but the lunar orbiter it's what they use to find water on the moon what student and student described is how they got to the moon and not what they used to discover water on the moon that make better sense ,yeah i think that's a little clearer 
150.1,Oliver,,is anything else i can do to clear this up for you class ,um i guess like what i was wondering like um okay so like a small machine well okay so i think that i'm beginning to understand but can you help me understand just like super clearly like how the ok so the microscopes like not quite the right answer and i got the same answer as student so it sounds like the answer is the lunar orbiter but i just wanted to understand like why the lunar orbiter is the right answer and the microscope's not quite the right answer 
150.1,Oliver,,okay was that student speaking ,yeah 
130.3,Oliver,,okay so a microscopic okay so the lunar orbiter is what you use to discover the water that's how you got to know that there's water on it and then the microscope is what she needs to study the water because it's so small that you need to microscope did this study yet but the lunar orbiter is how you discover the water ,so they use the lunar orbiter to like discover it and then microscope to like study it 
110.1,Jazmin,,yes yes that is correct yes student yes student ,unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to take a moment i just wanted to thank you 
110.1,Jazmin,,hold on turns off ringing phone ,sure 
110.1,Jazmin,,okay what were you saying student ,i just wanted to take a moment and thank you like sometimes our science teacher gets frustrated with us but you were so patient in listening to like what we had to say and then also like you like took our answers and you like kind of helped us to understand each other's answers and like understand better like kind of about the text but like by helping us listened to each other and sometimes we get kind of like in fights with each other but this was really easy for us to listen so just to like thank you for your patience and like helping us to listen to each other 
110.1,Oliver,,no problem at all ,hi 
110.1,Chris,,good morning how's class doing today ,we're doing good thank you 
110.1,Luis,,yes student ,um yes so here's the thing um i don't think i should be in this class because like i already know like all this stuff about space and i don't really need to be here for help 
110.3,Luis,,and that's okay maybe you can help me help someone else later let's wait off on that okay ,okay 
230.3,Luis,,let's see here student you mentioned a scientist like to use a lot of equipment yes ,yeah 
230.1,Luis,,all right you mentioned oxygen tanks why did you mention oxygen tank ,um so the reason that i mentioned it was because i know that like astronauts have to use oxygen tanks when they're going up into space and they have to use like stuff like that in order to walk around 
230.2,Luis,,all right what what part of this text that you read gave you the impression that they had to use them ,"well i guess i didn't really look at the text because i already knew this Maybe there's something in there because I didn't, I didn't really read because I thought I already knew. Okay. "
230.3,Farrah,,all right student you mentioned a thing called a microscope and it does something to look really closely ,yeah 
230.1,Farrah,,okay what does a microscope look for how do you use it ,well like you use it to like study something and like look at something really closely you know what i mean like you you look at it like like small things 
230.1,Farrah,,oh well what exactly does the microscope do to help you look at small thing ,um so i think if i remember it's like you um okay so in the text is said that um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so like i guess it helps you look at small things 
310.1,Farrah,,you're you're correct and i'm glad that you referenced the text because that was awesome and correct thank you student ,awesome but i have one question um like why is my it's because we're all here to like work on it together like what why is my answer not quite right 
230.2,Farrah,,well your answer says they use a microscope to look really closely but what are they looking closely at what can they use it to focus on like are they looking at something really small or really big yes student ,so i guess they're looking at like something really small they're looking at the water they're studying the water 
110.1,Oliver,,there you go there's something small that they're looking at is the water good job student you had your hand raised ,yeah i was gonna say basically the same thing like you can look closely at the water 
230.1,Oliver,,all right is there anything else that they could look closely at besides the water with a microscope ,um well like i don't know like what if like it's not really in the reading but like you could look at germs and stuff 
230.2,Oliver,,you could but what is something on the moon that they could look at on the moon they said the moon is a desert what else could they look at if they say desert ,ah they could look at like the sand and like the dirt 
110.1,Jazmin,,i think you're correct absolutely great job all right student oh i'm sorry student you have a question ,yes so i'm just so i guess my question is like so whose answer is like i thought that it was a small machine and i'm trying to understand like why is my answer not right 
230.2,Jazmin,,well i didn't say your answer was wrong it is technically correct they did send a small machine but what kind of small machine did they send can you tell me that student ,yeah well i guess i guess in the reading i guess i can look and see ok ok ok i see it so in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate is it the lunar orbiter 
310.1,Chris,,it is the lunar orbiter great job looking back at the text thank you for that student yes sir ,um you know so like here's the thing like um like okay so i guess i don't understand still like because you have to like luis's answer like i went to nasa so like i know that you have to use a space soon if you're gonna go like walk around and study something so i'm trying to understand like why is my answer not quite right 
230.1,Chris,,well can you tell me where they found the water on the moon ,oh they found it in the craters that were full of water 
230.1,Chris,,did they find it in the crater ,i thought that um i thought that's what they said 
210.4,Chris,,oh well let's look at the first paragraph if you could read that for me ,um yeah okay um scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on earth however they used to believe there was no water on the moon now they know this is not true scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines 
210.4,Chris,,correct now did it say the craters where full of water or was the water below the crater ,oh so like there wasn't much water like there was only some water because you had to look at it through the microscope 
130.3,Chris,,not exactly they didn't really use a microscope to find the water the water was located underneath the ground ,so how did they find the water 
110.1,Jazmin,,oh that is a great question i think that is something we could both look at for the next time we have class how did they find the water under the moon it's craters yes student ,so we have to go to lunch but before we went i just wanted to take a moment and thank you for working with us today like sometimes like we really upset like the science teacher because he gets a little frustrated with us but you were so patient and you really like helped us to feel like we were part of like like a class like like that we weren't just wrong like that we had like some learning to do that we could do together and so like it was really nice that you are just so supportive of each of us as we try to learn about it so thank you so much 
110.2,Luis,,thank you student and absolutely none of you were wrong you were all correct to an extent thank you for being here go on to lunch yes student ,um yeah i was just gonna say like i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know all about space 
430.3,Chris,,well i'm glad you know all about space but we're looking for specific information from the text that we have and the first one i went like talk to his student with your question i like that you focused on the the craters in the moon but i'm a little concerned that you think they're full of water can you go back and look in section two or paragraph two of the text and try to find a quantity of ice or water inside that paragraph ,yeah oh i'm 32 ounces and 4 glasses 
210.4,Chris,,you're correct four glasses of water is that a lot of water on the moon ,no that's that's um that's not very much at all 
210.4,Chris,,it's not very much at all do you think that could fill up a crater ,i guess not so the craters aren't full at all 
230.3,Farrah,,no they're not they're not full at all there's such a tiny amount of water that it's almost you have to have a special tool to see it and that special tool is what student mentioned student you mentioned that you they use a scientific tool called a microscope yes ,yeah that was people used to find it 
430.3,Farrah,,well that's where i'm concerned a microscope is used to look at objects not really to find them do you think you can look in paragraph two and find the name of the machine that's used to find the water ,yeah let me see i see well is it the is it the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Farrah,,you're right it is the lunar lunar orbiter they use that to find the water on the moon and did they find a lot of water or a little water ,no he just found a little water is that was what student found but i think i'm still a little confused just like why my answers not correct so like it seems like they found you know what i mean like yeah they use the orbiter but didn't they use the microscope because they could see it without the without the microscope right 
130.3,Farrah,,well scientists weren't on the moon to look at the water by themselves so they didn't need the microscope they had the machine the lunar orbiter investigating the ground for that water ,that's interesting so they didn't use the micrsoscope to find it they were using my something else on the lunar orbiter like a sensor or something like that 
110.4,Farrah,,oh absolutely that's how they would find it ,okay yeah okay yeah that makes sense so did they use the microscope i'm like it sounds like they used it so i guess did they say they had to do something else before they used the microscope 
210.3,Oliver,,correct they had to use something else to find it before they could use or identify the water with a microscope because it was such a small amount of water now student you have the same answer as student did you follow along with what we just went with ,um yeah i followed along so i think like okay so the lunar orbiter was the thing that discovered the water um and then like they use the microscope to study it after they found it 
310.1,Chris,,yes they could use the microscope after they found it to study it that's very good deduction there i like what you did there student let's turn to student oh yes student what is your question ,um well i was just thinking so my dad took me to nasa and like when we were there like i know that but we saw that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like i was thinking like did they not use those things as oh 
130.3,Chris,,well i'm glad you brought that up well in our story in the moon is a desert it doesn't mention that the astronauts themselves were on the moon so they wouldn't have the need to include that equipment in our story today ,okay yeah okay so they weren't actually there so they didn't need to use masks and suits and stuff like that student like that's the thing to remember like they didn't do that is that right 
410.3,Luis,,correct they sent that small machine the equipment the lunar orbiter to investigate the moon and with that student let's look at student student you mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks but like we just talked about with student that oxygen tanks weren't exactly in our story so i'm concerned why you're talking about things not in our story ,yeah i was using up like you know how we talked about in class sometimes like background knowledge so i was using background knowledge and i was thinking like um you know like that was like probably enough to answer that question but i was thinking like i guess i was wondering like even though it wasn't in the story like why should i not use background knowledge this time 
130.3,Luis,,well for the question it's asking exactly what they used to discover water on the moon and they didn't use oxygen tanks although they do use them they did not use them to find the water on the moon ,gotcha oh ok so they did like okay that makes sense so it's really like what was in there reading so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with 
130.3,Luis,,welcome back class yes sir student ,um yeah so i was just gonna say i think i got everything figured out so i think i'm all that 
420.2,Luis,,all right well then if you think you're good let's look at your response first let's see our water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that is very true but i'm concerned that you're not giving me a reason to as why it could be valuable on the moon is there a place in the text that that mentions what hydrogen and oxygen can be used for ,me see yeah so you can use them for rocket fuel 
210.4,Luis,,you can use them for rocket fuel can do you can use both of them ,i'm like you could use like them mixed together and you can also read the oxygen and you can drink the water 
210.4,Jazmin,,"Speaking of drinking water, Jazmin, you mentioned astronauts can drink water and stay hydrated and you can't survive without it. That is true. but how much water is on the moon ",you're talking about i remember that it wasn't actually a lot so i'm actually still kind of confused because it sounded like it sounded like there was it very much why is there enough water for astronauts 
210.4,Jazmin,,there probably isn't enough in the drink on the moon but what do you think they can do to get more water on to the moon ,take it with them 
210.4,Jazmin,,they could take it with them take it with them on a what ,on a spaceship 
210.4,Jazmin,,on a spaceship would that increase the value of water on the moon if they brought it with them ,we get i think it would be like yes it would be more valuable if it was on the moon like already and then they could just build their even and they could see it right there 
230.3,Chris,,absolutely i think that that would be a more valuable deduction if they already had it or put more on the moon good job there student i'm uh but student you mentioned that water is heavy what it but you yeah but you say they wouldn't have to carry it on ships anymore ,yeah i'm i think what they were saying is that they were saying that like you could you know you could basically not have to take the water or you could just get it from the moon 
410.3,Chris,,well like we just talked about with student there's not a lot of water on the moon so i'm a little concerned that you're saying that astronauts don't need to take it on their ships anymore do you think they may still need to take some water with them ,yeah i guess so if there's like if there's not very much because we said that like there were only a few ounces right glasses on and so like it actually wouldn't be enough to you know what i mean do everything but i think it would be really valuable because water is so heavy but that doesn't make sense yet so they they still yeah they would still have to carry some on the ship 
210.4,Chris,,exactly and in paragraph one what does it say that the future astronauts could do ,they could drink the water 
230.1,Oliver,,that's right they could drink the water in the future teacher so with it being in the future student and student you mentioned that it's not ready and no not for a long time why do you think student and student that it's not valuable yet ,um so i think that's not valuable yet because it seems like it would be really complicated to actually get the water to a place where you're like all all yeah i can use us really easily like i read somewhere that they weren't going to maybe put a moon base up on the moon in 2024 and i was thinking like they they wouldn't like they don't really have figured out it seems like like they need to come up with a plan to get the water out of the moon like they said in the read 
310.1,Oliver,,you can find that in paragraph six exactly that's great use of your background knowledge about that space station that they're planning to build ,lots of time and money so that seems like like it seems like you know we don't spend like very much money on like space travel like that's something that i know from my reading so it seems like it would be kind of i'm like it seems like it would be kind of hard to like make this work because it seems like a really expensive 
110.4,Oliver,,oh absolutely would be expensive yes student ,um so unfortunately unfortunately we we have to go to our next class but before we go i really wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for like explain to us what we all needed to work on like offering like the concerns that you had and you are so kind about the way offer them that i think we offer really okay with like hearing about concerns like i don't think class took it personally you know what i mean and i think like class like really learned something from being able to listen to each other so you really also give a suggestion on like how we should do so it was really fun working with thank you so much hi 
110.4,Chris,,hi how are you all ,we're doing okay 
120.2,Luis,,good has class had a chance to answer their question what equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon yes student ,um yeah okay so here's what i was just needed to say is i don't think i should be in this class like i don't like i know all about space already so like i don't think i need to be here 
110.1,Luis,,well that's aweseome so maybe you can help us teach the others since you know ,okay yeah 
120.2,Farrah,,awesome thank you so who's ready to tell me what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon student are you ready ,yeah okay yeah yeah so um i said that the the scientists that they okay if i look at the text it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i think it was a microscope but i'm not sure like why my answers not right 
110.1,Oliver,,let's go and see what someone else said before we get back and talk about whose answer is correct student do you want to give your answer ,um yeah so i pretty much said the same thing as student and i circled the same area like in paragraph three that the um the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so like i think you have to use a microscope to discover the water 
110.1,Chris,,right okay student do you have a different answer ,yeah so like for me like i kind of just like i went to nasa so like i i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so like i know that they have to use all that stuff and like the craters are so full of water on the moon that like i guess it's pretty easy to find 
110.1,Jazmin,,okay student what do you think ,that okay so i think that it's this small machine 
230.2,Jazmin,,okay and what was a small machine called ,nasa send this machine called lunar orbiter to investigate so lunar orbiter 
210.4,Luis,,student do you want to add to this discussion okay that is the name of the small machine okay let's not stray too far and understand that you know a lot of this information but we want to find the answer here in the paragraph that you read as i'm going back and looking in and it says that the water they found is microscopic which means you you can't see it with your naked eye so you would need exactly what student and student said you would need a microscope to look really closely to see it ,i guess i didn't really read it like i kind of knew the answer so i just kind of didn't read the text Yeah. 
210.4,Luis,,yeah then that way you can help class else okay thank you ,um sure i'll take a look at it okay 
110.2,Farrah,,yes student it is ,um so i think like so i can kind of wondering like who is right like is student right or are student and i right because like like is it the microscope that discovered the water or is it the lunar orbiter 
130.3,Jazmin,,the lunar orbiter was the machine that nasa sent to investigate to look for ice deposits so the water they found is microscopic so you would need the scientific tool you would need the microscope to be able to see it so you and your answer and oliver's answer was correct it was a microscope ,so my answer 
130.3,Jazmin,,but i guess you could say you know they did use the lunar orbiter also to investigate it but to actually see it you would need the microscope ,so is my answer wrong or is it like sort of right 
130.3,Jazmin,,but the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon it's sort of right they did send the machine so they use that the lunar orbiter to investigate but to see the water they had to use the microscope ,okay okay that makes sense 
150.1,Oliver,,any other questions yes student ,um so we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to take a moment before we had to go to thank you like you were really patient with us and you like helped us like use our prior knowledge to like like be part of the discussion and so i just wanted to thank you for like taking the time to do that because it was really nice and sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher and you were so patient with us 
150.1,Jazmin,,well thank you thank you how are you all ,good great 
150.1,Luis,,great i have what are your questions are the answers for the passage that you read water on the moon ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class teacher i know a lot about space 
110.3,Luis,,well that is wonderful i'm glad you know a lot about space but maybe our friends don't and maybe you can help me teach them some new things about space ,maybe i can teach you class some stuff yeah 
230.1,Farrah,,that would be a good thing so going back to the question it was is there what equipment didn't scientists use to discover water on the moon how did you come up with your answer student ,um well i saw the question asked about equipment and so i was looking for a paragraph that talks about equipment and water and so i found it in paragraph three 
120.1,Oliver,,okay so what about you student ,okay so art or science teacher always talks about microscopes when when it's time for us to take out microscopes she's like okay take out the equipment for science class and we're going to use the microscopes so then i was looking at a question and i was looking for something on the story that talked about like you know discovering water and i saw the part where it says you need a microscope which is a tool which is equipment to look really closely and then we're talking about the water 
120.1,Jazmin,,right so when the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so microscope isn't isn't a piece of equipment but the word in the sentence that we need to look at is discover so why don't you go back to your passages and you know circle some or go back to the question and read it again and let me know if you have any questions ,i don't see anything that said discover in the story i'll look again teacher yes it's me student i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
410.2,Jazmin,,well student your answer was nasa sent a small machine they did send a small machine to discover water on the moon but what was the name we're looking for more detail what was the name of the small machine ,oh i don't remember 
430.2,Jazmin,,the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon we need to be a little more detailed we can't just say a microscope we can't just say a small machine you know a microscope is a small machine so we need to be a little more detailed and go back into the passage and highlight what they used to discover water on the moon ,okay so i have to say more details 
420.3,Oliver,,yes more details and as you're reading the passage you know might be good to take a highlighter and highlight keywords so when you go back you can look at what you highlighted to help you find the answers ,okay okay okay i'll try that because i still don't see on discover and here so i'll see what i find 
210.4,Jazmin,,so if you go back to the passage you know discover is to look for go back and the second paragraph says nasa send a small machine well which is what student read but if you were to keep reading that sentence it would tell you what the small machine was called that they sent to investigate they sent a lunar orbiter to investigate ,yeah i just found the name um and so i added i added the rest of that sentence to my answer so now my answer says nasa sent a small machine cutter lunar orbiter to investigate 
150.1,Chris,,wonderful that is great so class else have any other questions ,i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.4,Luis,,and that's excellent that's excellent let's look at your answer student ,yeah i talked about equipment in my answer 
210.3,Luis,,you did you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they do use equipment like oxygen tanks but the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so that's when you have to go back and you have to you know dig in a little deeper to find you know where they're talking about water on the moon and what they what piece of equipment did they use for that okay the oxygen tanks allows them to breathe better when they're on the moon ,it does cause they can't breathe without oxygen tanks 
130.3,Luis,,right yeah so the question was you know they're trying they're going to need the oxygen tanks while they're on the moon but you're also going to need different equipment to discover water on the moon ,okay all right now i should say like scientists used a lot of ox used equipment like oxygen tanks and um and others equipment like i guess i could what student said and and the small machine to investigate to call it a lunar orbiter 
420.2,Oliver,,exactly exactly the more detail you have the better off your answer is yes ,i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go time for the next class so we'll see you later 
420.2,Luis,,okay thank you okay start simulation ,hi teacher can you see yes 
420.2,Luis,,yes now i can how are you ,i'm good yeah i'm doing pretty good you know what a long day 
150.1,Luis,,understand the question was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon and each one of you had different answers in your journals ,excuse me i'm a teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,well that is wonderful student but we are still learning more information about space so we're going to teach our friends and so hopefully during the class if class else has questions maybe you can help me help them ,okay 
210.2,Oliver,,thank you thank you um so the question was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon student you said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely student you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon student said nasa send a small machine student said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks student said he circled the same as student through the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what are our keywords in the question what are we looking for we're looking for a piece of equipment yes student ,working for our equipment and for water 
210.2,Oliver,,okay so we're the question was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon so you're right we're looking for equipment but what did the equipment do or what was used for to discover what ,was covered water 
410.1,Farrah,,so discover water so we're looking for a piece of equipment to discover water student i'm not sure that maybe you understood the question correctly you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ,yeah i don't understand why my answers wrong 
410.1,Farrah,,student i'm not sure that maybe you understood the question correctly you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely well you do need a microscope to look really closely but this question is we're looking for the name of the piece of equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon ,but they said that you need the microscope to look at the water 
120.3,Jazmin,,"really close i'm sure you do but right now we're looking for the actual piece of equipment that was used to discover water on the moon student and student let's look at yours you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon So if we go back and we look in the passage, the first paragraph is called the moon is a desert. in the first paragraph tells us what scientists have known for a long time the moon is a desert but if you go to the second paragraph and the very first sentence it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate says the orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater ",student that's where i got my answer from 
120.3,Jazmin,,you what ,that's where i got my answer from that sentence at the beginning of the second paragraph 
410.2,Jazmin,,right nasa sent a small machine but you need more detail yes they did send a small machine but what was the name of this small machine ,um i think you just said the lunar orbiter 
310.1,Farrah,,the lunar orbiter right i see where student could have got her answer it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely ,yeah yeah that's where i got mine from 
420.1,Farrah,,right but if you go back and you reread the question again and you take out your highlighters and you go slowly you're looking for the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon ,oh and so like discover is not the same thing as as like to look at it 
150.1,Chris,,right to discover is to look for to look at something but to discover you're going to you know look for so that's what they use to discover the moon the water on the moon was the lunar orbiter okay does class have any questions ,okay i guess it's not a question but i went to nasa so i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.2,Chris,,you're exactly right and it also says in the second paragraph um that they do they could not breathe oxygen so they do use those suits and they do use oxygen tanks when they're up on the moon and when they're in space yeah you're exactly right here so thank you for that added comment ,okay so i'm reading it now and the other thing i guess is that i don't see them talking about water in the paragraph about the lunar orbiter so how can that be the right one because they don't have discover in this one oh i do see look for ice 
210.4,Chris,,and looking for and discovering so in the second paragraph if you look at the heading on it's called water is a valuable resource so it's talking about the water in space and what a valuable resource it is ,okay so me and student thought discover and looking at where it's the same thing and now okay yeah and i forgot to discover means to look for something and so i missed i missed that one in paragraph two 
510.1,Chris,,make sure when you're reading the passage you take a holiday you highlight important facts when you go to your question ,yeah i couldn't see how i missed that one um yeah okay 
150.1,Oliver,,does class understand now wonderful ,okay wow well teacher it's been a short time but thank you so much for working with us and i really appreciate how you asked us some questions so that we can think about how we got to our answers and then really explained our strategy where we really want to look closely at all of the words and the question and make sure we understand it because man to man i didn't realize that we we didn't understand exactly what discover man 
150.1,Oliver,,right well thank you it's been nice it's been a pleasure ,you know 
150.1,Oliver,,bye bye ,hi 
150.1,Oliver,,hello ,we're excited to work with you 
120.1,Luis,,so the students gave responses to what equipment that scientists use to find water on the moon who can answer that question student ,i i i really know like i don't think i need any help with this because i know like everything there is to know about space so i don't think i should be in this class 
120.3,Luis,,so tell us something that you learned from reading the text what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon ,wow like okay so they use like all kinds of equipment like they had to use like space suits and they had to use like you know all the stuff that astronauts have to use right 
210.4,Luis,,correct but helping reading the text and finding the evidence within the text can help you learn specific answers to the question like what specific equipment was used and how the scientists use that equipment to find water on the moon so it can deeper deepen your understanding about space ,okay 
130.2,Jazmin,,so who can say what equipment was used to find water on the moon about the scientist student ,and i thought it was a small machine 
120.4,Jazmin,,can you repeat that please ,yeah i thought it was a small machine 
230.2,Oliver,,do you remember what the small machine was called ,"let me see i can't quite remember Um, so I circled the same thing as Farrah. And what I said was that it was basically people use the microscope. "
130.2,Speaker,,scientists are a part of it so student can you add to that ,well yeah so i was trying to figure out like was i guess i don't understand why my my answer was wrong because like was the microscope did they use the microscope because it seems like they did use the microscope 
110.2,Chris,,and there's more details that we can add to our answer to show that we understand the text student your hand was up thank you for waiting a microscope was used there was other some other equipment also used so it's probably not just one piece of equipment ,yes so i was kind of thinking like um i was thinking that well i went to nasa and i know that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and maybe they use know that when they were finding like all that water in the craters 
230.2,Jazmin,,very good i like how you connected your experience of going to nasa to help you understand and reading the text better that's a great experience you had a bet that was really cool so student have you found some more details in the reading about what the machine was called ,and when i look back in i saw like what it what it said it said let me read it it said nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate so was it the lunar orbiter 
510.1,Bennett,,so you see how if you did remember that it was a small machine and i like how you went back and reread your text to figure out what that machine was actually called yes student ,i'm unfortunately we have to go to lunch so thank you so much for working with us but we have to go on to lunch let's see yes so we'll continue on and just continue the lesson where you left off using the moves that we talked about today and just see how it goes all right here we go 
510.1,All,,nothing's happening ,or you're not able to see us 
510.1,All,,nope it's the space picture with the lunar orbiter ,you might have back into your zoom 
510.1,Luis,,okay teacher now i see you know okay all right yes student i noticed your hand ,oh yeah i i always have something interesting to share for sure i just wanted to say like my dad is an astronaut so again like i know all about this spot 
120.4,Oliver,,thanks for sharing with us that your dad is an astronaut and i'm sure you do know a lot but there's always more we can learn by reading and finding more details in the text we can always learn more but that's really cool that your dad is an astronaut about that's that's fun to talk about what piece of equipment did the scientists use to find water on the moon what was that small machine called student can you tell me ,um so i saw i listened to jazmin's answer she said that it was um the lunar orbiter i think 
310.1,Jazmin,,correct it was a machine called a lunar orbiter and student did a good job remembering that it was a small machine and when you couldn't quite remember what the name of it was i like how you went back to your text and re-read the information sometimes we can read things but not quite absorb everything so it's always a good idea to go back and reread your text underline important information and details that can help you answer questions about it afterwards and keep that knowledge with you so great job class i like how class is reading their text and finding the details in the reading ,so my answer was sort of right and sort of wrong like when i said like nasa used a small machine like the initial one was was not quite right because i didn't say orbiters right 
310.1,Bennett,,it was the right answer but i like how you went back and read your text and offered more accurate details so you weren't wrong but by going back and rereading you are able to identify what the exact name of that machine was ,gotcha well we have to go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and particularly i wanted to thank you for correcting me to look more closely at the work and really valuing the thinking that i was because i was thinking about it but i guess i didn't really realize how much was the complete answer that you really like helped me to see like how to look to see the text and how to really get a more complete answer that was really cool are yeah and i really appreciate that that you're so interested in my stories about like my dad and space and all that stuff so thank you so much welcome back so how did that feel 
310.1,Oliver,,hello ,how are you today 
310.1,Luis,,good how are you yes student ,um okay so here's the thing like um so i already know all about space so i don't think i need to be in this class like i know all sorts of stuff about space already 
310.1,Luis,,i bet you do student said the small class purpose is to dig a little deeper and get a better understanding of the texts that we're reading okay ,okay 
310.1,Luis,,so your answer to the question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks but if you can go back and read the text can you find the specific piece of equipment that was mentioned in the text or how scientists found water on the moon ,um so maybe i didn't really um look at the text i kind of just knew that 
310.1,Luis,,yeah so um that's great that you knew but it's always good to completely read everything that's in the text as well to gain a deeper understanding in that way you can answer the question a little more specifically ,Okay. 
230.1,Oliver,,so student can you elaborate a little more on your answer for what equipment did scientist used to discover water on the moon ,um yeah i can totally do that so i circled the same things as student and i said in paragraph three that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Oliver,,okay so if you can go back and let's look at paragraph number two it specifically talks about the exact equipment that the scientist used to investigate and find the water on the moon so can you reread paragraph two and see if you can find a little bit more information there that will answer the question a little better ,um i'm not sure 
230.2,Jazmin,,let's look at paragraph number two it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small and then it goes on in paragraph three to talk about how you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so a scientific tool called the microscope is a correct answer for looking at the water but to actually just for the scientists to actually discover water on the moon as it says in paragraph to the machine was called a lunar orbiter okay so as you're reading and answering your questions always look back in the text you can also underline important information that will help you answer questions after you are finished and i notice student said that nasa sent a small machine so student can you look back in the text and recall what was the name of that small machine that nasa sent ,i can do that i guess what i saw so nasa it's in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbitor to investigate so i guess it's the lunar orbiter right 
310.1,Chris,,exactly very good and nice job looking back at the text right ,and i see that student answered that scientists found craters full of water on the moon and they did find that on the moon but what equipment student did they use to find the water on the moon in the craters well so that's kind of interesting like so i went to nasa with my dad like so yeah it was really awesome and like when we went there like they talked about how like that astronauts had to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that stuff so s that the answer 
230.2,Chris,,they used that equipment to keep themselves safe in space but the question for discussion is what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon so they wouldn't exactly be using their tanks and their masks to find the water on the moon that's just part of their their work uniform and protective clothing which is very important but the discussion question where you're trying to answer is the equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon so look back in the text and you can kind of scan over it and we were looking at paragraph two moment ago to specifically answer that question so what was the name of the small machine that nasa sent to investigate ,well i guess based on like jazmin's i guess the lunar orbiter 
110.1,Chris,,lunar orbiter that is correct ,i have a question okay 
110.1,Farrah,,go ahead ,okay so i don't understand um can you help me understand why my answer's not correct 
110.1,Farrah,,okay who is speaking right now cuz i didn't see a hand go up ,um it's student 
150.1,Farrah,,student ok so maybe student your answer is correct scientists did use a microscope to look at the water that they found but the question was asking what was used to discover the water on the moon so the microscope was looking at actual droplets of water after it was the water was discovered the question was how did they discover the water on the moon that make sense ,oh yeah that makes a lot of sense 
150.1,Luis,,great that was a good question does class else have questions ,i do i do i do student is yeah i have a question 
150.1,Luis,,go ahead student ,okay so actually um we have to go to lunch here in just a second but before we went to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and i wanted to thank you like sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher but you were so patient with us and also like i realized like i kind of just brought understanding like to the table but you like helped me to understand like like that i have to look at the text and that's really important so i really appreciate that because i don't always think that way so thank you for being so patient with us 
120.4,Luis,,you're welcome student and thank you for telling me that that's awesome start simulation hey class how are you awesome great student so i first want to start with student student could you read you me your answer ,yeah sure um mr teacher i shouldn't be on this class i don't already know all about space 
110.1,Luis,,well student why don't we why don't we listen to student answer and then we'll talk about your answer in just a minute okay ,okay 
110.1,Farrah,,okay yeah so just sit there and listen to student and then we'll get to you in just a sec all right go ahead student ,okay so um i circled the part where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
110.1,Luis,,okay so that's a great point student can i help you ,nevermind i'll wait 
120.3,Farrah,,okay thank you so that's a great thing to circle alright so let's read the question what does the question say ,um what equipment did telling us to discover water on the moon 
120.1,Farrah,,okay there you go so what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon so what does it say in the article about what machine or equipment went to the moon ,the microscope 
120.3,Farrah,,well did they take a microscope to the moon doesn't say that right no it doesn't say that so in in paragraph two what does paragraph two say ,nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate looks for ice deposits large pool of crater these ice deposits are very small 
210.4,Farrah,,all right there you go that's that's okay you can stop there so what did they send it to the moon to search for the spots ,on the lunar orbiter 
210.2,Farrah,,okay so then what equipment that they use to find the water or what do they sent to investigate ,oh they say simple lunar orbiter to investigate 
120.1,Jazmin,,yeah there you go there you go perfect alright so student let's get to you alright so read me your answer ,ah i'm sorry mr teacher i don't understand why my answers wrong too 
110.1,Jazmin,,okay student let's look at your your answer says nasa sent a small machine right ,yeah you just told student that was the right answer the lunar orbiter 
210.3,Jazmin,,i just want a little bit of clarification on right and i'm not saying your your answer is wrong okay so what is a small machine that they sent what is that called lunar orbiter right so if you add it in that nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter you think that could have clarified your answer well yeah cuz you think about like what use it uses talks about a microscope right and microscope is small right or it could it be talking about you know oxygen tank or i wanted to know specifically if you knew what equipment they used you know what i mean ,yeah that makes sense i understand 
210.3,Luis,,but let's get to student student read your answer that needs to be clarified ,said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
210.4,Luis,,okay so did the scientists use oxygen tanks to find water on the moon ,i mean they use oxygen tanks when they were on the moon 
210.4,Luis,,but did it talk about scientists going to the moon ,um i mean that's what the story is about them going to the moon 
210.4,Luis,,is it is it's about people going to the moon ,okay well okay okay in the first paragraph it says scientists have found evidence of water can be found deep in the moon's polar craters and if they find that 
120.1,Luis,,go ahead keep going ,then then that means that they had to go there in order to find it 
120.3,Luis,,well then what is the second paragraph say the very first sentence ,nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter okay 
210.4,Luis,,so did the scientists go to the moon ,no 
230.1,Luis,,no right okay so where did you get oxygen takes from in your ,well cuz i i know a lot about space you know i i watched some tv shows and sometimes i'll watch nova on youtube 
230.2,Luis,,the question is not based on the videos that you watched or the youtube videos you watch it's about what you read so where in the article doesn't talk about oxygen tanks ,it doesn't 
120.1,Jazmin,,that doesn't alright so how so how would you rephrase your your answer ,um okay um so the scientists sent what the name of the thing lunar orbiter 
110.4,Luis,,there you go yep ,ok ok so scientists sent the lunar orbiter to the moon 
210.3,Luis,,to do what ,to discover water 
130.3,Chris,,there you go discover water right so that is the equipment that they used all right ,"mr teacher i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and i guess the lunar orbiter too Well, like even just said they use the Lunar Orbiter. "
210.4,Oliver,,right they just use the lunar orbiter right so yes they may when when astronauts goes they may use all that equipment but they didn't send astronauts they sent a lunar orbiter okay ,yeah yeah yeah well i was just looking at the clock and it's actually it's time for us to go to lunch but thanks for taking the time to work with us okay 
120.2,Luis,,simulation hey class i've read your answers and i want to get a couple of clarifying questions have for you so let's start with student okay yes student so the second question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ,i just wanted to remind you that my dad is actually an astronaut 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay great it's not needed alright so let's talk about student student student will you read your answer for me please ,okay so i said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water 
130.1,Jazmin,,right okay Oh that is obviously a true statement. Right. You can't live without water. ,is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable 
120.2,Jazmin,,okay so is there convincing evidence that it could be valuable is there convincing evidence that it could be valuable on the moon ,well um it says that there's water on the moon and what is valuable because you need it to drink 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay so how could that be valuable for the astronauts so what so for example right now okay say there's no there's no water on the moon right so there's no water on the moon then what are they in order for astronauts to go to the moon and have water what do they need to do ,if there's no water in the mud in order for them to go to the moon they'd have to bring their own water 
210.4,Jazmin,,bring their own right in paragraph four what does it talk about when regarding water ,water on the moon can be valuable i mean when we say it can be useful in lots of ways for example future astronauts could drink this water yes see that's where i got my 
120.3,Jazmin,,keep reading what does the next one say ,okay i'm water is heavy it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things 
120.1,Jazmin,,all right so why is it valuable to find water on the moon ,because it would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things 
210.4,Jazmin,,well and it's also what does it say what does it say about the weight of water ,it says that water is heavy you know i also know you can use water to grow things so we can have like a moon garden on the on the moon 
140.1,Jazmin,,you like the martian ,i like that movie 
140.1,Jazmin,,so all right so what do you think you can do to add to your answer yeah it's a good movie ,um okay so i can say i should ask and drink the water you can't survive without water having water on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft water is heavy 
130.2,Chris,,how could that be beneficial how could that be valuable okay so let's speaking of waters heavy let's go to chris's answer okay there's you said water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it ,so if if you don't have to carry the water then you could have room on the ship for some other stuff that you wanted to carry 
210.3,Chris,,okay do you think do you think take off for a spaceship could be easier without the weight of the water ,well i know that like weight matters because like when we get on the airplane you know they weigh our suitcases and so um but i know that rocket ships go out into space and there isn't any arm gravity in space so 
210.1,Chris,,well but to get to get out of the earth's atmosphere okay takes a lot of force right so if your rocket doesn't weigh as much and it'll probably be a little easier for the rocket to get into outer space correct ,yeah yeah yeah yeah 
110.1,Chris,,yeah alright so there's that that's a that's a good valuable reason to have water on the moon okay so let's look at student okay your answer no it's not ready yet ,sorry teacher i just i just thought of one more thing yes that i had read also that water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
230.1,Oliver,,right yeah it can be alright so student will you explain your answer for me ,yeah sure okay so um i said no it's not ready yet because last paragraph they talking about how hard it will be and how it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money so it doesn't look like they're ready to pick up any of the water from the moon yeah 
120.2,Oliver,,"What is the question. The question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon to be valuable. Right. ","Well, I said no, there isn't any evidence because they haven't been able to get to the moon to find evidence because it's gonna take a lot of time and money. "
210.3,Oliver,,hold on you just said they haven't been to the moon yet ,i don't think so 
210.4,Oliver,,well what is what is what is the section to say paragraph two ,oh yeah we talked about the the lunar orbiter all yeah cuz they sent the machine there 
210.4,Oliver,,so they have been there right so they have been there and they have found evidence of water that's what it says in verse in section two ,right like like i remember okay 
210.2,Oliver,,oh we already had the evidence of water and student you can help out too now what kind of value why would that be valuable ,okay okay why would it be valuable okay okay in paragraph five it says moon water it could be useful and other ways or it can be broken down into two parts that's what i said hydrogen and oxygen and oh okay astronauts could breathe oxygen but that's not water that's oxygen 
210.4,Farrah,,oh but it says that water is broken down into two parts ,yeah so they could breathe the oxygen part of the water 
130.2,Luis,,what else does it say the oxygen and hydrogen could be used as student what else is to say that oxygen hydrogen could be used as ,it sounds like that could be used as rocket fuel 
210.3,Luis,,yeah so how would that be a valuable resource to have ,well i mean like if i needed fuel to get back home and they could like make the fuel i guess on the moon and have it be like a gas station so they could fly back home 
210.1,Jazmin,,okay so then that means that they have less gas when they start right when they take off from earth go ahead student ,cuz cuz you were telling student that if it's too heavy well it's better to be light so if they have less gas when they take off then they have their lighter and they can go faster 
110.4,Oliver,,right okay so let's recap let's recap so what are some benefits and valuable why is it valuable to have water there you go and it's a lot easier to get out into space ,you can break it up into two parts hydrogen and oxygen we can breathe oxygen 
110.4,Luis,,okay ,and and we can make they can make rocket fuel with it 
110.2,Farrah,,what else what are some other benefits you can grow a garden on the moon with it with the water too a garden okay yes ,i don't remember the other thing it was the thing that you said student it's it's it if you if you can get water up there then you don't have to take it with you i guess 
210.3,Farrah,,okay and so what is i mean what is water essential for ,to drink or bath 
210.3,Farrah,,right well yeah take it literally essentially central to take a bath right it's essential to drink water ,yeah 
110.1,Oliver,,right so okay awesome yes student ,i'm trying my supporting but i was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go but i did want to say that i appreciate it how you kept asking about why we were making the senators like you asked me why did i say nothing and i then it helped me kind of think about what i found in the story for my answer 
110.1,Oliver,,well thank you student i appreciate that ,i appreciate you 
110.1,Farrah,,thank you you class have a great day hi how are you doing ,we're doing well thank you 
150.1,Luis,,great well so do you class had an opportunity to review the discussion question yes student ,oh yeah so we all looked at that question and so we shared our answers but here's the thing like i don't think i need to be in this class because like i already know all about space so i don't like i don't need to like be like learn more i already know about it 
230.1,Luis,,okay that's great that's a great you know comment i would ask you what what do you think your question what do you think the question is asking you ,wow okay so ah the question is what equipment did like scientists use to discover water on the moon 
120.4,Luis,,okay and what was your answer ,so i said like they need like all the oxygen tanks and they like you know they need like all that stuff that like astronauts used to like go fly around in space 
210.3,Luis,,okay well did you read the the article that was with the question ,maybe i didn't really read it 
210.4,Luis,,okay so i have a question will you read number two for me please the second paragraph ,okay okay so paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Luis,,keep going keep reading ,okay this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water 
120.1,Luis,,ok you can stop you can stop now okay so the first sentence that you read was nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and again student what was the question ,um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay so from the article what equipment did did the scientists use to discover water ,um like jazmin's answer the small machine okay and student what was the small machine called ok so after we just read it the small machine is called a lunar orbiter 
150.1,Luis,,great great great answer so student do you think from your question from your answer to your question that you think that you needed to revise that question or the answer ,yeah i didn't really read it the first time so yeah i think that i see i think i understand like why that's that might be a better answer 
150.1,Farrah,,okay well great i'm happy that we got that resolved student ,yes okay so like um i didn't understand like maybe you can help me understand like why my answer is wrong 
150.1,Farrah,,okay well let's look at your answer um what will you read your answer to me please ,okay so my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to investigate 
210.3,Farrah,,okay what is the question asking us ,the question sayas what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.4,Farrah,,okay and what equipment from the article that you read and the student just read and in paragraph two what did the article what did the scientists use to find water on the moon water on the moon ,i guess like student and jazmin's answer was the lunar orbiter but like is like microscope is that equipment too did they discover it with the microscope 
130.3,Farrah,,well microscope is definitely equipment but it's not used in space like because we microscopes are used for to find tiny tiny organisms underneath right to magnify it to make it bigger and we didn't use a microscope to go and look for you know water on the moon we used the lunar orbiter which was able to be controlled from you know from the earth ,oh ok i see 
130.3,Farrah,,microscope microscope ,so they discovered it 
210.3,Oliver,,exactly yes now student i have a question for you you said i circled the same as student did you actually read the article ,um i did read the article and i did circle the same thing though like a section in paragraph three about like you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely but i heard what student was saying about and why you're saying like the dhe difference between like like looking at something and finding or discovering it 
410.2,Oliver,,right and so they use the lunar orbiter to discover the water now they use the microscope to look at the microscopic organisms that were found inside of the water you know microscopic meaning small tiny right so in order to to look at that in a larger sense they use the microscope the thing that troubles me with your answer is that you said the same as student which shows me that you're either looking at farrah's paper or you didn't have your own idea ,okay 
130.3,Chris,,and so in this case case in this case the machine they're using is a lunar orbiter okay and student ,um yeah so like like here's the thing like i went to nasa with my dad and like i know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and like stuff like that so like is that possibly an answer i went to nasa with my dad 
210.2,Luis,,well they use oxygen tanks and that they need oxygen in space however that's not the question here is and if you read the question the question states or asks you what equipment equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon the keyword discover water on the moon right the key phrase there and so we're not looking for just any scientific equipment that it's used out in space we're looking for this specific one this article says discovered the water on the moon which in this case like student and student had said is the lunar orbiter student ,um yeah so basically okay so i just we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to like thank you real quick like for working with us today and like like i wanted to thank you for like helping us to listen to each other like sometimes we kind of don't like listen to each other very well and we kind of make like our science teacher gets kind of frustrated but you are really patient and like asking i still listen to each other's answers and i think i think there was a lot to learn from that and that was pretty cool so like just wanted to thank you for like doing that and like taking that time for us to do that 
210.2,Oliver,,well thank you i appreciate it i'm glad this this helped thank you okay start simulation hi class how are you doing today ,we're happy to see you 
210.2,Luis,,i am happy to see you again welcome back to another session okay um so i brought you here together because i realized that you have made yes student ,um yeah so um i don't think i should be in this class because i already know like all about space and outer space and and craft that fly into space 
120.4,Luis,,"that's good but you can still remain in the class to help the others if you know a lot about it okay so that's that's good to know okay so you have attempted to answer the question which is good okay so i want to just say thank you so much for the answers that you have given and i'm here to just try to clarify the answer that you have and to see how best we can work around to arrive at a more suitable answer okay all right now so the question is what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon right now one of the strategies that we were going to use today is to look at some keywords that we have in our question now i want you to look at the question one more time and if there are words you don't understand circle them so wanted to take just a minute to do that Okay, okay. Now who wants to share with me. What words did you choose what words from the question. Did you circle. Yes. Luis ",um yeah so i guess i was wondering like i think i know the words but i was wondering about like discover 
110.1,Oliver,,okay the word this cover okay let me hear some other ideas what word did you choose student ,so what i chose i think i know the words but i was wondering about equipment because i basically said the same thing as student what was that it was the microscope 
110.1,Farrah,,okay very good student and what about you ,oh yeah i had the same answer as student 
110.1,Jazmin,,okay very good so two words that we have identified so far student did you find a word ,i actually feel like i knew what each of the words meant 
110.1,Chris,,okay very good all right now and student the you know the defining the words that you're not sure of ,not like i really love space and my dad has taken me to nasa before so i think i know the words pretty well 
130.2,Oliver,,look at those words again and share your ideas of what you think those words mean all right very good so i want you to talk to each other in your groups and i'm going to ask student student and student to be in one class and student and student ,so student i think that basically you know that we like equipment is like the tool or something that you use 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay very good so he was at all okay very good is from the other class wants to share which word did you discuss ,so basically we said like what was that we talked about the different machines that people would say okay people would use and so i was wondering cuz i was like confused why my answer was wrong 
210.2,Oliver,,okay um so so you had selected a machine a small machine right but let's let's before we go into that let us look back at the words so we talk about discover and we talk about equipment okay so what is an equipment we say it's a it's a tool right and student you rightly said that it's a machine very good now what about the word discover you know what the word discover means yes student ,and discover is like when you find something 
110.4,Oliver,,very good ,like like yeah when you find it 
110.1,Chris,,right so what we're looking for then is a tool that was actually used to find the water right now i'm student you said microscope right sorry i'm student you said microscope right ,i also said microscope right yeah 
210.4,Chris,,now i want you to yes student and those are tools right ,um well i was just thinking that some other tools were like because i went to nasa and i saw that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so did they use those things 
120.3,Farrah,,"Okay, great. So you said discover means to find right and equipment means a tool. Right. And the question is asking you to identify the equipment that they used to discover. Or we could say the tool that they use to find the water. Okay. so what we want to do now is to go back to the passage take a closer look at the passage and see if you can identify where the words equipment and discover are as it relates to finding the water Or we could say, look at the word investigating this case. Alright, so go back in the passage and look for me. okay now did you find the word machine okay can you read the sentence at the word machine comes in student ",oh yeah i can do that okay so basically it's nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Farrah,,all right very good now so the word machine is in that sentence right now what we're looking for is the machine actually or the tool that was used to find the water now what tool is mentioned in that sentence ,the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Oliver,,very good and which word in that sentence sentence tells us that they actually find the water yes student ,um unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i think that will have a chance to see you after lunch so we have to run really quick 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay ,hey can you see us 
210.4,Jazmin,,i'm not seeing you ,you might have to close the zoom window or move it out of the way or maybe move your internet browser out of the way 
220.1,Luis,,okay here we go okay now i must say you're doing a great job you're doing a fantastic job so far okay and so we had left of where we were trying to actually locate the answer from the passage so we are going to just briefly recap that we were looking at the word yes student ,um yeah so i just wanted to say my dad is an astronaut so i think that could be kind of helpful 
210.2,Jazmin,,oh yeah okay it could be but we were on the right path as well and i fantastic job that you're doing okay now we were looking at the word discover right and we said the word is what does the word discover means yes student ,so discover means like to find something or to you know investigate like the way that nasa use the small machine to get to the water 
210.4,Jazmin,,right and what machine did we identify that was used ,it was the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Jazmin,,very good and there was another word in that sentence that you've read that also has to that will give us a clue of the word discover do you know what that word is when we discover when you discover what are you actually doing ,you find something 
210.4,Jazmin,,you're finding but in order to find it what must you do ,look for it 
210.4,Jazmin,,there's a word in the sentence can you can you go back to that sentence for me the sentence that talked about the lunar orbiter look at that sentence for me is another word in that sentence that helps us to know that we actually are discovering something so what do you have to do to discover ,is it investigate 
210.2,Oliver,,so the word investigate means that in order to find something you have to investigate okay very good very good student so investigate okay the truth is that the lunar orbiter is what was used to actually find water okay now we can go to the other question and as we said the word discover means to find so yes truth now the other question is is there convinced yes student ,i'm actually i'm sorry we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to say thank you so much for working with us and what was really special when you are working with us is that you really help us to understand the meaning of the word discover because we didn't totally understand when we started but now we all know what discover meets and not just that but you helped us use evidence from the text you made sure that we were using information from the text and not just stuff that we knew from like our background so that was really awesome thank you so much for working with us 
210.2,Oliver,,okay you're welcome thank you hello class how are you doing today ,we're doing well how are you 
210.2,Luis,,i am fine good okay um my name is teacher name um and yes student ,um yeah okay so i don't know if like i should really be in this class because i know like all about space and like i know all this stuff so like i don't know that i should really have to work on it 
120.2,Jazmin,,yeah you you there's always a way for you to learn more right i mean we learn from each other has been going on okay all right the question is what took equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon now um let me see those really understood what you read did you understand the passage pardon me ,i think we did yeah yeah i think we did 
120.2,Jazmin,,okay you did understand the passage right ,yeah i think so 
210.2,Oliver,,okay um let us look back at the question and the word equipment what does that mean um talk to yourselves about it for me the word equipment discuss what it means alright is there class who wants to share the answer with us what is what does the word equipment means yes student ,um yeah so equipment is like something that you you like use to accomplish a task like it's something like a machine or like a tool that you use to do something 
120.4,Farrah,,all right very good so it's a oliverice that is used right good now look at the word discover talk to yourself again about the word discover share what it means with each other all right class wants to share that what does that mean yes student go ahead student ,so like discover so like discover is that's where you you find something 
210.4,Farrah,,right you find something do you agree with that class discover means to find something right okay good so what are we going to do we're going to go back to the passage and we are going to look for the oliverice or the equipment and yes dear yes student ,um i think that i think that you were just about to say this but i am not quite sure why maybe it's serious wrong because i think it's the microscope 
230.1,Farrah,,you think it's a microscope okay um now what did they say the microscope was used for ,i'm like in the reading 
230.1,Farrah,,in the passage yes what does the word what what was a microscope used to do ,okay so um let's see in paragraph three they said the water they found is microscopic me wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.3,Farrah,,okay um but you said that the water they found right does that mean they already find the water ,oh you mean 
230.1,Oliver,,can you think of did they use a microscope to find the water ,oh like like oh like your mean like the difference between like finding it and like like looking at it 
210.2,Oliver,,exactly right so the question i asked you what did they used to look at it or what do they use to find it ,they said what did they use to find it 
210.4,Jazmin,,exactly so not what they used to look at it so i wanted to go back is there class else who wants to share on that and that issue all right go back and look again and see if there's something another oliverice or another equipment that was mentioned yes student ,i realized that based on what they're saying the small machine i think was the thing that i think this small machine is what found that water 
210.4,Jazmin,,right so can you go back and look if there's another machine or equipment that was mentioned in the passage ,in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,exactly to investigate investigate means what ,look for 
110.4,Chris,,right student means to look for right or to discover as as the question asked you yes student ,um yeah i was just kind of wondering like so i went to nasa with my dad and we had a chance to like look at all the displays all the rockets and stuff so like i know that scientists like have to use lots of equipment but but i was thinking that they used equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that 
210.1,Chris,,right they use different equipment right but remember you're looking at the the passage right but a question actually relates to the passage so what we want to do is to find the equipment that was mentioned in the passage right student ,yeah yeah oh 
210.1,Chris,,good ,"Yeah, the lunar orbiter "
110.3,Jazmin,,very good see so that's where you find your answer okay so always remember that you have a lot of experience ,"So, we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to say really quickly i wanted to thank you for working with us today and i really wanted to thank you for like you were so patient with us like sometimes we can frustrate our science teacher and you were so patient and you help us to really listen to each other and like help build our answers like off one another and that was really cool cuz cuz that doesn't always happen and also you were really careful about like the answer to the question and like helping us break down the words to be honestly sometimes we don't read as carefully as we could so you really helped us to read carefully i just want to thank you "
110.3,Luis,,oh you're welcome that's very good welcome back hi ,oh hi um i just was gonna say that um i don't think i should be in this class because i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,well student i'm glad you are a part of this class maybe you can share with us some of your knowledge and help us expand our learning on space ,i can do that 
120.2,Chris,,thank you and then student did you go back and look through your textbook i asked you to now student and deb you obviously have the same idea so i just reviewed your answers for what told it scientists use to find locate water on the moon ,um yeah so i did a look i think so i'm going to guess that i didn't you were saying i didn't answer the question right because the question was how did the scientists what equipment did the scientists use to discover water and i just was talking about the creative right right 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay student refresh my memory what was your answer ,to be connected with that they use a small machine 
150.1,Jazmin,,a small machine that's right okay sir our high quality answer can be found in the text yes student well ,i guess ever since you were we were talking i was just wonder like i guess still not sure like my my answer 
120.3,Farrah,,"but we're going to focus on a elaborating our answers okay okay okay alright so my concern is while you class use your text to answer the question your answer wasn't wrong they did use this question i will have more let's take our little answer and make it a great big answer to make it make more sense to make it concrete okay so the first part is i want you to take your pencil or your tablet pin and let's reread the part of the text where it describes the type of machine that was used okay not just a microscope what is the actual equipment called Okay, you got it. okay so let's read straight from the text let's go student ",um okay so should i should do the part that i circled yes okay basically so okay what i was circling was i still stuck on the microscope and i can i can tell you why i said it like because it says it's a scientific to exit and then i circled like small machine because i think that was jazzmines answer and and it sounds like that might also be it but i guess i'm thinking that okay so it's both the small machine and and the microscope 
120.4,Oliver,,okay it can be at oliveron what did you circle the ,one pretty much the same thing i i just start called the microscope again because i still think that that was what they used to you know to to discover it like when they were discovering the water like how could they discover it if you can't see yet and they said that the ice was microscope 
110.1,Luis,,student what did you circle okay alright so let's find out ,um so i basically when i went in i circle lunar orbiter and microscope 
130.3,Jazmin,,so how about let's restate the question to form our answer okay so we're getting there the lunar ,orbiter the lunar orbiter 
150.1,Farrah,,that has a microscope to explore for water on the moon see how that answer grows yeah this is really short one word answer we created a whole sentence where class reading our answer can identify what we are talking about what we're learning about okay student any you look a little little stunned is there something i can help you with ,with you up me 
150.1,Farrah,,no student ,oh this is student 
150.1,Farrah,,oh ok sorry ,no that's okay sometimes i can have a voice that sounds like the voice so um yeah basically i guess i think i understand so okay so in the in the question like we restate the question it's like scientists use the you know a particular equipment to to find the water on the moon and i guess so i can understand that i guess i'm still wondering like is like okay so it sounds like jazmin's answer was was the right answer is is the microscope like do we say both of them or do we say like student 
130.3,Farrah,,you say both of them because the lunar orbiter had the microscope on it ,oh interesting okay gotcha so like you would say both okay interesting way 
420.2,Oliver,,to make your answer very clear and to clarify ,"Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but thanks so much for working with us. It was really want to work. "
420.2,Oliver,,hi how was lunch ,was great thank you 
420.2,Luis,,hi student ,um yeah so i just wanted to remind class that my dad is actually an astral which is pretty cool 
210.4,Jazmin,,that is cool okay so we were focused on the lunar orbiter consent by you remind me what why the lunar rover is so important student ,that with the small machine that they use to discover the you know what i mean they said that that was it so i think it's really important that with 
310.1,Chris,,that is a very good answer you remembered from your text and you elaborated by restating the question thank you ,well i was gonna say lunar orbiter as well and i changed my because you asked us to look at the text and not like necessarily background now even though i know that like they use lots of other stuff it's clear that you know what i mean that the lunar orbiter is is in the text so i guess i wasn't quite sure i didn't quite catch student and but it sounds like it was important to rephrase it 
230.3,Oliver,,to restate the question to the form your answer yes okay great so let's continue student asked me a question about our text ,you want me to ask a question about the text um so i guess like one question i have so i'm still a little torn about the microscope um i guess the question i have is that in the text right they say don't in paragraph three they say the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close i guess i'm wondering like you know like how did they find um well it's kind of confusing as they say like you wouldn't be able to see it unless you are looking straight at it or even if you were looking straight at it so like what did they use the microscope for 
130.2,Farrah,,that is a very good question to class class wants to help him out and answer why would they put a microscope along with the lunar orbiter student ,well i think that that's where they said you know you have to look really close that catches so if they put it on the lunar orbit that they still found it using it sounds like something else so they don't say it the texts like if it's if it's true or something they're like they just say it's a lunar orbit so i think i think that's the best answer because i think i feel like i'm getting 
520.1,Jazmin,,your all on top of it okay so from reading the text today and using our tools by going back and rereading the text and circling important information how can this broaden your understanding in the future of any topic that we discuss whether it's space or farming ,student do you think the state but basically one thing i would say just that to farrah's queestion they use the lunar orbiter to get to the war like you can't find it with the microscope you have to you have to find you have to discover it so and then use the like what we would use like so i think what i would use is basically like we have to close it right and then we have to restate the question which is really hard you know 
420.2,Jazmin,,sometimes it is if you listen to the question So just with write down the question and then use them. The words on your paper or on your iPad. You can just rearrange them to restate the question. ,can you show us 
110.1,Oliver,,i can okay student what did you have to offer ,um i don't i'm not sure now i'm really interested in in learning how to do that question Yeah. 
110.1,,,okay maybe i can i might be able to share screen hold on oh ,oh i don't think you can share the screen i 
110.1,Oliver,,i just tried ,yeah 
510.1,Oliver,,for restating a question you listen carefully for the words being used such as in our question to answer the question using the race method you restate the question ,um well it sounds like the lunar orbiter is the right answer and even if i'm not totally 100 sure why so you would say scientists use the lunar orbit 
130.3,Oliver,,to discover water on the moon ,scientists use the lunar orbiter oh okay yeah so scientists to the question is like how what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon and you say like right back scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon 
520.1,Luis,,there you go you got it okay so how can you use your knowledge of restating the question in our next lesson ,it's a good question well the first thing i would do is i would restate the question i would say like okay so if the question asked this then i got it i got to answer that question because my response didn't really answer the question i was saying like the scientists found craters below water so it didn't really answer what you asked so i guess it might answer can't answer the question then it's like okay like that's not the answer you know what i mean 
110.4,Oliver,,was that you that is absolutely correct yes ,so unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we do i really wanted to thank you for working and like in particular i wanted to thank you for like being really clear about like why you were concerned about like what were the things that you you know what i mean like what you wanted us to be focused on and like where we were focused instead and that was really clear and and you also gave us like class or how to like improve our answer you know what i mean like you gave us a lot of ways that we could make our answers better like both being more accurate but then also like you know like restating the question that a lot of booze and be found like just saying the question back because then things make make more sense you know what i mean so it was really cool working with you and you are also so patient with like student who can be kind of like says a lot of crazy things so thank you so much 
110.4,Oliver,,thank you have a great next class good afternoon how are you class ,hi 
110.4,Chris,,hi hi student ,hi how are you 
110.4,Chris,,i'm good how are you ,doing well thank you 
110.4,Luis,,so i know you class just read about finding water on the moon how exciting was that ,it was fun but i have a question 
110.4,Luis,,yes student ,um i don't think that i should be in this class like i already know all about space and like everything there is to know i don't think i need any help 
120.4,Luis,,so what was your answer to the question what tool did the scientists used to discover water on the moon ,well i was saying that the scientists would have to use like i'm like spacesuits and that they would need like rocket fuel and they would need oxygen and like all that stuff that i already know before like ever doing the reading 
110.3,Farrah,,okay so let's start with student student what did you how did you answer the question oh okay so you have some prior knowledge of space travel right ,um so my answer was that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look closely 
110.1,Oliver,,that's very good student ,i answered the same as student 
110.1,Chris,,and student how did you enter the question ,so i went to nasa so like i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that kind of stuff like i already know about all that stuff 
110.1,Jazmin,,great okay and student ,so i said that nasa used like a small machine 
210.4,Farrah,,okay great okay so let's reread over the text because student and student are really close to the answer i'd like you to reread paragraph two and see if you pair up together student student to see if you can find any better information about the tool that scientists scientists use to discover water in the craters now student student and student to read paragraph two as well and see what extra equipment or what kinds of equipment could narrow this down ,okay we read through it but um i have a question if that's okay 
210.4,Farrah,,okay ,so my answer about the microscope i just i'm not quite understanding why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,it's not wrong you're still correct they you will need a microscope if you want to see the water but what was in paragraph two in the very first sentence let's see if we can find exactly what they used yes student ,okay so it says um it says on paragraph in paragraph two 
210.4,Jazmin,,go ahead ,it says basically that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Chris,,okay all right student you want to elaborate on her answer ,um well i just i feel like we're talking about stuff that that we know like cuz i went to nasa with my dad and i feel like we're missing stuff that like we have to use 
120.1,Jazmin,,jazmin's right she's not wrong keep reading see what else you can discover ,so it's the lunar orbiter 
110.4,Chris,,so where did they find the water mhmm it's the lunar orbiter that they sent to look for the water student ,well i was going to answer the earlier question i know where they found the water 
110.4,Farrah,,ok but let student talk it's her turn keep going student ,so i was gonna say um so did they use the the microscope to discover the water as well or did they use it for something else 
230.2,Farrah,,okay from your text it says that you would need what to see the water ,a microscope 
110.1,Chris,,there you go okay student what did you want to add ,um so i was just gonna say like that basically i can understand so like the lunar orbiter is the machine that like went up there like student said did they have astronauts in it did they need all that stuff 
210.4,Chris,,it did not clarify did it so maybe this could have been an unmanned mission and they just send the machinery and the lunar orbiter was part of the bigger machine that discovered the water ,yeah that makes sense that makes sense okay so maybe they didn't send any astronauts at all 
210.3,Oliver,,there you go okay so student where were they finding this water ,um so they found the water in polar craters 
140.1,Oliver,,in polar crater so what does that mean is it around the earth or is it the top and the bottom ,um it's at the top and the bottom 
210.4,Oliver,,okay that's what polar craters mean polar means the poles the north and the south so what is the main idea of this section what is for informational texts what is the main idea what is the target they they want you to know ,um do you mean for the the three paragraphs or in one paragraph 
210.4,Oliver,,all three paragraphs what is the central idea ,well i guess the central idea is that um the water is that there's water on the moon and the lunar orbiter found it and the microscope was used to look at it 
110.1,Oliver,,there you go great job class so each ,awesome 
110.1,Luis,,do you feel better about being in this class now ,um yeah i do like i feel like maybe like i kind of jumped the gun like i kind of was saying like you know i know all this stuff but didn't really read the text so i feel like now i understand a little better 
110.1,Jazmin,,okay there we go yes student ,so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and i just wanted to thank you for for being so patient as we all work together and for helping us to listen to each other's answers and kind of use each other's answers to help our own answers sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher and it was really special to be able to work with you and to have you encouraged us to listen to each other so um i really appreciate that and i think class else does 
120.4,Luis,,well thank you for working together so well now go enjoy your lunch okay student let's look at your answer that you gave yes student ,i do have a question so um here's what i was thinking um i know like a lot about space like practically everything that you can know about space i don't really think i need any help i don't think i should be in this class 
110.1,Jazmin,,okay student let's hold on just a second keep your thoughts just for a moment let's student let's go back to each for just a minute tell me about your answer ,well what i read was in paragraph two and it said in the first paragraph that nasa sent a small machine 
120.3,Jazmin,,okay so class look at your paper let's look at paragraph two student can you just read that for me again what did you just just read it one more time for me ,sure okay nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater should i keep reading 
120.1,Chris,,stop right there okay so did class did class read that with her did you read that student with her okay student id you read that you would you like to look at your answer that you wrote for the question and see if you want to change that answer ,um well like i guess i guess no cuz like i guess the lunar orbiter landed in one of the craters that was full of water 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay so let's talk about that student did why did you answer your question by using by saying the words hold on let me look at my thing again how did you answer the question again ,so i said that nasa sent a small machine and then when i was reading i said nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
210.4,Chris,,okay so who can tell me about the lunar orbiter student can you tell me about the lunar orbiter go back to paragraph two student you go ahead and look at paragraph two ,yeah no problem 
210.4,Luis,,student can you hold that thought for just one moment what does it say student about the lunar orbiter ,um okay so lunar orbiter the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so like that's what the lunar orbiter does it flies up and it orbits the moon 
210.4,Luis,,okay the ice deposits are very small so do you think the lunar orbiter was able to see the ice deposits or what how do you think the lunar orbiter was able to find the ice deposits ,like maybe it had like instruments on board like it had like very scientific instruments 
110.1,Farrah,,that's a good answer student what would you like to add to the conversation ,okay so i thought that it's the microscope that discovered the water but um i i don't understand why my answer is wrong because i thought the microscope discovered it and also the yeah i thought the microscope discovered the water 
230.2,Farrah,,okay so you're you want to talk the microscope what paragraph does our reading talk about the microscope ,okay so it's paragraph three and it says the water is the water they found is microscopic um and then you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Farrah,,okay does it say the microscope found the water in that paragraph ,no i guess not 
110.1,Chris,,okay harisson what you had your question a question just a few minutes ago what was that question that you had ,well i guess i was just wondering kind of i mean kind of like student like i don't know like i went to nasa with my dad and like we basically like went and studied all the exhibits and stuff so like i just know like outside of the reading that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that stuff 
120.3,Oliver,,and student that's really cool so what you learned there is that they're very scientific in their studies and that they use equipment to search for things so when you look back at your reading student can can you look back at your reading in paragraph two and read that one more time for us okay ,sure okay so paragraph two um let's see which part just like the whole one 
120.3,Oliver,,the whole thing a paragraph two ,okay um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one 
210.4,Oliver,,stop right there stop right there let's go back to paragraph two again i think you didn't i think even added a few little words in there let's go back to paragraph two once more it does say nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate what do you think the word investigate means ,oh like to look at to like look for something 
130.2,Jazmin,,to look for something to what do you do you have anything else student student or student or student to add to that investigate means what what does that mean to you if you're going to investigate something what student what do you think ,so i think if you're investigating it's like how you're finding something so you went off and looked for something 
210.4,Jazmin,,so if you're investigating something you're finding something so what are you going to find about it once you find it what else what else you're going to want to know about it ,well i guess you know what it is is it water 
210.4,Farrah,,you're going to want to know what it is okay so yes student ,and so i guess like that's where basically like investigate can you find it but also study it but you have to find it and then study 
210.4,Oliver,,exactly we have to find it and then study it student what do you want to add ,so what i wanted to add was just that unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us that sometimes we can really frustrate our science teacher but like you were so patient with like student i don't think student did the reading so i think like it was really nice like how patient you were and like how you like brought all of our answers together so that we could better understand each other that was really cool so thank you because it was really nice to be with my classmates we don't always get along 
120.4,Luis,,well you're very welcome okay i've read your responses to our question let me read let me reread the question again hold on just one second okay the question was what equipment did scientist us to discover water on moon okay so student student student what did you want to ask first ,um well i was just gonna say that i kind of know like all about space i don't think i need to be in this class 
120.3,Luis,,okay appreciate that answer student so maybe we could look at this together and maybe we could come to some new conclusions possibly okay what i understand that your answer was scientist use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks Today I would like for all of you to look back at paragraph number two. And if we can look at that paragraph and I want you to circle the word machine. and then i would like for you to read to yourself silently just passed the word machine what actually let's have student read that sentence for us ,okay so um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay that sentence so what did what did nasa send to investigate yes student ,they sent the lunar orbiter 
120.2,Jazmin,,the lunar orbiter ok so our question that we had what equipment did scientist us to discover water on the moon what do you think they sent ,a scientist sent the orbiter to discover water on the moon 
110.1,Chris,,okay so what did you your and what did you want to add to that student that is correct they did send that ,oh i was just gonna say the same thing 
120.3,Oliver,,okay so let's look down the next sentence past that one can you read the next sentence for me student ,the lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
210.4,Farrah,,okay so what did the lunar orbiter do who can tell me yes student ,so the lunar orbiter landed at the south pole and it looks for ice water 
210.4,Farrah,,okay so ice and water is that the same thing yes student ,it's it's the same thing it's just that ice is frozen water and i guess i just i wanted to ask i think i'm still a little bit confused about why my answer is wrong 
230.1,Farrah,,okay so you your answer you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope scope to look really closely so i can what made you say that ,well it says it says in the question that they're looking for the equipment that was used to discover so i said okay the keyword is equipment and discover and i thought what's equipment and i saw the microscope and i know that you use the microscope to see stuff and they said the water was microscopic so you couldn't see without the microscope so i was thinking like you have to see it to find it you know what i mean 
210.3,Farrah,,i can see exactly why you would say that because it does say the water is microscopic and you would use a microscope to see it but did the microscope actually find the water ,oh i guess i guess not cause it didn't say that they found it with the microscope it sounds like they found it with something else with the lunar orbiter right 
210.4,Chris,,exactly so if we will let's underline that sentence on number two the very first thing some paragraph to nasa send a small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate okay i'm sorry student what did you want to add to that and then the second sentence underline that one as well this lunar orbiter will land at the most south pole and look for ice deposits ok now let's go on to the third paragraph so ,um well actually it was more of a question 
210.4,Chris,,okay ,yeah i guess it was that i went to nasa with my dad and we saw that scientists like oxygen tanks at masks and suits and stuff and i was wondering like that wasn't in the reading and i was wondering like did they use that to find the water 
410.3,Farrah,,well i can see how if you went to nasa and you actually saw all of those things i can understand why you would think that because there's a lot of things that you probably learned but when we're answering questions we probably should refer back to our the reading that we were given to find out answers that we need so if you look at paragraph number three and it's look at let's read paragraph number three i'm going to read it you follow along okay ready okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest or driest desert on earth the water they found is what's the word there microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely there's where student found her answer but the microscope was just to be able to see the water after they found it we're back to number two ,the lunar orbiter 
110.1,Farrah,,exactly exactly ,and i'm so sorry unfortunately we have to go to our next class but we wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with thank you 
120.2,Luis,,thank you okay student so you want to respond really quickly go ahead okay so our second question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ,um yeah well i was just gonna say that like i think i kind of got all this figured out by now so i think i'm good 
150.1,Luis,,okay so what was your response student okay i appreciate that that you that you feel that way but let's talk about this for just a minute ,so okay so my response was that water can be split into two parts at the hydrogen and oxygen 
420.2,Luis,,"Okay, I understand. And I see why you would say that, how would you use that answer to convince me that water is valuable or could be valuable on the moon ","so like i didn't well i guess like that it would be valuable because you could use all those things like hydrogen you can use for rocket fuel and oxygen you can use to breathe Yeah, well, I think so. it sounds like i should say like what it does so that you know people understand like what like you know like what i'm trying to say so i guess i didn't have like a complete answer "
120.3,Luis,,okay great response so let's go back to and i think you pulled that right out of paragraph five can you read that this the first two sentences on paragraph five for me student ,oh yeah absolutely okay so paragraph five moon water could be useful in other ways water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
120.3,Luis,,okay and what else does it say about it ,um well it says that like get astronauts could read the oxygen and then oxygen and hydrogen oh they use both for rocket fuel 
210.4,Luis,,okay so you said they could use it for rocket fuel but what other thing didn't say right there that you just read ,they could breathe it 
110.4,Jazmin,,okay so student what would you like to add they could breathe it ,and i just i'm still kind of confused about how to how to structure the answer so that it's a better answer 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay so your answer tell me what your answer was again ,yeah so my answer was that yes there's convincing evidence because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water 
210.3,Jazmin,,but does is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable i see where you got that answer so we could drink it student said we could break it down to oxygen hydrogen we could breathe it we could use it for rocket fuel so okay so are those reasons that it could be valuable ,i think it's valuable yeah i think i was just wondering like if if i know that it's valuable like how do i structure like my answer it how do i say the answer so that it uses evidence you were reminding us to use evidence did i do it right or do i need to adjust it 
420.2,Jazmin,,okay so if we look back to paragraph four it says that water on the moon would be a valuable are very important resource you see the very first sentence on paragraph four okay it could be useful in a lot of ways perhaps you could have worded it by saying water is valuable or could be valuable i'm trying to find my question um ,i can read it to you is that helpful 
420.2,Jazmin,,yes please ,of course the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable 
420.2,Chris,,okay um student ,what i was ok so i was i read that they were possibly going to have a base on the moon by 2024 which i think that could be really useful 
210.3,Chris,,okay art so did you read that in our paragraph or did you listen did you hear that somewhere else ,oh i i heard that somewhere else 
430.3,Oliver,,so student did you want to add something to that just a second ago okay so you might be confusing your prior knowledge that you may have gotten somewhere else with with what we read in our paragraph so let's think about what we just read in our paragraph to answer our question ,um well i actually unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i really wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for making sure that we were using evidence and really helping us to clarify like what we were thinking and and like what kind of ideas perhaps like you really help us to sort of think about like like how did we come to this answer and by thinking about like that you helped us to make like such better answers and like i think that class had a deeper understand like don't you agree class like i think class agrees that like class like you know what i mean understand better and like especially with like student just now like it was really cool how you were asking him like you know like how did he come to his answer so i think student like understand even more and i know that i like was really interested in that conversation so thank you so much for working with us 
430.3,Jazmin,,hello class how are you class today ,we're really excited to see 
430.3,Luis,,awesome i am so excited to see class to so we're going to go ahead and get started with our class today yes student ,um yeah so i was just gonna say i don't think i have to be in this class because i already corrected my answer 
150.1,Farrah,,yes and so class corrected their answer but we're going to talk about that today okay we're going to talk about our okay so who can tell me what they did to correct their answer so how did you go about correcting your answer stick around yes we're going to talk about our corrected answers who can share that okay student what did you do ,okay so basically what i did so good my initial answer was scientists use the lunar orbiter nope sorry you need a scientist tool for the microscope to look really looks and then i said after after class with you i said scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon and so i did that because you help me understand that the scientific tool that it with the microscope was not the equipment they use to discover the walk so after we work together i realized that it was the lunar orbit that helped to discover 
210.2,Jazmin,,we look really closely at those keywords in our question so we looked at discover because that was one of our keywords because there was a lot of tools that the scientists used that they talked about in our text so what does discover mean student what is discover mean ,i'm discovering like when you find them but like it's when you find them for the first time 
510.1,Jazmin,,"Yeah, so when you find something for the very first time. remember when we are reading our question we have to look really closely at those keywords those words that we need to look for in our text Okay, Jazmin, what word. Did you underline or circle. ",i started a couple things like i changed my answer to so basically i was like at first i said this small ship for nasa and option but then you helped us look at like how we needed to use the question and like use that to answer it so i'd said basically that like scientists for nasa us the lunar orbit to discover water on the because the lunar orbiter is the equipment that takes you know what i mean like and that was more accurate like i kind of had it right but i didn't i didn't say the actual equipment and they were asked like the name 
130.2,Farrah,,"remember when we are looking at our question we always have to look for those important words Okay, so let's look in our text for a minute. then we have to look in our text for the same words so that we can try to find our answer and let's see if there are any other words in our text that might help maybe someone else in our class so if you got the right answer the lunar orbiter what are some words you think we could underline or circle that might help a friend someone sitting next to you so what is a word in our texts that might help someone else answer the question what do you think student what might help your friend ",so i basically so i was thinking about what word is like discover so i i found that the word okay so it says like in paragraph two it says nasa set this ball she called the lunar orbiter to best which is kind of like dis discover yeah don't let go and find something and so i thought investigate was important because basically like you know what i mean it says like that's what they that that's what they discover and then when i was looking at the microscope originally i was like oh that's because they had to look really closely but they had to look closely like after they found right 
110.4,Chris,,is there any other words that are important yes student yes awesome job ,well i actually have a question 
110.4,Chris,,yes ,my question was like okay so i know because i went so with like that that scientists use oxygen tanks and stuff you know what i mean equipment like that because i was wondering like that's not in the reading like did they leave it out or you know what i mean like is that is that right or is that just like i guess i don't want to understand 
410.1,Chris,,yes that is a very good question so they were focusing more on what they used to find the water specifically they weren't really thinking about what they use to actually get to space so yes you're right they did use the oxygen tanks and things like that because there is no oxygen in space but they were focusing more on the water piece versus what they use to get to space ,because it's it's not in the right so even if it was true right okay 
150.1,Oliver,,yes i'm make sense sometimes they don't put everything in the reading because then we would be reading forever yes student ,i'm so sorry but we have to go to lunch but we just wanted to thank you for working with us it was really awesome to have a chance to talk so thank you so much 
150.1,Luis,,hello class so yes student ,oh yeah i just wanted to remind class that my dad is an astronaut just pretty cool 
210.2,Oliver,,so we answered our last question so we're going to move on to a new question that is awesome thank you for sharing that so we know that there is water on the moon that the scientists had discovered it but our question says is there evidence that the water could be valuable okay so what do we think valuable means what do you think that means what do you think student ,i think valuable means like useful it can also mean like you know like something that costs a lot like it could be really expensive 
210.2,Luis,,okay awesome so valuable means that it's useful so this is asking could water from the moon be useful okay so do we think that water from the moon could be useful to our scientist you think yes or no okay student what do you think ,um yeah so basically well i guess okay so you're asking is it useful well water can be split into two parts into hydrogen and in oxygen and those are both really useful in space so yeah i think it's us 
230.1,Luis,,okay what are you going to use the hydrogen and oxygen for ,um i'm like whoa okay didn't say it i don't remember mike my dad uses it or something okay did he say oh oh oh you could you could breathe breathe the oxygen 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay so that could be one thing that's useful student what do you think ,um to basically we is it the answer to the question or like why are you 
120.4,Jazmin,,yes so do you think water could be useful ,oh yeah i think it would be really because astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water also you could use the order that they have and you could grow a garden all over the moon 
120.4,Chris,,oh that would be awesome that is very good thinking student what do you think do you think water could be valuable from the moon ,i'm yeah i mean yeah like water is heavy and so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships like they don't have to carry any water they could just go to the moon and get the water there 
230.3,Oliver,,student what do you think that is very true yes water is heavy so it would be good that if they didn't have to carry it on the ship they could have room for other things so that is very good thinking ,um okay so i was thinking that no and mostly because it's not it's not ready 
230.1,Oliver,,okay what do you mean by that ,um well i guess the waters not like it's not like immediately ready to use like they were saying in the reading you have to do all this stuff to to get it and it's like it's in just like these like small amounts you know we were saying from the last question it's like microscopic so like it seems like it would be really tricky and and i guess the other thing is that because it's ice like you have to collect that and you have to you know you have to like like i guess melt it you know what i mean like you have to do all that stuff wall like before you can use so i it's not ready to us why don't think it's a very useful 
310.1,Farrah,,okay student what do you think i like your thinking that is awesome you used details from our text to support your thinking so that's awesome ,um so basically i thought that okay so my answer is also know and that i guess i feel a little different from student is like it wouldn't be useful for a long time 
230.1,Farrah,,okay what do you mean by that ,well okay so you know how they were saying in the reading kind of like what i've said like they need like all this there's all these processes to to break it down and do stuff with it so i do think that it might be useful i bench but like right now like i don't think the evidence is very fancy because it's like saying you know can you use it can you use it now i don't think it's very good until we figure out how to how to make it useful and we haven't done 
310.1,Chris,,so awesome job using evidence from the text as well ,um yeah so i just basically was just thinking also that that like water can be broken down into arts i virgin and oxygen i agree with with student i think there's lots of reasons why it would be useful 
210.4,Chris,,okay awesome so in our text it says that it is in small amounts yes def ,so unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go to our next box i really wanted to make sure that i was able to share with you hi 
210.4,Oliver,,hi there how are you all doing ,we're doing okay 
120.2,Luis,,all right so you just read this text about the moon is a desert so when you are reading this text you're looking for an equipment that this text is discussing so um do you know what equipment means do you know what that word means and so we want to answer this question together what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon okay ,i do i do 
120.2,Luis,,okay yes ,um yeah so okay my name is student and actually so i kind of know what equipment is like it's stuff that you it's like machines and tools and things that you use but my real question is like i don't think i should be in this class like i know already all about space and i know like everything there is to know about space so like i don't think i need to be in this class i don't need any help 
210.4,Farrah,,"okay um well we are going to work together as a class to answer this question this is a class effort not just one person answering okay So in the third paragraph, it's talking about a microscope. does class know or have you heard that word before microscope okay student would you like to describe what a microscope is ",yeah ok so a microscope is okay so in the text it said a microscope is a scientific tool and it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so it's like something that you look at something that's really small but i have a question like why is my answer wrong like i feel like my answers right because like you have to use like like microscope to see the water 
230.1,Oliver,,yes that is correct and no one's answer is wrong ok so the equipment that is scientists use is a microscope to discover the water on the moon okay why do you think a scientist would need a microscope to see the water we are just diving deeper into the text as a class so that class is on the same page she said a microscope is used to see things that are really small why do you think the scientists would need to use the microscope to see the water yes student ,um okay so basically you need a microscope to see the water because there's not much water on the like moon surface and you you have to look really closely to find it and see it 
210.4,Jazmin,,great job good all right also in the first let's see says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so you would need to use a microscope to see the water it tells you in paragraph three does class see that yes ,i can see it but here's the thing that i was thinking is the i thought that thesmall machine that nasa sent was the thing that discovered the water is it the microscope but like i think that they discovered it with the machine 
130.3,Chris,,machine was sent to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits let's see so they used the machine that you're talking about the lunar orbiter to investigate the water and the ice deposits that makes sense and then they used the microscope to look more at it to discover yes sir ,so i was just kind of wondering like okay so i went to nasa with my dad and we like went and looked at places and we looked at like exhibits and stuff so like i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff but they don't i don't know like i already know that so i'm wondering like maybe that's the equipment that they used to discover water yeah 
130.3,Chris,,okay so whenever the astronauts have to go into space there's no oxygen in space so they have to have an oxygen tank and a mask and things like that to be able to survive when they go into space does that make sense so they're not they're not using the mask and things to discover the water they're using it more to survive while they're discovering those things ,okay 
130.3,Luis,,but that's really cool that you've been there yes sir ,um okay so we have to go to lunch unfortunately but i just wanted to take a moment and like i just wanted to thank you for like spending this time with us like you really took the time to listen to all of our ideas and you really like helped us to listen to each other's ideas and like even though i didn't really read the text like you were very patient with me and still brought me into the conversation which was pretty cool so i just wanted to thank you and um yeah i hope that we work with you again 
130.3,Oliver,,i hope so too thank you hello ,hello how are you 
130.3,Oliver,,i'm good how are you student ,i'm good we're working on this question about what scientists what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon 
130.3,Luis,,yes i see that yes student ,okay so i have a question like i know all the stuff about space like practically all you can possibly know like i don't think i should be in this class because i don't think i need any help with this 
110.3,Luis,,well maybe you can help the others ,okay i can do that 
120.2,Luis,,why don't you start with what it what why do you think that the scientists used on the moon ,well okay so here's what i know is like probably they had to use like i'm like spacesuits and oxygen tanks and they had to use like stuff like that like gloves and like helmets and things i think that's what they had to use 
210.4,Luis,,well yeah that's what they all have to use just to be there but what special machine did they use it was in our reading does class know ,well 
210.4,Farrah,,yes student ,oh yeah okay so i think it's i think it's the microscope i think it's the microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,all right where did you see that ,um okay so i saw it in paragraph three you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i'm not totally sure like why my answers not right 
420.3,Jazmin,,why don't we go ahead and look at paragraph two to see if there was a special machine that they brought to investigate can someone see what they brought yes student ,so what i said what i saw is that nasa send a small machine and it's called the lunar orbiter to investigate 
230.1,Chris,,yes that is what they sent and student what did they investigate when they got there ,oh well so i think like they investigated the craters and they found them all full water which was pretty cool 
230.2,Oliver,,and student what happened how did they study that the small ice deposits ,um so they basically used the microscope that student mentioned and basically they use the microscope to study the the tiny little pieces of water like that you couldn't really see necessarily with with just your eyes 
110.2,Farrah,,very good so student do you see now why your answer needs to go a little bit further ,um i think i began to see but i'm still kind of confused because so if they use the lunar orbiter to to find it they couldn't see it without the microscope like they had to go out and look at the crystals right 
130.1,Farrah,,that's true but they couldn't get the crystals to investigate without the small machine right ,oh so okay so they had to use this small machine to like find it in the first place 
130.3,Farrah,,yeah so first they had to find it and then they could investigate using the microscope ,gotcha okay that that that makes a little more sense i think i think that makes sense um 
510.1,Chris,,often when we read it will tell us a sequence it will tell us what happened first and then what happens next so it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story ,yes student yeah okay so i think like for okay i went to nasa with my dad and we looked around at like all the exhibits and all the stuff and i kind of like i know from my own like reading and from my like visit that you have to use all this equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like what student said so like i don't know like that does that fit into the answer 
110.3,Luis,,it ties because sometimes our personal experience helps us to understand what we're reading and so student when you are reading if you've seen these things at nasa itt helps you to visualize them and to know more about them and so that's a great thing to share with the class does class else have an experience that similar yes student ,um yeah so i guess like for me it's like um i didn't really read it because i kind of knew all this stuff but i guess there's more in the reading so like the stuff about the orbiter and the microscope like i guess it didn't really think about that 
110.3,Bennett,,good so sometimes if you if you already know something i think we can always learn more about it or maybe you could see if your classmates maybe they don't know it and they need your help yes student ,um so we have to go to lunch in just a second but i wanted to just thank you for working with us today because i'm sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher because we don't always work together but today you really asked us to think about each other's answers and really kind of listen to each other and and be patient with each other and kind of like even student like didn't do the reading like you were like really nice to him and i just wanted to thank you because it felt really safe to like put out our ideas so i just wanted to thank you for that all right welcome back so how did that feel 
110.1,Luis,,so let's go ahead and talk about it okay alright thank you very much for taking the time to work on and give me your answers i really appreciate the work that you've done in the time that you've put into it yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,well maybe you can be a benefit to others by listening and offering some suggestions ,oh yeah yeah sure i'll tell class what i know 
210.4,Farrah,,okay that would be great thanks for for helping us out alright so let's just go ahead and see and let's talk about some of the things that you've done and that is one of the tools that was used to do some observation and some research and let's see student you talked about needing us scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely do you remember what that was or maybe where you could look to find that answer but there's another tool that was used to discover the water and so that looked more closely at the water but it wasn't what was discovering the water ,oh i don't remember where it is i mean i guess i could just i could look back at the story again 
110.3,Luis,,yeah so what's some strategies that we can use to find that answer to that question who knows have a strategy that we can use student you're a resident or maybe you could help us out ,well i was thinking that you know how i learned a lot about science is by i'm watching youtube videos and and and watching the show on on on nova show on pbs so i was thinking that maybe student needs to watch more more science videos 
210.4,Farrah,,well science videos my family we love to watch science videos and documentaries and those are great places to learn and it's a great place to learn more about what we're talking about so we can go ahead and go back i'll look at that and if you give me a minute to this kind of pull it up but an excellent place to look is in our text we can look at the text and we can look for clues so let's see ,okay i'm working i'm looking at the text and i still don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Farrah,,oh i'm sorry i missed two who asked that question can you ask again ,oh yeah it's me miss bailey i just looked at the text i still don't understand why my answer is wrong 
130.2,Farrah,,okay well if you hold on to that and while i talked to some of the others and while i talked to some of the others maybe we'll discover it together what do you think ,oh ok ok 
210.2,Oliver,,ok let's see if we can put it together let's work together to see if we can find this answer okay all right let me see let let's see we're looking for some scientific terms who remembers what term in the question there's a term and the question that we're looking for yes def ,equipment 
110.4,Jazmin,,yes equipment is one of the terms equipment student ,i was thinking discover 
110.4,Chris,,discover okay good what else ,well for me i was thinking about water seem to be an important word in the question 
210.2,Farrah,,so student let's look back to your answer you answered so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon oh yes water is important mm hmm yes because the question does ask about water so what are the keywords we already talked about water discover and equipment right ,i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i got that i'm in the third paragraph 
210.3,Farrah,,okay you do need it to look closely but that means you already found it right ,oh yeah yeah to look at it yeah 
110.1,Oliver,,so let me see um let's see what other answers we have that we could talk about and work this out together so that's the next step so we want to find it first we can look at it until we discover it or find it and jab you said that you circled the same as student let's see ,yeah 
110.1,Oliver,,it's right on to that hold on just a minute and student okay thank you deb what would you like to add to that ,well i just mean like when we were saying our answers out loud like um i had the exact same sentence that i have circled on my my my text to the last sentence you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
110.1,Oliver,,is there anything you want to maybe add to that um and now that we've talked about it ,um well you did say that um you can't look if you're looking at the water than your you have to first that's the second stop so then um i guess i have to look for the first step i gosh 
130.2,Chris,,yes alright so let's see what student wrote he recently wrote scientists found craters full of water on the moon and let's see class raise your hand if you think that's a true statement they found craters full of water on the moon ,"Well, your side equipment. okay yeah well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
420.2,Jazmin,,"That's true, but we want to focus on the text. Let's see. student you wrote that nasa sent a small machine that's very good so maybe we need to investigate look a little further to see what is that machine called ",okay i should look at it i don't remember 
210.3,Luis,,"if we look at paragraph two it says nasa send a small machine which is what you wrote what comes next Okay, so NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So let's look at our question again and see if that answers. What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon. what do you think then ",i'm okay so i think it's that i'm at the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.3,Oliver,,very good so together you came up with the answer you each had answers that were true but they didn't necessarily answer the question fully yes student ,i'm sorry my spelling but i was looking at the clock and it's time for the next class so we have to go 
210.3,All,,okay well thank you for your time and i hope you enjoy the rest of your day ,thank you all bye 
210.3,,,okay all right i hope that you had a good lunch and that you're right it connected learning was it good today ,it was good we had a chocolate chip cookie and and we also have lasagna so it was delicious 
210.3,Luis,,that sounds good day at lunch good i'm glad your bellies are filled up and we're ready to continue our discussion yes student ,i'm okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm okay 
110.3,Luis,,well just like last time you had something to contribute to the class so we're going to hang tight and maybe you can contribute some more what do you think ,oh 
210.2,Chris,,okay thanks ok so our question that we're going to talk about this time around is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable what are the keywords in that question i'll read it again so you can hear them ready is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable there are keywords yes student ,i think water again is the keyword and may be valuable 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay that's two of the keywords student you can maybe you can give us another one ,um i think that um is a keyword and the second one and maybe moon because we're talking about water on the moon 
120.4,Farrah,,How about Farrah. ,okay i think my answer i chose i'm valuable it's important one 
110.1,Oliver,,all right deb is there a different word that you found mm hmm good job it is important we do agree on that ,i'm gonna say convincing 
210.2,Luis,,all right i'm convincing is good and there's one more word that we use a lot in science ,evidence evidence our teachers always asked 
210.2,Luis,,okay so what is evidence ,evidence as one it's like something that you can pro you know it can't be something that like you think but you gotta be able to prove it 
220.1,Jazmin,,see that i'm glad you're still staying with our class because that is some good insight And so in this case. That's what we're going to do. So let's take a look at your answers. all right let's see oh my answers this hold on just a minute let me find your your work ,we can tell you our answers to if that 
220.1,Jazmin,,was a very helpful ,okay well i'll go i'll go first cuz i'm still kind of confused it's me student okay i said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water 
230.3,Jazmin,,okay just a good piece of evidence that we can use water and specifically that the astronauts could use water he said evidence and ,why is it wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,"Well, it's not wrong. so one strategy we could use let's let's work together with student let's help her her figure out what we could add to this okay so what is a strategy that we can use to look back at the text and to know where to look in the text ",well i know i know that i'm supposed to look for the keywords and the text and i guess that's why i'm confused because i feel like i did that 
120.3,Jazmin,,all right well let's look at it together okay let's see ,cuz my answer i said astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water okay and then in the paragraph number four it says future astronauts could drink this water i added on another detail because i know that's another strategy we're supposed to do is is because the last question you said that i needed to add more details and so i 
130.2,Chris,,One place we can look is exactly where you look so you found the right spot to look under the section. Water is a valuable resource right so let's see who can add to that ,"Okay, it's me, Chris, I talked about the water to I said I'm water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it in the ships anymore. "
130.2,Oliver,,um ,i read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024 
410.2,Chris,,wow that's very possible and student you did find some good information because water can be very heavy that is true but we're looking for convincing evidence that it could be valuable huh ,okay it takes 
210.3,Chris,,it says it's good so it's good i don't have to carry on the ships anymore and that's that is some good information but does that convince us that water on the moon can be valuable ,no no i guess not 
120.3,Farrah,,so maybe there's something that you can go back to that text and see if you could find some more so if we put jazmin's information with your information and we work together we can come up with a full and more complete answer i'm jab and student you both wrote no to this answer and you said not for a long time or it's not ready yet But I want us to go back and look at that again. to see if there is convincing evidence because student has given us some good information of why it could be good and why it could be valuable and and and then chris's answer follows up to that is if they had water there so they wouldn't have to carry it around so that would be valuable because we all need water to drink and so let's look back and see so student and oliveron i want you to go back to the section that talks about water as a valuable resource and see if you can come up with a different answer look at paragraph five ,is me student i see the last sentence kind of after student and chris's it says having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things so is that the right answer 
230.1,Farrah,,what would that be valuable ,oh yeah having more room would be valuable 
130.1,Oliver,,okay so that's that's part of an up the answer is that we could have more space having more room and let's see ,i agree what student 
510.1,Oliver,,we don't want to just say we agree it's good to agree with people but it's also good to know why we we think something ,okay i agree with some out because i do think that um well the thing that i'm so after student said a thing about drinking the water and then student to think about the water being heavy i'm done it does say more room i mean i have to share a room with my two brothers and so if i had more room in my in my room than i would think that would be valuable 
110.1,Chris,,um i think that would be valuable to all right let's see and ,okay um let's let's really i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go again um but it's me student i did want to say thanks for for for hearing our ideas like i feel like you you listen to everybody's ideas and make us feel like valued oh like the water but also that you had me and student kind of look back at at the story so we could find more evidence and build on each other's ideas and i think that was helpful too yeah 
110.1,All,,well i appreciate your response ,okay bye 
110.1,Luis,,okay class so yes student ,yeah i just wanted to say i just wanted to remind you and class that my dad is actually an astronaut 
120.4,Luis,,so the question is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable that's pretty cool alright so let's look at the question right and let's look at your answers so student can you remind you what was your answer for this question ,um yeah so i said that water can be split into two parts into hydrogen and oxygen 
210.3,Luis,,okay good so that's a good start on your answer um so do you what do you think do you think that that's partially convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ,um you know i think it's pretty convincing because those two things are so important in space and like for space travel that i think it's convincing that they have like you know what they talk about with whay you can do yeah i think it's convincing 
430.2,Luis,,good so with your answer what i want you to do is to describe the reasons why it's valuable when you split oxygen and hydrogen does that make sense student ,oh yeah like using the evidence yeah yeah that makes sense 
150.1,Chris,,now student can you tell me what your answer was again yes good okay so that's what you do to re evaluate your answer ,um yeah so i said that water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore 
120.1,Chris,,okay so that's a good story they talk about the water being heavy and that could be a positive thing that they're not having to carry on the ships but let's see can you find some other reasons and other evidence that's just one thing can you find some more evidence that supports water being valuable on the moon does that make sense student ,yeah i'll try i'll see what i can find 
120.4,Oliver,,okay student can you tell me what your answer was ,um yeah so i said that um no like i didn't think the evidence was very convincing because it's not ready yet 
130.3,Oliver,,can you find some reasons in there so far that eventually it could be valuable does that make sense student okay so it's not written about it not might not be completely ready yet but as they were as time goes on it could be i think that it could be valuable ,um yeah i could try to look for reasons um i just think that like it just seems like it's not you know what i mean cuz it's not ready yet like it would take such a long time to be useful you know what i mean so it didn't seem very convincing because it seems like we'd hav to use but yeah i can look and see 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay student yes so basically i was just gonna say like one thing that i thought of was that you can use water to grow things so we could have a garden on the moon okay so eventually i think should go along with what student said i don't think we're quite ready for that yet but i do think that maybe a long as we research and in the future that could be a possibility that but i do think that maybe a long as we research and in the future that could be a possibility that can you remind me student what was your answer to this question ,i said that it definitely would be useful because the scientists can drink water and and people can't survive without water 
130.1,Farrah,,and see if you can figure out some other evidence that water would be valuable on the moon so you and student you and student work together and see if class can work to combine your answers and help each other out um student what was your answer to this one so that was one of the things that was evidence was that you could drink the water from the moon so you think that you could work with student student had a good start on his too ,um so my answer was i guess no that it wasn't very convincing because kind of like what student said like we wouldn't be able to use it for space for a long time you know 
210.3,Farrah,,okay um well just because we can't use it right now at this moment does that mean that in the future it wouldn't be valuable what do you think ,i guess that's a good question i guess it could be valuable in the future 
210.3,Farrah,,okay so ,you certainly have more spaceships 
130.3,Chris,,so see if you could find some evidence to support that it may be valuable in the future see if you can look in your text and you and student can work together because you class are kind of on the same page too yes student yeah so let's think of it as you know maybe it's not great right now but in the future it can be valuable ,um yeah i guess i was thinking like well let's see what was i gonna say i was gonna say that well i guess what i found was that water can be broken down into two parts so hydrogen and oxygen so i guess i was going to say that like yeah that's stuff that also is useful 
420.2,Chris,,good so you're right it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen now let's go a little bit further with that answer and can you also see if you can find what you can use the broken down oxygen and hydrogen for and that can go along with your evidence ,oh yeah yeah okay 
120.1,Jazmin,,so student and student you class have been working together and student are you able to re-evaluate your answer and maybe provide some more evidence ,yet so basically so and student was sharing his answer about how water can be split into two parts into oxygen and hydrogen so i guess like that was something that just says like it was even more useful than just using the water like you can use water and then you can use oxygen and then you can also use hydrogen and unfortunately we have to go to lunch i just really wanted to thank for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for like hearing all of our answers and really taking the time to listen to what each of us was saying 
120.4,Luis,,okay class so let's go ahead and review your answers yes student ,um yeah so um i just wanted to say that like i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know like all about space 
120.4,Luis,,well let's review some answers and then we'll see about that okay so student i noticed that you when you answered can you repeat your answer for me ,um yeah so basically what i said was um let's see what did i say i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
430.3,Luis,,okay so you're right they do use equipment and that was part of the question so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon could you go back and look in your text and see if you can find a different kind of equipment so instead of oxygen tanks let's see if you can find the equipment that helped scientists to discover the water on the moon does that make sense student ,um yeah is there somewhere that because i'm not sure where to look is there somewhere i should be looking 
420.3,Luis,,so um the sections are labeled 1 2 3 4 5 and six let's take a look at section three and see if you can find an example of the equipment they used to find water on the moon ,okay 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay i'm gonna while you look i'm going to go to student and look at jazmin's answer so student can you repeat your answer for me please ,yeah so i said nasa sent a small machine 
420.3,Chris,,now Chris. Can you repeat your answer for me. so look back through your texts and see if you can look for that keyword equipment and then see if you can find the answer to the question ,um yeah so i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
120.4,Farrah,,okay so they did find water on the moon but can you find what equipment they use to find that water on the moon okay can you look back in your texts and see if you can actually find the equipment yes student ,on i was just wondering because i guess i'm still not sure why my answer's wrong 
120.4,Farrah,,um can you repeat your answer for me ,yeah so my answer was basically that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close 
120.4,Farrah,,um yeah i think i think you have pretty good answer what we're going to look at the question the question was what equipment good scientist use to discover water on the moon so can you read your response one more time student a please ,yeah i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close 
210.3,Farrah,,maybe instead of using the word tool we could use a different word what would be another word that you can use ,well i guess like i mean i guess you could say like you know you said equipment like definitely microscopes you know it's in a piece of equipment that they looked at because the water was was microscopic right 
130.3,Farrah,,so maybe instead of tool you can use the word equipment to answer your question does that make sense ,yeah i think so 
120.4,Luis,,okay so student did you discover how to did you discover the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon ,um well i just kind of kept looking around and look what i was like i i looked in paragraph three looking but i was like it looks like they use the microscope but like i don't know like did they use it to discover like it seems like there's a lot of equipment that they used 
110.1,Chris,,okay i'm student ,yeah i i kind of had that like because i went to nasa so i know that the scientists use like a lot of equipment that wasn't in the reading but oxygen tanks and masks and suits and things like that 
410.2,Chris,,so they do use a lot of things but you didn't look for the specific equipment that the scientists used to discover the water ,yeah i think so i guess i was wondering like did they did they not use suits or like i guess i was just wondering like should we say from what we know or you know what i mean 
410.2,Oliver,,yeah so i mean you do have a point there that they used other things too but i was just looking for a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon ,we unfortunately have to go to lunch but thank you so much for working with us hi how are you 
410.2,Oliver,,good how are you ,we're doing well we're excited to work with you 
410.2,Luis,,excited to work with you too okay so student ,oh oh i have a question and can i just kind of see just like one thing real quick 
410.2,Luis,,sure ,okay so i like i don't think i should be in this class because i already know all about space like i know everything practically there is to know that i don't really need any help 
110.1,Jazmin,,well i think that you can learn something from any of these four other students that you have in here so student with your answer can you hear me student ,yes i can hear you just fine 
230.2,Jazmin,,so you said that nasa sent a small machine can you figure out what the name of that small machine is ,okay so in paragraph two nasa scientists small machine called lunar orbiter so it says lunar orbiter right 
110.4,Jazmin,,yes ,great 
110.4,Farrah,,yes student ,um yeah so here's my question so i don't really understand why i'm why my answer is wrong 
230.2,Farrah,,well it's not completely wrong just um can you go into more detail about what else what other equipment might be used other than just a microscope ,well i mean i i guess yeah but it seems like the microscope is like they can't see the water without the microscope you know like they have to be able to see it in order to study it 
230.2,Farrah,,right um but what did nasa have to send in order to use a microscope ,oh well they sent up it sounds like student just like the lunar orbiter 
150.1,Oliver,,right so maybe include that with your answer in the microscope does that make sense yes student ,so does that mean that they use both of them to discover the water or did the one of them discover it and one of them did something else i'm a little confused 
110.1,Jazmin,,alright yes student ,does that mean that my answer is wrong like did the microscope do the discovering or was it the lunar orbiter 
110.1,Luis,,okay i'm ready start simulation hi class hi student ,yeah i already know a lot about space so i should be honest 
120.4,Luis,,okay well do you know the answer to our question that we are talking about today so how did scientists discover water on the moon ,oh yeah sure um well they need like oxygen tanks and spacesuits in order to roll up to the moon 
120.1,Luis,,okay yeah they did they didn't need a lot of equipment to get up there because there's not a lot of oxygen they need a lot of tools but how did they discover water on the moon what things did they need to find the water ,hmm i'm not sure 
120.1,Luis,,okay so maybe if we look at the first few paragraphs so paragraphs one and two you will find something specific that they used it was a type of machine that they sent up there so that they can find water because the moon is very dry it's kind of like a desert so what machine did they use to find that water ,um i don't know 
210.4,Luis,,okay let's see let's look at paragraph two we see in paragraph two there's a senate's about how nasa send a small machine called a what is that machine called ,lunar orbitre 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah so they sent that machine to investigate it will land on the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so those ice deposits are made out of water they had a hard time finding water unless they use that machine to help them search for it ,right yeah yeah ice and water it's the same thing right okay i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,okay your answer was actually really close so you did have the small machine is what you said but looking more specifically you want to see if you can find the exact name of that machine and kind of be able to explain what that machine does so your answer was right on it you just wanted to add some more detail to it ,okay 
150.1,Oliver,,great are there any more questions ,well um i mean i think that i had the right answer so um i guess i don't know why my answers wrong too okay um i had the same answer as student 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah so i understand and i feel like you class were all around the answer but we are we're looking more for specific answer so like student and student you class said that you needed a scientific the microscope was actually to use just to see closer the water because the water was so tiny that they couldn't see it with their own eyes tool called a microscope but the microscope was used for something different the small machine the lunar orbiter was used to find the water so there's two different machines and equipment things that they used ,okay one was used for to find the water any other thing was used for something different right which which one is the right one 
130.3,Farrah,,so the lunar orbiter was the correct one that is the small machine that they use to find the water the microscope was used to look more closer to the water ,oh but i guess so how do you figure that out is it just because you're the teacher you know you know 
150.1,Chris,,well i look back at the paragraphs that you have to find your answer in the reading that's what the most important thing is so you need to read and be able to find your answers in the text so i looked very closely to find the details that we were looking for ,okay well i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.4,Chris,,yes you're right ,so i mean that feels like that could be like some tools that they would use to somebody equipment you know 
210.2,Oliver,,yes and you are exactly right they do need a lot of those equipment tools to use to get up to space because without on they wouldn't have been able to get on the moon so yes you're right but remember the question was just specifically asking how they discovered water so all those equipments yes they are very important to them so they didn't need them but we was looking for the tool for water ,okay okay okay so thanks teacher it's time for us to go to lunch thanks for working with us 
210.2,All,,okay thank you ,bye 
150.1,Luis,,hey class alright so what do you class have questions about so what do you have to say student ,oh not so much a question i just wanted to remind you that my dad is an astronaut 
110.1,Luis,,oh really that is awesome ,yeah that's why i know so much about space okay 
110.1,Luis,,what do you class think about that so is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable well i am glad that you know a lot ,um well for me i dont know convincing evidence 
230.3,Farrah,,yeah so if you look at your passage you want to use the passage the second half which is paragraphs four five and six and find the details in the text that tell you that there's some actual evidence that water could be useful so what do you class think about that where is the evidence that might help you with this question so why did you class think that what was your opinion about that well so i see that student and student you class said know that you didn't think that there was any evidence to find water valuable ,i was just kind of thinking you know about the fact that um that it said that they need to come up with a plan for extracting the water so it seemed like and they need to study it so it seems like they got they there it's it's nowhere near ready you know there's got to be a lot of time left since i got to have a plan and a study 
210.4,Jazmin,,yes and i completely agree it will take a long time and that's what the passage said that it's going to take a long time but in the question it says is there convincing evidence that it could be valuable so when i'm looking for my answer you want to look for details that will tell you how the water is going to be valuable so how is the water in the passage like let me give you an example for instance like in paragraph five there are a lot of examples about how the water could be valuable how could it be used ,well i thought that you know that they could like make them own garden you know and so they could grow vegetables and pinks 
110.4,Oliver,,yes that's a good idea and i seen in your answer you said how it was definitely important to have the water because they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water that is very true you definitely can't so it is very valuable to have the water also see where student he added kind of onto your answer and he said that it was heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore that is true also because in the passage it explains how hydrogen and oxygen could be split apart and they could use hydrogen for rocket fuel and they can use the water for other things like a garden like you said so yes so it is very valuable and you class are all giving me good answers on that yeah ,i was in paragraph one it says water is heavy and it says that future astronauts could drink this water 
420.2,Jazmin,,yes and you're right and then also student also explain how the hydrogen oxygen can be split so you class are all giving really good details but we want to say give like a yes or no question if you think that it is valuable and all of your details put together does say yes it is valuable because they can use it for surviving so you class are giving really good details for that they can use it for rocket fuel it can be split apart ,so my answer is right 
110.2,Chris,,but you class were right there at it so so ,"What I say yes it's valuable cause it's heavy, and they don't have to carry it in ships. "
130.3,Jazmin,,yes and you can also say how it's important that it will help them be able to survive because they need that water ,so i would say yes it's valuable because you need water to drink 
110.4,Chris,,yes and you need water to survive yes you're right ,yeah i also know like you said that water splits into oxygen and hydrogen 
210.4,Farrah,,yes and you're right that was a detail from the text but the reason that they split it apart is so that oxygen can be used for other things so they breathe the oxygen and then the hydro jen can actually be used for rocket fuel so they split that up apart so that they can use it for different things ,oh wow okay i guess i hear what you're saying about why student and student are right but i guess i don't know where they found the answer okay how did they do that 
150.1,Farrah,,so i feel like it's more of your opinion based on the details and the facts that are in your passage so it's more of your opinion based on what they gave you in the passage so you class you in depth said no and then student and student said yes and then student kind of gave some details so you have to use all those details so about hydrogen and oxygen about how water is you can serve can't survive without water so they're using all those background knowledge tips in order to help them find the answer to ,so they're using their background knowledge so me and student get it because we don't know as much about space as then 
150.1,Oliver,,maybe but you can also use the passage remember too you can use your reading passage to help you figure out how it would be valuable so if you read and you look for those details and you can also get the answer to ,all oh ok ok i think i think i understand so it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thank you for kind of explaining what me and student need to work on well i guess all of us that we should um keep reading the passage course i'm even though we don't know as much about spaces student and student they weren't right either because they needed to put all their ideas together 
150.1,All,,yes and just expand your answers that's the best that you can do ,okay expand our answers okay thank you so much teacher okay bye 
150.1,Luis,,alright so i noticed that student and student you both had pretty close answers and then i feel like the rest of you did find pieces of the passage that made sense but we couldn't seem to find the exact same answer it was a small machine student so you were close also but that small machine had a name and we need to find that exact name in the passage so if you all would look at paragraph two it has a two labeled in the first sentence it actually says that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater so this is the machine that actually went and explored does class see that sentence ,ah yeah i see it i have a quick question though 
150.1,Luis,,yes student ,um okay so here's the thing i don't think i should be in this class because i already know like so much about space that i don't really think i need like any help with this i think i already know like a lot about this stuff 
110.2,Luis,,yeah a lot i did notice that you you pointed out the oxygen tanks that was a really cool answer that you gave but as you see there was more information that we always can learn that we didn't know before did you know the name of this orbiter ,well i guess i didn't really like do the reading exactly i kind of just like had my knowledge but um so i guess no 
220.1,Luis,,yeah well we always have a good background knowledge of space and that's really cool that you're interested in it but we can always learn new names for machinery and things like that so that's why we read this passage together in hopes that you would learn more ,okay gotcha 
120.4,Jazmin,,um so does class remember what the name of that machine was called student do you remember the name ,yeah okay i think so when we were rereading i saw that in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
120.4,Jazmin,,yes perfect good job ,so um 
120.4,Farrah,,yes student ,okay so here's the thing though um so it i was saying that it was the microscope that discovered the water i'm not sure like what my answer is wrong 
130.3,Farrah,,okay yeah i understand you were really close but it wasn't the exact answer that was to the question your answer would have been so there was a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water so you were almost right but the machine itself that they used was called a lunar orbiter and that's what they used to see the ice deposits ,oh so like they like found it using the lunar orbiter and then they used the microscope like like to see it 
130.1,Chris,,yeah they looked at it really close with the microscope so you weren't exactly wrong there was just a more specific answer um so yeah good job student ,um yeah so like here's my thinking like man like so my dad like took me to nasa and we checked out like all these different exhibits and stuff like that which was awesome but like here's the thing like um like like what student was saying like so i know that they have to use like the astronauts when they go out on the moon they have to use like oxygen tanks and um like you know like spacesuits and fuel so like i guess i'm wondering like isn't that what they used to discover the to discover the the the water 
110.2,Jazmin,,well it definitely helped them because you know in space there's not a lot of oxygen so you have to have those tanks to help you breathe so that was one equipment that they did use Jazmin? ,yeah so i was wondering with my very first answer when i said it was the small machine why was that not right 
510.1,Oliver,,but again you want to use context clues to find the exact name of that small machine well that was right too when we're given questions we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are the more sense that they make later on ,um yeah so um unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we went to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us like sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher he says we give him stress hives and you were so thoughtful in the way that you like um like student i'm not sure he did the reading and i feel like i'm you really were were kind with his answer and really helped like all of our answers like worked on one another tp kind of get a class answer together which was pretty cool because like sometimes we don't always listen to each other so it was really neat to like listen to each other's answers thanks to the way you were teaching us so just wanted to thank you 
510.1,Oliver,,well thank you class you class did a great job ,hi 
510.1,Oliver,,hello ,how are you 
510.1,Oliver,,i'm good how are you ,we're good we're discussing um what equipment id scientists use to discover water on the moon 
120.2,Luis,,perfect and what equipment did they use student ,um okay so here's the thing um i think that um i should really be in this class because i don't really need any help like i basically know like all about space and so like i kind of like have all this knowledge so i don't think i really need the help okay 
110.3,Luis,,well you might not need help but you might be able to help me help the rest of the class and you'll be able to share all your knowledge ,that sounds good 
230.1,Jazmin,,alright so let's see student could you explain your answer to the rest of the class like how did you come up with your answer ,okay so my answer was the nasa scientists small machine and i noticed that in the reading that they they had that that was a piece of equipment that was used to discover water like they uses the the machine to go in like to find the water 
230.1,Farrah,,all right student i noticed you said that the scientists were using a microscope um could you and student try and explain why you picked microscope ,um yeah okay so basically the microscope so i was looking at paragraph three and they said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i i thought you have to be able to see the water in order to discover it so i said the microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,that is that's a very interesting take and it's actually my first read through and answering the question i thought the same thing but i kind of agree with student and saying that they just they brought the machine from the second paragraph to the moon and that machine helped them look into those craters but then the microscope helps you more analyze the water that they already found ,so um yeah it's it's speaking to me since i think but i'm not quite sure why my answer is wrong because didn't they have to use the microscope to discover it 
210.4,Farrah,,so the way i looked at it was nasa send their small machine out to the moon and they analyze those craters and they found water and i think the piece of using the microscope was for if i traveled to the moon with them and wanted to see the water for myself i would have to check under the microscope but the small machine did it without having to send people out there ,oh gotcha okay 
210.4,Chris,,student ,yeah okay so like here's the thing like i'm kind of thinking like um so i went to nasa with my dad and we went and looked at all the equipment and stuff so i know that there's a lot of there's like a lot of equipment that they use like spacesuits and oxygen tanks and masks and stuff so i guess like did they not use those things 
140.1,Chris,,that is very a very good way to look at that teacher i feel like the way the question was phrased they were specifically talking about the oliverice that discovered the water not the behind the scenes like um because yes they would use all of that but kind of how i think about it um like a refrigerator if somebody asked you what keeps your food cold use that you would say like the refrigerator you wouldn't say the plug that plugs into the outlet that supplies the power ,okay okay i think oh i should probably read the the reading like a little closer maybe 
210.2,Chris,,Because the question. I feel like is a little bit more specific on what discovered the water because you could also argue that the astronaut discovered the water ,yeah yeah i guess you could like and i guess it's like um i guess just wondering like did the astronaut go or was it like an unmanned probe you know what i mean 
120.4,Oliver,,right exactly all right before our little time is up and we need a good clear concise answer class have one that they would like to share student ,yes okay so the question was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon and the scientists used a small machine to discover the water on the moon and they use the microscope um wait student can you help yeah so um yeah so basically they they use the small machine to discover the water and they use the microscope to like study it 
120.4,Jazmin,,all right ,yes student basically we have to go to lunch but i just i just wanted to thank you really quickly for working with us today and specifically like you really were patient with class like sometimes we give like our science teacher like he says they're stress hives and i feel like you were really patient with us and you also they were really interested in our answers like even when we weren't like totally correct or like we were sort of figuring it out like you really listen to all of us which is kind of cool so do you think thank you so much 
120.4,Luis,,you're very welcome ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Luis,,sorry who was talking ,that was me student 
230.1,Luis,,okay well student if you already know a lot about space can you go ahead and explain why you pick the answer that you did ,yeah sure okay so i was talking about how scientists need a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks you know cuz they can't breathe on the moon and so they're gonna need oxygen tanks to go on the moon to do any type of exploration you know um did you hear my answer teacher or do you want me to say it again 
230.3,Luis,,i heard up until where you said the you know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks because they can't breathe in space so we need oxygen ,yeah exactly you can't go to the mon without an oxygen tank 
410.2,Luis,,but i'm a little confused on how the oxygen tank helped them discover the water on the moon because to me they needed the oxygen tanks to get to space and to be able to survive in space i don't see how oxygen tanks discovered the water ,well i mean they can't walk around on the moon without oxygen tanks to breathe 
410.2,Jazmin,,right i think the question was a little bit wanting more specifics on what oliverice actually discovered the water the point of the oxygen tank is to supply oxygen to the astronauts i don't think the intention is for it to discover water ,yeah yeah now okay teacher 
410.2,Jazmin,,yes ,i don't know why my answer is wrong 
410.2,Jazmin,,nasa sent a small machine Because they did send a small machine called think I was a probe Or something. so i would say that your answer was just a little bit incomplete it was lacking just a small detail on what specific machine they sent ,okay i guess i thought we were all here cuz our answers were wrong i thought that's why the teacher told us to come to this small class 
230.3,Chris,,okay i think we just wanted to have just a deeper discussion and the the question so what equipment did scientist us to discover a water feel like we just wanted to have a just a discussion on what we all thought the answers were student over there said oxygen tanks now that is equipment and it did help them you know get to the moon to discover the water but he needed to be a little bit more specific on the actual equipment that discovered the water and your answer said they sent a small machine which is true it's a little bit more detailed than luis's we just need that extra bit of i guess what specific machine and i'm sure that student and student might be thinking well i picked a specific tool they said that they wanted a microscope yeah student ,i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
410.2,Oliver,,"right You might have all that equipment and you might need all that equipment to get there, but I think the question is actually asking for, if I was holding that tool in my hand right now, would it discover water. so back to you savannah and student the microscope helps them look closer at the water but the microscope itself didn't actually discover the water okay sorry it keeps cutting out ",you were about to tell us your suggestion to all of us 
410.2,Oliver,,"You read the read the question first, maybe look at some key words. So like this question. So equipment. So, all right, I'm looking for equipment when I go to read. And then I'm going to read the passage and maybe highlight or circle any equipment that I see as I am reading, and then go back to the question and read it again. I think. I think everybody had you know, good effort on answering the question, but I think we all could have answered the question better and more specific. ",okay oh i just looked at the time and it's time for us to go to lunch um but thank you for taking the time to work with us 
410.2,Luis,,hello ,hi i just want to remind you my dad is an astronaut 
110.1,Luis,,well that's really cool yeah student ,i know a lot about space 
140.1,Chris,,oh that's really cool well fun fact when i was in first grade i wanted to be an astronaut so obviously i didn't live up to that but you know that was my goal ,you're a really good teacher 
230.1,Oliver,,because the question said is there convincing evidence that you know water is valuable and okay so real quick i'm just clarifying what the question is really asking in the actual passage it says water is a valuable resource and then they list a whole bunch of reasons you know why its valuable so i think the question is really asking is are you convinced that there that is valuable and i think that three of you student student and even i think you all had said yes it's valuable and you gave one of their reasons and i think that was great but i'm a little concerned with student and student on your responses because you both said no there was not convincing evidence so i want to know from either of you why you say there was not enough to convince you that the water is valuable ,okay but it's not it's not ready yet because i'm one you look in paragraph paragraph six it says making this plan will take a lot of time and money um they need to study the moon surface and built new equipment do you think it would be a good investment you'll decide well no it's not ready cause it'll take a lot of time and money so so no it's my answer 
210.4,Jazmin,,i like that you said no because it's going to take a lot of time and money but the question you answered was do you think it would be a good investment the question was is water valuable because one. We have a lot of water here on Earth. So why do we want water from the moon and to um student yes and two that's a lot of time time and money and as a as a teacher and we know we don't have a lot of money why would we want to spend extra money on something we already have ,"Well, I also think that he could use water to grow things so we can have a moon garden on the moon. "
130.3,Jazmin,,we could and then i guess you would say that it would be a good investment because they would could grow things out side of the planet but would it be on me i guess what kind of space plant would it be because earth plants need oxygen to or i guess carbon dioxide that we give off so i'm not sure if that's a space for them to grow ,yeah that's a good point i didn't think of how the heck 
130.3,Jazmin,,let's see ,i don't know if you still wanted to talk to student and student but well i think that my answer was a good answer 
120.4,Jazmin,,your answer was what ,good i think i had the right answer i said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water and and that's true and they talk about in the first paragraph that astronauts could drink the water so why am i in this class 
310.1,Chris,,"um well as i said for the first question i think we were put in a class just to have some discussion because everybody's answer was different so i think that you and student and student all said that yes it's valuable and then you gave a reason why you thought it was valuable so i like that you justified your answer So I mean he's not wrong, Because he answered, whether it was a good investment. I don't think you may answer the actual question of water being valuable, but I think we all had um i like that we all had our reasons and justified our reasons you said yeah and then you pulled your evidence from the text student ",great great i just thought of something else okay from the story water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah and that's what student said he said it could be useful because it can be broken down now he could have extended his answer a little bit more and said what is valuable about breaking it down and said what is valuable about breaking it down and the text says that it can be used as rocket fuel ,i don't think i saw that part i don't remember that part either honestly rocket fuel oh yeah it does it says it right here you're right where do you see that student middle of the paragraph it says oxygen hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel oh ok ok so i just have to add that sentence to my answer and then my answer is ok all i have to do is add the thing about rocket fuel to my answer water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and they make rocket fuel that's it 
310.1,Oliver,,"that's the only thing i would have done i mean the question was really yes or no and you said yes it can be broken down but if i were reading it or grading the question i'd want to know what's valuable about the water being able to be broken down so you need to include that in your answer and you gave it how it could be valuable, but maybe not so much how it was used. So that's the only thing I would add to your answer. of the water and how the water could be used ",okay okay it's time for us to go to lunch um i did want to say all thank you for explaining what all of us need it to work on i'm like i know that i didn't answer the right question um but even didn't answer the question but he needed more details and his answer 
310.1,Oliver,,no ,okay well we'll see you next time bye 
310.1,Oliver,,okay hello student student student student and student ,hi 
150.1,Jazmin,,okay you've been we've been reading about the water on the moon and we talked about the moon is a desert and we are going to think a little bit thorough okay do you know what thorough is no so we are going to think a little bit yes ,can you say it again 
220.1,Luis,,we are have been talking about that the moon is a desert right and you answered your questions and we are going to discuss and see how did we understand this questions so we're going to discuss and listen to our friends responses so we're going to begin with student student i like yes ,oh can i ask a question real quick 
220.1,Luis,,yes my friend ,okay so here's the here's the thing like i know a lot about space already like i know all this stuff and so i don't really think i should be in this class because i already know all about space 
110.3,Farrah,,good but every time we learn something we continue growing and learning so we are going to listen to our friends okay thank you for your input and i'm glad that you know a lot about space and we can learn from you right right our friends we can learn from him ,yeah we can do that 
230.1,Farrah,,okay so student you told us that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely did you understand need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely did you understand you answer ,yeah so i my answer was in paragraph three and i said on that said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so you need the the microscope to see the water 
230.1,Oliver,,do we agree with her answer now student could you talk to us about your answer you said that you circled the same as student what did you understand ,um so yeah i basically did the same thing as student i looked at the same paragraph and it said that um the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so i figured that the equipment that they studied the um the water with was a microscope 
230.1,Chris,,perfect excellent okay student you summarized very well you understand that answer ,yeah so like i guess there's like all these craters they got all this kind of water and all this stuff like um so they got like lots of water on the moon 
230.2,Chris,,okay and you understand what equipment they used ,um yeah like i think they just use basically like um like spacesuits and like i know cuz i went to nasa so like they use like oxygen tanks and and masks and suits like to go flying around in space 
110.1,Chris,,and we also read in the paragraphs what else did you what other equipment should they be they use and other tools okay thank you for that input okay ,"um well i kind of know about space um i didn't really read that Yeah, I can. I can do that. "
110.1,Jazmin,,okay and student ,i was just wondering like why my answer might be wrong because it sounds like like farrah's answer and oliver's answer might be right with a microscope but i thought it was the small machine that did the discovery 
230.2,Jazmin,,and what else did you did you read that it's good ,well i read it in the second paragraph nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,i love how you elaborated a little bit more on your answer that is great what was the name of the small machine ,okay so it was the lunar orbiter so is that what i got wrong is that didn't say the lunar orbiter 
130.1,Jazmin,,no it's not wrong okay you just need to elaborate a little bit more okay ,okay gotcha 
130.1,Jazmin,,okay thank you ,so 
130.1,Jazmin,,and student excuse me student yes ,so i'm just wondering like which one is like so am i right about the lunar orbiter is the how they discovered the water 
110.4,Jazmin,,those are the tools that they are using to discover water on the moon ,okay 
110.4,Jazmin,,okay nasa sent a small machine ,did they use the microscope to discover it 
130.2,Oliver,,what could can somebody help student did we read about that student ,yeah so basically um i think that well it sounds like the microscope like yeah i think the microscope is how they found it like i think they use both of them to find it they use the orbiter and the microscope to discover the water 
210.4,Luis,,okay they use several types of of of equipment okay thank you student you use very good background information we know that you know about space and can you remember what other equipment they use or other tools that we read about ,well yeah like i think that the thing that they did was they had to use like spacesuits and stuff like so i didn't really even read it i just kind of knew that like they had to use that stuff you know they had to use like space suits and stuff 
110.2,Jazmin,,but we're we're expanding our thinking we want to learn more okay so it's important that we read so that we can discuss and learn a little bit more about water on the moon exactly can we do that ,um we can unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we left i just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us sometimes like our teachers are always so patient with us but you were really patient and you also made us all i think feel like our answers were really worthwhile even if we weren't totally accurate so i just wanted to thank you because that feels really good when we're trying to learn something so thank you so much 
110.2,Luis,,thank you for listening my friends and student i would like you to get back to me tomorrow with the answers so you can read your paper okay have a great lunch you class okay yes student ,um yeah so i basically like i already know like all sorts of stuff about space and i don't really feel like i need to be in this class because i know all kinds of stuff 
110.3,Luis,,okay we are going to use your background knowledge okay we've talked about background knowledge in you can help us with more information about what we're learning okay ,yeah i can do that 
230.1,Farrah,,okay so reflecting in our answer okay student can you please um now now that that i've seen that you answered you've used some of the words that i'm that were you you provided some words microscope right and that was one of the tools that they are using what yeah how did you come up with that answer can you share with your your students student ,yeah yeah so i came up with the answer because okay so i was looking in paragraph he and i saw that basically by they said that the water that they found on the moon is microscopic and you couldn't see it unless you keep your microphone so i thought that's how they that's how they found the water 
110.1,Chris,,okay okay thank you yes student ,oh um well actually i think student was pinnacle 
110.1,Jazmin,,excuse me ,just said that i think he raised his hand by accident so what i was gonna say was i was just gonna say that like i don't really understand like why my answers wrong 
220.1,Jazmin,,okay i am sorry that you believe that your answer is wrong your everybody's answer is accepted okay and we are going to move on and to improve our answers to learn better about our subject okay don't feel it's wrong thank you for for your input okay now we are going to think of strategies of ways that we can improve our answer okay and find those words in our writing that is going to help us connect and learn better okay i want we want to see the process of how are we going to reflect on our answer in think to improve our response can we do that ,yeah 
120.4,Oliver,,okay deb can you share with your friends what was your response ,yeah so basically my response was i circled the same thing as survey 
130.2,Oliver,,okay and do you think that you could improve that in response what could we do to improve that response because i am concerned i think that you need to read a little bit more and if you have any questions we can help somebody else can help out ,so yeah i wasn't sure how to make my answer better 
130.2,Farrah,,can somebody help yeah student ,i think that you were saying right well you should use evidence and say like where we we found her answer is that right 
110.4,Oliver,,mm hmm there ,um well yeah i could do that because i actually saw a lot of the same stuff as student so basically what i saw was in the same thing that third paragraph where they were saying that you wouldn't even be able to see the water if you were looking like right at it so that made me think that you had to use a microscope to find the water that to discover the water okay 
420.2,Oliver,,"So I suggest that you write, even though it's this almost the same as your ",Okay. 
420.2,Chris,,yes student ,yes so i was just gonna say that i went with my dad and so i know that like scientists use a lot of equipment like you know like masks such said oxygen tanks and i don't know where that goes in my answer 
150.1,Oliver,,okay but there is an experience that you you had when you went to nasa and you can connect that with what you are learning thank you for sharing that okay yes ,um unfortunately we have to go to our next class but we just really wanted to thank you for working with us thank you so much bye bye thank 
150.1,Oliver,,you for trying your best hey class how are you ,we're doing well how are you 
220.1,Luis,,good thing so we're here to talk about this information that we've just read and are learning about you have a question student ,um yeah so here's the thing like um i know all about space like a lot about space so like i don't think i really need to be here i don't need any help with anything 
110.1,Luis,,okay well i would love to hear that information that you can give us from this question that we've kind of want to talk about now okay ,um so yeah okay so what i know from my like understanding and like my reading and everything i know about space is that you have to have like an oxygen tank and you have to have a space suits and like all that stuff if you're going to go up into space and like you're out 
230.1,Luis,,right you do have to have those things are question is about what the equipment the scientists use to discover water on the moon if they're on the moon we know that they're using the oxygen tanks and stuff like that but what did they need to use to find out about the water on the moon can you tell me a little bit more about that ,maybe i didn't maybe i didn't really read the text very much because i kind of knew about space 
420.2,Luis,,why is it important to make sure to read all of the information before we try to answer the question ,yeah yeah i think so 
130.2,Farrah,,okay so let's go back and talk about it it said that scientists found that there's evidence of water really deep in them in the moon's craters but that when they sent the machine up there to look for those ice that it was tiny tiny little droplets that you can only see with a microscope so what can you tell me from that information that i just gave you what other tools they might be using to learn about the water on the moon student can you help him out there ,so i think that they they use the microscope to discover the water like that's how they they found it so i'm not really sure like why is my answer like um not right 
110.2,Farrah,,um but can you tell me why they needed a microscope to find this water your answer is very right they did use a microscope ,oh yeah okay so in paragraph three you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so you have to see it you can't see it without microscope 
210.3,Chris,,very good and you looked back in the text to find your answer and to get all the information can class else answer that question though why did they need a microscope to see the water was there a lot of water in the craters or was there just a little bit of water in the craters ,yeah so i thought i think there's a lot of water in the craters so i think they um they just wanted to study more closely because there's a bunch of water 
230.2,Chris,,okay so let's go back to our text and in paragraph two the very last sentence it says these icy deposits are very small so i see deposits are very small does it seem like we have a lot of water or a little bit of water ,i guess maybe not very much water so maybe it's not like full of water 
150.1,Oliver,,right you're absolutely right we just need to make sure what we're looking back in our information to make sure we can find the right answers make sense ,yeah 
230.1,Jazmin,,okay so let's see student you said that nasa sent a small machine can you tell me why you thought it was a small machine ,yeah okay so in paragraph two in the first sentence it says a nasa sent a small machine called a lunar oribtor to investigate 
110.4,Jazmin,,good job ,that's what that's what i think cuz is like investigate's like discover so i think that's what they said discovered the water 
230.1,Jazmin,,so that's one thing that they used and so we can also collaborate and talk about what that small machine did right ,yeah yeah 
110.1,Chris,,that's very good good job student you have a question ,oh i guess it's not really a question um i mean i guess what we kind of talked about this but like well like i guess like i'm like i went to nasa and when i went to nasa with my dad like i saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so um did they not use those things 
210.4,Chris,,just because it's not in the text doesn't mean that it wasn't being used because we kind of know like you said you saw that they use those things to be in space and so it talks about that nasa sent a small machine that nasa sent a small machine it didn't say that it sent the astronauts to space does that make sense if an astronaut were in space then they would use those things because we can't breathe up there and we need those to help us but they didn't send the astronauts they sent a machine ,i guess i didn't really that makes sense i didn't really read it closely enough because i think i hear what you're saying 
510.1,Luis,,i think we've all kind of learned a lesson when we're reading the information we have to pay attention to it and not just assume does that make sense we know we all know different things about space but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being given ,um yeah so like here's the thing um we have to go to lunch unfortunately but before we go to lunch i just wanted to like thank you because when um sometimes um our science teacher gets really frustrated with us and says that we give him stress hives and you were so patient with us even though we kind of were trying to like figure out all these different answers and stuff and like um you you were very like patient with me because like i didn't i didn't read the text but i like i had ideas so i just really appreciate like that you were just like really patient with us and really we're spending time to help us so thank you so much 
130.1,Luis,,i appreciate your honesty alright so the reason i pulled you back here's because i kind of want to get a little deeper into what we were talking about our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so student i really like what you said with nasa send a small machine you are on the right direction so i want class to look at the text yes student ,um excuse me but i shouldn't be in this class i already know about space 
110.3,Luis,,well i think that we don't know exactly everything quite yet we can always learn more but you can use some of your knowledge from what you know about space to help us ,okay 
120.1,Jazmin,,all right if you class will look at the passage if you look at number the number two paragraph i want us to take a second and reread that paragraph give me a thumbs up after you've read it ,the principal doesn't like us to do thumbs up but he said that we can just look at the teacher when we're finished 
120.1,Chris,,that is fine with me too alright it looks like we're all ready ,"Okay, we talked. I said-- "
120.1,Chris,,student if you'll join student and student yes ,we just talked about it and i said that it was the craters the craters of was what they used and and student was talking about how astronauts have a lot of different machines that they use and then and then we were done 
230.1,Luis,,what kind of machines do they use can you go a little further with that student ,yeah sure um they use oxygen masks and they use spacesuits and they use the like the space shuttle itself that's that's also a machine to you want you want me to say more because i know like a lot more machines too 
210.4,Luis,,let's look at that paragraph number two what machine did they use in that paragraph ,um let me see nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter oh so it's a lunar orbiter 
120.2,Luis,,lunar orbiter that's right so what equipment did the scientists to use to discover water on the moon ,a lunar orbiter 
210.4,Farrah,,a lunar orbiter that's right and let's look at number three i want you ,excuse me 
210.4,Farrah,,let's look at number two this lunar orbiter looks like for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small can you yes ,i'm sorry to interrupt but i don't understand why my answer's wrong 
210.3,Farrah,,let's figure answers student so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely you are correct miss savanna you need a microscope to look very closely but what did they use to discover it with before they saw the microscope ,before they saw the microscope 
210.3,Farrah,,yeah before they had the microscope they have to use what to discover it ,well normally use the microscope to see the things um 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah let's look at number two that paragraph number two again read that first sentence for me ,um nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate keep reading or stop there 
410.1,Chris,,stop right there so although you're you are correct with you need a microscope to look at her really closely what it equip they're asking what equipment do the scientists use to disover it you are correct with you need a microscope to look at it really closely but they're asking what equipment do the scientists use to discover it the microscope is equipment that they looked really closely at the water with but did they discover the water with the microscope ,um i went to nasa with my dad so i know that like scientists use a lot of equipment like um oxygen tanks well ehtan said that one and like masks they have to wear a mask because they can't breathe in space and um they have to they have to wear these certain types of shoes because there isn't any gravity either so that's all like the stuff that they wear is equipment too 
110.2,Chris,,that is equipment you're correct they have to use all those things before they can start their explorations that is right student ,yeah 
150.1,Oliver,,does class else have any questions about their answer ,um i'm not i think i'm still not sure about because i have the same answer as student so how did we get the answer i'm not sure i'm sorry 
210.4,Oliver,,let's look back oliveron let's look what was the question say the question for me again oliveron ,it said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.4,Oliver,,so what is it asking us ,for the kind of equipment that the scientists used 
210.1,Oliver,,yes it's asking for this equipment the scientist use but not just the equipment the scientists use but the equipment the scientists used for what ,um equipment scientistis used to discover water on the moon 
230.2,Oliver,,so it's using the equipment to do what ,to discover the water 
230.2,Oliver,,all right so did they use the microscope to discover the water ,um oh okay oh yeah i guess it says that you use a microscope to look at the water all right 
230.2,All,,no problem student ,well i i was looking at the clock just now and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i do want to say thank you for helping me to look really closely at the question cuz i didn't i didn't realize i missed part of a question so um thank you bye 
120.3,Luis,,so my next question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable i want you to go back and look at the passage it says water is a valuable resource i want you to reread that and raise your hand after you've reread that passage student are we rereading make sure you're reading our passage ,wow i was just thinking like my dad is an astronaut so i know all this stuff you know 
150.1,Luis,,so maybe we can read to help us understand a little bit more about what your dad does ,yeah okay yeah that sounds cool 
120.4,Jazmin,,remember raise your hand after you've read that part now let's see is does class want to share why they think water could be valuable student why don't you share with us ,well i was thinking that you could use water to grow things so that we could have like a garden can you imagine how beautiful it woud be 
210.2,Jazmin,,that would be very beautiful very did you find that in the text student ,um lets see i was looking at hmm i guess well i was just thinking about what you could do with water and seeing it's not really in there i was just thinking that if you could use the water that's one thing 
120.4,Chris,,But what I want you to do is I want you to go back. I want you to underline at least one thing that they said was useful. And if you want to amaze me. I want you to underline two things and raise your hand. Once you're done. Raise your hand. Once you're done. Thank you Chris for raising your hand. thank you student thank you student thank you student and student so who would like to share something that they underlined student what did you underline ,so i said that you could wait okay um water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen which is a big deal 
230.1,Chris,,and why is that a big deal how what can i use the hydrogen and oxygen for ,well you could show you can breathe oxygen and you can drink the water that's a big deal 
230.2,Chris,,that's right where did you find that in the passage show us where you found that ,it's this paragraph five but i guess it's the second paragraph this next one it says water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts could breathe the oxygen oh and you could use it as rocket fuel 
230.3,Oliver,,right so they can use the oxygen to breathe and then they can use the hydrogen as or do you want to add to that student ,unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i really just wanted to thank you and i wanted to thank you particularly for helping us to clarify our thinking and really helping us like i think that all of us felt like our ideas were really valued today and it really felt like we had time to explain like what we were thinking about in our different ideas like just wanted to thank you for doing that it was really cool and it was really nice to meet you 
120.2,Luis,,thank you student alright so we just talked read the article water on the moon and the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon student hi ,hi yeah shouldn't be on this class i already know all about space 
230.1,Jazmin,,do you really like what ,like lots of things um okay okay well i know that in order for the astronauts to go up into space they have to be on a space shuttle but then the space shuttle also has this other part to it that like has to fall off you know when it's um in order to in order for it to like to go up into space and then i also know that there isn't any oxygen in space and then i also know that there isn't any oxygen in space so will the the astronauts have to work spacesuits until that some of the kind of equipment that they have to wear a spacesuit so that they can breathe and then we're trying to figure out if we can like do a mission to mars and if there's life on mars where we can read them live um because if we destroy this planet then we might have to move to mars 
210.4,Farrah,,"right We're getting a little bit off topic here, but Luis you said that astronauts have to use oxygen tanks in space shuttles, and those are types of equipment so you're right about that. mainly in let's see paragraph two right you remember that it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small and that means the moon is still the driest desert on earth the water that is found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely alright so they use oxygen tanks but what other things do they use in the article ",um they use microscopes because that was that was in my answer and i don't understand why my answers wrong 
210.3,Farrah,,okay so student they do use microscopes right but do they use the microscopes on the moon or would they have to maybe collect the samples and then we'll get back to earth ,um well in the story it says that well it's talking about the moon and then it says the water they found is microscopic you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so there they are talking about the water on the moon 
210.3,Farrah,,you're using your deep reading skills to really engage with the text and that's awesome but is that the type of equipment that they used to discover or investigate the water or is there a better answer ,reads to herself the moon is still the driest desert on earth the water that is found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i'm not sure 
210.4,Farrah,,not sure okay well you just read paragraph three again maybe let's backtrack a little bit before number three what about number two ,okay reads to herself nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater the ice deposits are very small okay i mean it talks about a machine and this one it talks about a machine and equipment is machine but it doesn't talk about the water 
210.4,Farrah,,it doesn't talk about the water but before that it talks about how they find evidence of the water right ,Okay. oh yeah it says investigate 
230.2,Farrah,,investigate right so we have to investigate our evidence and what are we using to investigate our evidence ,oh i'm not sure 
210.3,Chris,,you're not sure okay well let's read the paragraph together again okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small there any type of equipment they might have used to investigate the water does class know ,i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and spacesuits and masks 
120.2,Chris,,right student and that's sort of what student said too right so that's great that you're using your background knowledge awesome right but can you find what the what nasa used to investigate the water on the moon ,yeah yeah i thought student said they use like a small machine called a lunar lunar orbiter to investigate 
230.1,Chris,,right and is that lunar orbiter on the moon ,ah well it's a story and i mean the stories about water on the moon so um oh yeah yeah it says it in the second sentence but it will land at the moon yeah 
130.3,Oliver,,looks for ice deposits right so could the lunar orbiter be the type of equipment the scientists used you class think so all right and they use the microscope to look at the small teeny tiny deposit of water that they had but to find this equipment on the moon or to find the water on the moon ,they use the equipment which is the lunar orbiter student what's up i'm sorry i just heard the timer and i was looking over at the clock and that's our bell at told us on it's it's time to go to lunch but i do want to say thank you for helping us to keep looking back i thought story cuz i thought that i had a good answer but then i listened to you kept telling student and student to look back and look and read it again and read it again so thank you for that 
130.3,Luis,,thank you class ,bye oh you're welcome bye um so i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know like all this stuff about space so like i don't think i need to do this 
150.1,Oliver,,well so even though you know a lot about space and you know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and microscopes and things like that it's really cool but you have kind of missed the answer about what equipment we need to discover the water on the moon and that's kind of what we're going to be talking about here today so i really liked reading all of your answers um and before we begin what was the most interesting thing you class found in the article student ,um i thought the most interesting thing that i saw was the idea that like there was like water up there that like even though it's like very like microscopic that that may be um it could still be used or it could still be something that like is enough that we could do something with it 
310.1,Chris,,awesome and i love your use of the vocabulary term microscopic that's really good ,um yeah i was really interested in seeing like how they found the water they were trying to like you know what i mean like how they manage to look for it 
110.1,Jazmin,,yeah that's really cool to student what about you ,um so i was really interested in like i got like really about how be thinking how cool it would be if you could grow this garden that would be so pretty 
110.2,Luis,,it would and it would be really useful too student what about you ,um yeah so i think for me like i was really interested in seeing like what kind of equipment they could use and i was thinking about like you know that they have other equipment that they use that's not necessarily in the reading but but i know we're supposed to focus on the so yeah 
310.1,Farrah,,that's exactly right and i love that you're using that prior knowledge that's really good ,um so me well i actually have a question i was not sure like i was thinking a lot about it and i still don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.3,Farrah,,look really closely at what okay well that's perfect student so let's go ahead and get into those answers so you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to close to look really closely ,i'm really closely at the water 
210.4,Farrah,,water right but the question is how do we find the water so what was used what are the scientists used to find the water ,oh that's interesting so okay so the way i was thinking was like that if you i guess okay so if you had to find the water did you have to see it or was there another way maybe to detect 
120.3,Farrah,,that's a really good point so to answer your question further let's go ahead and look back in the article so paragraph one talks about how scientists thought the moon was a desert okay but now i know that's not true because in paragraph two it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small scientists said that when ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water so using the information in paragraph two what equipment did the scientists use to find that water to investigate if there was water on the moon that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day ,okay so to investigate that was the lunar orbiter right 
420.2,Chris,,right right so we use the lunar orbiter to find the water okay and we have to use the microscope to look at it so it's really important when we are answering questions even though you found part of the question stem and your answer you've got to look around it to make sure that's the total ,so i went to nasa with my dad and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that and i guess i was wondering like did they use that to discover the water as well 
410.3,Chris,,they would have to use a combination of all those things but this article is mainly about the lunar orbiter that they use and what we can do with the water once they found it ,oh 
150.1,Jazmin,,yeah you got it ,That's it. So I just have to say like the full sentence. 
420.2,Jazmin,,yeah sometimes that works but sometimes we have to look around too so yes it is a small machine and the small machine may answer a question because we have to also ask a small machine that did what ,um it discovered the water 
210.4,Jazmin,,right and what was that machine called ,it was it was called the lunar orbiter 
110.4,Luis,,the lunar orbiter that's right ,which unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us a lot of fun thank you so much um yeah so i think i got all this stuff figured out pretty good so i think i'm good 
210.4,Luis,,i loved your answer you really used the details in the article you went back and re-read to find that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that's exactly right and the article talks about how the hydrogen might be able to be used for a rocket fuel which is awesome i think that's really interesting don't you class ,oh yeah it's awesome yeah it's really cool that that's a possibility 
210.2,Oliver,,it is cool so for us to talk about the question just for a minute before we really dive into those answers so is there convincing evidence so remember convincing evidence means that we're looking for details are in the article what it says directly okay that water on the moon could be valuable now this is a tricky question okay because valuable we have to use the definition that they gave us in the article for that word okay so let's look back to paragraph let's see paragraph four right we're under this heading where it says water is valid a valuable resource so it says water on the moon would be a valuable or very important resource so what is the meaning of valuable there student ,important like something that's useful or important yeah 
230.2,Chris,,exactly right so something that is useful or important already so something that is useful or important now taking that in mind i would like to talk about your answers just for a second so let's see student and student you both said it's not ready yet or it would take a long time for the scientists to get it and even those both of those things are true so what are some things all of you that water could be used for on the moon like it says in paragraph four and five your answer doesn't really encompass how water on the moon might be valuable can we look back for some details student ,some details well okay so we know that like there's a few things that you could do because you could like you could use it to make like rocket fuel you could drink the water there's a lot of stuff you could you could do with it 
230.3,Jazmin,,yeah you can drink it can make rocket fuel everything else student ,reach every reader you can drink it you can make rocket fuel oh you can breathe it they said that you can breathe it if you make oxygen 
310.1,Farrah,,that's exactly right so like you said your answer student the water is valuable and we really need to discuss why it looks like you've done that in your answer so great job ,i think i just i'm still a little confused 
410.2,Farrah,,okay well let's go back and reread so water on the moon will be a valuable or very important resource it can be useful in a lot of ways for example future astronauts could drink this water water is heavy and it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things moon water could be useful and other ways water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts can breathe oxygen hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel my concern is that you want it to be right now and you're not thinking about the future ,it seems like it would take a lot of money and time it seems like it would be really hard to get class to work together and make it happen but i do think i see what you mean that it is like valuable in theory like no matter when it is 
110.2,Oliver,,that's right so remember back to our question we just have to find convincing evidence for its value and like you said we've done that right we have tons of ways that it can be used but you're right it will take a lot of time and a lot of money so it might not be worked at student ,um well i actually read somewhere that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so maybe it would be useful faster than student and i thought 
210.3,Luis,,that's true i haven't read that but i'll be sure to look it up that's really interesting that i'm glad you brought that into the discussion see um let's talk about sorry i have to keep looking back at my picture um let's see student you said water can be you can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen so those are very important things however is that the best piece of evidence that we can grab from the article to use ,well i guess i'm not sure like when you say the best the best evidence like what do you mean exactly 
210.3,Oliver,,okay so if i just told you water was split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen did that tell you any information about it on the moon or about astronauts ,"i see like i gotta say like i gotta say the whole sentence like you like work with student when she needed to say like the whole thing about the lunar orbiter and the small machine like i need to say like what my opinion is and then i need to say like what it could be used is that right Um, well, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. Before we go to lunch. I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you for helping us to create much more complete answers and like in particular you really asked us to like use evidence from the text and to make sure that we work on yeah backing up our statements with with like actual evidence and things and i think that like everybody's answers got a lot better because of the way that you lead us through that that's the discussion and you also really made us feel valued by making sure that we all like felt like you know like what we were sharing was worthwhile and that was really cool and it was really interesting like to learn new stuff and and to talk about it as a class so thank you so much "
120.1,Luis,,thank you i appreciate that ok so student you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so look back in paragraph 3 ,excuse me 
120.1,Luis,,yes ,i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.3,Chris,,oh yes sorry wrong student i said the wrong name student look back into paragraph 3 and can you read that aloud for me about what they use to find the water in space on the moon ,yeah sure ok paragraph 3 that means the moon is still drier than the rest of oh sorry ok that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Chris,,right so would you be able to see it with your regular eye would you be able to look down at it ,no no you need a microscope to look at it 
120.2,Chris,,exactly so can you now answer what type of equipment they needed to discover water on the moon ,well i had said that they could do it with the craters i said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
210.3,Chris,,right but did they after reading that last paragraph we just read ,well in that one it was talking about a microscope and how it said the water is microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it you need a microscope to look really closely at it 
210.2,Farrah,,right so the question is asking us what type of equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon so what type of equipment did they have to have in order if it was there to see it ,oh excuse me 
210.2,Farrah,,yes ,i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Farrah,,you're right student so what did you say for your answer ,i'd say i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely but the teacher said that we were all over here because we had partial responses to the question but i don't understand why mine has a partial response 
120.4,Oliver,,right because ,yeah and i had the same answer as student i mean not on purpose but i did 
120.3,Farrah,,right so if you look back at that third paragraph can you read that first sentence for me student ,yeah it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth 
210.4,Farrah,,right so is there any water on the moon ,oh no no it's dry it says dry 
230.2,Farrah,,right so did they actually discover that water was on the moon ,the water they found yeah yeah because in the next sentence it says the water they found is microscopic so they did find some water 
120.3,Farrah,,but what does the first sentence say ,it says that it's really dry 
120.2,Farrah,,right but when they were able to discover some how did they discover it ,they said that you need a tool well this was my answer 
120.1,Farrah,,right but what else did you need to know ,where the water is 
110.4,Chris,,yes ,i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.2,Chris,,right but does it mention that in the paragraphs ,oh no 
210.4,Chris,,ok so let's look back in the text it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found within the moon's polar craters so where can we find water on the moon or where can water be found ,in the polar craters that was my answer yeah 
130.1,Chris,,in the polar craters so you've got part of the answer right ,ok 
210.4,Chris,,these craters are dark places where the sun never shines you've got a piece of it so what did they send to investigate the moon's craters nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ,the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Jazmin,,the lunar orbiter so what equipment did they use ,oh ok i got it oh yeah ok so they used the lunar orbiter but then i mean i kind of said that in my answer i said that they sent a small machine 
420.2,Jazmin,,right but did you name the machine did you give specific details ,"no Oh, OK. "
210.3,Luis,,and just like student he had mentioned some as well they use a lot of equipment while that's true is that what they used ,well no i guess it's not in the text that they used it 
420.2,Luis,,so we always have to look back to our text and refer to that when we're trying to find our answers ,miss teacher i just heard the bell so it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just met but i do really appreciate how you kept asking us to go look back at the text over and over again 
420.2,Luis,,right thank you ,yeah well ok thank you bye 
420.2,Luis,,goodbye hello good morning ,morning um yeah so i have a question because like i know all about space already so i don't think i should really be in this class 
150.1,Luis,,think we all should be here i'm so glad that each of you and take your time and completing your task and you know we each of you have varying levels of understanding of the question so each of you are going to have a part where you understood it better than one another and we're going to discuss what we understood does that make sense ,yeah yeah okay i can stick around for that 
220.1,Chris,,okay all right great so here's what we're gonna do class so we're going to talk about a new skill a new skill of circling or underlining keywords from the question that are in the text okay so what was our question can someone read that for me student ,okay so yeah let's see the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
420.1,Farrah,,let's think about keywords in the question think about that on your own and then we will discuss what keywords we see okay who's ready student ,um yeah okay so basically when i was looking at the question some keywords that i was seeing was like equipment that's what i saw that i thought was most important 
110.1,Oliver,,equipment yes that's great and student ,um yeah i agree with student i also saw equipment and i thought like water too was maybe an important word 
130.2,Farrah,,i think so as well water too because we're looking at what was what equipment was used to to find water there any other important words student ,i actually have a question i still don't quite understand why my answer was wrong 
150.1,Luis,,so we're going to discuss that here in just a few moments okay student we're going to discuss why each of your answers for wrong and how we can do better to find the answer ,"Um, yeah. So what I saw was, I was looking at what look like they said like scientific tool. hey said, small machine. And I said those were equipment words. "
120.3,Jazmin,,yes those are great equipment words ok can someone else read me the sentence for those for one of those student can you read me the sentence where it talks about the small machine ,let's see nasa sent a small machine called the lunar obriter to investigate 
120.2,Chris,,right okay so and our question said that nasa they sent something to an equipment to investigate right so what actual equipment did they sebd to investigate water student ,well i was thinking like about you know like the experience that i've had at nasa and stuff and i was thinking that like they must have sent like oxygen tanks and masks and suits with them 
120.2,Jazmin,,"Okay, so now what does it say that they sent. What did they send to investigate. student ",he sent the small machine the lunar orbiter 
220.1,Farrah,,yes exactly okay so let's look back at student answer real quick we're going to go through each of your responses okay so let's look at your response first what did you say ,i said that basically as i said that you need a small a tool called a microscope 
210.3,Farrah,,right so let's look at where it says that its on paragraph three it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope sorry class it says you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely okay so does that say that that's what nasa sent though student ,oh um i guess not 
210.4,Farrah,,i know so now let's look back in paragraph two what does it say that they sent to investigate the water ,on they sent the small machine the lunar orbiter 
210.3,Farrah,,right okay so i can see how you may have a misunderstanding there because it's the say that you would need a tool called a microscope right student but does that say that's what they sent ,yeah i can see that 
210.3,Oliver,,yeah all right student had a question ,um unfortunately we have to go to lunch but we just wanted to thank you so much for working with us 
210.3,All,,ok hi class how are you class today ,yeah i'm good good awesome i'm good too 
210.3,Jazmin,,what did you say ,i'm good too 
210.3,Jazmin,,oh good good can you class tell me your names real quick ,my name is student 
210.3,Chris,,hi student ,i'm student 
210.3,Farrah,,student nice to meet you student ,i'm student 
210.3,Oliver,,hi student ,i'm student 
210.3,Luis,,student good to meet you ,yeah and i'm student i don't think i'm supposed to be in this class i already know everything about science 
110.3,Luis,,ok well you can help me teach the others i really need you to still be in this class so that you can help me help us understand a little bit better ,ok 
110.3,Luis,,awesome ,yeah ok i'll do that 
120.4,Farrah,,ok good good sounds good so let's see let me see i know you class had already submitted me some questions student can you talk about your question a little bit your answer that you gave me ,yeah sure i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.4,Farrah,,good and do you class have you've got the text in front of you correct ,yeah it's on our tablet on our desks 
120.3,Farrah,,good awesome so can some student or one of you which would somebody like to volunteer to read paragraph 1 ,oh i'll read can i read 
120.3,Farrah,,yes absolutely go ahead student paragraph 1 ,ok scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on earth 
120.3,Farrah,,good let see are you reading paragraph 1 right under the moon is a desert ,let me see ok i see mine says that scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere oh i see i see ok that's like the fourth sentence in here scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines 
210.4,Farrah,,so you didn't find your answer from paragraph 1 yes yes that's the sentence i want you to read good job good job so and in your answer you'd said that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so in our first paragraph there it says that you just read it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters or dark places where the sun never shine ,no no it was in paragraph 3 paragraph 3 
120.3,Jazmin,,ok let's go ahead and read paragraph 2 and 3 did somebody want to read two and somebody else want to read three and then we'll talk about those four answers ,yeah i can read paragraph 2 ok yeah this is where my answer is from ok nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one top of the top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water 
120.3,Jazmin,,oh go ahead ,you want me to stop reading or keep reading 
210.4,Luis,,yeah stop right there for a minute ok so paragraph 2 says that nasa has sent a small you did a great job rating by the way but and student you did too very good job reading so paragraph 2 says on this worksheet that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in large polar crater i'm sorry in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small so we know that the ice deposits are very small so you're going to need something to small right something that can look at small things correct ,yes 
210.4,Luis,,go ahead student ,i was just going to say that i know all about the ice deposits because that's like because it's really cold there 
110.1,Jazmin,,oh good that's really good thank you for contributing that go ahead student what would you like to say ,yeah i was going to say that i don't know why my answer is wrong 
120.3,Chris,,oh i didn't say that no no no your answer isn't wrong we're just wanting to find kind of even more ok about it so nasa did sent a small machine correct yes good so let's keep reading paragraph 3 and then we're going to go back and we're going it's kind of getting more information ok but that's a very good start very good so paragraph 3 who would like to read 3 student would you like to read it ,yeah i'd like to read it but also i wanted to say that i went to nasa and so i know that i use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit and stuff 
140.1,Chris,,did you go to the one in texas or florida did you go to the john f kennedy center or ,the john f kennedy center 
140.1,Chris,,ok i forget the name of it ,the space center in florida with my dad i went with my dad 
140.1,Chris,,oh so i think that's the one named after president kennedy was it fun ,it was a lot of fun we got to see a lot of space shuttles and astronaut space chutes and all of the different ways that they can breathe upon in space 
120.3,Chris,,great i bet that was i've seen some of this equipment that's very neat thank you so much student so paragraph three who would like to read three ,yeah you're welcome i can read it ok 
120.3,Chris,,go ahead ,that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight eye you need a scientific microscope to look really closely 
110.1,Oliver,,oh good good job great job all of you class i appreciate all of you class volunteered to read and you've all done a very good job ok so let's get through if do you class have like a highlighter or a pen or pencil ,oh yeah i'm sorry to interrupt i know this was really really short and we just met but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i really appreciate how you really just took some time to really listen to every single one of us and i mean i didn't say anything but you really listen to class sharing their ideas and that was really nice thank you 
110.1,All,,you're welcome thank you student hi good evening ,i'm hi i hi 
220.1,Luis,,so we've already read the text about the moon in class and i just want to talk to you class about some of your answers to your questions and try to see if we can discover more answers and and think more deeply about this passage does that sound good to you class yes student ,trust me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,oh that's okay well we can always learn new things about topics so you can help me you know help us learn more about it ,all 
120.4,Oliver,,right cool thank you student i'll need your help and so can you class show me your responses to the first question ,says we can't lift up our tablets off the desk but we can meet them um my answer was that nasa send to small machine and i said i'm scientists from craters full of water on the moon i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely up same thing i student 
120.4,Farrah,,awesome so um let's see student were you the one that talked about the microscope premier ,yeah um i circled the last sentence it's in the in the story where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's at the end of paragraph three 
230.3,Farrah,,awesome okay so i just want to make sure that heard you out there so you're talking about the microscope that you can see the water with correct ,yeah yeah 
120.3,Farrah,,so in the text i think it was in are you class allowed to show me the text or ,we can see it on our tablets 
310.1,Jazmin,,"i'm using a copy of it too yeah actually i've got a copy i'm sorry i just i wasn't sure how to pull up my copy and still see you class i'm sorry i'm so because of the same so Really small small you can look really closely at it right and see it because it's very small and the moon, but there was another machine that they kind of found the water with can class or student can you tell me maybe if there was another machine mentioned or how they how they discovered the water i know they can look at the water with the microscope but how did they discover the water you class look back at the sin to me okay but i like how you found a machine because it did ask for a tool and a machine in that question and i really like how you found that ",miss jennifer yes it's student um i had i wrote about my answer has about a small machine i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,oh yeah okay so can you read me your answer again sometimes it's hard to keep up with so many i can't see him ,yeah um so this is student student can i my answer was nasa sent a small machine 
230.1,Jazmin,,oh good that's right that's right i'm so sorry that i missed your your answer student yes so they sent mall machine that's very good you're exactly right that's the tool that we're looking for do you know if it had a more specific name oh it was a small machine but didn't have a specific name that ,that was the sound in the text and the text messages machine called a lunar orbiter oh 
230.2,Jazmin,,good awesome good so it was a small machine but it was the more specific name for it was a lunar orbiter rat what did they use the lame lit lunar orbiter for keep her in that sentence ,i'm okay i'm okay to investigate i'm good investigate 
210.3,Jazmin,,yes to investigate so investigate means that we're kind of and that's what we're doing right now in this class we're looking deeper into these questions and our answers looking deeper into it right so they used how can we how could we restate this question how can we restate that question in our answer so that we know when you're reciting a our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon it lets your teacher and it lets people know like you fewer question because if you just put lunar orbiter we're not going to know what question you are answering what will know by the number but like if somebody that didn't know what we were what this passage was even about how could they read the answer to this question and know that we're taught what we're talking about how could we restate that question i know ,nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to invest ticking i'm water 
120.2,Chris,,"We need to restate that question in our answers. Well, and he's the text, so I can use the text, but can you can fit it into this question, maybe just a little more more clear into the question. but we also our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ",but i do like how you did that teacher it's me student i was thinking about the equipment because you talked about equipment in the question and i wouldn't have nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
150.1,Chris,,Because we need to know which equipment did the scientists sees to discover the water right to discover the water so they use the And that was the orbit. when you restate the question you kind of take some some some words from the question and put it in your answer i'm almost a start like a couple words of restate and i want somebody see if i can help me from the text finish that sentence does that sound good ,okay 
120.2,Chris,,so what if i put the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon was ,orbiter 
130.3,Farrah,,good lunar orbiter good good and or another way you could say that would be that's a very good answer you could even say like let's say nasa scientists used the lunar orbiter to investigate water on the moon that takes words from our sin it's am from our end i mean from our questions in its and from the senate's in the passage correct ,yeah 
420.2,Farrah,,yeah and then also our reader knows what we're talking about route because if we just put down lunar orbiter they're not going to know what we're talking about the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon was a lunar orbiter it gives our reader more information and they can if they know nothing about the topic that helps them learn more about it doesn't it ,yeah yeah yeah good yeah 
420.2,Oliver,,um let's see ,teacher yes it's it's me i'm sorry but it's time for them 
420.2,,,okay start simulation hi class do you class have a good break ,yeah it was lots of fun 
120.2,Luis,,oh good that's good okay so let's go to question two okay would say answer question one so question two is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable okay that's our question to okay i've been sees me yeah student go ahead ,okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
110.3,Luis,,oh well i really need you to stay in our class and and you can help me with like information and things okay ,yeah okay i can do that 
210.3,,,okay good thank you okay um so my question is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable okay so um you can help you can be my helper let's see i'm going to look at your responses real quick read what you wrote your class um so student you said not for a long time right so that so you mean that it could be valuable but it's not valuable right now right is that right is that what you meant by that okay okay so can you can can dig a little deeper for me and tell me how how is it not really valuable right now but it or let's see let me think about that how it is so you feel it is valuable but not for a while can you go a little deeper and tell me why was it not going to be valuable for a while okay ,because they said in the end of the story making this plan will take a lot of time and money they need to study the moon surface and build new equipment so that's like i that's going to take a long time 
210.3,Jazmin,,"yeah yeah you're right good and i love how you used the text to to back up your answer that's awesome i really like how i mean you went straight to the text why it's going to take a long time so so you feel it will be valuable but it's not available right now correct yeah Like say that those things were, say that time and money wasn't a problem and it could, you know, think about um you know trying to think about if those were issues how it could be important now try to think about that next time okay yes student ",i'm still kind of confused 
230.1,Jazmin,,what's your quick what's what are you i'm sure ,well i think i i think i answered the question this time and i added more detail to my answer 
210.4,Chris,,"Make sure you back things up, it takes like Farrah Farrah, you know, like in your answer. You didn't really back it up. in the original time but it's i want you to work on that next time okay and then student back to you you said yes is astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water that is exactly right the astronauts we do need water to survive right and stay hydrated and you can't survive that water that's exactly right now in our text you know how it said so let's think a little bit deeper about that and that's a good response so say there it says that you know one day you know they'd like to have people living on the moon and being there for longer periods of time maybe not leaving but at least be in there longer and spaceships can't really carry heavy i can't really can't carry enough amount of water to subside people for a long time right because waters really heavy and it's hard you know it takes up space on the spaceships so do you think it yeah yeah go ahead and go ahead student ",yeah yeah i'm sorry i didn't mean to interrupt i was just gonna say that's what i said in my answer 
230.1,Luis,,yeah i was trying to get to that yes you said water is is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it and ships anymore that's good so but they still have to carry it and ships because they have to get there correct and and kind of back to space and you know we're not we're not leaving they are being able to inhabit the moon right now they hope to one day in the future but so right now if they went to the main the ships would have to carry it so that's one reason it's it's really valuable that we can be able to find water there and student can you tell me a little bit about your answer you said water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen so how can that make it valuable ,wow i mean you that that's okay so i saw that in a story and that seemed like that was important 
210.4,Oliver,,"it was important so let's it was very important because you can do so water is made up of hydrogen oxygen and you can take those things that Lead them and then you can use the oxygen, hydrogen for other things. ",I read I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
210.4,Luis,,so let's say so in order to follow my advice or to found that base and be able to be able to what's some things that if orders split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen oh that would be neat when it that that that's only four years away the oxygen just it's in it's in here it's in your text and about paragraph five ,i'm okay yeah so i read i read that sentence after after the one that i said and it says that astronauts could breathe oxygen so i mean it seems like that's pretty crucial 
210.4,Farrah,,yes it is you're right yes breathing is very crucial great so we can split the water so with the hydrogen and oxygen and use the oxygen for air and that's very valuable and very important correct we cannot live without oxygen what's another i really i'm really glad you found that what's another thing in that paragraph that you could use the oxygen and the hydrogen are not as same as water but what's something else that they can be used for ,oh it says oxygen and it could also be used as rocket fuel 
210.4,Farrah,,yes and what much nate rocket fuel for here on the main ,um so that you can like go up to the moon out like you're on the moon oh 
210.4,Farrah,,we're not you and get back on the moon ,oh yeah yeah they use it to go home 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah they used to go home that's right yeah because they have to get nasa has to be really careful they have to right now they have to have enough fuel to get them somewhere and to get them back and that takes up space on the own the spaceship so down here later in our take to talk about how in paragraph five it says imagine the moon could serve as a stop for spacecrafts to refill their gas tanks before heading out into the solar system so they could visit further white areas of the solar system or they could come back home with the fuel that they yeah yeah that's cool so we met his we have a lot of good information and so so we've decided and ,reach every reader it's me student 
150.1,Oliver,,yes ma'am yes ,i was just looking it's me student i was looking at the clock and i realized that it's time for us to go to lunch well yeah i did want to say that i appreciate for how you explained what i needed to work on me and student that we should add more details to our answer and then i did listen to when you you told student and student that they were on the right track or their answers and so i feel like you really made us feel valued and kind of helped give give me some suggestions for what to do next time 
150.1,Oliver,,i'm really glad to hear that ,yeah thanks so much i'll see you again next time 
150.1,Luis,,really good lunch you class did a good job today good job bye ,high up excuse me don't i shouldn't be unless i have already know all about space 
230.1,Luis,,well i bet you do know a lot about space specifically and what you said why did you talk about oxygen tanks as the equipment ,because i know that i'm to go to the mon astronauts have to use oxygen tanks because they can't breathe on the moon without it 
230.1,Chris,,good so i'm glad that you recognize that just have to have oxygen when they're in space but if you look at the title we're talking about water in space so in the question asks us what equipment do they use to find the water so while i'm talking to student i want you to look through the text and find equipment that helps them find water okay all right student so you talked about craters why did you talk about craters on the moon yeah ,um yeah well cuz the question asked about water on what you were saying student and i i saw in the first paragraph that they said that they found water deep in the craters so um yeah so that's why 
230.1,Jazmin,,"But in the question. It says what equipment. Did they use not. Where did they find it so and Jazmin. So you specified that they use small machines. Why did you, why did you look for. Why did you say that they use small machines. ",well because i was looking for the name of up the equipment um and so i i only saw two things in the arm the story but machine i know his equipment and then they say a microscope at the end but i know that that one wasn't like to discover the water they were they were saying you could use it but they didn't say you they did use it so that's how i figured that the one in paragraph two was the right one 
310.1,Jazmin,,Good. You found exactly where you should be looking at by that word machine there. ,i don't 
310.1,Jazmin,,go ahead ,i don't understand why my answers wrong 
230.3,Jazmin,,okay so let's let's think about your answer so you said they use microsoft's correct ,all 
230.1,Jazmin,,so why did you say they use microscopes ,because that's what they used to look for water 
230.3,Oliver,,okay so i agree they used to look at water is it what they find the water with Microscope and tell me what they say about microscope. student you said you found the same exact answer as i'm student is that right ,uh huh 
120.4,Luis,,okay so is there anything else that you can find in there why go back to student to you read and see if you can find something different than student so student tell me what ,okay um so yeah um there's a bunch of there's two different things where they're talking about equipment in here um so in paragraph two they talk about the lunar orbiter and then paragraph three they talk about the microscope so that's equipment to but um and they both talked about water though in both of the paragraphs 
210.2,Luis,,good you found the equipment they talked about really really good is it talking about how they water or is it talking about how they were they find the water give me one second student ,it says to discover what what equipment data scientists use to discover the water 
210.4,Luis,,okay very good so which one would that be the lunar orbiter or the microscope ,okay let me see 
120.4,Jazmin,,while you're thinking i'm going to answer class my question what did you need student what was your question ,oh it wasn't a question it's just that i found the rest of the sentence it says they be such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate i'm vulnerable at them and south pole and look at it so yeah 
130.2,Chris,,how does the rest talk with student about because he's trying to find which one discovers the microscope or the lunar orbiter i think you have the answer so talk with student and help him discover which one it is ,ok ok i'll miss miss haley i know that um but i went to nasa so i know that that they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks answer to 
110.3,Chris,,that is awesome that you know all the extra stuff and we're just trying to learn about the water so you know so much more you're going to add some equipment to your equipment well ,yeah yeah 
120.4,Oliver,,alright student did you find something else ,um well i found the same thing not even was saying but they have also have a small machine called the lunar orbiter um but i thought one is talking about i spend only in paragraph one paragraph three or they're really talking about the water 
210.4,Oliver,,what do you know about ice student ,like frozen water oh frozen 
210.4,Oliver,,oh kind of the same thing isn't it ,oh yeah yeah i got so 
120.4,Farrah,,good okay so i think paragraph two is really important so student i asked you to do something so did you ,um okay yes so so i looked i looked because i was also i was listening to what you are seeing a student and to death to and um so i guess the answer is that um it was a lunar orbiter because they were they were looking you use a microscope to look at the water but you said what they were looking for i guess um but i guess i mean i know that because i heard you were telling it to like to student and and then 
120.4,Luis,,did you find that in the text i want you to find where it tells me what the lunar orbiter does so circle a word that tells you what the lunar orbiter does all right student have you talked it out ,uh huh yeah yeah i got it now i am yeah i got it 
120.4,Oliver,,okay so tell me what you got ,me my family i'm sorry to interrupt but i was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch um but i did want to say thank you so much for talking to each one of us about our kind of what we didn't understand and and then trying to help us get it better 
120.4,All,,welcome alright so i guess it's time for lunch ,okay bye 
120.3,Luis,,okay start simulation okay so i'm going to start by talking with miss student so you said no because we were talking about the question is there convincing evidence that oh gosh remind me other questions man ,i'm i'm looking for the question i just wanted to remind you that my dad to actually an astronaut 
110.1,Farrah,,is awesome student ,okay the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable 
230.1,Farrah,,okay very good you said no because not not for a long time why did you say not for a long time ,because it's gonna take a while for us for the astronauts to be able to find out if it's if it is valuable or not 
410.1,Farrah,,but is the question asking is it right now. ,let me look at it 
230.1,Luis,,is a while you're looking at it i'm gonna go back to student because i'm pretty excited that his dad is a astronauts so student the water can be you said that water can be split into two parts why did you tell me water can be split into two parts ,um because i found it in the story and i know you told me last time that i have to look into it look in the text for my answers and not just because i know it already and so it comes right after the first sentence that says water could be useful so i figured that's probably where you get the answer is after the first sentence 
210.3,Luis,,good i'm glad that you're looking into the text instead of just going off of what you know but the question says is it convince if we have the convincing evidence Is the fact that water can be split telling us anything about if it's good or not to have in space. Does that tell us ,is this convincing 
210.3,Jazmin,,paragraph for me okay all right student so i'm good ,yeah well i was thinking about the water on the moon and well it could be valuable for us to have like a moon card you know so we could grow things on the moon 
110.4,Jazmin,,but and i want to specifically look at what you wrote on your answer you said that you could yeah that would be awesome if we could do that stay hot they need to stay hydrated and you can't survive without water now why did you why did you choose to tell me about that when answering this question you are exactly right ,well they were talking about it i'm paragraph one but um oh i don't remember 
120.1,Jazmin,,go ahead and read rethink about your answer there for for me while i talked to student ,i see it okay it says future astronaut oh 
120.1,Jazmin,,good okay good ,well it's a future astronauts could drink this water so then i was thinking okay like we need water to drink in order to live so um so yeah that's why i said 
230.3,Jazmin,,and i want to specifically look at the question it says is there convincing evidence and you're right we so we do need that what did you say before you told me that what was the first part you just read there ,um that future astronauts could drink the water 
230.1,Jazmin,,mm hmm so that would be good what it is that does that convince you that it would be good to have the water ,oh yeah yeah it'd be good so that they could drink it oh yeah yeah that sounds good 
230.1,Chris,,student you talk to me about water being heavy why did you choose to talk to me about that ,well all because that was in the in the first the first part and the the teacher our english teacher said that usually the first paragraph is where you're going to find the important information 
230.1,Oliver,,"And I, I want to ask another question. When you said that. So you said water is heavy you found that in the first paragraph. Right. where it is that water at when they say it's heavy so read that sentence again for me so read that sentence again for me and while you're reading it i'm going to talk with student so student they you said they're not ready yet why did you say they're not ready yet ",um well because at the end it says making this plan will take a lot of time and money they will need to study the moon surface and build new equipment so i mean they don't have all of that stuff yet so so clearly they they are not ready for for getting water off the moon 
210.2,Farrah,,"Insight there, but i really want to reiterate how important the question is and really reading it it's asking you if you have enough evidence to say that it would be valuable not that they're ready have water so re rethink about that do you think it would so what is valuable mean maybe that's what we need to ask ourselves so what does it mean to be valuable student ",valuable means like something that's really important like um um yeah something that's important 
120.2,Farrah,,so do you think it would be important to have water on the moon ,um yeah i mean like like student said out people need to be able to drink water um so yeah that's valuable 
230.2,Chris,,so here's an did you find specifically where that waters heavy at yeah and and what it student say ,your research be heavy on the spaceship the space shuttle 
130.2,Farrah,,good so student so what did student you say about the water ,um he said the waters heavy if it's on the space of the spaceship 
130.2,Luis,,right so they're having to take up this water in the space and its way in down that spaceship so then student would it be valuable to have this water and in space so we don't have to lug it from earth to the moon ,um yeah yeah that'd be great because you know if i have to carry water might my arms and be tired 
230.3,Oliver,,yeah so we're saving saving some energy for that space shuttle ,was harrowing 
230.3,Oliver,,mm hmm ,it's time for us to go to lunch but i understand now because you kept telling us to look up a word in the question so i do appreciate that you kept on challenging and it helped me kind of think about maybe how i got to look up a question a little bit more maybe next time 
230.3,Oliver,,all right well you class have a good lunch hey class student do you have a question ,yeah me too hi no i was just saying hi 
230.3,Luis,,hey ,i actually i do have a question um i don't think i should be on this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,but does that mean you know everything about what scientists using in space how does an oxygen tank work well you know i liked your response the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks ,okay because there isn't any gravity i mean there isn't gravity in space but they're also isn't any oxygen and trees and carbon dioxide so the site so the astronauts have to wear these oxygen tanks in order to breathe when they're up in space so they have they have a whole a whole space suit and then in their space suit they have like a helmet and then breathe out carbon dioxide can go out and then oxygen can come in so that they don't like suffocate in space 
110.1,Luis,,well can you tell me what the title of this was that's really cool student ,um i'll me let me look down um water on the moon yeah water on the moon 
230.2,Jazmin,,yeah does does that sound like i agree that they do use oxygen tanks when they're in space and in the moon but i think what we're trying to figure out was we're talking about water on the moon and so that's a little bit more in depth than just the oxygen tank and let's see i wanted to talk with with um with student student you said that nasa send a small machine to the moon what is this what was the small machine called ,i'm not sure 
210.4,Jazmin,,so i think that's in paragraph two why don't you look at the first sentence and paragraph two ,okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the small machine is called a lunar orbiter 
230.2,Jazmin,,good and so you said they sent this machine so what did this machine do ,um investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,it does it does investigate what does it investigate read that second sentence again ,"okay this will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater i still don't understand why my answers wrong Oh, oh, okay. This lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. well it's going to land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
230.1,Jazmin,,okay so it lands where ,on the moon 
230.2,Jazmin,,okay and you said so this lunar orbiter looks for what deposits ,it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
230.2,Chris,,okay good um so student you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon yeah um you so talk to me about that how much water did they find ,um oh okay i'm not really sure like exactly like the amount like how many gallons or anything but i mean i got it from from the story that they found like a lot of water 
210.4,Chris,,where does it say they found a lot of water let's look look at that first paragraph does it say anything about finding a lot of water ,rapidly rereads paragraph one to himself oh yeah because it says a water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters and so it's like you know like deep 
210.3,Chris,,right so they found it deep that means that so think about um think about if you dug a really big hole so they found it deep within the moon's craters they found it really far down but it just says that they found evidence that there was water not that they found a lot of water they just not evidence meaning that they seen water there does that mean that there's a lot ,i guess i guess not if it's just evident to not the water um but you know i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like how student was saying but also masks and suits too Number three? 
210.3,Chris,,mm hmm very good ,let me see number three 
210.3,Chris,,so that start with that means very good ,that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.3,Farrah,,so what does that ,that was my answer 
210.3,Oliver,,yeah ,well that was my answer too um student 
230.1,Oliver,,so student you said that was your answer too so that's awesome can you tell me what that means ,yeah i can because they're talking about how you need a microscope to look really closely at the water and so and a microscope is basically a scientific tool but the scientific tools also equipment 
230.1,Oliver,,okay so it is an equipment what does this equipment do if i put something under a microscope what does it do ,it helps you look at stuff 
210.4,Oliver,,am i looking at stuff am i making it look really big so i can really see it or am i zooming out what am i doing ,oh oh i'm sorry teacher i just heard the bell that means that it's time it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you took time with with class to kind of ask questions and listen to everybody's ideas um wasn't really cool class 
210.4,Oliver,,i didn't hear the bell ,hi 
210.4,Luis,,hey boys and girls yes student ,um yeah so i just wanted to say like i already know all about space i don't think i need to be in this class 
220.1,Luis,,well i wanted to call you back here because even though you know a lot about space in your answer that you gave to my first question tells me that you know that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks we want to really focus on what it says and our article today we want to learn more details about scientists especially on the moon ,okay sounds good 
230.1,Farrah,,so let's look at our question our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question alright so miss student i want to talk about your answer real quick how you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so when you are listening and answering this question how did you get to that answer ,okay so when i looked at was i was thinking okay so what equipment did they use to discover the water right so what i saw was like microscope i thought that would be what you'd have to use because they say that the water is microscopic 
210.2,Farrah,,mm hmm they do say that and that's great text evidence to use they say this specifically in the text our question specifically says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon do you have any really important words in that question ,like other than other than equipment like discover 
210.4,Farrah,,any other yes discover so when you discover something you're looking for it so did i need um you said that they needed the microscope to look really closely so did they use a microscope to find it or just a look at it ,um i guess i still understand why my answer is wrong because they it sounds like they had to use the microscope to see it so how could they discover if they didn't see it 
210.4,Farrah,,well they they have to find it first so they don't even know where to look for it on the microscope they use it once they find it ,oh so they have to find the first 
210.2,Chris,,and in our text when we look at our texts let's all look at our text they have to investigate yes student ,oh yeah i think you answered my question thank you 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay so in our text on the second paragraph it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so they used um well what machine what piece of equipment did they use let's use evidence from our text yes student ,they sent this small machine so it's this small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,said they sent a small machine does that small machine have a name ,yes it's the lunar orbiter 
520.1,Oliver,,so what machine was used to find the water yeah it's the lunar orbiter the lunar orbiter so when we're answering questions like this again what's something that we need to make sure we do when we're answering the question ,"well i guess i'm not sure i guess think about it Um, well, you asked us to look closely for the equipment. Right. And like look at what was using to discover the thing "
510.1,Luis,,we looked very closely at our text we looked for those keywords yes student ,um yeah i guess i was gonna say kind of the same thing like we look for the keywords right but i guess i'm not totally sure like what are the keywords 
510.1,Farrah,,"Alright, Farrah ",um yeah so i guess what i found is that the keywords were equipment and like you had to also look at discover and see like that those were the important words we eventually had to find 
150.1,Luis,,does that answer your question student ,yeah i guess you know how do you find them 
130.2,Chris,,student do you want to answer luis's question ,oh i'm kind of had a different idea i was just thinking like you i went to nasa so i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like masks and oxygen tanks and suits so like why wasn't that maybe an answer 
410.2,Chris,,well that wasn't an answer because in our text it didn't talk about that ,"oh so it's just stuff that we read not stuff that we knew Oh, that makes sense. "
410.2,Oliver,,student ,yeah unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you for being with us 
220.1,Luis,,thank you all right so i see that you have all um did your best and answering the question and some of you really went into detail pulling out specific sentences from the text but we want to get this specific answer so remember the discussion question is yes student ,um yeah so here's the thing i don't really think i need to be in this class because i know all about space already so i don't really need any help with this stuff 
110.3,Luis,,okay well maybe you can help us have help us with the other students understanding of space and we can pull from details from the text just to reaffirm your knowledge and what your prior knowledge is ,okay that sounds good 
210.4,Farrah,,great so um let's start off with rereading the question so it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon alright so um can class tell me what paragraph did they think that gave the most information about finding water on the moon alright student what would you say ,um so i would say that um i think it's the third paragraph in the third paragraph they say that on the water they found this microscopic and you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
110.2,Farrah,,that is correct and it does say that um does it so are we using the microscope to find the water or to just look at the water that has been found ,um well okay so i i'm not really sure why my answer might be wrong because i think the answer is that the microscope is what they use to to find the water you know what i mean tey had to look at the water to see it 
210.2,Farrah,,well you're right they do they do need to use the microscope to look at the water to see it but we're trying the we're trying to find how did they find all that water because it what if they looked at um how did they know where that water is ,yeah i think that sort of makes sense i feel like well so how did they how did they find the water if they didn't use the microscope to find it 
130.2,Farrah,,um what about in the first paragraph there do we see anything about any type of machine that they used to find it okay well let's ask your other classmates ,um well let's see uh no i don't think there's anything about a machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,right so let's look at the second paragraph and see if it mentions any type of machine did any of you find anything about a certain machine or equipment they used yes student ,so what i saw that nasa used small machine and so i think that's something that they said that they were using to find like to discover the water you know what i mean like that was something that they looked at 
230.2,Jazmin,,so does this whole machine is it given a name do we see any place where it's given a name at ,"Yeah, so it's the Lunar Orbiter. "
210.4,Jazmin,,yes okay so it says the lunar orbiter it's a small machine to investigate now investigate means to ,like it means to like find something or like yeah like to find something or to see something or to study something 
210.4,Chris,,right yes so um well we don't know for sure yet what they're going to investigate so let's look at the second sentence in that paragraph let's read it together real quick this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater alright student did you have a question or a comment ,um yeah so i kind of got like i was sort of thinking um like i was wondering um well i feel like i like did they use like spacesuits and stuff so i feel like that might be missing from the from the the reading or something like because they have to use like spacesuits to go out and space 
210.3,Chris,,they do have to use those spacesuits but well yes they do have to use them and that's the only way they can be out there in space looking but the whole the whole thing that this article is about was about water on the moon do you think that the spacesuit could help you find water or is it just a tool the that the astronauts had on them to protect them ,oh so like so like what it's used for so like the spacesuits are just like to protect but they use other stuff to like find it and study it is that right 
210.3,Jazmin,,yes exactly yes student ,so we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you for taking the time to work with us today and especially like i really wanted to thank you for being so patient with us and our answers and like um like you really made us feel valued like when we were talking and had different ideas like you made sure that we knew that like our ideas were still worth listening to and that's really special so thank you so much for that 
210.3,Oliver,,thank you hey class ,hi 
210.3,Oliver,,how are we doing ,oh we're good we're really excited to work with you 
210.3,Luis,,good yes student ,i don't think i should be in this class like i already know all about space like all this stuff and i don't think i really have any problems like figuring it out 
150.1,Luis,,okay well let's just worked work together for a little bit and let's just see where we get okay ,okay 
120.4,Farrah,,all right okay the question was we read our story and we want to know what the scientists use to find water on the moon right okay so let's go over some of our answers student do you want to give your answer ,oh yeah okay so i said that a scientist would need to use a microscope 
230.1,Farrah,,microscope very good i love how you found that in the reading would you like to share how you found that or why you chose microscope ,yeah um so when i was looking at like when i was looking at the beginning i was thinking like what equipment the scientists use right and microscope jumped out as like i know what i use microscopes in class so i know that you have to use them and it says microscopic in the reading it says that things are really small so you'd have to use a microscope 
310.1,Oliver,,student would you like to give your answer to the reading into the question very good i love how you are reading very closely and paying attention to those very big words very good ,um yeah so i have the same answer i student so i thought it was the microscope and i guess for me i guess it was kind of the same thing i figured when i read through the microscope was the only piece of equipment that i saw like when i was reading so i guess that could be the only answer 
230.1,Oliver,,okay well can you tell me why you might have chose that answer what made that microscope stick out to you ,i'm not really sure like i feel like i guess it's just because it's a piece of equipment and i know that like we're we're working on the small class so we can we can kind of get the right answer but i'm not really sure why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Chris,,okay but i'm glad reading the text and you notice microscope was in there okay well that's what we're working towards trying to see where everybody's at and we'll get there and student can you tell us what you think the answer is and what you found in the text ,so i was saying basically that there were craters like full of water on all this water 
230.2,Chris,,very good and what made you think about the craters on the moon but why did you choose that out of the out of the tags ,i guess because when i looked at the text what i was thinking was basically like i was seeing that they were saying that there was all this ice in the craters and so i thought like well that's all the water so when they we were asking about finding water i was like well there's the water 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay very good i love how you were reading closely to the tax student what did you find in the text student what did you find in the text ,basically nasa sent this small machine and that was what was like what found all the water 
120.4,Luis,,okay very good i love how you are also reading very closely and looking at the details in the story and then student you said that you knew a lot about space i bet you really enjoyed this reading then what did you find out that nasa used ,um well i guess i mostly was thinking like about what i already do so i guess i didn't read it that closely because i was like i already know this like they use like space suits and gloves and i've been to nasa so i know that they use like oxygen tanks masks and suits like to go to space 
210.2,Oliver,,okay but in the top of the reading they talk about nasa as student was talking they do send a small machine okay alright well i'm glad you know all of that information and they do talk about sending that you might need a microscope which student brought up and student but the microscope is used to see the little particles of water okay and they also talk about craters in the story which student brought up so that class had a little part in the story but we want to talk about what they found how to find water on the moon don't we yes student ,unfortunately we have to go on to the next class but thank you 
210.2,Oliver,,okay okay class are we ready ,yeah 
210.2,Luis,,all right we ended right when we were getting ready to talk about what was in the passage so what i would like for us to do is let's reread the passage i want class just to look at it and i'm going to give us a little bit of time to re read our story okay so if class will just look back over it and then we'll think about our question again okay just a minute student let's let class are you sure that you read over at all ,no i just wanted to say my dad's an astronaut 
210.2,Luis,,okay well i want you to read the passage just like class else okay can you do that okay ,yeah 
210.2,Farrah,,okay let's see some of us are finishing okay while you're finishing up i want you to be thinking about the question what did they use to find water on the moon be thinking did you find it in the story could have been something different than what you were thinking about if your answer is different or if you think is still the same student did you see something different while you were reading ,um i guess i was looking really close but i guess i still kind of see that it's a microscope because that was what i saw 
120.4,Oliver,,that is fine that is okay student what did you see why you were reading ,um i guess i saw the same thing cuz i i just kept seeing microscope and i kept thinking about microscopes for some reason 
120.4,Chris,,hey that's okay at least you were looking closely at your words why you were reading student how about you why you read read your story what did you find ,well okay so i tried to focus on the equipment and so instead of i realized my my answer was like about like the water so i i was looking at was like okay so like what equipment and i couldn't decide i thought maybe it was the microscope or maybe it was the lunar orbiter i didn't know 
110.1,Jazmin,,allright student while you were reading did you find any more information okay very good observation while you were reading good job student ,well i guess i still think my answer is right that nasa used a small machine to get to the water 
110.1,Luis,,how about you student did you read it for me okay very good ,i did i did read it i did read it i just i just kept thinking about all those like spacesuits and all that you know 
110.1,Chris,,okay will you hold that in for a little bit and thinking about those spaces maybe we can talk about that later okay while you were reading near the top it does talk about a small machine that help nasa find water and it is called a lunar orbiter and that's what they helped find water and as you're reading a lot of times you need to use a finger pointer to help you point as you're finding your words okay but each one of you did a fabulous job reading and looking at all the information and taking it in so really good job class very proud of each and every one of you yes student ,i i am we go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for really thoughtfully work with us because you help me to understand like how my thinking led to you know to the first answer and why it wasn't quite the right answer and you you made me feel really value and i think class felt really valued and felt like you know what i mean like that you appreciated what we were saying so i just wanted to thank you because it was really nice to have that so thank you so much 
110.1,Farrah,,you're very welcome hello how are you class today ,we're doing well thank you we're excited to work with you 
110.1,Luis,,okay does class remember the text that you read yes student ,um okay so here's here's the thing like i don't think that i should be in this class because i already know like all about space and i know all this stuff and like i don't think i really need any help with this stuff 
110.1,Luis,,okay well there may be somebody here that does so let's all just take our turns and we'll see where it goes okay ,okay 
120.3,Farrah,,all right so let's talk about the question it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon class gave a different answer so i think we all need to reread the passage okay one more time i'm going to give you about two minutes to read over it and then we're going to come back and look at our answers again okay ,we can read super fast so we're done 
120.2,Farrah,,okay is class done okay what equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon now yes student what is your answer ,okay so i think um i think the answer is the microscope they said that in in paragraph three you need a micro a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
110.1,Farrah,,good job student so once you reread it you found a different answer correct ,well that was i'm sorry this was student that was my answer from the beginning 
110.1,Farrah,,sorry ,but i think it was still that's okay um so i still think it's the microscope and i'm not sure like why my answer might be incorrect i don't really know 
210.4,Oliver,,yes it was the microscope does class see where student found that in paragraph three has class ever use a microscope before okay it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is mcroscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you weren't looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ,yeah we've used it in science class before 
230.1,Oliver,,wow what were you using it to find ,um we were looking at dna like we did a like a like a swab of our cheek and we were looking at like dna cells it was really interesting 
230.2,Jazmin,,wow what else do you think they would use be looking for on the moon do you think of anything else student ,i think that they would use i think that the answer is that they're using the small machine and the small machine is what they're using to discover the water i'm not sure if the microscope is what they're discovering with so i'm not quite sure if farrah's right or if i'm right 
210.4,Chris,,okay all right well let's look at page paragraph three okay do you see where they're numbered each paragraph has a number beside of it can class take their finger and put it on number three find the number three paragraph 1 2 3 you see it do you yeah okay let the rear end of that paragraph it talks about what kind of small tool scientific tool that they would use do you see it student does class need help finding it does class need help student you need some help ,no no i don't need help but i did have a question 
210.4,Chris,,yes sir ,okay so i was thinking that um i went to nasa with my dad and we studied like all of these like different things that like um like the astronauts use like oxygen tanks and spacesuits and like i was wondering like like that was my answer well i mean know my answer was about the craters but like i think that like maybe we could use the oxy like they could use oxygen tanks to find it also 
230.2,Chris,,okay but what does the reading tell us you possibly could use oxygen tanks but what does it tell us in the story ,um i guess it doesn't really say anything about like i'm like really about like the um using like space suits and stuff i guess that was like from like my understanding 
120.3,Oliver,,mm hmm all right well let's uh we are actually i'm gonna let some friends take turns reading who would like to read first class like to volunteer to read student would you read paragraph one for us ,um sure okay so scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on earth however they used to believe that there was no water on the moon now they know this is not true scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines 
110.1,Jazmin,,okay who would like to read the second one who'd like to read next okay student go ahead go ahead student ,so it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigat the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crator these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day 
110.1,Luis,,very good who wants to read the last paragraph student go ahead sir ,okay okay so okay so yeah like um okay this means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic many wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.2,Jazmin,,right who heard in that story what they use what was the name of that scientific tool student ,yes scientific tool in the third paragraph with the microscope 
110.2,Jazmin,,good job student did class hear that while student was reading ,unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and i wanted to thank you for working with us today like you were very patient with us as we were all giving our answers and we all had very different answers and you were really thoughtful about like listening to us and helping us be able to say our answers about what we thought like sometimes we stress out our science teacher and you were so patient and it really made us feel confident to like share answers so thank you so much 
110.2,Oliver,,thank you ,hi 
110.2,Farrah,,how are you class ,we're doing well thank you 
140.1,Luis,,so you read the text the water on the moon already so what are some thoughts that you've had on the text prior to answering any of the questions ,um so i just wanted to say um i already kind of know like all about space and like i kind of like know like all this stuff so i don't think i need to be in this class 
220.1,Luis,,well that's a very big statement because i don't even know all about space space is so broad and there's so many unanswered questions that i think that you have be eager to learn about i didn't even know about water on the moon so this though you might think that you might know some of this stuff i'm sure there's something new that you might could gain from it so i think it's very beneficial that you're in this class ,yeah that's that's a good point 
120.2,Jazmin,,wonderful okay well let's look at our discussion question it said what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon now have class already thought of your answers for this question ,yes we did we all yeah 
120.2,Farrah,,okay who wants to share their answer with me yes student ,okay so basically um i think that the answer is they used the microscope because they that's the science tool they talk about in paragraph three 
110.2,Jazmin,,that was a wonderful answer does class else want to add their answer to it yes student ,and so basically um for me like i thought that they used to small machine to discover the water 
210.4,Farrah,,so whenever we're looking at passages we really want to focus on textual evidence now textual evidence is when you have a question and you refer back to your passage to find the exact answer or as close as possible so if we look at our passage right here in the first stanza it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines does that stand to say anything about any equipment ,no i guess not 
210.4,Jazmin,,no i don't see anything in there either so let's move on to our second one it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small was there anything in that stanza that might have referred to equipment being used ,yes that's where they talk about the small machine that they sent to the moon 
210.4,Farrah,,correct so we already seen stanza to that we can support our answer to the question because we have found it yes student ,okay so here's my question i'm i'm trying to understand like why my answer might not be correct to say thought they use a microscope to see the water 
210.4,Chris,,your answer is correct because the microscope is a tool now equipment is is very broad when comes two machines and tools and what you refer to them as so the scientists needed to use tools and equipment to discover the water on the moon and they use that by starting with the small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate so once we investigated the moon we could then use our tool to discover more about it so you had to have both forms of equipment to figure out the answers that we were looking for in this passage does that make sense yes student ,um yeah so i was just wondering like my dad took me to nasa and we went and studied like and looked at all like the stuff that people wear there and like the spacesuits and like oxygen tanks and all this stuff like don't we need that stuff to find the water like i think that maybe we need that stuff too 
110.3,Jazmin,,"there's a lot of things that we need to have whenever we go into space now that's very fascinating that you were able to visit nasa that's a great cultural experience and it gives you a little insight into having some prior knowledge as you move forward in your science classes now astronauts and scientists have to use all kinds of equipment and certain materials that they have to wear when they go into space because it's such an unknown area and we want to be as safe as possible so when you got to see all of those things that nasa you were able to see some of the space suits some of the tools and equipment that they use Yes, Jazmin? ",so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we could lunch i just wanted to take a moment i just wanted to thank you for working with us today you are so patient and so positive with all of us it really makes us feel like we can share our ideas with you like because you were so like helpful with like the different answers that we had and sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher and he says we give him stress hives and you were so just like calm and and just very thoughtful so i just wanted to thank you so much for that 
110.3,Luis,,you're very welcome hi class so today we have i've looked at some of your responses to our reading and some of the questions and what you class came up with yes student ,okay excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.1,Chris,,well we might can look just a little bit closer and you might find out that you'll learn some new strategies that might help you with other prompts or stories or questions that might help you in the future so i think it might be good for you in the class and listen to some of the strategies i want to share with you class would that be okay okay hopefully we can find some strategies that work for you and you can use so we're going to look at some of your answers that you have and ways that we could improve some of them and some strengths that many of you did have in your answers so our question that we have first is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so before we even look into our text we want to look at our question the question is specifically asking what equipment did scientists use to discover the water so right there we know that we want to look for some sort of equipment and based around water oh text evidence is something i wanted to talk to you class about so text evidence is going to support your answers and pull it straight from the text so that you always know that your answers are close or semi correct so in the very first paragraph if you all look at your text it says that scientists have found evidence so evidence is a really important word because it means that there's going to be proof in our passage so we want to find proof to the question of what equipment did they use to discover water now our first person that we're going to talk about is their response is student okay so student you said in one of your responses that scientists found craters full of water on the moon ,"So I did a good job in finding out where the water is I, I gotta find out what what discovered the water "
120.3,Jazmin,,exactly that's exactly what i want you to start looking for and we're gonna keep going and keep going a little deeper into the rest of the group's answers and see what we can find out but you are on the right track so as we continue into paragraph two it states nasa sent a small machine now student yes ,my answer came from paragraph two i still don't understand why my answers wrong 
130.1,Jazmin,,so student your answer is not necessarily wrong but we can go just a little bit deeper and to make your answer more detailed and just a little bit better than what we have right now but what you have is a great start so you said that nasa sent a small machine and that is correct the you have to send your small machine in order to discover the water ,Called the lunar orbit Jupiter. 
150.1,Jazmin,,a lunar orbiter so what machine discovered water ,and the lunar orbiter 
150.1,Jazmin,,absolutely so do you understand how your answer was right but we could have made it just a little bit more detail ,i just have to add called lunar orbiter 
150.1,Chris,,Yes Chris. ,i didn't see it in the story i'm in the story but i just heard you tell i'm student what it was so no i know that it was the lunar orbiter 
150.1,Chris,,it is the lunar orbiter and we're just gonna keep going and talking about our answers and figuring out where we came up with these answers and how we could have got them better ,better okay okay teacher i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.2,Chris,,right and they do use a lot of equipment such as that but our question specifically wants to know what equipment they use to discover water ,Yeah yeah 
230.1,Farrah,,okay awesome so we're going to move down to paragraph number three can you all find paragraph number three so i noticed student that you talked about a microscope in your answer that right yeah yeah so let's talk about that just a little bit so what made you choose that as your answer ,the question was asking about equipment and so i was looking for where the worst equipment and so the microscope i know his equipment and also i was looking for where they talked about water and in this paragraph they talk about the microscope as a scientific tool to look at the water 
210.3,Farrah,,"So your answer talked about a microscope being the tool use, but what did the microscope do did it discover water or was it used to look at the water ",used it to look at the water 
210.3,Farrah,,yet that's right they use it to examine the water so if they're using a microscope to examine the water is that our equipment we used to discover it ,i guess no i guess not 
150.1,Farrah,,right so our microscope is used to look at our water but we've already discovered our water with the lunar orbiter does that make sense now ,yeah i guess i guess so i feel like oh yeah cuz discover is different from look at 
150.1,Oliver,,yes it's just a little bit different yes oliveron ,i'm sorry to interrupt but i just looked at the clock and it's time for the next class so we'll have to see you again later 
150.1,Oliver,,okay we'll see you later ,alright 
120.2,Luis,,bye class all right you class so we're going to look at our second question that we have from the passage in the question states is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable yes student ,okay i think i got this all figured out so now i'm all good 
220.1,Luis,,okay you thank you you're good to go yeah wonderful buddy but we're going to talk just a little bit more about text evidence and how it can help us with our questions so i want you all to look at question number two ,Okay. um i'm going to say water is a big important word 
210.3,Farrah,,okay water could be one do you see any other words that could be important how about the word evidence and the word value evidence means that we're going to prove our answer that in this passage it tells us the answer to this question so will there be convincing evidence or will there not we'll find out also says the word valuable so now what i want you to do is look into your text before we talk about the responses to the question do you see the word valuable when we look at the subheading water is a valuable resource i see some nods yes it says in the heading that that that water is a valuable resource so we already know sort of the answer to our question that it is a valuable resource so when we look at the very first sentence it says water on the moon would be valuable now let's look at some supporting details that prove why it's a valuable resource so it's already telling us it's valuable now student and student i know that you saw on here that you weren't quite sure if it was a valuable resource or not but do you see in our heading and in our first line how we can already start identifying that it is a valuable resource ,but i'm still kind of confused 
210.4,Chris,,You always want to prove your answer so that you always know that it's right. okay so it says in here that water can be used for astronauts to drink so that's a valuable way that we could use water now it then says water is heavy so when you're if you are going up into space would you want to carry all these loads of water in your spacecraft or would it be really convenient if the water was already at the moon ,well i said that thing about them not being able to drink it so i think i'm right too yeah so that's why i put that one as my answer so i think i'm right 
210.4,Luis,,okay so in this article right here or in these paragraphs there's a few reasons as to why waters valuable so really good job you class but there are some more that we can look at so you are right in the fact that it is heavy it takes up a lot of room and so that is one reason that water on the moon would be a valuable resource so if we keep going into paragraph five it says water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen now we have to ,that's the thing i said i said that one 
110.1,Luis,,now i'll continue we have to use oxygen in order to breathe so if water can provide oxygen would that be a important and valuable resource to have on the moon yes good job student ,i mean yeah cuz you know class needs to breathe that's that's that's like the most important thing that you can have in life is breathing 
210.4,Chris,,very important so that could be a possible reason that it's a valuable resource we can also look at it goes into further and says that hydrogen and oxygen can be used as rocket fuel so that would also take some weight off your spacecraft if you're able to create hydrogen and oxygen in the moon versus having to take it all the way up into space so do you see that there's a few possible answers to this question because the text gives us some examples ,i read that there could be a base on the moon in 2024 
110.1,Chris,,Possibly. Who knows but that would be really cool now. ,reacher every reader well i mean that's why i'm still confused because i did you something from the text but you told me it was wrong yeah it looks like you know me and student and student add some stuff from the text i don't know where class were talking about student and student 
420.2,Luis,,So we want to be as detailed as possible when we answer our questions so that we have all the information that we need in our response. ,"Okay, so I guess what you're saying is that, me and Farrah were right too. So there you go. Chris, hmm. Um, but we just have to add more words. So all I have to say no it's not ready. Um, they would need to study the multiverse and build new equipment okay so i added more details is that as a good answers i got enough "
420.2,Oliver,,So when I talked about how you could break it down into hydrogen and oxygen that talked about a way that makes your water valuable. So we want to make sure that we're answering the question as fully and descriptively as possible. Does that help better explain it to you Oliver. ,okay um yeah okay thanks i just i guess you're saying i'm not like i'm but i i used i added more stuff from the text and my answer but i didn't answer the question 
420.2,Oliver,,correct you got to make sure that you answer the question and when you answer your question you got to make sure you add all of your details ,okay 
510.1,Oliver,,we're gonna be doing a lot more practice with these questions so that you feel comfortable with it but what we need to do is definitely go through your passage and then highlight important details you always want to highlight your headings or your sub headings because those are a lot of key details in there that could give you some really good text evidence so that's what you need to do you want to find details that go along with your question and could possibly support your answer ,all thanks teacher it looks like a time for us to go to lunch but i do appreciate how you you asked me a lot of questions to help me think about well how i i came to my answer and and and how you explain what what i need to work on which is like looking highlighting some of the arm but the headings and more details throughout the whole story i think to find more evidence to match the question 
510.1,Oliver,,that's right student and then you'll get the hang of it he's gotta keep practicing and you class all did great with your questions ,okay bye 
510.1,Luis,,hey class ,hi i'm excuse me master clement 
510.1,Luis,,yes even ,be on this class i already know all about space 
230.1,Luis,,right you you probably have an extensive knowledge of outer space through you know tv and stuff but we're in this class so that we can focus on extracting information from from informative text so that's the main goal of what we're working on together so i suppose i will start with will you tell me what what and you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks with your with your answer to number one which says what equipment did scientists you discover water on the moon how did where did you pull oxygen tanks from the text for them discovering water your thought process was for answering that ,well well like you said you know i know a lot about space and i know that you can't breathe on when you go to the moon so they need oxygen tanks in order to breathe on the moon 
130.3,Luis,,but i'm in the text that's good they do need that it there's a focus on what machine actually they which i actually used to discover the water on them so the oxygen tank maybe used to breathe but that isn't necessarily the equipment they use to discover the water Hmm. ,um okay well i don't know i don't know that one 
120.1,Jazmin,,could you look closer at the text at the at the forefront of text maybe and figure out what what what other equipment or machines were used in the in the process that might help you a little bit better ,Okay. i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
420.2,Chris,,"okay well we'll go over yours too so you mentioned a small machine but your answer sort of just summed up the fact that they sent a small machine and what you should be looking for is maybe an answer that. So it says what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon, but a small machine could mean anything. so you should be looking for something more specific what the small machine was called would be a more solid answer than just the small machine so when you're reading and it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon you should name that machine In the correct response like just just if you were having a conversation with someone and like as if you are super excited about the moon and they asked you what kind of machine do they use discover water on them and then your answer should be more specific to to answer them if you're having a conversation like you would name the machine and tell them how they used it so that's kind of the answer you should be looking for in answering these attacks okay and i'll go to student ",yeah yeah i i went to nasa so i know that time does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.3,Chris,,right i'm super jealous that you had nasa but ,me and my dad went 
510.1,Oliver,,to the next time invite me science is a your answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon okay so they did find and so it looks like you should you need to focus on the question more as well as the text craters water on the moon but the question is asking what equipment that scientists use discover water on the moon and so on and saying equipment it's looking for what types of machines or technology did they need to discover that water so you're going to be looking for our when when a text is talking about discovering the water you're going to be looking for the types of machines they used to do that and the text the informative text does list some of the machines it says the names of the machines and right before they talk about the discovery of okay so that would be a more solid answer And I'm a to Farrah. okay and you put you would need a scientific cool tool called a microscope to look really closely so your answer is not incredibly wrong you were headed in the right direction you would definitely need a microscope because the water is so so scarce and so microscopic on water and found you know only unlike little trace amounts and you would need a microscope to look at it but okay so you're when you're reading the informative text you should be looking for words that jump out to you about the question being asked that isn't what they used to discover it about discovering something you know like what they actually used to find it not what they used to look at it but before that how did they find it so it would help you better to understand the question and understand maybe like a chronological timeline of events in a text so if you broke down the text and circled like what happened first and then what happened and then what happened you might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question okay yes deb ,i'm sorry mr clemens i know it's been a short time but i was just looking at the clock and it's time for the next class 
510.1,Oliver,,oh ok ,ok so we'll see you later 
510.1,Farrah,,okay bye class hello ,how are you we're excited to work with you today 
510.1,Farrah,,doing well i don't really understand how i'm gonna do this but i'll start with student i suppose ,okay yeah you can just pretend like we're real students in the classroom and you can call on us or have us work however you like 
510.1,Luis,,or even raising his hand student why you raising your hand do you have a question ,um yeah okay so i actually like i know all about space so like i don't really think i need to be in this class because i don't really need the help 
230.2,Luis,,well you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen when responding to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon where did you find your answer from the text which paragraph ,um well i didn't really get it from the text a kind of just knew it so i didn't really like get it from the reading 
230.2,Luis,,okay that makes sense yeah class do that all the time but let's take your knowledge of outer space and focus in on this paragraph ,"Okay, that, that makes sense. "
210.2,Luis,,so what from the text how can you work how can you focus to see when when you've got the question what equipment did scientists you discovered water on the moon what what are you looking for ,um like we're looking for like machines or tools like in the text 
210.2,Luis,,okay and machines and tools that do what ,um discover discover the water 
230.2,Farrah,,right so when you're looking for what type of machines or stuff they use to look for the water when you're looking at the three paragraphs where where would you find that information one of the paragraphs specifically do you see a word that you would use in of those paragraphs just by skimming ,well i can i yeah i can look it up and try to see um i gotta kind of read it through i didn't read it very carefully i have a question it's student 
230.2,Farrah,,yes what's your question ,okay so i was wondering um i said that the the the the tool used the equipment used to discover the water was a microscope but i'm trying to understand what my answer might be incorrect 
410.2,Farrah,,so you found a sentence from the paragraph that had a piece of equipment in it but your answer is you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely it doesn't answer the question exactly about what equipment the scientists used to discover water on the moon ,"Oh, OK. OK. "
430.2,Oliver,,and student you you just said i circled the same as student but you should voice your own answer not just piggybacking off of one of your fellow classmates so that i can help you better and also if you circled the same as to then you're still looking you still just caught a glimpse of a piece of equipment but you're you didn't really read what that piece of equipment was for or what it did so you also need to figure out what the scientists use to discover water on the moon ,ah ok i can do that 
420.3,Chris,,but they didn't say full of water you didn't really read and do your underlining and highlighting and student your answer was scientists found craters full of water on the moon they did in the article did say they found craters with some water on the moon but they didn't say full of water you should be looking for keywords like tool equipment or maybe machine to help you find what they used to discover the water okay ,yeah i think i think you're right on i didn't well because i was thinking like i was thinking about well okay this is a little bit of a different thing but it makes me wonder if like like like we're kind of like a like we we like have to use spacesuits like if we go up in in space like i went to nasa and like saw the exhibit and stuff so i guess i'm wondering like did they not have to use that equipment to discover the water 
430.2,Jazmin,,"um i don't think so they sent a machine up there so they sent a piece they didn't send humans up there so no one would need the oxygen that's a good question there i would wonder the same thing and then student But there's, it's more descriptive. They talked more about the machine and we're trying to look at more at the detail of the machine. So what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon. And you're right, it is a small machine. But what was the machine called and what did it do? ",it was the in the same sentence as this machine it says the lunar orbiter to investigate 
430.2,Jazmin,,okay that's good and a little bit more detail ,the lunar orbiter it lands at the south pole and it looks for ice deposits okay yes so so it does say pretty clearly like that's the thing that that found the water right 
130.1,Oliver,,mhmm good your answer just needed to be a little bit more whole you had a small piece of the answer okay student do you have a question ,um yeah kind of we have to go to lunch unfortunately but before we went to lunch i just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us because sometimes we can get really kind of wrapped up and confused about the answer but you were really clear in what you are saying and asking us to look at specific parts of the reading and also um you were very positive with us so we felt like we could still give an answer even if it wasn't correct so i just wanted to thank you 
150.1,Luis,,you're welcome alright so you have all shared your responses and i can see that we have have different responses here yes student ,i'm excuse me i shouldn't be on this class i am already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,maybe you can help your partner's out student i think you would be a great addition to our class oh well there's so much more to learn space is so expansive right and so there's so much more to learn that's awesome that you like hearing about like learning about space but maybe ,all okay 
420.1,Oliver,,all right so you've all shared your responses and they're all i can see that they're all maybe a little bit different but i think we need to relook at this question so the question is asking us what equipment is used to discover water on the moon okay so i want you to look at your paper and i want you to circle the keywords in this question so circle maybe two keywords from this question i'll give you about 10 seconds to do that ,"Oh, whoops you said two, I circled like four "
420.1,Jazmin,,us okay ,"I said, and discover "
230.3,Farrah,,so you might have circled water as well okay yeah and i agree with you student i think a equipment and discover and you may have circled other words as well but i think that we are looking for the equipment used to discover the water ,i did yeah and moon to 
420.1,,,oh and move yes those are important as well so the two verbs here where discover and equipment okay so let's take about i'll give you 10 seconds to think of some synonyms or words that are similar to each of those words so what's another word for equipment and what's another word for discover right those above What might you say ,i said that equipment is a tool but i don't understand my my answer is wrong 
120.1,Luis,,"Yeah. Your answer is not, I wouldn't say that it's wrong. so so which tool or gadget or technology even or machine is was used to discover or identify or reveal or find the water cute um yeah i don't think that it's wrong so let's look back at paragraphs three and four specifically so let's break it up into groups student and student if you will be a class of two and then student student and student let's i'll give you class a minute to look back at paragraphs three and four and then i'll give you about two minutes to talk okay so let's look back at paragraphs three and four for about a minute and see if we can add to our answer or maybe even change it ",so um when i read it i read the thing where it talked about the microscope because i thought microscope was a tool just like student um yeah and i saw that an arm and in paragraph four they talked about a spacecraft um so that's an appointment true um so that's what i saw and most true well okay so i saw that they talked about a microscope in paragraph three with the water and i didn't really i saw a machine i guess the spacecraft yeah yeah spacecraft machine um yeah and microscope is is it my turn okay i think we're done 
110.1,Chris,,now if all five of us can agree upon one response yes student alright class i've heard some really great responses you class are doing a great job working together um let's see ,i want to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to 
130.2,Farrah,,yeah they do they they have to use a ton of equipment yeah and paragraphs three and four let's look at specifically what the text is telling us though so all five of us we all have i heard some really great answers let's see if now we can come up with a whole class response so let's take about 10 seconds each person is going to share Let's take about 10 seconds and class members while the first person is sharing you are just listening to them so we're going to start with student you will be our first person to share debbie will be the second student you'll be the third student forth and then student last so each person you're going to have about 10 seconds to share your answer so student if you will go first and then student i'll tell you when when to start after that okay so you'll share with the class student ,well me and depth kind of set the same stuff we said that you know the microsoft the microscope is his equipment and then we said that we also saw in paragraph four they were talking about a spacecraft and we said that that was equipment to 
210.2,Oliver,,okay um so both pieces of equipment which one was used to discover the water or to find the water ,hey oh are you know teacher i just looked at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch 
120.4,Luis,,hey so you all have just shared your answer to the question so the question is asking us what equipment did scientists used to discover the water on the moon and it asked you to circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question so student what did you what did you circle student ,well i i wanted i'm sorry i just wanted to say i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,oh well that's really great that's that's awesome that you know all about space maybe you can add to our conversation ,okay okay so what i i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
230.2,Luis,,okay so let's um what what did you what kind of evidence did you circle in the text ,oh um i didn't actually circle anything because i already know a bunch of stuff about equipment that they use 
120.3,Luis,,okay well you know this is this is asking specifically based on the reading so let's um let's talk to our the rest of our classmates let's see what they thought and then maybe we can so although it's really great that you have a lot of background knowledge we have to look at the the paragraph to answer our question as a class look back at paragraphs three and four how's that sound ,okay 
230.2,Jazmin,,okay so student you said that they sent a small machine what um what piece of evidence did you circle ,circle that at the beginning of paragraph to 
120.1,Jazmin,,the beginning of paragraph two okay so nasa sent a small machine called a lunar lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter landed on the moon south pole to look for ice deposits and a large polar crater okay all right student um what was what was your response ,excuse me i still don't understand why my answer is wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,"your answer is not wrong student You know you've, you found the piece of equipment that they used, but we have to be a little bit more specific here. ",okay 
110.1,Oliver,,so student you said that they found craters full of water on the moon but we i think we didn't see at we didn't know why they found craters of what they use to discover define craters of water on the moon and oliveron student it looks like you class kind of work together as a partner or as a class in partners and you said that they use a microscope so ,yeah i i found it on my own but since you had asked student first i was just trying to say that i had the same answer but i didn't like copy off for her talk to her to find it 
420.1,Chris,,oh okay yeah you just you found it yeah you found the same one as her yeah okay i wasn't sure if you work together as a class where or not okay so what i want i want us to do is i think that i see that we are close but i think we might need to look at the question a little bit and maybe rephrase it sometimes i feel like it's helpful to put a question in our own words to understand what it's really asking what i want you to do is i want you to circle the two action words in this question the two main action words or verbs in this question or verbs in this question so i'll give you about And if you will just put your pencil down when you're finished. alright so what ,i circled us and discover and that made me think about that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks and suits 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah and it was similar to what student said but what what kind of equipment do they use to discover water yes that's i think that's the key part is what did they use to discover the water or what did they use to find the water or maybe we could even say identify the water so when they were first going into space on the moon when they first got to the moon what did they use to find that but what did they use it first to discover it so we see that they used after the fact after they found the water they used a microscope to look closely at the water like student said let's look back i'll give you class about a minute or so individually let's look back individually at paragraphs three and four those are the ones i think we need to look at again ,i still think that the small machine is that what they used because you said discovery is like define and well it says that they used it to investigate and like a detective kinds of discovers things you know and they investigate so i still think it's in paragraph two 
210.4,Oliver,,okay yeah let's look paragraph two it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so this lunar orbiter will land on the moon south pole to look for ice deposits in a large polar crater okay so you were right it's in a small machine but specifically the small machine was caled what ,yeah i was a lunar orbitre 
110.4,Oliver,,exactly right yes and exactly um so mark ,yeah sorry to interrupt you but it's time for us to go to lunch i i wanted to say thank you for helping us understand some of the important words in the question and to try to see if i can help us find that in the text and i like how you valued class like i felt like you understood at least that i we all kind of we're trying to find the answer and that felt good 
110.4,Luis,,you all responded and with some answers that really talked about the scientist and you talked about nasa and you talked about tools that they might use and yes what's your question student ,um yeah so here's my question um so i know like all about space like i know all this stuff about space like i don't really think i need any help so i'm not really sure like why am i in this class 
120.2,,,oh well our discussion question today was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon ,so in the texts in front of you called the moon is a desert 
120.1,Luis,,but we didn't exactly answer the question about equipment what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon you can answer that question by reading it and you've given some great answers ,well i guess like i was wondering like do they use like oxygen tanks and do they use like that kind of stuff because like like that like seems like something they'd have to use but maybe they don't 
110.1,Luis,,all right ,i didn't really read very closely 
120.3,Luis,,okay well what paragraph do you think we can find that in let's look back at the text ,oh um yeah i didn't really read too closely i should probably look at it 
120.3,Luis,,okay let's see student do you have a question ,um yeah well i guess it's more of like kind of a comment i already know like all about space so i think i even need to be in this 
120.4,Farrah,,well i think there's always room to learn more and sometimes we can learn from other people's responses and also maybe what i has to add to those responses so i would appreciate it if you would just kind of listen and maybe you will learn something new so student can you read to me your answer about the question that was asked ,yeah ok so my answer was basically you need a scientific tool called a microscope to really close 
310.1,Farrah,,what made you choose the word microscope what made you choose that word okay and i like that you use that wording scientific tool ,okay so i looked at the keywords in the question and i thought the keyword for equipment and discuss and when i looked at the reading what i saw was that the microscope was something they said that the water was microscopic and you couldn't see it without a microscope so i was like well then you have to use the microscope you know what i mean 
310.1,Oliver,,well you are correct on that in our story it talked abou the water that they found on the moon was microscopic like you had said and that's that the word microscopic means that you can't see it without looking through that microscope student i did see that you put you answered the same as student so in your words can you tell me how you would answer that question i like that you use that word scientific tool great great job there ,um yeah so i would say i guess it was sort of similar but basically what i would say like in my own words is that like you use the microscope to see the water and like kind of what she said that it's microscopic so i was thinking that like how could you find the water or the i guess the ice that's like the frozen water how could you find it if you can't see it you know 
420.2,Jazmin,,i do understand what you mean and i really appreciate you explaining your answer so next time when we are asked a question instead of saying i answered it like student or a neighbor make sure you write an answer out instead of saying i found the same thing as my friend i want to hear what you found ,well i guess my question is that it still don't quite understand why my answer is wrong and i just was trying to figure it out 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay so our question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and what was your response what did you put ,a small machine 
230.1,Jazmin,,a small machine well i don't think that you're wrong i think that we can add some more to your answer to make it a little bit stronger can you tell me why you put nasa send a small machine and nothing else ,so yeah so well okay so when i was reading i saw that oh okay so yeah i just looked at it again so are you seeing like i should say what the machine is 
420.2,Chris,,well it's always good to add detail to our answers and so the more detail we can provide with our answer the better or the stronger answer can be okay student ,i went to nasa with my dad and when we were there we saw that scientists use masks and suits and oxygen tanks i was wondering i'm like it's not in the reading like did they use those to find the water 
210.4,Chris,,well let's remember that the title of our story ways water on the moon so yes astronauts do wear those as a protective measure so when they're on the moon they can survive because it's a really cool place and if they didn't wear those they could die ,"Yeah, that does so like I need to use the evidence not like background knowledge. "
210.2,Chris,,right you need so because our our question and what was what equipment it scientists use to discover water so they're asking the question is asking what scientists use so specifically what do they use not their suits but what they use to find the water does that make a little bit more sense ,yeah okay that actually okay that makes a lot more sense so like it's yes that makes sense 
210.2,Oliver,,okay perfect student do you have a question ,um unfortunately we have to go to the next class which were bummed about because we're having a lot of fun working with you but um thank you so much for working with us 
120.4,Luis,,thank you student do you have a question ,um yeah well it's kind of more of like a thought i guess i think i got this all figured out so i think i'm all good 
430.2,Luis,,so the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable okay so we're gonna kind of review what the question was and your responses and because student just responded with he thinks he knows just about everything about this and so hey student i did want to tell you that i really enjoyed reading your answer because you talked about the way water is split and you said to split into two parts hydrogen oxygen that is correct however if we were talking just about our reading passage those are not necessarily in there so can you come up with a new way to discuss how there is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable can you think about that and i'll come back to you ,yeah absolutely 
230.2,Jazmin,,okay perfect all right student i really enjoyed reading your response and you talked about astronauts can use the water to stay hydrated and i did like how you said you cannot survive without water um where did you come up with that answer how did you find that answer ,okay so basically okay and let's see it's in the second reading the water is a valuable resource and i said in paragraph four it could be useful in lots of ways the astronauts could drink this water 
210.4,Jazmin,,great job is it just astronauts that need to survive with water or do we all need to survive with water we all do right ,yeah all living things need water 
230.1,Chris,,that is correct all right student student you your response says water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in ships anymore so that is true it does talk about water being heavy how come you responded with that ,so i was thinking when i was looking at it that well okay so i was thinking the waters heavy and you have to take it on the spaceship but maybe you could could get the water on the moon you wouldn't have to take as much water with you although i have to say i'm still a little confused about kind of like you and i mean like how it didn't quite answer the question 
210.4,Chris,,okay well let's um let's remember kind of what we read the whole reading she is talking about water on the moon so really we wouldn't have to bring water from earth it would be discovered on the moon and they would be using that water from the moon ,"Yeah, I think it does. Yes, thank you. "
120.4,Luis,,sure and student i saw that your hand was up do you have a question ,um i forgot 
230.1,Oliver,,okay all right student so we need to figure out yours and farrah's you kind of both have very similar responses so student oh no sorry student you talk you said no it's not ready yet so what do you mean by that ,um so i guess it's kind of it's kind of interesting so i when i mean it's not ready yet like the water that's on the moon isn't really ready for us to do yet so um it's kind of like it seems like it would be really hard like so they asked if there was convincing evidence and i thought it wasn't as convincing because it seemed like it would take a long time to work and even though i read that we're going to try to have a moon base on the moon by like 2024 or around then i kind of don't think that's gonna happen because they always say that you're going to like put stuff in space or we're going to go to mars but then it never happened and so i was thinking that like even though it might be valuable like maybe i don't think it would be for a long time 
230.1,Farrah,,"I agree with you. I think that you are correct, that sometimes it's not going to be ready. Like right now, it's not ready and I do like that you shared your opinion, good job there. Alright, Farrah you had responded similar and you had said no not for a long time so is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable and you responded with no not for a long time do you care to kind of explain your answer a little bit more ",yeah absolutely so i i wish i could unfortunately because you have to go but before we go over i really wanted to thank you for working with us and i in particular there were so many cool things that you were doing with us we were working together like first off you have to make sure that we were using evidence from the text whenever we gave an answer which was really cool and you asked us like all the time you asked like all of us like what what our thinking was like to the answers we have and i like class had really thought processes that they were able to share and you let us have time to explain like what her ideas for and that really made us feel valued and you you said that really thoughtful things to us that i think we're really true and like i think meant something to class right class yeah i think that like it was really cool working with you because i think we learned a lot about how to respond like more effectively questions like this so thank you so much thank you 
230.1,Farrah,,good morning ,hi how are you 
230.1,Oliver,,i'm good how are you ,we're doing well thank you 
230.1,Luis,,alright so we're going to go over a few things we read the water on the moon do you have a question student ,um yeah i guess it's kind of a question like um so i know all about space like all this stuff and i don't really think i should be in this class because i don't think i need any help 
220.1,Luis,,well sometimes we feel that way but you're you might have some knowledge that wasn't really covered inside of the texts that maybe your other friends in the class can learn from so work on all learn from each other and kind of discuss what we've read and if you have questions at the end teacher name will gladly to answer those okay ,okay that sounds good 
120.2,Oliver,,so student i see that you had circled the same answer as student how come you do that awesome so we're going to go over our reading passage that you all did water on the moon and so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,well we came to the same answer basically because she she was right i think i circled the same answer so like you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i agree with student 
230.1,Oliver,,so did you find that on your own prior to student writing that or did you kind of just copy that ,"oh that's a that's a fair question um but i found it on my own we are we're kind of both looking separately OK, I can do that. "
220.1,Farrah,,okay um a lot of you have really great responses but the reason why we're kind of in this small class is to kind of build off those responses so although it asks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon there's a little bit more that we could probably add to our answers to help you better does that make sense ,yeah i have a question um i was wondering if um like so my answer like if we're all in the class to work together on getting the more correct answer like i was wondering why my answer might be incorrect 
220.1,Farrah,,which one is talking can you raise your hand ,oh yeah this is student 
220.1,Farrah,,oh i can't see i'm sorry i can't see your hand there we go i see you now i'm sorry student ,no problem 
420.2,Farrah,,and so it's not that your answer is incorrect how do you think that we could have wrote our answer differently to include the question ,yeah definitely i think i know what you mean yeah 
230.2,Farrah,,do you know how you could have i'm not saying that your answer is incorrect but maybe you could have put on because you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely correct but what are we looking closely for ,we're looking for water 
210.4,Farrah,,okay and in our texts did it talk about using a microscope that those astronauts or rather those scientists use ,in paragraph three it says um you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
150.1,Farrah,,right so what you could also include is that scientists use a tool called a microscope to discover water on the moon not that your answer is incorrect because i see in the third paragraph that it states exactly what you said but maybe adding exactly what they're looking for can also help your other friends maybe if you're working in partners of two does that make sense ,yeah thank you 
150.1,Jazmin,,yes student ,so basically i was just gonna ask the question like so when i looked at it i thought okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and i guess i guess i should have said lunar orbiter and i guess i'm wondering like is it the microscope or is it the lunar orbiter that found the stuff 
150.1,Chris,,well so in in here it talks about the water on the moon so we know that that the planet or essentially what is being discovered is one the water but the water on the moon specifically right so in the first paragraph that talks about scientists that found evidence that there can be water deep within the moon's polar craters do we all remember reading that part student do you not remember reading that part ,no i do i do remember um i thought that there was like a bunch of water in the craters um but i did have a quick question 
150.1,Chris,,okay can i answer jazmin's question and then i'll answer yours next is that okay ,yeah yeah of course 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay perfect so then in the second paragraph it talks about nasa using this small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate so what they're doing is that they're using the orbiter to investigate the evidence that they found deep within those craters does that make sense ,yeah i think so 
150.1,Jazmin,,okay and then what they did was in the third paragraph they talked about the microscope and so the water that they found is microscopic do we know what the word microscopic means class student do you know what microscopic mean no ,well i think it means something really small 
210.4,Oliver,,yes and so you have to look at it under that microscope and that's where what student was talking about and it also says in the last sentence is that they looked at a scientific tool called a microscope really closely so all of those tools that they've used helped discover that does that make sense or look at that evidence all right student i see you but i'm going to get to chris's question then i'll get to you next ok ,ok i should probably let have i should probably let student have this turn and yeah we just because unfortunately we have to go to lunch i just wanted to thank you before we had to leave sometimes our science teacher he says that we give him stress hives and you are so thoughtful and friendly in the way that you're asking us our questions and i think that i can speak for class and say that like i don't think class felt like um felt bad like if they had the wrong answer which is really important like sometimes we all feel really bad if we if we don't have the right answer so i just wanted to thank you for really like paying attention to us and being so kind in in thoughtful 
210.4,Farrah,,well thank you and just remember just because you're in a small class doesn't mean that you're not smarter than the rest of the class sometimes you just need additional help or you class have really good ideas that you can learn from each other good afternoon class i hope everybody's doing well today ,yes we are 
220.1,Luis,,well good so what we're going to do today is look at the article that you all previous you read called water on the moon and we're going to look at the discussion question in regards to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so what we can do is just kind of go around the room if you just raise your hand i'll call on you and then we can look at your response and kind of figure out where you came up with that response and see if we're saying is correct or if it could use a little work so if you will just kind of raise your hand and i'll call on you alright student what did you put buddy ,um so i was talking about like using like oxygen tanks and like stuff like that and um like i don't really know like if i should be in this class because i know all about space so i kind of feel like i know a lot of stuff about this 
110.3,Luis,,okay yeah you're right so the scientists would have to use an oxygen tank to breathe up in space but if we're looking specifically at a question it's asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so they didn't technically need to use their oxygen oxygen tank to discover the water if you look back in your text it says specifically that they sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate but like you said scientists do have to use oxygen up in space so they can survive ,I guess I didn't really like read it as closely as I could have 
130.1,Chris,,yeah maybe just pay a little bit more attention to the exact question but you were correct and your response to just didn't specifically answer the question does class else alright student ,um yeah so i kind of was um so my answer was um you would find that the scientists found like craters full of water on the moon 
130.3,Chris,,they did find craters of water on the moon and that's kind of why they went up to space they wanted to see if there were water in these craters they did discover that in fact there are water in the craters but like i said we're if we're looking at the specific question is want to know what did they use to find that water and if we look in number two in the article the machine that they use what's called the lunar orbiter so rather than saying they found the water when you do go back into the text and see what machinery they use to find that water but like you said they did find water but we need to look specifically other question on how they found that water and it was with the machine called the lunar orbiter ,okay gotcha okay 
130.3,Farrah,,student ,um yeah so basically um i was just wanted i was just gonna ask like so my answer was um you know you need a scientific tool called a microscope which was in the in the reading but i'm i'm not quite sure what my answer it isn't right 
210.1,Jazmin,,your answer is correct what they used in space to find the water was a lunar orbiter but if you look at number three it says to look closer to actually see it you would have to use a microscope so your answer actually would be correct you would need a microscope but what they the machinery they use what's called the lunar orbiter but you'd also need a microscope like you said to be able to view the water molecules deep in the craters student ,so my question is then so i said that nasa sent a small machine and did i just like why was my answer not quite right 
420.2,Chris,,"So that's the only thing I would add to yours. What you put was was correct, but your teacher may want you to be a little more specific. So you could just name the actual machine, and it was called the Lunar Orbiter. So you're not very far off just a little bit more specific. student ",um yeah so i was just i was just thinking about like what you need in space and i was kind of thinking about luis's answer and like so my dad and i we went to nasa so i know that like if they're astronauts up there they have to use equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and spacesuits and all that kind of stuff so um i was just curious like did they did they not have astronauts 
210.1,Chris,,they did and those astronauts didn't have to oxygen oxygen tanks like student said but the the question specifically wants to know what equipment they had to use to find the water in the craters and so they didn't necessarily have to use the oxygen tank on their back for find the water they have to use oxygen tank so they can continue breathing and live ,oh okay yeah that makes sense so like you you to maybe they had to use like the equipment but it's not what they used to like find the water 
110.2,Jazmin,,correct they did have to use the equipment so student and you are both correct that they did have oxygen tanks but that's not specifically what they hadn't used to find the water and the craters student ,actually unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we went to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and i also wanted to say like to thank you for being so clear like with your response to our answers like sometimes we can frustrate our teachers a little bit because we're still working out you know like the answers as we go but you were very patient and you also were very clear and helping us understand like what we were trying to say so just wanted to thank you for that because not class does that 
110.2,,,thank very much i thought class did a really good job hello class how are class doing today ,we're excited to work with you 
110.2,Luis,,good student you got a question money ,um yeah i just wanted to say that like i don't think i should be in this class because i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,well i'm glad you you have a basic understanding of it but in this room we're just gonna learn a little bit more and you can broaden your knowledge on everything that involves space okay ,okay yeah i can do that 
420.1,Farrah,,all right well first off i want to say thank you for for class class reading water on the moon i hope class thought it was pretty interesting uh i looked at your responses to the first question of what equipment designs is used as discover water on the moon i noticed we kind of had a very in range of responses some of class kind of understood the question some of class are a little off but today what i hope to do is kind of come together work on some strategies that we can kind of hone in on the answer that that is specifically wanting okay all right so what i think we should do after looking at those answers is kind of look at the question itself and kind of determine some keywords that are in that question And anybody can tell me student what do you think ,um i think the keywords are and discover 
210.2,Oliver,,good because we are wanting to know what specific equipment the scientists used to discover all right there what do you think buddy ,um yeah actually i agree with student i said equipment and discover as well 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay student do you agree also do you have something else to say ,yes i see discover a different answer than them and i'm confused why my answer is wrong 
110.1,Chris,,well looking at your answers like i said all of class did a decent job hang on one second let me ask student what do you what do you ever say buddy ,um well i was just gonna say like i i only underlined 
410.3,Farrah,,okay well equipment is the keyword but we got to figure out what's what is the whole point of the equipment in this question the equipment is to discover water on the moon okay does that make sense i'm not going to say your response was wrong by any means okay yeah okay so looking at your responses i will say this student you were probably the closest and getting the correct answer with your response uh so for example a student you put that you need a scientific tool called a microscope now that is a piece of equipment but in the text it didn't really mention that the microscope helped discover water on the moon ,oh well i guess like what i thought about the you know about the microscope is that like they couldn't okay so in a text they said that they couldn't see the are acceptable microscope because it was so small but um i thought like how could they find it if they couldn't see it 
210.4,Farrah,,okay and that makes sense they do have to use the microscope to see it because it is so small but to find the water itself they didn't necessarily use the microscope when they found the water then the microscope came into play so they can actually view it does that make sense ,oh so they like something like studied the water 
210.4,Farrah,,the water ,and another 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah and then i noticed that you put the same answer as student so does that make sense to you also buddy ,um yeah that makes sense so like they use something else to find the water and then they studied the water using the microscope 
430.2,Chris,,correct student you put sounds is filming craters full of water on the moon okay they did find craters with water the question is actually wanting to know what equipment they used to discover water on the moon in that sense your answer doesn't fully answer the question you did put that they found water which is correct but you need to describe what equipment they specifically used to find that water does that make sense ,yeah i think i think it does like i guess my question is i went to nasa with my dad and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that and i guess like if i know that like even if it's not in the meeting like is that the answer to 
410.1,Chris,,i'm glad you do know stuff about oxygen tanks and things like that and it will help you not necessarily but for this specific question it wants to know what specifically they used to find that water and that wouldn't necessarily be like oxygen tanks and things like that however having that knowledge does help you with this overall topic but it's not specific to that question if that makes sense ,yeah i think i think that makes sense like so i'm supposed to like pull from the reading answer the question not from like what i what i knew before 
420.2,Chris,,yeah we want that specific evidence from the reading that we want to pull that straight out that shows we found the answer to that question student that is one thing i think that will help you if you really try to pull that answer out of what you're reading ,gotcha 
130.1,Jazmin,,"All right, now Jazmin, you put NASA send a small machine and you're almost 100% right ",but i can do that she was caught the lunar orbit so is that was it the lunar orbiter was with the 
210.4,Chris,,correct now does class see where she found that out because that is the specific name of the equipment they use to find the water okay and like you said class told me that were the keyword was the equipment to discover and then up in the text it specifically says nasa send a small machine called a lunar order order to investigate so does that make sense where we got that from ,yeah i think that doesn't make sense so okay so that's the answer that's the equipment that you to find the what like to discuss 
130.3,Jazmin,,yet specifically to find the water they use the equipment called the lunar orbiter now there's other equipment that's talked about in this text but specifically to find the water they use the lunar orbiter ,so we have to go to our next class that is so much for working with us 
130.3,All,,all right you're welcome you have a good day hey class i'm back ,hi 
130.3,Luis,,student you got a question buddy ,um yeah i guess it's more of a statement so i think i got this all figured out now like thanks to the first thing that we covered so i think i'm all good 
220.1,Luis,,well i hope you're right but i think with we go through this second question will be able to make sure that we understand how to kind of really dive deeper into a question so we can find the evidence from the text way say sound good ,yeah i can stick around for that 
420.1,Oliver,,all right i appreciate it alright so the second question we're going to look at is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable okay so within that question just like we talked about in our first session what do you think are some keywords in there that we need to pull out before even worry about answering this question there what do you think buddy ,um okay so when i look at it i think that convincing evidence and valuable 
210.2,Chris,,i agree with you those are all very important words student what do you think buddy ,um okay so for me i thought well i thought water and value 
130.2,Luis,,okay well valuables and very important word but we also need that convincing evidence on why water is valuable ok so the convincing evidence is also very important okay okay all right does class have anything else say thanks important or is class else agree that convincing evidence and valuable role very important words student what do you think buddy ,um yeah i think for me when i was looking at it like i kind of thought that um well i guess i wasn't totally sure i thought maybe because i thought like what you could do with the water so i kind of think water might be important i guess i'm not sure 
210.2,Luis,,well water is very important because we're wanting to find out you know how can water be valuable so we need to really find the evidence in the text on why that water is valuable so water is an important word but we want to find the evidence on why it's valuable if that makes sense okay ,yeah 
210.4,Jazmin,,i think that makes sense alright so i just want to kind of look at some of your responses and then we can kind of talk it through okay so student and student both of class kind of said no it's not ready there's no real evidence on why it's valuable this time okay now if you go back into the into the text do you see anywhere in there that talks about you know how it could be valuable ,yeah i mean just we have a question oh yeah well i guess i'm sorry to jump in i just was still kind of confused about like actually we haven't really got to my ticket so i guess we can wait like 
210.4,Oliver,,okay that's fine yeah we'll go around the room and when i get to you i'll let you ask your specific question okay so if you go back into the text alright so this event and divya what do class think is all kind of had the same answer you see anywhere that specifically talks about how water couldn't be valuable ,yeah there's um let's see yeah and the very first sentence right there yeah like and the very first sentence of the fourth paragraph it says water on the moon would be a valuable are very important resource i guess i think like we probably did the same thing like when we were talking about it i think what we were thinking was that well at least for me like i don't think that the water would be valuable yeah because i don't like i don't think that we can use it yet and so when they asked like is our convincing evidence like it it sort of made me think like it's not very convincing because we don't really know like how to use the technology exactly to wit so i kind of thought like you know what i mean like maybe it wasn't valuable yet 
130.3,Oliver,,no no i understand what you're saying but at the same time if you're able to find water on the moon moving forward this could be very valuable because if you go on the read further it could you know for example what you like the text says you can drink the water they could use the water eventually for like fuel for this spaceship does that make sense so even though we're not using the water right now the implications of finding that water moving forward could be very beneficial to our astronauts and the spacecraft and everything of that matter ,yeah i guess that's true because i read that like there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and like they would definitely need water if i did that 
210.4,Chris,,i agree so moving forward yeah that's that's very important so and i'll see yourchris and you put water is heavy so it's good they don't have to curate in the ships anymore so i guess with your answer you're kind of saying that it's important they found water that way they don't have to bring it back and forth which it talks about in the text so let me just kind of build off that so by you saying they don't have to carry water what does that essentially mean they can you do with the water that's already there ,well they can pick it up on the moon and use that water than to fly around or like they don't have to take it from earth so i guess it would be by 
210.4,Oliver,,good good good i know what i mean yeah so they don't have to carry it you know because they can use it for fuel and they can also drink it so that's less stuff they have to care or you know to bring with them on the spaceship so they can have room for more people more supplies and things like that so that's a very good response they have you got a question buddy ,um yeah well unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i really wanted to thank you for working with us and like there was a couple things in particular that were really cool like for example you really helped us to understand like what the question was asking for each of the questions and you really make sure that we use but that's like from the text when we were talking about our answers and like even more like you made us feel really valued and you explain like what we needed to work on like you know what i mean so that we could get a better or more complete answer and you gave us ideas for like you know what i mean what your concerns were and then like helped us to kind of find our way to to understanding it which was really cool and like that's not always the case so like thank you so much because i think like class in the class like feels like you know what i mean like we all understand it really well at this so thank you so much 
210.4,Oliver,,we're good i'm glad i could help class high class how are you ,we're good we'ere excited to work with you 
210.4,Luis,,good yes student what can i do for you ,um yeah so i was just gonna say like i already know all about space so i don't think i need to be in this class 
220.1,Luis,,well maybe you can help some of us understand things better by being in this class then because we're not just yeah we're not just looking at space we're looking at how well we read this text and we're just working as a class to kind of share our knowledge with each other okay ,i can stick around 
120.4,Farrah,,awesome okay so you class have all shared your responses with us and that's been really really good i really liked that you class tried to pull your evidence from the text i saw bits and pieces of that in there so does class want to volunteer to go first where we can kind of critique and go through our answers and look and see how we can find maybe some more detail to support our answer student you want to go first oh and student awesome student you go first for me okay ,okay so all right so my answer was basically that you need a scientific microscope to look really close and i was looking in paragraph three that's where i got my evidence because they talk about a microscope here 
120.4,Farrah,,in paris which paragraph sorry it went out ,it's three three 
120.4,Farrah,,perfect okay so if you look at our original question let's go back and decode that question so hopefully you'll remember us talking about that but if you look at it it says what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon so our keyword here is equipment so our keyword here is equipment and discover alright so let's go look let's say at your paragraph three where does it talk about discovery in there yes student go ahead and say it ,okay so actually i guess it was really about looking like discover it doesn't really say that it just says you need it to look really close 
130.1,Oliver,,so def do you have something to add to this you had your hand raised right okay good so maybe the microscope isn't what we used to discover it ,no i was gonna say the same thing as student but i'm still kind of wondering why our answer is wrong like why the two of us is our answer is wrong i don't quite understand 
120.4,Farrah,,okay well so student just had a really good point student can you repeat that for student for me ,yeah so that basically like when you look at it the third paragraph like it doesn't say discovery to we're supposed to match up with what the question is asked it says you could look really closely but it does it match like the word discover 
210.4,Chris,,student right okay and so let's go back and look and see what's the word that goes with that word discover so we know discover means to what somebody does class can answer to find right so if we're looking to find something what are some of those words maybe in those first couple paragraphs 1 through 3 that go with finding something ,student find 
120.4,Jazmin,,student what do you say again can you say again ,yes i was going to say investigate 
210.4,Oliver,,yes investigate alright so what what did they use to investigate student what do you think they used to investigate if you go back and look at the text ,well i guess i'm not sure if it's not the microscope might take me a moment 
120.3,Oliver,,that's okay look back through those first couple paragraphs ,i'm not sure 
120.4,Chris,,you're not sure okay we'll keep looking student what what can i help you with what do you think you know the answer ,well yeah i was gonna say i went to nasa with my dad and i know that scientists lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and that's not in the reading but i know that they use you know 
130.1,Jazmin,,that's awesome um it's always good when we have that background knowledge that we can pull in but let's look back at this specific article because this is about water on the moon okay so let's look at paragraph two because if you look if we listen and look at all of your answers student you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon and then if you look at jazmin's answer it says nasa send a small machine what was the name of that small machine that's not entirely true but they did find water in some of those places jazmin's ,lunar orbiter 
420.2,Oliver,,"very good okay so one of the things i would say is that you class did a really good job trying to pull things you found out of the text Instead of just agreeing with Farrah, maybe think about why do I agree with Farrah. What is it that she picked that I agree with. So you could still say I agree with Farrah, but then tell me that reason why you agree with her. Does that make sense. ",oh yeah i could tell you 
420.2,Farrah,,yeah okay so if we rewrote our answers if we might do that in a minute go ahead and think about why you might agree with student ,"Yeah, I can see that, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. thank you so much "
420.2,Luis,,you're welcome okay class so we've already discussed that question and we're gonna get into the next question that you class just answered student what can i help you with ,um i just wanted to remind class that my dad is an astronaut that's pretty cool 
420.3,Chris,,that is pretty cool you'll have to go home and show him this article once we've talked about it some more um awesome we talked about what is is there considerable evidence to show that water is valuable so look back on your article and look for that word valuable do you see it anywhere in there maybe look for the word in one of the headings or sub headings alright student you see it ,oh yeah i saw it i's a subheading at the top it's water is a valuable resource 
210.4,Chris,,perfect alright so do you think that might be where we look for our answers class ,yeah 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay so do you think that's a good place with are looking for answer about water being valuable yeah okay you can if you want to say yes or no you can shake your head yes or shake your head no all right now what what does it mean if something is valuable yep okay perfect so let's go down to that section student ,you can say it's expensive 
210.2,Luis,,what else student it's expensive okay so something that's expensive is considered valuable good okay ,i'm like something you can use or something that you need like valuable is you know like yeah like something that that you want 
120.4,Farrah,,right something that you can use okay that's great student what is valuable mean to you ,i was gonna say the same stuff 
120.4,Farrah,,you're gonna say what ,mostly the same stuff 
110.1,Farrah,,though the paragraph that you class read did it tell you what they meant by valuable mostly the same stuff all right good ,yeah yeah actually yes it 
210.4,Farrah,,did what did it say valuable meant ,it says water on the moon valuable are very important resource 
210.4,Farrah,,let's underline very important i'm sorry i didn't mean to cut you off ,no it's okay i was just gonna say yeah very important and then in the next line it says useful 
210.4,Oliver,,good it could be useful in a lot of ways okay and so i'm going to pull back up your responses so it says if they're convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable and you put it out perfectly it could be useful in lots of ways so it could be very important another way to say or state this question is why would water on the moon be very valuable or very important right so what in what ways so that word convincing evidence it's just asking So I want you guys to turn and talk and share and pair for about 30 seconds and look through there and see if you can find some places that Show through the text that water is a valuable resource. so just paragraph four or five and six okay so oliveron student you class and student can work together and student and student you can work together so make sure you're using the the text to look for answers too okay ,yeah we had a chance to look at and have the conversation 
120.4,Chris,,you did okay perfect alright so let's start with jazmin's class what are some of the things that it said make water a valuable resource from the moon student ,yeah okay so one thing is that water can be broken down into two parts into hydrogen and oxygen and it says that in the reading you said to look at the at the beauty and it says you could do that and that i think that would you really use 
130.2,Jazmin,,why would that be useful that is an excellent point but i want you to think about why that would be useful so you've given me a really good piece of evidence but you need to validate that using the text in the next sentence so what should that next sentence say class can answer ,for example future astronauts could drink this water you can drink it and do other stuff right 
210.4,Luis,,right okay so you could have the water to drink but if you look back at the sentence student gave us water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts could breathe the oxygen right so they could use the water to be broken down and to make oxygen so that's one way that the water is helpful or valuable right ,yeah yeah my dad would totally need that 
130.2,Farrah,,how about student and student show us another way that water could be useful and tell me the paragraph that you're in and start read the sentence that it comes from as well okay he would um what is another one ,so unfortunately we have to go to our next class we go to our next class i just wanted to share with you how awesome it was to have you with us today and in particular you like really helped us to remember to use evidence in our reading and in our in our answers like so that didn't just say stuff without using evidence and like even more like you help us understand the meaning of words also they helped us to think about like how did we get to the answer so it was really cool because we were able to explain like what we were thinking about and i feel that you are really this student student just says stuff sometimes so we thank you so much it was really fun to work with you 
130.2,Farrah,,bye class ,bye 
130.2,Farrah,,hi class how are you ,doing good it's good to see you 
220.1,Jazmin,,it's good to see you too um so i have seen your responses to our discussion question and i wanted to talk to you about how you came to know those answers yes student ,"um yeah so like here's something that's kind of on my mind like i know like a lot about space and um i don't really think i need to be at this class you know Um, well, okay, so equipment and scientists and um water and moon yeah um student okay so basically and another word that i saw was discovered it's like when you find something or when you when you when you find something "
230.2,Jazmin,,class look back with us and student read that sentence that you found nasa sent a small machine good okay so you talked about nasa sending a small machine if we look back at the text what did it send the small machine to do ,okay so in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
420.3,Jazmin,,good so we could underline that sentence to support this discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon right because investigate is something you do to discover something right ,right okay so i underlined it 
230.1,Chris,,all right class underline that sentence nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate or how did you come to that conclusion ,um so i kind of was like um let's see uh well is like in paragraph one i think no no no was it paragraph one yep scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters um well i guess i'm not sure 
210.4,Chris,,so let's look back at the text so you've all read this once through right ,um well okay so there's a couple places on paragraph two they said on the lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits and then paragraph paragraph three the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it 
230.1,Oliver,,good okay now student you said you circled the same response as student can you explain what you mean by that ,um yeah so basically student and i both thought that that the microscope was the thing that they used to discover the water 
230.1,Oliver,,okay how would they be able to use a microscope to discover water in your opinion ,um um well they would use the microscope to look at it and it said that in the in the reading it said that the water they found is microscopic so it's like really small like you couldn't see it you had to look in the microscope um yeah i guess so 
210.4,Farrah,,so what tool in here does it say they use to find it ,oh oh oh so i just this really 
110.1,Farrah,,savanahh hold on let student finish but that's okay ,um well i guess i guess i'm not sure because like you have you have like the microscope but you would study it and then you have like student said the lunar orbiter and so you would use maybe both of them yeah so i was just going to ask like although i'm not sure now but it seemed like maybe the microscope wasn't the answer so i was just wondering why it was the lunar orbiter and not the microscope it's like finding something 
420.2,Jazmin,,right it's like finding something so finding it versus looking at it closely are two different things so the question is asking what equipment did they use to find the water and if you need help getting started you could say the equipment and the scientists used to discover water was the what and then write out your response yes student ,unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just before we went to lunch i wanted to just thank you for working with us and especially i just wanted to thank you for you were really careful about making sure that like we all had a chance to speak and sometimes that doesn't happen in the class and so it was just really nice because we all had a chance to speak and we all had a chance to share our thoughts and also you were really patient even though we weren't like totally sure like what each piece was so i just wanted to thank you for doing that 
420.2,Oliver,,oh you're welcome class did a great job okay we're back for lunch did you enjoy lunch today ,oh it was delicious we had some noodles but then we had a chocolate chip cookie for desert that was mm mm mmmm 
120.4,Luis,,i like chocolate chip cookies too yes student did you have a question ,teacher yes yeah i just want to remind you that my dad is an astronaut 
230.1,Farrah,,well congratulations you should be very proud of your dad okay so the second question that we had was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be value and so student you've mentioned that it will be a long time why do you think that ,okay well in the last paragraph it says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money so it sounds like that they don't have the money and it'll take a long time 
230.1,Farrah,,yeah and that's certainly very true it will take a long time to do it and will take a large investment a lot of money will be spent to get the water in other words it's not available right away but if they could get to it and after a while with the water evaluable once they were able to get to it what do you think ,i mean all yeah cuz water it's definitely important so i guess if they could get to it it would be yeah 
230.1,Jazmin,,okay so it'll just take them a while but it'll be important student you mentioned that that the astronauts would need water to drink and to stay hydrated right and why do you think that why is that true ,okay because well you know like we need water to drink um and i feel like i read it in my book i read it in the story where they talked about that they need water to drink 
110.1,Jazmin,,yeah so it's it's certainly mentioned that ,oh yeah yeah yeah i see it okay it's in the beginning it says future astronauts could drink this water 
230.1,Jazmin,,yeah and so that would make it valuable right ,yeah yeah cuz you need to drink 
230.1,Chris,,that's right and student mentioned that that water is is very sorry student and actually you mentioned that water was very heavy and that right now astronauts have to carry it in space but if they could get water on the moon that would certainly be viable why do you think it would be valuable if they can get water on the moon rather than taking it with them ,how could it be soluble if they could take water on the arm instead of waters okay so i said it was heavy oh well because okay so i know about when when the rockets take off that they they it's already heavy right because they have all this fuel and so then maybe you would burn less fuel if if it was less if they didn't have to carry as much water 
230.3,Jazmin,,yes student very good so that's a very good observation on your part student and then if they didn't have to carry all the water with and they had room to carry other things whether that's fuel or other equipment or more people so that's very useful ,i was just thinking um you can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon 
120.4,Oliver,,that's a great idea that's certainly another great use for water is that you could use it to potentially grow your food and so now that's less things that you have to carry with you what else do you think would make water valuable student what are your thoughts on that ,well i had read the same thing that student was talking about in the last paragraph machine to you someone want ours to come up with a plan for extracting are getting out of the poor yeah i mean not i was like arm they need to study the moon's surface and sounds like it will be really hard because i need to study the moons surgace build new equipment i mean it's not valuable because it's too expensive 
230.1,Oliver,,okay so certainly if it's very expensive and hard to do that may or may not be able to get to the water and so unless you can get through it it has no value right say that we do have enough money and we do have enough time to get the water from the moon would then it be valuable ,i mean yeah cuz cuz you know water is valuable yeah okay water is valuable 
120.4,Chris,,ok so student what's another way that water could be valuable what's another thing they could use water for ,excuse me mr teacher i just thought about something from the story 
120.4,Chris,,okay student go ahead ,water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
130.2,Luis,,very good that's a claim that student said right student ,yeah that's what i was gonna say that was that was the answer that i sent for the question 
120.4,Luis,,yeah that that was a very good answer and it can be broken down into those two elements oxygen and hydrogen you've probably heard water all through maybe have h2o the h stands for hydrogen and oxygen and so if you can break it down into those two elements then you can use it for other things what are some things you can use oxygen for what do you think student ,to breathe 
210.4,Luis,,exactly the room you're in now you're breathing oxygen and because we have it in our atmosphere the moon has a very limited atmosphere and there's not enough oxygen to breathe so you have to take action with you or if you can use the water to make oxygen you take advantage there about hydrogen what can hydrogen be used for hey you want to take a quick look at your article that you read you could look at the sentence what do you see there what do you see there that that hydrogen can be used for ,rocket fuel 
110.1,Farrah,,rocket fuel that's right ,rocket fuel 
120.3,Farrah,,exactly right class see that it says rocket fuel ,i don't i don't see what you're seeing 
120.3,Farrah,,the part of the paragraph the article the second part where waters valuable resource it's paragraph number five starts off moon water can use one other ways ,okay yeah yeah oh i see that i see 
210.4,Oliver,,student you have a question okay so i mean like rocket fuel and the moon i would that be by valuable ,well i was just gonna say i was looking at the clock out it's time for the next class um but i did want to say thank you so much mr teacher for helping us think about like what what we needed to find an ma ma ma ma ma story cuz i thought that you know i had read the story pretty well but then because you kept on asking us to think about it and to look at the story i i feel like i kind of maybe get it a little bit more baby 
210.4,Oliver,,well that's how we learn we look at things again and we talk about it and we talked about yeah and then i really appreciate you keeping time for today so that we didn't miss lunch ,okay bye 
210.4,Jazmin,,you class take care ,hi hello how are you 
210.4,Jazmin,,hey i'm doing fine how are you ,we're doing well thank you 
210.4,Luis,,okay so we've had a chance to take a look at the discovery of water on the moon yes student do you have a question ,um yeah it's a question but it's well so here's the thing i know a lot about space so i don't think i really have to be in this class because i already know all this stuff 
110.3,Luis,,that's great that you know that stuff but what i'd like you to do you can help other students learn more to would you like to do that ,yeah that sounds like fun yeah 
120.4,Farrah,,sure it will be okay so the question at hand is what equipment to the scientist use to discover water on the moon so have all you thought about that student what do you think ,um so i think that the um the equipment was the microscope like in the reading it says you need a microscope you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Farrah,,okay and so when you look at that word let's look at that word again where it says that it says the water they found is microscopic and so do you think microscope and microscopic are the same thing ,um well it's like i think if it's microscopic like it's small and that's how like you see small stuff with like a microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,well certainly you can see some small things with a microscope but there's other ways to measure things that may be very very small and it's called microscopic because often it is very small and you wouldn't need a microscope to see it but there's other ways to detect it so in this case they didn't it doesn't look like they said they actually use a microscope they were simply describing the size of the water as being microscopic that makes sense ,oh yeah that doesn't make sense so they didn't actually have a microscope on the moon 
120.4,Chris,,that's correct so student what do you think they used to determine the water was on the moon what did what did the reading tell you ,well so here's the thing like i kind of thought that like um well i've been to nasa with my dad and like we really like we had a really good time like walking around and like we saw all these like exhibits and stuff so i guess my guess is kind of like luis's like i think that they must have used like spacesuits and like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that 
210.4,Jazmin,,But if we look at the the information that was actually provided. Let's go back to that for just a minute and take a look at it where it talks about water on the moon. So everyone look look at it together. And the first statement that it says there. yes student student go ahead ,yeah so i was just wondering if like if the answer was what well i was just a little bit confused like why my answer might not be right 
210.4,Jazmin,,student can you hear me ,i'm sorry it cut out for just a second i'm sorry 
210.4,Jazmin,,i can hear you now ,so basically i was saying that um i was just wondering like why my answer maybe wasn't right like because i think we were just saying that the the the machine was gonna like see everything so i'm just trying to find out like like why my answer might not be right 
210.4,Jazmin,,maybe your answer is right so you answer that that nasa send a small machine and so if we look at what was written actually you can look at number two on there see how it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate student what do you think a lunar orbiter would be ,it's like a spaceship that goes up to the moon and can study things 
210.4,Jazmin,,that's correct because if you look at the name lunar orbiter and look at what each of those words mean lunar refers to what do you know ,the moon 
210.4,Jazmin,,that's right lunar means something dealing with the moon and so what would an orbiter be what does orbit orbit mean ,orbit's like when something's like flying around something or like circling something so like like i guess like maybe like the spaceships like flying around the moon 
210.4,Jazmin,,that's exactly right because lunar orbiter means orbiting flying around the moon and so they have a small machine so the other the other students that looked at that gave different answers you did a great job being able to identify what that means it's not actually on the moon it's simply flying over the moon around the moon to take a look at that the possibilities of water for example student do you now understand with what microscopic means and they didn't have a microscope but they actually had a spaceship that orbited around the moon does that make sense ,yeah i think it does make sense that they like might study the water with a microscope but they they might find it with something else with the machine i 
210.4,Jazmin,,go ahead that's right that's very good and if they were able to get a sample of that water then they could certainly look at it with a microscope but in this case they haven't actually landed on the moon they're simply using the lunar orbiter to study the moon from a distance so so student ,i'm so sorry we have to go to lunch now but before we did i just wanted to thank you for working with us and specifically i wanted to thank you for being so patient sometimes we our science teacher says we give him stress hives and you were so thoughtful and very patient and also like even though our answers were kind of muddled at first like you helped us be very clear about what we were trying to say so thank you so much 
210.4,Bennett,,well thank you student i appreciate it enjoy your lunch alright let's start the simulation ,okay let's bring up the student 
150.1,Luis,,alright um and so yes student do you have a question together because i just want to go over a few of the things that we read in the article ,oh excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.3,Chris,,yes but you can help some of the other students so let's uh we'll use your contribution to help help the other students as well i've got your answers that you that you wrote down and so student could you read the first question that we were supposed to answer ,uh huh it says what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon 
230.3,Chris,,very good teacher but what equipment do you think they used to find it what did you read in the article about the equipment that they used you didn't find where the water is located and you said it found craters with the water ,what equipment they used to find it i don't remember 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay well let me let me ask student a question student you mentioned that nasa sent a small machine what kind of machine did nasa send maybe you can help student with that one ,okay let me look i don't remember that's a small machine called a lunar orbiter that's the small machine it's the lunar orbiter student 
210.4,Chris,,exactly they sent a lunar orbiter have up there and so student do you know what a lunar orbiter is ,oh no i mean i've been a nasa and i saw the mars rover but i don't know what a lunar orbiter is 
130.2,Luis,,okay so student you know a lot about space can you tell us what the lunar orbiter is ,okay well so i know a lot about like what astronauts wear and what they use and i know that there isn't gravity but i actually never heard of a lunar orbiter before so this is news to me 
210.4,Jazmin,,well let me show you a picture of a lunar orbiter this is a lunar orbiter simulation picture of it flying over the moon like satellite flies in space it was launched on a rocket from earth transition to the moon and then it can circle around the room so around the moon so it's orbiting the moon and so that's why it's called a lunar orbiter lunar means moon and so lunar orbiter means something orbits around goes around the moon that makes sense ,but mr teacher i don't understand why my answers wrong 
150.1,Jazmin,,i didn't say your answer was wrong that they said that small machine a lunar orbiter is a type of machine so your answer was right i'm just clarifying what kind of machine that they sent and the machine that they sent is called a lunar orbiter atoms okay does that make sense ,yeah yeah i thought we were all here because all of our answers are wrong 
150.1,Jazmin,,who told you that that's not true i just wanted to clarify your understanding of the art it's not that your answers are wrong we just want to understand better exactly what you're trying to say and when you said a small machine we were able to clarify that that's the lunar orbiter we're going to get into more information that makes sense okay ,yeah yeah 
120.4,Luis,,so student you know a lot about some of the equipment nasa uses any ideas about how they might detect water on from the orbiter ,hmm okay now that i've seen a picture of it um i think that let's see how would they detect the water um i feel like maybe maybe the camera just kind of look for it and if they see some puddles of water and then that's how they find it 
230.1,Farrah,,yeah so that was certainly one one way to do it so student what what did you mention in terms of the ability to find the water you mentioned you would use a scientific tool called a microscope why would they need to use a microscope ,well what i mean cuz it said that in the story that was like the last sentence of the stories you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Chris,,and so student you mentioned that you can see water puddles okay well a microscope is used to look at something really really closely because the water on the moon is is there's so little of it and it's so small yes student certainly if you saw a water puddle you know that was water on the moon the water is much smaller so it's very hard to see in fact if you had a sample from there you wouldn't be able to see it without a microscope yes yes ,i was just gonna say since we're talking about the scientific tools that um i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits that stuff 
120.4,Farrah,,that's a use all those things because the environment in space requires him to have been extra equipment right there's a lot of things that they need to do but what we want to talk about today is is what they did to discover the water on the moon and then try to figure out what would be the value of having water on the moon any thoughts about that well why would finding water on the moon useful student go ahead what do you think student go ahead ,well i was just i was thinking that you know if i'm if if if the astronauts got like you know thirsty or something then they could just like drill a hole in the moon maybe and then they could drink the water like that maybe 
120.4,Oliver,,and so certainly being able to drink water and using it for other things maybe brushing their teeth and simple things like that or to cook with water it's very very important to have for the most part astronauts will take the water they need with them but if they could find a way to get water from the moon and that would save them having to bring it so student what do you have ,well i was just looking at the clock and i i see about it's time for us to go to lunch so i just wanted to let you know before we call 
120.4,All,,all right well thank you i appreciate you keeping time for us and we'll get ready for lunch now okay thank you hey class ,hi 
150.1,Luis,,i was looking over your responses from the reading that we did so i'll read the question again for you class but it was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so sabina do you care to share your response with us and so i just wanted to kind of get your input and let you class share with me your responses on the question ,excuse me a teacher i hadn't been on this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Farrah,,right student so you'll be able to share some information with us and maybe you can learn from your friends to okay ,off okay okay student and so do you mind to share with us what your response was 
110.3,Farrah,,yeah ,sure i sit on that scientists could use the microscope to find the water 
130.2,,,that's great so do you class think that you can use a microscope to find water on the moon class think student student ,i have a same thing 
210.4,Oliver,,okay student or sabina what do you class use a microscope for ,us to look at small stuff that's right so um have you used a microscope in your other science classes yeah yeah well you're stomping mr smith's clash 
130.1,All,,we're so we use microscopes to discover things just like you class said it is a tool that we can use to help us to discover things but if we go back in the text and we just need to clarify but what did they use on the moon to discover water do you know what that that tool was called what tool they this the scientists used so you can use a microscope ,um 
130.1,,,do you class have in front of you ,yeah 
120.3,Chris,,teacher student can we go to paragraph two ,yeah 
120.3,Chris,,very first in its ,nasa send a small machine on the lunar orbiter to investigate 
120.1,Farrah,,oh so oliveron student what was the tool that they used on the moon ,and lunar orbiter 
150.1,Oliver,,that's right so they use a machine a tool similar to the microscope like you class said to discuss to investigate and discover and that was called the lunar orbiter does that make sense to you all ,um well i guess i didn't know because you had student read it 
130.2,Jazmin,,but they use a different tool on the moon to discover so i think both of you were you were right in the fact that they do use the scientific tool but we just need to clarify what that tool so you class did a really good job at using your past knowledge on microscopes student what did the scientists fine yes ,i don't understand what why is my answer wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,so student what did what did you say ,i said that i used to small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,and you're right so they did use a small machine do you know what the name of that machine was ,i think it was the one you had student read a lunar orbiter 
210.4,Jazmin,,a lunar orbiter so that's what they used to investigate what were they investigating do you know they were trying to find ,ice deposits 
150.1,Jazmin,,yeah so what they use was the moon lunar orbiter so you were right in that it was a small machine so great job student Does that make sense. ,i think so 
120.3,Luis,,so if we go back and read this sentence that i'm student read in the name of this small machine was a lunar orbiter and what did that lunar orbiter do so student can you read the second sentence and paragraph two ,i'm sure okay this loan or what oh well land damone south pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater 
210.4,Jazmin,,good job so what did the lunar orbiter do student ,look for ice deposits 
210.4,Jazmin,,good job and what did they discover in those ice deposits so those ice deposits held what so i'll read this in it for said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in about 32 ounces of water ,water 
210.4,Chris,,water so by using the lunar orbiter to decide to investigate the ice deposits those ice deposit sores what was holding the water yes student ,um well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.3,Luis,,your right and so student said the same thing right student what was something that you said that scientists use ,i said oxygen tanks too and spacesuit 
110.2,Chris,,right so they those are different types of equipment that scientists use so you class are right and that they use oxygen tanks and space suits do do those equipment does that equipment help them discover water ,um well i guess i guess not i mean it and helps them breathe on on the mon 
210.3,Luis,,right so what does the oxygen tank do student ,and helps them breathe 
210.2,Luis,,so that equipment is something that they use to help them breathe so what equipment do they used to help them discover water ,lunar orbiter 
230.1,Oliver,,what's right so student you did a really good job at stating that scientists found craters full of water on the moon so what made you think that that was the type of equipment that they used ,i'm teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch thanks for taking my time to work with us 
120.2,Farrah,,you're welcome bye class hey class welcome back and so we think of convincing evidence what does that mean to you student we're gonna follow up with the question of is there convincing evidence that water on the name could be valuable ,oh it means that like you got to say it so that i believe you 
210.2,Oliver,,oh good job so it's something that needs to be stated it in a way that you can believe it right what about you demi what does convincing mean ,convince me that you gotta know more than me 
230.3,Oliver,,so there has to be more knowledge they have to provide more knowledge than what you have ,yeah yeah 
210.2,Chris,,okay student what does convincing mean ,if if your friend wants to do something and you don't want to do it and they like the try to get you to do with a big that's convincing 
230.3,Jazmin,,okay so they're making statements to make you believe something ,well i guess like when i am trying to advocate for our environment and i go out and i i pass out leaflets to try to tell people what they can do i try to convince them 
210.2,Luis,,good job student what is convincing for you ,i'm well i convince class that i'm like i'm the best at minecraft ever i just want to remind you all saw that my dad is actually an astronaut 
140.1,Luis,,oh it's awesome how do you convince people that you're the best at minecraft what do you say ,i beat them and i say ah you can't do it as well as me and then i play the game and i get the most points and and i say you're a loser 
140.1,Luis,,well you actually show them by beating them in the game right so you're using actions instead of words to convince them ,yeah 
120.4,Jazmin,,so we're talking about convincing evidence evidence means information that supports the statement being made so we're going to look at the evidence the information that supports that water on the moon could be valuable it can be of use for the astronauts so student you stated that there was not convincing evidence is that correct ,well i just i mean i do think there's convincing evidence because like they could drink the water and they could stay hydrated and you need water so that seems to be convincing the have water 
210.3,Jazmin,,good job so you redirected and rethought your answer and you looked back at the text on if there was convincing evidence that water can be valuable and one way astronauts could do what with the water ,we can drink it 
230.1,Oliver,,you're very good drink it and that's something that's valuable to them because we all have to have water to stay hydrated right right right student and you say that there wasn't enough convincing evidence what makes you believe that there's not enough convincing evidence ,um well i i know that um i know that the mo0ns not ready to live on so i don't think that i'm convinced that arm but we could we could get water from there because we can't live there 
210.4,Oliver,,oh so you're looking at it from the fact that the moon is not ready as a whole to be lived on right what else what else do we mean student besides water ,air 
210.3,Oliver,,we need air to breathe did they have air on the moon yet no no so it's the moon isn't ready for us to live on yet so you're absolutely right but if there was water on the moon but that help us ,yeah because then you can like take a bath on your card arm drink it like like what 
110.4,Chris,,it could be something that we drink it could be something that we could use to stay clean good job your rights right so if there was water on the moon it would be valuable student you did a good job for answering and you say to that water can be valuable because it's so heavy and then astronauts wouldn't have to carry it anymore correct ,i have yeah 
120.4,Jazmin,,and then student what did you say astronauts could do ,i said they could drink it 
210.4,Chris,,they can drink it can we survive without water now ,what else must miss paul i also saw in this mo story that i'm water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
110.2,Luis,,you're right you did a great job with with understanding what water is even how can it be valuable for us on the moon ,because we can while we can drink it and we can take a bath and i'm 
110.2,Luis,,teacher ,okay 
110.2,Oliver,,yeah we can use it to drink we can use it to bake those are great job class thank you hey class how are you ,hi it's good to see you hi 
220.1,Luis,,it's good to see you hey so i wanted to go over the discussion question that you all answer yes student ,um yeah so i had kind of this question like i already know like all about space i know all this stuff so i was kind of wondering like i don't think i should be in this class 
110.3,Luis,,but what we really want to focus on is more of this reading and so why don't you go ahead and read the discussion question for us okay well i'm so glad that you know a lot about space ,okay um the discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
120.4,Luis,,teacher alright student so without looking at the text do you know the answer to that question ,um well i think that they use like oxygen tanks and that they use like space suits and stuff like that 
210.1,Luis,,okay they do use that in space but i think the question is asking what did they use to discover water so do you know what specific tool they use to discover water ,oh i didn't really read that closely because i thought i kind of knew this stuff 
420.3,Luis,,okay so how about we go back in the text and look a little bit more closely so that we can learn more information about space okay ,okay 
120.4,Farrah,,all right student and what was your answer to the discussion question ,so my answer was that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.2,Farrah,,and that is a great answer and but let's can you find that in the text is there any way you can go back in the text and see where you found that ,yeah absolutely um okay so in paragraph paragraph three 
230.2,Farrah,,all right ,you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely after it talks about the water 
120.4,Chris,,okay and that is a great answer but if we look at what the question is asking it's asking what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon that word discover is really really important can class help me explain what the word discover means student ,yeah okay so i think like discover is like how you you find something or you kind of like um like you you like find something 
150.1,Farrah,,that's absolutely right find is a perfect word so when you discover that means you're finding something for the first time so back to student and i think student you said you had the same answers her when they use the microscope that wasn't to discover the water that wasn't to find the water on the moon that's when you get on the moon and you you have to use that microscope to look really closely but that's not the tool that they use to find it for the very first time okay does that make sense ,yeah i think so so like my answer wasn't quite right but it was like that they they have to use something else to discover the water 
120.4,Jazmin,,right yes and so once they discovered the water on the moon then the scientists can use the microscope to look at it really closely but that's not what they used to discover it okay so what we need to do is we need to go back in the text and find what the scientists used to discover that there was water on the moon alright student you kind of want to explain your answer for us ,sure so basically what i said was that that nasa used a small machine and that's like the machine that they sent to the moon 
130.2,Chris,,okay yeah and so what did that small machine do student can you look in paragraph two and tell us what this small machine did ,yeah okay so small machine um nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
230.2,Luis,,okay and so what that lunar orbiter does that's the small machine student that they sent and the small machine you were talking about is called the lunar orbiter and what does that lunar orbiter do ,um so like the lunar orbiter i guess like okay so it flies around the moon and maybe it lands on the moon and and it might do things like 
130.2,Chris,,okay so student can you help him out and tell us what the lunar orbiter does ,"Yeah, so I could do that. But I like first. I just wanted to ask, like, um, i went to nasa so like with my dad and we saw that like the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so like i guess i'm a little confused like is student wrong or like i'm not quite sure "
210.4,Chris,,no and so why don't we why don't we answer my question first and then i'll get right back to what you asked okay so my question was can you tell us what the lunar orbiter does so i want you to read the second sentence in paragraph two ,the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for the ice deposits and a large pool crater 
120.4,Jazmin,,ok so the lunar orbiter student the small machine that they sent it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater now these ice deposits are very very very small okay so then paragraph three goes on and talk about how the moon is still drier well that means if we go back to paragraph two what did they use to investigate so when we investigate something we're normally discovering something what did they use to investigate the lunar what is it student ,so they used the lunar orbiter to investigate 
120.4,Farrah,,to investigate and what did they discover when they used that small machine to investigate what did they discover student what did they discover ,they found lots of um well they found water they found amounts of water 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon yes so they found very very small amounts of water those ice deposits student ,so they used the lunar orbiter to discover water and so we have to go in just a moment but before we went i just wanted to thank you for teaching the class and i especially wanted to thank you for like really spending time with us too and being really patient with our different answers like sometimes we give our science teacher he says we gave him stress hives and i'm really really patient and also like i think that you really helped us to like work as a class to something like don't get along and you really helped us to work strongly as a class so thank you so much 
130.1,Luis,,thank you student and student i want to answer your question real fast before you leave student and student i think you both did a great job at may at using your outside resources so different things that you've experienced in your life related to this and i think that that's awesome and no you are not wrong those are all tools that scientists use but just make sure you're reading the question of what specific equipment did they used to discover water on the moon okay great job yes student ,yeah so here's the thing um i don't really need to be in this class because i know all about space so i don't think i really need to be here 
150.1,Luis,,well perhaps you can help us all learn more about space as we continue going forward in a class ,okay yeah i can do that 
150.1,Farrah,,okay ,so we were just talking about our answers to the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and you can ask us anything you like 
230.3,Farrah,,okay um student you believe that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely when you are trying to look at water on the moon ,right 
130.2,Chris,,but within within the actual text what does nasa send to the moon to actually investigate for the water on the moon yes does class else have another aspect what they may have also sent with the astronauts student ,i think that what they must have sent was um like oxygen tanks and masks and like suits and stuff like that because um they they have to like breathe in space like my dad took me to nasa and we saw like that they had to use all this equipment and everything so like they had to use it if they were going to space 
120.1,Oliver,,okay and that would be that would be correct there's definitely no oxygen in space but this is there anything that they would take with them to possibly try to investigate and sort of study the water on the moon with them can class does class have an idea ,yeah so basically um i think i had the same answer is student and we thought that it was the microscope that they had to send to basically like look at the water and see the water so um i guess what i'm trying to understand is like did is like um why my answer is wrong like efforts because we're all working together to get a better answer like maybe why is my answer wrong 
150.1,Oliver,,you would definitely they are microscopic so if it was on earth you would definitely need a microscope to visually look at the water well it's part it's part of the answer but within the maybe perhaps the second paragraph it says you know what they sent with the astronauts to investigate the water on the moon does that does that make sense ,um yeah um so they it was the they sent like a microscope and something else 
120.1,Jazmin,,perhaps um does it talk about anything else within the paragraphs ,um let's see i guess um well they talk about so i think they sent a small machine 
130.3,Jazmin,,student you haven't spoken yet what do you believe they may have sent to the moon okay yes within the second paragraph it talks about nasa would send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ,so is that just what i was missing was just the name of it 
110.2,Jazmin,,i mean it is a small machine it you're you're still correct ,so yeah i think it was a small machine the lunar orbiter is what they sent because it was sent up and then they would like fly around the moon and then i guess it lands on the moon and then it would discover the water i think 
150.1,Jazmin,,you are correct yes student does class does class have any questions yes student ,i just want to thank you we have to go to lunch now but i just take the moment you for working with us and for being so positive i think sometimes our science teacher says that we give him stress hives and you were very patient with us and you really took the time to listen to our answers and i just wanted to thank you for that 
150.1,Luis,,no problem enjoy your lunch start simulation hello class welcome to class yes student ,hi yeah okay so basically what i was gonna say is that um you know i don't think i even need to be in this class because i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,and maybe even help others learn more about science and sort of explore their own strengths within that type of knowledge and that may be the case student but it is always best to you know sort of definitely challenge our preconceptions of of science and how we can further our learning ,yeah i could do that 
120.4,Jazmin,,has class completed reading the water on the moon assignment okay i can tell by the way some of you are shaking your head that you have completed that i have also looked at some of the answers that you have given for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon i would like to at least in the beginning let's let's let student and chrise let us know what they got for the first question for what tool was you to discover water on the moon ,okay um so for me i said that scientists foudn craters full of water on the moon to me i say that nasa sent a small machine okay i was kind of curious like i was wondering like why my answer was wrong 
120.2,Jazmin,,okay well let's um so you're you were able to find out that there was that they used a small machine that is you know very good job you were able to discover sort of what the answer was if we wanted to explore perhaps more what would be even maybe more correct answer so the question is so what i'm sort of wondering could you be a little bit more specific perhaps in identifying what that small machine could possibly be so to be a little bit more specific you would then you know want to choose perhaps the lunar orbiter where did you get the question is what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon ,it says that the small machine this machine is the lunar orbiter 
150.1,Jazmin,,ok so the lunar orbiter good job so for the most part that so that is the small machine the exact same thing is the lunar orbiter ,it says in the reading that you need nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate so the lunar orbiter must be this small machine 
210.2,Chris,,"correct so to be a little bit more specific you would then you know want to choose perhaps the lunar orbiter And so, I mean, for example, a small machine could sort of, I mean that could be anything, you know, from maybe even a remote car to even a clock on the wall. But you can't use those to sort of discover water on the moon. and student you are you are you know you were correct to you you're able to find out where they were able to find the water but what what tool or piece of equipment would they actually did the scientists used to perhaps find that water on the moon within the craters ",well okay so i went to nasa with my dad and when we went there i saw that scientists a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and and stuff like i i was thinking maybe that was something that that you know what i mean that's the tools that they're using 
420.3,Chris,,well they would definitely use that equipment especially to you know breathe and sort of operate within the space around the moon and on the moon so good job yeah yeah but if you were to look through the sort of the article a little bit more you know sort of try to pick out some keywords ,that's a good question i guess you might need other equipment yeah you couldn't just like use the suit and be like oh yeah here here's like the water you can use other stuff that's a great question 
420.3,Farrah,,yes yes student ,unfortunately we have to go on to our next class but we wanted to thank you so much for working with us thank you 
420.3,Luis,,thank you student hello class so sorry i had to walk outside for a second yes student ,um yeah i just wanted to remind you that my dad is actually an astronaut which is pretty cool 
140.1,Luis,,do you know the name of the facility that your dad works at ,i yeah he works at that that's dennis space center i'm in mississippi and he kind of like commute so we don't get to see him as often as you know we like 
140.1,Luis,,well that's that's unfortunate but does he uh are you able to speak to him on a regular basis perhaps or some online activity or is hearing stories ,yeah yeah we talk on skype all the time 
110.3,Luis,,well that's that's that's really cool you know sort of idea that you have that sort of special inroads you know you're a you know first hand knowledge of some of this might actually come you know sort of in handy and help somebody goes to kind of understand this material ,awesome 
120.4,Oliver,,okay so here's what's going you started the the second question that was asked about the you know how the moon is a desert and how water is a valuable resource the second question that you know the second prompt that was given is is that is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable and student what was your answer to that question ,um ok so my answer was no you know i'm because i don't think it's ready yet 
210.3,Oliver,,okay well good job yes it was in the text it does state that you know this technology will you know sort of be needed to be expanded upon going forward but let's say for example the do you need do you need water to live on earth ,oh yeah you're totally need it and like i i could see that like maybe it would be maybe valuable but i don't think it's like that convincing the evidence because it seems like it would cost a lot of money and take a lot of time to like we don't even really have spaceship that go to the moon very often 
210.3,Jazmin,,okay well good job for sure um it would be very expensive every time that you know you need to go into spaces is pretty expensive but if one day we are able to you know perhaps expand our you know space traveling capabilities to be able to actually use the water on the moon might be a little bit more inexpensive inexpensive than actually having to transport it to me yes student ,and will and i was thinking like what you could do with all the water is like grow a garden all over the moon like you could make this moon garden 
110.2,Jazmin,,well that would definitely you know really come in handy for any you know scientists or astrologers who might perhaps be on the moon i'm not totally sure we could have like maybe the entire moon being covered by garden but it would definitely you know perhaps provide sort of you know sort of some greenhouses that we might be able to construct on the moon so that perhaps the scientists could even perhaps grow vegetables and have something to that that they can grow to eat on the moon ,yeah that's really cool 
210.3,Farrah,,this can class does he might know of another reason that it might actually sort of be beneficial to have water on the moon they might actually help out astronauts let's go with student ,actually i was asking because i my opinion is that it's actually not very convincing evidence that kind of agree with with student so i don't know if you wanted someone who thought it was convincing is because i kind of think it's like not but i think that it will be valuable but not for a long time 
230.3,Farrah,,yes yes it's so you are correct currently like like you said as for right now is you know not very valuable just because we don't really have class there but ,yeah 
210.3,Farrah,,but do you think perhaps like you said perhaps in the future is there enough evidence you know you know at least going forward if it were to have some type of you know human habitation there on the surface of the moon with the water become more valuable than for those who live there ,oh yeah i think in like sure it could be very valued it just seems like people you know like it would be hard to build it and yeah i i could see and i just think it will be valuable you know long time 
110.1,Luis,,fair enough yes student ,um yeah so actually um so what i was thinking is that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and you know stuff like that um and then also like you know water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
210.4,Chris,,you know we human beings breathe oxygen yes that was within the actual document that you can split up water into oxygen and hydrogen that is very good student you were able to find that key evidence very quickly yes student you've had your hand up and perhaps hydrogen can be used for rocket fuel for maybe traveling back to earth from the moon ,yeah i was just gonna say that so water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and we like you know that in the reading it says that 
210.4,Luis,,yes yes it good job student you student are on the same page you both have come up with the same evidence that perhaps you know like like you said if we were able to ever have someone living on the moon hopefully soon but maybe you know further along in the future yes student and that would provide ample reasoning for us to be able to use that water even if it is barely sparsely spread out to enhance those astronauts and scientists labs there on the moon ,um so we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and so like in particular i really wanted to thank you for asking me so much about my dad and it was really fun to talk in this class and share with class about like some of my life and and it was really cool like you helped us to understand like that we needed to evidence from the text step we were eating and that that was really important and you really asked us to explain ideas like why we thought that something was you know valuable or not valuable and like student and deb have different ideas then like student and i and you really i'm like listen to our opinions so i i feel like really good about class and i'm really excited to like learn some more from you so thank you so much 
210.4,Luis,,okay good afternoon class i hope everyone's having a good day yes student ,um yeah i just was i just wanted to say i don't think i should be in this class because i already know like all there is to know about space 
120.3,Jazmin,,i'm so glad you know a lot about space because we need all the knowledge to help us especially with these questions that we have today i'm glad that you brought that up about space because that's why we're here today to talk about the very question is you might remember the question who could read the question that we have student can i get you to read the question ,reach every reader okay the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
420.1,Oliver,,okay so and student brought up about space and i'm glad that he did that that's a good point because we're talking about the space in the moon but the reason we're here today is to find out how that we can answer these questions and look deeper into it okay so she brought up what equipment did scientists use to discovered water on the moon so what i want you to do for just a couple minutes look back at that question and i want you to take your pencil and circle or highlight some important words that you feel that are important to you or something that stands out to you So go ahead and do that right now. okay is that enough does antone need a little bit more time ,i think we're good 
420.1,Oliver,,all right all right student what is something that stood out to you in that question or even it's something that you're concerned about ,"um in the question or in the whole text Yeah. Um, okay. So what are the things that I circled in the question was basically you know I circled equipment and I'm water. "
230.1,Oliver,,equipment water okay why did you circle equipment ,um i circled equipment because they're asking in the question they're saying what equipment did the scientists used to discover the water so it seems like the answer would have to be some kind of equipment 
310.1,Farrah,,very good job looking deep into your question and circling the keywords did anyone else circle equipment. all right student what else did you sir all right alright so student what else did you circle besides anything else besides equipment ,yes so what i did was i said equipment and discover 
230.1,Farrah,,discover all right and why did you circle discover ,discover because they were asking like you know what i mean like what they found the water like discovers like something that you like found the first time and asking like what equipment found the water 
150.1,Farrah,,and i'm glad you did that you know what you're doing you're reminding me like when we look into text will become a detective and looking deep into it just like student and i'm sure to the rest of you just like student brought up about space he's looking into it he knows this is not just about equipment but about space yes student and student the same thing discovers like a verb we're looking deep into it and you're trying to find out what they discovered ,i just i just was wondering like i didn't i wasn't quite sure why my answer was wrong 
130.1,Farrah,,when i looked over your answer there was some great points you brought about it it wasn't that it wasn't wrong it is what it is it's not that it was the wrong answer it could have been a better choice and we're going to get talk about more about that when we're talking just like you brought up discover before when you look at the question did you look at discover ,i'm i'm mostly focused well i guess yeah i thought about discover just like student i circled equipment and water 
140.1,Chris,,okay and once you run it you look at equipment you look at microscope and that is an equipment but we're looking deeper into the question just like today all right because we're looking at what equipment is just like today sitting in front of you okay you're sitting there were at school now we're not scientist and we're not astronauts and there's some things that we do know but right now you every one of your student at school right so what's an equipment you have right now thats helping you with your work student ,oh oh well that's a good question but i was gonna say first just real quick because i went to nasa i know that scientists use like lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and i saw that they weren't in the in the reading but if your question about like what do we like we use tablets and we use pencils and paper 
120.2,Jazmin,,and i'm glad you brought that up too about nasa because you know what today when we're learning you're having to use the tablets you may have a pencil in front of you but things are changing now just like when they did their research it's different some things are different now in school right and we're learning differently and you class have done a great job by looking more into this because you can use some of your knowledge that you have or you've read about nasa to help you with things like this and help our partners alright so let's go back to our question and we talked about equipment we have like you said the tablets and pencils but what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon Okay. And then I'm going to work with Chris and Jazmin and Luis Okay. all right all right so i didn't get to see what student student what did you circle ,in the in the question 
120.2,Jazmin,,yes ,i circled equipment and discover 
150.1,Jazmin,,discover great a lot of you are doing it and that's i think that's awesome that you're thinking about that and looking at that and again that's a verb it's going to connect you back when you're looking at a question you will get where they're asking for and that's key points every one of you said equipment and they discovered and then a lot yes event student sorry ,it's time for the next class so thank you so much for working with us 
150.1,Luis,,glad to see you class today yes student ,um yeah i just wanted to remind class that my dad is actually an astronaut 
120.3,Oliver,,oh wow that's awesome information because you know what that can help us out today about learning about the importance of you class are going to look back over questions about convincing the evidence that water on the moon could be valuable thank you student because i know that you can make some great connections about your dad because i know he has shared a lot of information about things that he has done it work alright so let's go ahead and one thing i was looking at every all the responses that class had and i was very impressed about how class took time to look over and look into the text and had some really deep connections and that you really thought about the things that we were asking all right can i get student to read the question for us please ,sure okay so it says um is there convincing evidence that water on the moon would be valuable 
420.1,Jazmin,,"okay so what we're going to do right now we're going to use the same strategy that we've been taught before about how important it is to make these connections and find out what the question's asking and help us to go back to the text so first what i want you to do is get your pencil or highlighter and look back over and find an important word or words that you feel you don't understand okay Okay, I'll start with Jazmin. Jazmin. what word is there ",i think i know the word but i just wanted to check evidence what does it mean 
210.2,Farrah,,evidence okay all right evidence did class else have that word evidence raise your hand if you had that word okay let's talk about evidence what do you think evidence would be what do you think evidence would be student ,evidence is like in detective stories like it's like how they proove something so it's like proof 
210.2,Jazmin,,She used like a Luis use that his dad was an astronaut. Made a connection and we're studying about space and on the moon. You made a connection a detective. and we're going to discover evidence and proof very good alright so student she's exactly right like we're looking for proof what are we looking for proof for proof of what ,we're looking to see if the if the like okay so is there like good proof i guess they're like strong like convincing proof that the water it's valuable and i think it is and i think you could even grow a garden on the moon 
230.1,Jazmin,,oh so what makes you think you could grow a garden on the moon ,because they talk about the water and they said like the astronauts could be able to drink the water eventually and and be hydrated and you can't survive without water water to grow plants 
110.2,Jazmin,,great and that's a good connection so i loved your response about the word you used use the word hydrate did you use hydrate student you said it again ,you can stay hydrated 
230.3,Jazmin,,i like that response because that's something you're proving to me whenever i asked you about the garden what makes you think you could and you're telling me did you tell me that our plants need water to survive is that correct ,yes so if there was water you could make a garden you could grow it using the water 
310.1,Chris,,i love that so you went back into the text when you said you didn't understand that word ,"Oh yeah, it was mostly the same word evidence. And I was thinking that, like, basically. Well, I think the evidence is good because water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen plus water so heavy. They don't have to carry it in ships anymore. "
110.2,Chris,,how did you know that water's heavy i thought that was a great idea to be you look at that i'm glad you looked at that detail about hearing the shoes because it's heavy ,oh well cuz okay so i actually knew already because um well i guess they said it in the reading but they but like i knew that because i visited nasa and i know all about nasa and i could tell you that water is like one of the heaviest things they have to carry on a spaceship 
110.1,Luis,,i bet student could confirm that about his dad probably has told him too right student all right so great connections i love this ,yeah yeah true very true very good 
120.2,Farrah,,okay so we're looking at again is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable yes student ,i'm so i'm so sorry but unfortunately we do have to go to watch but before we go to lunch i just really wanted to thank you for that in particular i really wanted to thank you for helping us use evidence from the text in our answers and you also helped us declare hi hi 
120.2,Farrah,,hello how are you class ,we're doing well thank you how are you 
140.1,Luis,,doing great so did you enjoy reading the passage ,you know i think we did um yeah i enjoyed it but i just have a question i don't really think that i should be in this class because i already know like all about space 
230.1,Luis,,what is it you know about space ,oh man i know all this stuff like rocket launches and like equipment and like all this stuff that like people would would use to go into space and like you know what i mean like all kinds of stuff 
110.3,Farrah,,i want each one of you to get a little piece of paper i don't want you to write down what all you know about space okay that's great student you know what you gave me a great idea i want each one of you to get a little piece of paper we're going to do that um i'll sit like a little timer here ,we can work super fast okay so we actually just finished 
120.4,Farrah,,great alright so what we were talking about your your article or your passage it was what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon you're talking about space alright so let's go over i want you to share with a partner but i'm gonna have the first class we're going to let student student and student you get you three work together and let student and student work and share what you know about space okay with each other quietly okay so class can turn to each other and show each other what you know about space okay now let's go over to the first class student what's something that you learn new from your partners ,so pearson was talking about how he went to nasa and he like got to go and visit with his dad and so he was talking about how like in like rocket launches how like the like um like it looks like smoke but it's actually steam comes out of the rocket when it flies up which is pretty cool 
110.2,Farrah,,great and there's a lot dealing with article because that's like equipment right like you read about equipment in the passage that we had all right what about oh yes ,i was wondering can i ask you a quick question 
110.2,Farrah,,yes ,um so i just wanted to ask you um so it seems like my answers like not quite correct what i said about like the microscope i'm just trying to understand why 
120.4,Farrah,,okay so your answer was will you refresh my memory and tell me what your answer was ,sure my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.3,Oliver,,okay so let's go back at a our article so class look at your article student you had a great question there okay all right who would like to read the first part there can i get you to do it student alright student read that the number one ,um yeah i can read it okay so um let's see our scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert are we reading paragraph one 
120.3,Oliver,,i must have something different on my screen so i don't i have scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters you have that one ,you're right that was a different page sorry yeah you're right scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines 
120.3,Chris,,great all right who would like to read number two okay let's let student will you read number two ,um yeah okay so um so nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small 
120.4,Luis,,okay so let's look back what equipment did the scientists use discover water on the moon okay um yes student ,okay so i think that they probably had to use stuff like oxygen tanks and masks and spacesuits and and like stuff like that you know 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay yes good response student ,i think they use the small machine machine and it's called a lunar orbiter i think that's what they used to discover the water 
120.3,Jazmin,,okay that's a good response alright student can i get you to read number three ,sure okay number three that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.4,Farrah,,okay and student isn't that what you mentioned you'd need a scientific tool called a what ,a microscope 
230.2,Farrah,,mm hmm and why we use that for to look at what to look at things ,to look closely like to see something close 
140.1,Farrah,,okay what's something that we use today or you've ever used if we want to look at something very close it's really small what's something that we could use ,um like different than a microscope 
140.1,Farrah,,yeah ,um the like a magnifying glass 
140.1,Chris,,yeah like a magnifying glass how many of you have ever seen a microscope good okay all right so student where did you see a microscope at ,um so i saw a microscope like in science class um like i've seen it in a couple places but i think we've all seen it in science class and also we've like you know we've seen it in movies and stuff like that 
120.4,Farrah,,okay all right student ,um yeah so i just unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we went to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and i especially wanted to thank you for really asking us like to think about what we already know about space and like how that like really gets us excited to like work together and talk about it with each other and sometimes our science teacher says we give him stress hives and you were so patient and very very very thoughtful and how you asked us questions i just wanted to thank you 
120.4,Farrah,,well thank you i hope you class have a great day ,thank you 
120.4,Oliver,,hi good afternoon students can can class hear me okay ,yeah we can you yeah we can hear you hello 
120.4,Farrah,,okay thank you okay good good to see class okay so i asked you what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon let's let's go over some of your responses here student i it seems like you and student here we're kind of on the same path student can you read your response for me please ,i'm sure i can i think student has his hand raised 
120.4,Luis,,oh sorry let me scroll over there oh yeah you did have your hand raise i'm sorry go ahead you go first ,oh no problem i just um i don't think i should be in this class because i already know like all about space so i don't really have like a lot more to cover 
140.1,Luis,,oh you already know a lot about space good what do you want me to tell me about space student ,um well there's like i know all about like rocket launches and i know about like you have to where spacesuits and oxygen tanks and like you know like i know that like space is a vacuum like all that kind of stuff 
110.3,Luis,,okay so you do have some some of a good foundation on space so when we cover more about space it seems like you'll be able to help some of your classmates right ,yeah that sounds pretty good 
110.3,Luis,,okay so maybe maybe we go forward maybe i'll have you been one of our class leaders okay ,all right 
230.1,Farrah,,okay so that sounds good thank you student but let's let's go back to our question about the equipment used on the moon so let's go back and look at our responses here now i did notice student and student had the same response so which one of you would like to explain your response okay so man i see you i see your hand yes ,yes so basically i said that um that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i guess what i mean is that like in paragraph three it talks about how you have to be able to use the microscope to even see the water 
230.2,Oliver,,okay and so that's very good student and student is that where you found your evidence as well ,um yeah so i pretty much have the same place and the same idea um i think adding to farrahs answer like i think that you have to use the microscope to see it you can't like find it i guess unless you can see it 
130.1,Oliver,,okay so they they can't see it without the microscope now how do you think they originally were able to get the water though remember we're seeing how they discovered water on the moon so you both are on the right track here in the equipment they're using a microscope to see the water ,"Um, yeah. So should I go back and read? "
120.4,Jazmin,,you why don't you go ahead you and student why don't you go ahead and take a moment to read back again starting from paragraph one and see if you can underline what they use to discover water on the moon and then while you're doing that can i hear from some of the people that haven't talked about what about student or student and when you tell me what what you read okay let's hear from student you were you were putting your head at hand and let me hear from you first so you were you're gonna put your hand up ,basically what i learned was that that they sent a small machine up to the moon 
230.2,Jazmin,,okay they sent a small machine and where did you see that at ,it's in paragraph two and actually i have a question about that so i knew that we're all working together to try to improve our answers and i'm wondering like what might be wrong about my answer 
210.3,Jazmin,,okay so when we answer something do you think sometimes maybe it's we can be a little more specific that way there's no confusion so you how do you think if we took your answer they send a small machine which your correctly did what else how could we make that a little more clear for somebody if they had no idea what you're talking about ,like if we could say what the machine is that's like being used 
210.3,Jazmin,,okay so we could say what machine is and what what was the machine here that was being used ,machine was the lunar orbiter 
110.4,Chris,,ok so the machine was the lunar orbiter so why don't you go ahead and circle that and then i'm going to come back to you in just a moment let me hear from student student what were you gonna say ,okay so basically i was gonna say kind of like i guess kind of like what student said before like i went to nasa with my dad and like i know that scientists have to use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and all that kind of stuff so like i guess i'm wondering like is that i guess that's not the answer but didn't they have to use that stuff to find the water 
110.3,Chris,,okay you know what student i that sounds like a good point so maybe there was there's probably more than just one thing used to find this water but oftentimes when we're asked a question we want to come to the best answer we can possibly give or the most clear and simplest answer which in this case student was just saying it is in paragraph two but like you said you said you went on a trip to nasa with your father so i think that means you probably have a lot you could share with the rest of the class about some of your experience with nasa and maybe we could talk about that here in a little bit and you could tell us some more interesting facts ,okay yeah that sounds great 
110.3,Luis,,okay so maybe you and student could be our two leaders when it comes to some of the having a little more knowledge about space okay ,yeah awesome 
110.3,Oliver,,now why don't we come back to student and student have you class finished i'm rereading the the passage ,on yeah we get that we checked and kind of read through everything 
110.3,Farrah,,okay you read through everything student you as well ,yeah 
120.4,Farrah,,okay and what what did you find what what do you like to share together as a class ,well i guess we were listening to as you were saying this stuff with with student so i guess the the difference is like what's the best answer and like i guess you like you said you have to you have to find the water before you can use the microscope to see the water so they couldn't have used the microscope to discover the water unless they unless they knew it was there 
130.2,Oliver,,exactly so they had to discover it first before they could use the microphone okay so and student did you agree with student ,um yeah no i agree and i think that makes sense to me 
420.1,Jazmin,,so then that is why sometimes when we're looking at questions we got to be really careful because sometimes they'll try to trick you by throwing in a little something that could be the answer but you got to be clever and make sure you watch out and make sure you're looking for what could be the best answer you can give by throwing in a little something that could be the answer but you got to be clever and make sure you watch out and make sure you're looking for what could be the best answer you can give now student what's your question ,so actually we have to go to lunch here in just a moment but i wanted to thank you for working with us and especially i wanted to thank you so much for really having us work with each other and having a sort of think through our answers ourselves sometimes our science teacher says that we give him stress hives and you were so patient with us and also sometimes we don't necessarily get along as a class but you really encourage us to like work with each other and listen to each other's answers and then come to like a better answer ourselves so it just to thank you for doing that 
420.1,Jazmin,,now thank you student and thank all of you i think you're all great students and i think that we're going to get through this together and we're going to do great things in science here ,reach every reader sounds good okay 
420.1,Luis,,thank you hi good afternoon class okay it's good to see class it looks like right here as we get started looks like student has a question what's your question ,um well it's actually more like a comment i i already know all about space so i don't think i have to be in this class 
230.1,Luis,,okay so i student so you think are you know a lot about space so what makes you think that you wouldn't want to be part of this class though ,well cuz you know when you're working with us because we we didn't have the right answer um so you wanted to talk to us so i feel like i kind of know everything 
110.3,Luis,,if you think you have a you know if you know a lot about space don't you think that would make it even better for you to be in this class to help the rest of us and maybe we could learn from each other ,that's a good point okay i'll stick around 
120.4,Farrah,,so that sounds very good so would class like to open up with what they thought as far as their response to the first discussion question all right let's start with okay we got a couple hands going up how about we start with student ,okay so basically my answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close 
120.1,Farrah,,"okay so that's that's right so you said that you would need a microscope to look really closely Do you think if we went back to the text, could we find anything else that scientists might have used when they were discovering wonder on the moon? Any other equipment. ",yeah because we could okay so we should look for i should look for more equipment 
420.2,Farrah,,i think if we go back into the text and we look for any mention of equipment that scientists have used and we underline that that we could then build on your answer we'd have a complete full answer to that question ,okay i'll take a look 
420.2,Chris,,and then i noticed the moment ago we had a couple other hands that are up i believe it was on student and student have what we hear from student first and then we'll let student chime in ,um yeah okay so basically what i was thinking is like that scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
120.3,Chris,,"Okay, so you noticed the mention of craters and so with water on the moon. teacher and then also i would like you we need to relook at the question and we need to reevaluate that question so can you read back the question for me ",yeah okay what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon 
420.1,Chris,,"okay so what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon very good you might have made an observation about the scientists finding craters which is very good that you're noticing the craters and that's where the water is It might be great to build our knowledge and answer questions that might not even be asked but when it comes to being a successful student, especially on any other tests that you might have from other teachers. We want to make sure that we're looking at the question that's being asked and that we're addressing just that in our response. Does that make sense. ",so yeah so like the equipment not the not about so what should be the answer right 
420.2,Chris,,usually it's best when we answer a question if we just stick to that question and we can save the extra information for discussions like when we're having right now ,cool okay 
110.1,Jazmin,,let's uh let's see i think student was done with their hand up earlier and then after her we'll check in with student to see what he's thinking okay so thank thank you very much student for sharing so thank you thank you for contributing ,i said that nasa sent a small machine and but i was wondering like why my answer was wrong because it seems like the right answer 
420.2,Jazmin,,So you you are partially correct so you're right in the sense that NASA did send a small machine how do you think we could be a little bit more specific in our response because there are lots of small machines in the world right ,yeah 
420.2,Jazmin,,if we go back into the text we can see the type of small machine that they sent and so we can give that a name so that when we respond to the question we're being specific with our answer ,"I think I know I think I was just, I know what this machine was so is the answer. The Lunar Orbiter. "
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah so that's that's the small machine they sent and then do you remember from the text what the lunar orbiter what it was doing ,when i looked at it i sadi it investigated because it's small machine that's what discovered it because it was investigating 
510.1,Chris,,you built off your answer i appreciate how you build your answer we got more specific we narrowed down to that core of knowledge we're looking for and then we said okay this is this is what that machine was and this is what it was doing so thank you student student looks like he has his hand up that i do want to hear from student so student you have something you want to jump in with before i hear from them ,yeah i just i did check on the the text and what i saw was you know when i was looking at it i guess i was wondering like but i've been the nasa so i know that like your scientists and astronauts use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits i guess i was wondering like why that's not the answer 
210.2,Chris,,right so that's a good point so i do want to address that so you said you've been to nasa and you've seen lots of equipment that different astronauts and nasa scientists use to address student question i would just like to clarify so when we talk about nasa here were first of all two things you know we're talking specifically about the scientists here so not just not just astronauts that might be actually exploring space physically but also the scientist on the ground back here on earth and we're looking specifically at the equipment if we if we pay close attention to the question i want you to read after me it says what equipment that scientists and then can you finish the question ,yeah okay so what equipment that scientists use to discover oh what equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.2,Chris,,okay again so and much like with student earlier we're just we're trying to look at that question and we're specifically boiling it down to just its core components so we're looking for specific equipment and equipment is doing what harrion ,that equipment is discovering the water on the moon 
110.4,Farrah,,exactly it's discovering water on the moon i and now finally i haven't heard from student yet so let's let's hear from them so we all get a chance to speak here ,so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i circled the same thing as student scientists found craters full of water on the moon nasa sent a small machine scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and all kinds of other stuff hi how are you doing today 
110.4,Luis,,good how are you ,we're doing well we're trying to figure out the answer to this question yeah and i i have a question i'm just wondering i already know all about space like i don't think i need to be in this class i don't need any help with anything 
220.1,Luis,,so the reason why we're looking back over your answers and i want to have help you have a better understanding of space and exactly why there is water on the moon ,okay well that sounds okay i guess i can hang around for that 
210.4,Jazmin,,thank you i would appreciate it so we we read the text did class understand the text water on the moon class understand so our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and we all gave really good answers when we look back over the text in paragraph two um what what did it say we're looking for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,um i can answer well basically in paragraph two it says nasa send to small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay ,do you want me to read anymore 
230.2,Jazmin,,no i think that's okay so what that's one type of equipment what else did they do with the equipment what did it do ,well they used it to like go and look for ice deposits in the polar craters and that's where they found them 
110.1,Farrah,,good job student student ,yes so i was kind of wondering like why my answer is is really right or my it might be wrong i don't really understand 
110.2,Farrah,,so your your answer is not wrong i'm in paragraph three it talks about that the water they found us microscopic meaning that you wouldn't be able to see it so i think that's where you were thinking that you would need a tool walk a microscope to see those types of things on the moon does that help you understand more ,i think so like do i need to i need them they need the microscope to see the water or can they see it in another way 
120.3,Farrah,,they they use the small machine the lunar orbiter to investigate ,okay 
120.3,Chris,,student ,um yeah okay so like basically i think luis's thing about like well like he said before like um scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and all that stuff like i i've been to nasa with my dad and like it was definitely um they had like all that equipment they have like the shuttle they had the boots and like the oxygen tanks and all this stuff like um do you think that like i guess i'm wondering like why that might not be right 
150.1,Chris,,why it might not be right for what we're talking about right now ,yeah like why that's not like the answer 
130.1,Chris,,so you are correct nasa does use all types of equipment that these boots they have special special articles of clothing that they were but some some things like the the oxygen tanks those on they use for different things so those things they might use like when they're exploring space around space missions but for this they're talking about a machine that they use to find out about to find out about the ice deposits ,okay that makes sense 
130.1,Oliver,,student ,um yeah so actually we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us today it was really nice to meet you and it was also really nice like you're very patient with each of us and you really listen to what we had to say and really like made us feel like we were being heard when you are talking to us so we really appreciate it thank you so much 
130.1,Luis,,you're welcome thank you for listening welcome how are you today ,i'm good i'm good i'm scares me i shouldn't be on this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,let's great student maybe you can share some some ideas with us about the article ,okay 
120.2,Luis,,okay so i'm happy that class are all here today and i was looking over your responses we had our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and so i love that class are all thinking about the story and are using the text to help support your answers but i want to dig a little bit deeper into the question and let's figure out exactly what they're talking about and see a we can expand on some of the ideas that class write down for your answers using the text to help support your answers um what is the question asking us okay so our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,um it's asking what equipment do they use to discover water on the moon 
210.2,Farrah,,okay that's the question and so does class here know what the word equipment means ,okay oh yeah because we will use equipment in pe class 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay that's one type of equipment class else know about another type of equipment ,we also use it in science class to 
210.2,Chris,,correct those are all types of equipment and so what about the word discover do we all know what the word discover means ,i think discover is like when you find something 
210.4,Farrah,,class agree excellent harris and that is when you find something so our question is asking what equipment did scientists use to find water on the moon okay so look yep okay so we're looking over your responses we're going to look back at the paragraph i know that some of class had some of the same answers and then some of your answers was a little bit deeper and that's okay um so when looking at the paragraph um i know that there are two words that students get confused and that's microscope and so microscope is a top of tool that we use to see different different objects and then there's the word microscopic and microscopic just means that it's something that you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking right at it yes so student ,i use the microscope and my answer so i don't understand why my answers wrong so no one's answer is wrong it's just that some answers are 
210.3,Oliver,,that we need to expand upon some of the answers okay damn did you have a question or a response ,well i was gonna say about the microscope and i'm so when i thought i thought was the right answer because they talk about the microscope and the water in that paragraph 
210.4,Oliver,,they do talk about the microscope and the water in that paragraph the difference is the microscope is the tool that they use to see the microscopic pieces so microscope is the tool that they use and then microscopic is the um the ice it's a form of the microscopic ice ,okay 
120.3,Jazmin,,so when we look at our paragraph if we're looking at paragraph three it talks about that no excuse me paragraph to nasa sent this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for us department posits in a large polar crater these deposits are very small and then in paragraph three it says that means the moon is still drier than the dress desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ,okay well i got my answer from paragraph to i don't know what's wrong with mine 
420.2,Jazmin,,we just want to be able to give the best answer but nothing's wrong with your paragraph and so your answer you said nasa sent a small machine so i would like for you to tell a little bit more about the small machine so looking in the text what could we add to expand and give more details what top of small machine was it to expand do you do you see the name i'm looking through the paragraph and give more details what top of small machine was it ,i'm looking 
420.2,Chris,,okay ,you know what a teacher i went to nasa so i know that time does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
140.1,Chris,,you are correct i went to nasa as well when i was younger two different times and they use all kinds of really cool equipment ,yeah it's really cool there i had a great time with my dad 
140.1,Jazmin,,i had a great time there as well ,ok i see it says that nasa scientists small machine called a lunar orbiter 
110.4,Jazmin,,a lunar orbiter what did the lunar orbiter do excellent so nasa see the machine and it's called a winner orbiter ,investigated 
210.4,Luis,,investigated so we know the lunar orbiter investigated what did it investigate ,i'm all right there says and i was looking for ice deposits and a large polar crater 
110.4,Luis,,okay so it looked for ice deposits in a large ,crater 
210.4,Oliver,,polar crater okay so um they saw the us deposit it's in the large polar crater what details that it gave about they asked deposits ,oh it set of eyes deposits were really small 
210.4,Oliver,,so they were really small um so they use the lord the lunar orbiter to to to investigate and they found asked deposits that were really small so looking back at our question oh yes dan ,i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch well 
210.4,Oliver,,go ahead ,i was just gonna say thanks for taking my time to work with us and we'll have to see you next time 
210.4,All,,okay that sounds great will work next time own figuring out what equipment decide to choose to discover water on the moon ,okay bye 
210.4,Luis,,hello class hi how are you today ,i'm good okay i think i got this all figured out so i got it i understand now 
120.4,Luis,,okay so what we went before we went to lunch we were talking about our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so anything would you like to share ,yeah yeah okay so um we were reading that up first the sentence in a second paragraph and so now i think the answer is nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ice deposit 
110.1,Luis,,"so i think i think that's a wonderful response um So, student student said that nasa sent the lunar orbiter to discover faster gate to investigate ",asked about because that's what it says on a story okay it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbit to investigate and then i added ice deposits from the next sentence you see how i thought 
420.3,Jazmin,,Okay. so what i would like for you to try is i'm reading trying to get my paper to pull up i'm so i would like for you to read the third paragraph and see if we can expand upon luis's answer that he gave us ,to confuse the lunar orbiter the right answer because they don't talk about the learner or pioneer in the third paragraph 
150.1,Farrah,,student you are correct they don't talk about the lunar orbiter in the third paragraph but we have luis's answer that he gave us so i just want us to expand and think a little bit more we know that we have the lunar orbiter and that it's used to that that nasa is using this to form the ice deposits or to investigate the ice deposits but i want to talk about like i want to challenge you to look and read about the size of the us deposits ,okay this is kind of like with this is where i got my answer from 
110.1,Farrah,,you did you had that they used that they use a scientific tool called a microscope ,oh 
210.3,Farrah,,and they did use a scientific tool called a microscope but the microscope what did it show us ,all it showed us the water they found is microscopic being you want people to see if you were looking straight at okay so you can't see it you need a scientific tool called microscope to look through the closely so you need it to look at the water okay so you need the microscope to look at the water and we know that the water is what oh microscopic 
210.4,Farrah,,microscopic so what does microscopic mean what does it tell us ,that is really really really really really really really really really really small 
210.4,Oliver,,okay so it's really really really really really really small we can't see it with our correct and that what the story tells us yeah okay so let's think about putting all of these things that we know together we know that we're going to use the microscope to look at the microscopic us right that we found on the moon so we're going to put all of this together we know that the student said the lunar orbiter was used does class remember what it was used to do ,to investigate ice 
210.4,Chris,,ok so the lunar orbiter was used to investigate the water and it was in what form ,it was in the form of ice you know i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 yeah okay 
120.2,Jazmin,,so going back to answer our question let's work together to create a sentence to answer that what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon Maybe ,yeah yeah i'm trying to think i'm still kind of confused 
230.1,Jazmin,,okay so what's confusing you student let's see if we can call her ,okay well i'm trying to put all of the words from paragraph to paragraph three together and i i'm confused i don't know how to do that 
210.4,Jazmin,,sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together and it's called summarizing so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer okay so when we look at paragraph two we know that nasa sent the small machine what was it called ,the lunar 
210.4,Luis,,okay the lunar orbiter and what's the lunar orbiter going to do ,investigate ice deposits 
210.4,Oliver,,ok so the lunar orbiter is going to investigate the us deposits okay and then if you look in at then at the next the third and fourth sentence is that information that we really know to answer need to know to answer this question sometimes we have to realize that when we're looking for answers just because it's in the paragraph that doesn't mean the information is needed to answer this question okay so we know that nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ever end the end we're going to look at the next paragraph and so we know that the water they found it was what ,i was microscopic 
130.3,Oliver,,it was my first scoffing so when we write our answer we would we would say the lunar orbiter what does it do was ,orbiter was arm ah the lunar orbiter was investigating 
210.4,Oliver,,okay the ice what type of ice ,microscopic 
210.4,Chris,,microscopic us and where was the microscopic us at ,me on the moon so we're going to try to put all of our pieces together now to answer our question 
210.4,Jazmin,,so bad i don't have a whiteboard that i can write it out ok so the lunar orbiter was used to come right okay that would be great so let's work on formulate this sentence together so we got the lunar orbiter and it was what did it do ,it investigated 
110.1,Luis,,ok so the lunar orbiter investigated ,microscopic ice on the moon 
110.4,Oliver,,yes the lunar orbiter investigated microscopic us on the moon that is excellent ,oh wow okay teacher it's time for us to go to lunch but wow i really really appreciate how you you help us understand all the words in the question and to use all the evidence from that story and our answer and you you made me me feel really valued and and when i had an idea to share and you listen to it and you told me how how my idea was good or maybe not good but still yeah this was for working with us 
110.4,Farrah,,thank you dan thank you class for all your hard work today hi class ,hi 
230.1,Jazmin,,hi so i saw your answers and student it really looks like you're onto something there um can you expand on maybe your answer of a small machine ,okay so basically it's like the thing that they sent up to the moon to go in and like to find the water 
230.1,Jazmin,,okay so what is what is that thing what is it called ,it's called the lunar orbiter 
120.4,Luis,,yes that is what it's called so did any of you class student student student student did any of you class see any other information about the lunar orbiter ,um yeah this is student i just wanted to say um i don't think that i have to be in this class because i kind of know like all this stuff about space already i don't really think i needed this stuff 
110.3,Luis,,well student um you know so much about space let's let's maybe see if you can share some of that with your classmates ,so okay yeah 
230.1,Luis,,what do you know about microscopes ,um so microscopes are like these things that you use to like study something closely like if if something's really small then you like look at it that way 
230.1,Luis,,how is it used on the moon ,um well i guess i don't really know exactly how it's used on the moon but i'm kind of imagining like you know like maybe people look through it 
130.2,Farrah,,yes maybe student do you think you can help out student ,um sure um i actually was thinking that the microscope is is probably the the tool that they use to discover water on the moon but it seems like that answers not right i'm a little confused about why 
120.3,Farrah,,oh student that's a really good question and you class gave us some really good answer so let's look back at the text so what is the question we're trying to answer ,the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
230.3,Jazmin,,and student what did you say that small machine was called again perfect perfect so we've talked about a couple things we talked about a microscope and we've talked about a small machine ,it's called a lunar orbiter 
210.4,Farrah,,perfect so how so we've identified the equipment so i guess back to farrahs question how do they use this equipment to look and discover water so which one do you want to focus on first the microscope or the lunar orbiter ,i'm interested in the microscope 
120.3,Farrah,,okay so if we go back and we look in the text okay do you can you class see the text ,yeah we all have it on our tablets 
120.3,Oliver,,okay let's look at the third paragraph does class want to read that for me ,yeah i can do it 
120.3,,,um i'm sorry ,i'm student that okay the third paragraph 
120.3,Oliver,,yes ,okay um third paragraph that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it even if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Farrah,,good job student good job so what in that paragraph student what is that telling us about the microscope ,like that the microscope um i guess that it's something that like you would use to study something up close 
210.4,Farrah,,perfect and if you need a microscope to see the water on the moon what does that tell you about the water ,it's really small 
210.4,Farrah,,so what does that tell you about the water on the moon is there a lot of it ,no i guess not a lot cuz it um yeah i guess there's not a lot because there's just a little bit to see 
150.1,Chris,,perfect okay so what other does class have any questions about the microscope because that's one of our equipment ,oh yeah it's student i don't really have a question about the microscope but i have another question um should i save it 
230.1,Chris,,well does it pertain to our article ,yeah definitely 
120.4,Chris,,well then yes go ahead and ask it ,okay so i was just wondering like okay so i went to nasa with my dad and we went and looked at like all the spacesuits and like all this stuff and like i definitely saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that like student was saying so like do you think they use those things 
140.1,Chris,,"But I don't think that they necessarily, this articles necessarily focusing on those things just because it's focusing more on the moon's climate, rather than specific equipment on the moon. the question asked about the equipment but the article is talking about how the moon is like a desert did you see anything about the moon being like a desert when you were with your dad ",i'm not really like that wasn't really what was in the exhibit that was that was from like reading i didn't know that before today 
140.1,Oliver,,oh well that's great it seems like you learned something today did class else know that the moon is like a desert ,um yeah i sort of knew but actually i just had to say unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us today and i wanted to tell you that it was really cool like having you here because you really listened to our answers and you help us listen to each other's answers and and that was really cool because sometimes we don't listen to each other very well and it was awesome that we were able to do that today so thank you so much 
140.1,All,,thank you you class have a good lunch hi how are you ,hi good 
150.1,Luis,,so student do you want to start with the question what equipment it's scientists use to discover water on the moon that's good that's good so we all we all just read water on the moon and you class answered in your journal some questions ,yeah i can't 
120.4,Luis,,even you can go ahead and start ,um yeah well i was gonna say like i already kind of know all about ease so i don't think i need any help i don't think i need to be in this 
140.1,Luis,,isn't tell me what you know about space ,oh man i know all sorts of stuff i know that space is like like huge and like unimaginably huge and like it has stars and like when you go into space it's a vacuum so you have to use oxygen tanks at masks and i know that like 
140.1,Luis,,there's all this interesting stuff with like gravity and all those others you know a lot of us face do you have the text right in front of you ,oh yeah 
120.3,Luis,,okay well you mentioned how you know about oxygen tanks and about masks and all that good stuff so can you read to me please the second paragraph under the moon is a desert ,yeah okay um let's see so nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to invest 
120.3,Luis,,can you read that yeah read the next sentence ,yeah this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look ice deposits in a large polar crater 
210.4,Luis,,okay good job so you're talking about some equipment that they needed or that you knew happen on the moon so um do you know anything about a lunar orbiter ,um i know that it's something that like basically goes up to the moon and i'm like it flies around the moon orbits and and it studies the moon from from or is 
120.4,Farrah,,um let's have someone else talk for a second if class has their hand raised this pretty good but that is definitely one of the lunar orbiter does student what do you are what do you what do you know about equipment used in space ,well i don't really know very much about like this is the first time i like learning about it 
120.3,Farrah,,oh okay so based on what student just read about a lunar orbiter um what do you think it does according to paragraph two what does it do again what's the second sentence say ,lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar 
210.4,Farrah,,do you know what a polar crater is ,it's like i think it's like a big hole like on the moon 
210.4,Farrah,,is can you imagine the lunar orbiter landing at the moon south pole and basically looking around for this water on the moon ,yeah i can imagine i guess i'm still kind of use like by my answer is wrong because like i think that the lunar orbiter had to use the microscope to be able to see the water find 
130.2,Oliver,,yeah that's a really good question and the lunar orbiter it wouldn't need the microscope but let's see what the point of a microscope is according to the article so do you know what paragraph or can class help student find the paragraph that a microscope is mentioned in student ,um yeah ok so the paragraph let's see they say in the last paragraph paragraph three and they say that the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a my first go to look really closely 
210.4,Oliver,,yes and so based on what you just read what do you think about the what is the point of the microscope ,um well it looks like the microscope is there to study the water um and like look at it really closely i guess i kind of think the same thing i student like how could they find the water if they can't see it 
120.4,Chris,,so you're partially right when you kind of say that the microscope is used to discover water but the article is thinking more in general of what equipment would be used along with the microscope so what are you thinking student i haven't heard much from you ,okay i have been to nasa with my dad so i know that like scientists use up like equipment like masks and suits like stuff like even said so 
120.4,Chris,,i guess that's kind of ,what i'm thinking about 
230.2,Chris,,are masks and suits mentioned anywhere in the article ,no that's just what i kind of knew 
120.4,Jazmin,,"before the arctic So, whenever we're talking about the equipment that scientists use the keyword in this question is to discover water on the moon so to answer your question student and deaf so far it's not the question is not asking necessarily about the way they found the water because the water is very small it's asking the machine or the equipment that is used to discover the water the keyword is discover a microscope helps you study the water whereas the lunar orbiter helps you discover the water student what are you thinking what are you thinking for number two ",number two which is which one do you mean number 
120.2,,,is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ,oh we can possibly answer that but unfortunately we have to go to my next thank you so much for working with it thank you 
150.1,Luis,,okay i'm ready hi students oh this actually does class want to start and share their opinion again allowed so we are going to start talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable and i saw your previous journal entry and i want to start ,yeah 
150.1,Luis,,okay go ahead ,um yeah so i think i got this all figured out now so i think all good 
120.4,Luis,,i'm glad you haven't figured out student so can you remind the class of your answer ,i yeah okay so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
120.3,Luis,,will you reread the question for me. ,yeah okay um is there convincing evidence that water on the moon 
110.1,Jazmin,,so student can you just tell me what that question means could be valuable yeah so let's see what student thanks ,yeah so to me with the question means is it's asking like to testing our opinion and we have to say like yes or no the answer is the asking is the evidence convincing and and so i said that yes the evidence is convincing and that's because astronauts wanna and they can stay hydrated and and you can't survive without water 
430.2,Luis,,"And Luis What you gave us is a good fact, but it's the fact that water is split into oxygen and hydrogen. So instead, let's focus on your opinion. So is there. Do you think there's evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. ",um um yeah i mean i think so cuz you can take the water and you can like what i was saying you can split it into oxygen and hydrogen like you know what i mean like you can do like some really cool stuff with it so yeah i think it's definitely value 
230.3,Chris,,so student can you share your answer again you can do some cool stuff with it and student actually wrote about some cool stuff or another cool benefit of it ,yeah so i said that water is heavy so it's really good that they don't have to carry it in the ship's it 
210.4,Chris,,okay so that could be a benefit of having water so let's talk more about that who's the they that you're talking about ,the astronaut and like the spaceship 
230.3,Chris,,you're right the astronauts and so water is very heavy on and how do you know this or it's very cumbersome for astronauts ,um well i guess i just kind of know that you know what i mean like that that waters really heavy and it it's really hard to set it in a spaceship because humans need water and it makes spaceships really 
210.4,Chris,,i'm glad you know that but it's also in the text could you read the first two sentences at the fourth paragraph for me ,oh yeah okay um water on the moon would be a valuable was very important we suppress it could be useful in lots of ways 
120.3,Chris,,and it can you continue for the next two sentences ,oh yeah yeah for example future astronauts drink this water water is heavy it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft 
130.2,Oliver,,great so yeah exactly you're exactly right and water is heavy and because that water is heavy it would definitely be a benefit if you know astronauts could you know use what's already there instead of have to take up stuff with him in the spaceships because it's very heavy and like i said very cumbersome and so what do you think about this student ,um okay so basically my thinking is that like i don't think it's it's very like convincing evidence that it's valuable because the water is not ready yet and we don't have like the like you know the equipment to like take the ice and make it into water like i think it would be maybe like in the future but it's not like useful now 
310.1,Jazmin,,i really think that you did a really good job identifying and separating the idea of what is valuable now versus later ,and it's just another piece about like i guess like the when student was saying this stuff about the water play you know what i mean like this this this do we need like evidence from the text when we're seeing our like our our speech like rp 
420.2,Chris,,"So you don't want to have an opinion. Most of the time that is just something that you you make up because it's not necessarily true. Yes, Chris. ",i i was i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
420.2,Chris,,i'm sorry i couldn't hear you ,oh it's okay i read that there could be a piece on them like 2020 or 
140.1,Chris,,oh that's really interesting i don't know if that's the truth is i mean i don't know like that's the like a truthful like a like a i don't know if it's necessarily possible but if you read it that's super cool where do you read it up ,oh some some article in a magazine yeah i don't know if it's true either because it seems like that would be really hard to do but i think if they had a face they could use the water to survive in the base 
140.1,Farrah,,possibly so i mean at this point in time and this year anything could happen honestly i wouldn't be surprised if next year they did something crazy with everything happening yes ,so i just would surely we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i really wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i wanted to thank you for making sure that you use evidence in our answers because sometimes we just kind of like say our answers but from what we think that we don't use evidence and you really make sure that we were using the evidence but like beyond that like you really asked us about like how we got to our answers and you listen to us as we explained our ideas and i think that class here for leave value and like even beyond that like you like we're really clear with us like what we needed to work on and like let us know like you know you need to do this and think about this with your answer i think that was really helpful because i think sometimes we get confused about what we should be answering like from the text or like from our background knowledge so it was so much fun working with thank you so much 
140.1,Luis,,thank you ,i have a question um i already kind of know a lot about space already so i think i need to be in this class i don't need help with any of this stuff 
410.2,Luis,,well let's focus on the text let's talk about it student so your answer is scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and that may be true but um let's so the question says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon But it doesn't make sense as far as the question goes. So let's look at the question again. I'm going to read it again what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon. So your answer doesn't really relate to that question. Do you understand that. ,yeah i think so i think so 
410.2,Luis,,so what do you think may be a better answer as far as because again your answer pretty solid as far as a comprehension of space but as far as discovering water oxygen tanks don't really have anything to do with that ,wow i guess i didn't really read it that well closely so maybe i didn't i didn't i didn't really read it 
420.3,Luis,,so maybe you should go back and just read it and look for some specifics on how scientists or what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon ,okay 
420.3,Chris,,"so let's go with you and we'll just go to the left student so your answer is nasa send a small machine so i see first the second part it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate So, specifically what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. So your answer needs to have something specific from the text about how scientists discover water on the moon. So if you'll go back in and try to find a specific okay student so scientists found craters full of water on the moon so again that's true i can tell you read part of the text that's true and you're talking about water which is the questions asking you to talk about water but again we're focusing on the equipment the scientists use so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so the the question itself establishes that there's water on the moon so if you'll just go back in the text and try to find some specifics on what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon ",okay yeah i can do that sounds good yeah 
420.2,Oliver,,alright so talk about what you found not what student found so just go in and maybe read it and just again we're looking for what equipment the scientists use to find water and talk about yourself not another student that way if i had no clue if i've never read the text i'll read your question i know exactly what you're talking about when we answer and talk about yourself not another student ,okay 
110.1,Farrah,,and student you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ,yeah 
110.2,Farrah,,that's absolutely true so far the scientist it says that they need a microscope to look closely so right now your answer seems pretty solid ,i'm wondering though because we had to work on it together is my answer is my answer wrong 
110.2,Farrah,,excuse me i could not tell student was that you ,no it's student um i was just wondering like if if my answer is wrong like why it might be wrong 
110.2,Farrah,,so student your answer's i don't think your answer is incorrect your answer's your answer is correct ,oh okay great 
420.2,Farrah,,yeah maybe you can just go back over the texts and try to find a way to relate your answer back to the question you answer the question but maybe instead of saying you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely relate it back to water just to make your answer just even more solid that way if i had no clue if i've never read the text i'll read your question i know exactly what you're talking about when we answer ,okay yeah 
420.2,Chris,,yes student ,um okay so this is the thing that i'm kind of wondering about like basically i'm wondering like when i went to nasa with my dad like we went and we saw like all these space suits and all that stuff like the oxygen tanks that student was talking about so like did they have to use like this space suits and like the oxygen tanks to like go and like study the water like i'm just a little confused 
210.4,Chris,,yeah that's a great point student so um yes they would have had to use these oxygen tanks and stuff to go out and actually explore the moon so yeah you would need that equipment so yes just like if you can't breathe oxygen you're going to need an oxygen tank but really a better answer would be since it says what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon is what equipment are they actually using to discover water kind of like if you're playing basketball for an organized sport you're probably going to need a jersey right to play ,yeah that makes sense 
150.1,Chris,,but the important tool is the basketball itself does that make sense student ,yeah it does 
150.1,Oliver,,okay yes student ,um so we have to go to lunch now but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for a second for for working with us especially like you were very patient with our answers and you really listened to our answers and also we were able to listen to each other better because you were really listening to our answers and i just really appreciate it and wanted to make sure you knew that thanks 
150.1,Luis,,i really appreciate that start simulation ,hi excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,i'm glad you said you know a lot about space so that means something that probably interest you a lot you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks you know that um but i'm just going to direct you to the question which is scientists us to discover water on the moon and that obviously shows your understanding of space that's really cool ,uh huh 
210.2,Luis,,we look at that question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon what are we really looking for ,um okay the equipment they use to discover the water 
110.4,Luis,,absolutely equipment they used to discover the water ,i'm okay it's like when you got a space you know and and or when you're looking for the telescope and then you see a new a new planet or no star and you're like oh wow you know like i discovered her new star i discovered a new planet like that 
210.2,Luis,,so now when we look at your answer was oxygen tanks is that the equipment they used to discover water that's that's true so it's a new it's new to you it's new to whoever finds it that's absolutely true ,yeah no no no no you're right yeah oxygen tanks we don't we don't discover water with the tanks we just we don't need them to breathe on the moon 
110.1,Jazmin,,"and that's cool you know that so now i'm going to help another student Yes, Jazmin. ",i don't understand why my answers wrong 
430.2,Jazmin,,nasa send a small machine so what equipment that science use to discover water on the moon student your answer is not necessarily wrong so then that that is also true nasa send a small machine we go back into the text it is called a lunar orbiter what i would like you to do though is instead of just saying nasa sent a small machine we need to make that answer specific by using the name of the machine ,"If they just said, okay, a small machine. I mean, I guess, I guess no. "
420.2,Jazmin,,what would be helpful ,um okay so if you wanted to know the small um i guess to tell you something about it 
420.2,Jazmin,,yeah tell me something about it and what else what identifies that machine ,um what it looks like or what it size 
210.3,Jazmin,,yeah and then also um so when i'm talking to you i'm gonna say student ,yeah my name Yeah yeah 
130.1,Jazmin,,"You're in again your answers, not necessarily wrong. all right but you're definitely on the right ",okay so i just have to add more at the name and stuff to it 
420.2,Jazmin,,yes just make it more specific and tie in the question so instead just go in and answer what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon i love when students make the question alright so equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon is and then go into your answer ,okay 
150.1,Jazmin,,does that make sense ,yeah yeah i think i got it 
150.1,Chris,,teacherr okay good deal oh sorry i'm just gonna keep one so hey student ,yeah i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks and tanks and suits 
110.2,Chris,,well first of all student i would just like to say that's awesome um i've never been the nasa so that's really cool that you have that experience and then your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon and that's definitely true scientists did find craters full of water on the moon so if we go back to the question what equipment that scientists us to discover water on the moon what is that question asking okay so i'm glad you you've noticed that ,like you said to student the name of the equipment the name of the equipment that they used oh yeah i didn't write the name of the equipment 
310.1,Chris,,yes you you went right into you said scientists want crater some water on the moon again true we're just looking for what equipment led them to finding those craters of water You do a great job of talking about the question. So you obviously understand the question. As far as that goes. . ,"OK, OK, OK, I can do that. "
310.1,Oliver,,thank you student hey student ,hey mr martin i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch um but i did when i say thanks for taking time to work with us what we'll have to see you after lunch 
310.1,Oliver,,okay oh ,okay bye 
310.1,Luis,,hey hey class we're going to go ahead and start with the left side now on that way we can make sure so student or yes student ,okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
110.1,Luis,,so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that's what you said yeah ,i think i got it this time 
430.2,Luis,,so you're picking up on key parts of the text that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that's important but if we look at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be value so this is an argument piece so you can say yes it is valuable or no it is not valuable so i really like to do is the race format so we're going to restate the question we're going to answer the question we're going to cite evidence and then we're going to explain that evidence so right now you have some evidence water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen but i would like you to restate the question and then answer the question because we need to put whether it is convincing or it is not convincing evidence that the water on the moon could be valuable ,Okay. okay so i gotta say yes or no um and then i write then i so i gotta put a couple a sentence before before i write before my answer so i just got to like add a couple more sentences first that says yes or no 
230.3,Luis,,yes so what you'll do is for example you are going to restate the question so is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable from your evidence it sounds like you think yes is that true ,yeah i 
420.2,Luis,,"Let me see you again, sorry. There is convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable. So there you restated the question you answered the question. then you would say in the text what it says water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and then you would explain why that's important ",i gotta write all of that stuff that's a lot 
150.1,Luis,,but then your answer is gonna be awesome you can do it i believe you can do it ,okay 
150.1,Jazmin,,so student great yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water you answered the question and you provided evidence you also explained your evidence the only thing i would like is just the restate the question okay does that make sense ,yeah yeah okay okay yeah cuz i did say yes 
420.2,Jazmin,,yes you do say yes answers so you go yes and you're very use think strongly about it there's an exclamation point right if you could say there is enough evidence that water on the moon can you class and then you're off you're saying yes you're just also bringing the question into it ,okay okay all right 
420.2,Farrah,,thank you ,mr teacher i'm still confused 
210.4,Oliver,,student so you put no not for a long time so that's fine that that you think that um because this is it's what you believe so um is there and convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable so you're saying no but if we're just going completely off what the text says if you will read number four that might change your answer just go back and reread number four ,"Okay, I'll read it, but I guess that's why I was confused because I felt like you know I did better this time. And I did, I did read it, I got mine from I'm from from I think from paragraph number six. yeah me too i mean i did read it this time and and and and and number six is how that it'll take a lot of time and money so that sounds to me like you know it's not right so that means no "
120.1,Oliver,,"did you all hear what i said to student So on there, you can make that on so again. ",your said to student that he has to restate the question and an answer the question and give evidence okay so i guess i can restate the question but i feel like i answered the question 
420.2,Farrah,,and then you need evidence to support your answer and then you found the evidence from number six that's perfect just provide that evidence and then explain found the evidence from number six that's perfect just provide that evidence and then explain ,okay okay so so i'm not wrong my answer is not wrong 
210.3,Chris,,no it's not it's you just need to support it ,okay okay um okay yeah mr teacher i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
420.2,Chris,,yes student so on that's awesome again that you that you're reading about space and that's awesome that you're excited about that so i'm going to the question and your answer really quick waters so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore and you read that in the text that's fine water is heavy really what we're looking for is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable okay so you are talking about bringing water so that might imply that water on the moon can be very valuable okay so yeah so that that's a good train of thought so now if we'll just restate the question answer the question ,Okay so you can't tell that I need more evidence or I have enough evidence right cuz I pulled it from the story. 
420.2,Chris,,yes ,but i 
420.2,Chris,,i would say that you do need more evidence your evidence does say that bringing water on the moon is hard but i would also talk about how the water on the moon would be good ,okay ok 
420.2,Oliver,,yes yes ,ok ok ok ok i think i'm thinking about it i on i just have to add more to my story um but i i also just looked at the clock and it's it's time for the next class um but i do want to appreciate that i feel like you did you you made me feel valued in and how i was thinking about the question and i think i do understand that i just need more specifically to add more evidence um yeah i think are sorry student and i was just i felt kind of good to cuz i feel like i know that what i need to work on as to add more evidence to and to i guess um i'll say more about the question itself as aren't right 
420.2,,,that is 100 right good ,okay great oh thanks mr teacher this was really good okay we'll see you next time bye thank you bye 
420.2,Luis,,hello class you have provided some really great answers i love how you class are thinking yes student ,um yeah so i know like all about space so like i don't think i need any help like i don't think i need to be in this class 
130.1,Jazmin,,"well i'm so glad that you already have some prior knowledge of space so i can't wait to hear about what you know about but let's talk about the equipment that the scientists have used to discover water on the moon student and oliveron you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water on the moon and you class are both on the right track you class are really thinking and i like where you're headed Jazmin, go ahead and ",let's see okay the question is what equipment do you use to discover water on the moon 
420.1,Farrah,,okay great thank you so does class have any keywords that would help us to look back in the text and determine what exactly are we looking for student what do you think ,um i just wanted to check what what is a keyword 
420.1,Farrah,,a keyword is an important word that is going to give us a clue as to what we're going to be looking for to answer our question ,oh okay gotcha 
510.1,Farrah,,so for example when i read what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon i try to think to myself i try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking so for example i might say the equipment that the scientist used to discover on the moon would be and then leave that answer blank and then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment ,um so okay so that's really interesting so like the arm so like the key the keyword would be like what what like equipment like equipment is that a keyword 
210.2,Oliver,,absolutely you are on the right track so we're going to let's look back in the texts and see what equipment was talked about does class take a second to look back in the text and tell me what equipment well first of all can class tell me what equipment means can class give me another word for equipment student how about you what other our could use for equipment ,yeah um i would say like like a tool or like yeah like like a tool 
420.3,Chris,,a tool absolutely that is perfect so if you class could take a second to look back in the texts and find different equipment or tools what equipment or tools do you see mentioned in the text ,"So I actually had kind of a question. I'm like, I'm basically like a I was sort of wondering like, so my dad took me to NASA. And when we went. We saw like all of these like space suits and equipment like that. So actually, I was kind of wondering because like that seems like like those, would those be tools? but i was wondering but do you think they they use them but did they did they not use them to to measure things with the microscope like the astronauts i'm like i guess it's not in the in the reading and i was wondering about that "
420.3,Jazmin,,absolutely absolutely those are some great observations yeah yes that absolutely would be equipment that nasa would use but let's refer back to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon i want you class to first think about equipment or like student said tools that would be used and then let's think about how they would be linked to discovering water on the moon so once you to narrow down tools that would be used to discover water on the moon helmets and all the other equipment are absolutely things that would be used to go to the moon but let's link equipment and or tools to discover water on the moon do you see any tools that could be used to discover water on the moon let's look back in the text and see if we see any tools oh we've already get some ideas student what do you see what do you think ,what i think is so it's like what i said was like the small machine and then when i was thinking about like the tool and like how you would pick what this like how you would use this machine it's like a lunar orbiter right so you would that that's one two that you would have to use right like to get there 
210.4,Oliver,,okay so let's look back in the text i see let's read it says let's reread the text quickly it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places wherever or where the sun never shines nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate there you go that's our keyword student so a lunar orbiter to investigate can someone else continue reading for me to see what this lunar orbiter does ,um yeah i can do it this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small 
210.4,Farrah,,okay so what exactly do the lunar orbiters do based on our reading student can you tell us what do you think ,so it sounds like rhey look for the ice deposits but they they go searching for it like they're the thing that finds it right 
210.3,Farrah,,yes absolutely so i see that we have let's look at back at some of our answers so i see that we looked at our question what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon so i see we have our answers are a microscope a small machine and then we have some other equipment which answer makes the most sense as to what would be found on the moon student ,i'm actually i'm so sorry because we're really enjoying this but we have to go to lunch so before we go though i just wanted to thank you like this was really interesting for us the way that you let this class like we were really able to like think through really clearly like what we were studying and and like able to sort of like understand better and i think like you really led us through that process and it was really interesting like thank you so much 
220.1,Luis,,well thank you class so much you class were thinking great and we will class hi class first of all i want to say thank you so much for your hard work and all your responses i think you class had some really you class put some really great work in and had some good answer choices but i don't feel that we have a complete understanding of what the question is asking so firstly what i want to do is even ,me 
220.1,Luis,,yes ,just shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,alright so first of all let's look at the question so student would you go ahead and read the question to us you already know all about space alright well how about you stick with us for a little bit and see if we can teach you something new okay ,sure okay it says oh what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.2,Farrah,,yes okay so first i want to make sure that we have a clear understanding of what the question is actually asking so what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon first of all i want to make sure that we know what the word equipment means so can class give me a synonym for the word equipment student ,a tool 
140.1,Oliver,,a tool that's exactly right so a tool so give me some examples of tools debbie had your hand raised can you give me an example of a tool ,yeah so um one on are playing a video game when i use my xbox controller and that's equipment about are you so that's like a tool 
140.1,Luis,,yeah absolutely that's absolutely right is there class else that wanted to share a tool ,okay well i was gonna say that to death so um ok ok so when we go to pe sometimes it's not a tool but sometimes a pe teacher when we're playing basketball you'll be like okay class go get the equipment and we have to go get the basketballs 
210.4,Jazmin,,"That's right. Yeah, so that's a great example of equipment. in the texts that are going to talk about equipment so first of all we know we're looking for equipment that was used to find what student ",find water 
210.3,Jazmin,,to find water that's absolutely right so i want you class to take a second to look back in the text and i want you to circle the words Is related to a tool that's going to help you find water and I'm going to give you a second just to look back and do that. alright class so now that you've had time to look back what equipment do we see in this passage ,circled to but the one i circled i think is right so i don't understand why my answers wrong 
210.3,Jazmin,,okay so student that you said that nasa sent a small machine so what two words did you find what two words or what two pieces of equipment did you find ,the small machine and the scientific tool 
230.2,Jazmin,,and the scientific tool so i think you we're on the right track but let's go ahead and look at let's look at the sentence where you found a small machine go ahead and read that whole sentence where small machine is included ,okay this isn't a small machine coated lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,her perfect so student you were absolutely on the right track but a small machine can you be more specific about that small machine what was that called like ,the lunar orbiter 
210.3,Farrah,,yeah a lunar orbiter so you're absolutely right so let's look at some of our other answers so we had a couple people think that we were looking for microscope now the student has found the sentence that told us the lunar orbiter was the machine that helped the scientists discover water can we now see why that makes sense in why microscope wasn't the best choice ,it makes sense but they still use the microscope to look at the water so why why i don't know why that's not the best choice because they're both they're both equipped 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah no you're right student that let's look back in the text so once we have found types of equipment then we want to look and see which one's the best so let's look in the area where it talked about the microscope so we are on the first page in paragraph number three so student would you go ahead and read that paragraph to us please ,yeah it says that means the moon is still drier than the dry desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Chris,,okay so are they saying is there any evidence in that paragraph that leads you to believe that that's something that was used or something that you would need to use to look really closely it says out of water they found is microscopic meaning you want to be able to look straight at it and that you would need a tool but is it saying that they've already used a microscope to look at it ,oh um you need you need all okay okay you need a scientific tall to look really closely on yeah also student i think i think i guess we didn't read that fully i know i know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
420.3,Oliver,,"absolutely they do you're absolutely right so a lot of equipment is huge but what we have to do i think you class did a great job and you were on the right track when we're given a question we have to look at the keywords but i think next time we need to use the strategy of looking at keywords and be really specific because the microscope was a tool in fact so you were on the right track with the word equipment and looking for keywords that related but we need to make sure that it it fully answers the question so another suggestion is once you have found the keywords reread the question to see if these keywords answer the question Once you give me just one second tab and then I'll answer the question. Be able to better answer text and another thing rereading the text, maybe will help get a deeper understanding of the text. so deb did you have a question ",um no i'm sorry to interrupt but if i was looking at the clock and it's time for the next class so we got a gold 
420.3,All,,okay all right well you class did a fantastic job today thank you ,thanks okay see you later 
150.1,Luis,,alright class first phone and say thank you for all of your hard work and for writing down your responses to our first question i think you class have somewhat of an understanding to what the question is asking but i don't think we are fully there yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in that spot i already know all about space 
120.3,Jazmin,,all right well student why don't you stick with us and see if we can teach you something new even scientists are constantly learning new things about space so why don't you stick with us and see what you can learn today alright so first of all i want to look back at the question so student would you go ahead and read the question for us ,okay it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.2,Jazmin,,okay so what can you restate that question what is that question asking what are the some important words class i want you class to turn and talk or take a second to really look at the question and see what exactly how else could you ask what that question is asking what are those important words go ahead ,okay i think it's saying like i'm like um what what kind of things did the astronauts use to find water on the moon 
210.2,Jazmin,,yeah absolutely you're exactly right so what kind of things so specifically it says what kinds of equipment so first of all i want to make sure because i think judging by some of your responses i don't think we fully understand equipment so equipment is what we're going to be looking for equipment that helps the scientists discover water on the moon so can you give me another example of a word for equipment student what does it mean what does it mean ,okay well there's another word story it's a tool a scientific tool so that's how i know the microscope is right cuz that equipment but but i think it's machine because that's what i had and that's equivalent to so i don't know what my answer is wrong 
130.2,Chris,,so i think you class are exactly right so uh equipment is a tool you class are correct in stating that both of those things the microscope and so let's look it specifically we want to look through our passage and make sure that we're looking for equipment that helped the small machine are both equipment they are tools so let's look so student you said that the small machine the scientists find water on the moon was the equipment that you think help the scientists and student you said the microscope so does class else see any other equipment any other answers that it could that you possibly had that was related to equipment ,i wasn't in my answer but i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks 
230.2,Luis,,they absolutely do yes that is in fact true but let's focus on what the question is actually asking so if nobody has any other equipment let's let's look at those two answer choices and see which one makes the most sense and answers our question i want you class to take a second to locate so we're looking so we've narrowed it down we have our small machine and we have a microscope in the text where you found small machine and microscope and i want you class to tell me what paragraph in the text is a small machine in the microscope ,okay i'm not a lot of different equipment 
230.2,Oliver,,oxygen tanks okay so go ahead and locate that as well alright student did you find where you found oxygen tank now okay well i do see oxygen tanks and it's actually in paragraph five so i'd like class to look at paragraph five i'm concerned because oxygen tanks did not help the scientists find water to look at paragraph and we're going to see why we're going to see why that doesn't work so it says the moon water could be useful in other ways water can be broken down into parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts could breathe the oxygen oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel and So So Deb. Let's look at microscope. Did you find where we can find microscope and and there are past ,girl yeah it's in paragraph three it's that one is the last one the last one and this is where i got my answer me too 
120.3,Oliver,,okay so go ahead and read that last sentence for us ,okay so it says on your needle scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Oliver,,okay so did it say that they used a microscope ,um 
210.4,Farrah,,it said you need so you'd a contraction for you would need a scientific tool ,oh yeah okay okay yeah we did learn about that you would need doesn't mean that you you are using it means like me yeah 
210.4,Jazmin,,yes so how so the only other piece of equipment in the text is a small machine called so that makes sense that to be able they're saying to look really closely at the water you would need that tool but how did they discover it or another word how did they find that water so the only other piece of equipment in the text is a small machine called a lunar ,orbiter i have a day yeah that was my answer 
150.1,Chris,,so does that make sense student i saw your hand go up so does that make sense as to why i'm sorry go ahead ,no no i was just i was thinking okay i was on a piece of equipment he said the microscope and then student said a different one the small machine and since it says you want me you would need the microscope but not that you do need oh 
130.1,Chris,,yeah it said you would if you were to look closely but how they discovered or how they found out that there was water on there was not with that microscope ,okay okay um this is this is this is hard to kind of figure out cuz cuz i like i can hear both of their ideas and i think i feel like the keyword is like you would need which says that they they didn't use it 
130.1,Chris,,yes ,okay okay okay that was good thanks miss pickett it's time for us to go to lunch but i do want to say that i appreciate it how you you really like asked class questions about their answers so we got we got to kind of think about why we made our answers um and and like how you ask student to like find his answer in the story and um yeah i think i think i'm thinking about now looking at the story and really trying to find more of the words just looking at more of the words in the story to see if that if that will work for the question 
110.1,All,,Well you guys did awesome today. Thank you so much and I will see you later. ,Bye bye. 
110.1,Oliver,,how are we today kiddos ,we're doing well glad to see you 
110.1,Luis,,oh it's wonderful to see you as well so yes student ,um yeah so basically um here's the thing i know like a lot about space and i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know all this stuff about space 
120.3,Luis,,well that's fantastic how about you be the one to read paragraph two for us again because it seems like we're a little confused on the correct answer here and i want to see if we can hone in on it ,okay um paragraph two nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small 
120.4,Jazmin,,all right stop right there for me student excellent job thank you i want class to take a moment and circle the most important word that they found in that paragraph give you just a moment and when you're done give me a thumbs up or raise your hand student do you have a question are you finished ,no i'm ready to answer 
120.4,Farrah,,wonderful give me give class just a moment 10 more seconds 987654321 all right let's actually start with student and we'll move our way around the circle to student so what word did you circle student ,so with that i circled was ice ice deposits and and i circled it because you know you had one because they say in there that the ice deposits are very small and so like you have to you have to use the microscope to see the ice deposits and ice water 
230.3,Oliver,,let me go to student what did you circle very true so so we know that ice is the water we know that the water that we find is very small okay so that's very good we're going to keep that in the back of our brains ,um so i circled the part that says very small kind of for the same reason but like the fact that you have to use a microscope to look at the ice deposits 
230.3,Chris,,so let's see what student has to say okay very good so where we're thinking about how small the water is ,um yeah so i kind of went in i was looking at like um i guess lunar orbiter 
230.1,Chris,,okay can you tell me why you chose lunar orbiter ,well it just kind of looked like the you know man like it just kind of looked like the other like the machine you know they said like what equipment i just i don't know it seemed like the most machine or equipment looking word 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay student what did you put ,i circled the same thing small machine i'm talking about the lunar orbiter 
120.4,Luis,,okay so when you say the small machine are you talking about the lunar orbiter or the microscope okay so we have lunar orbiter again and student what did you put ,well okay so i didn't really read it that closely 
230.1,Luis,,okay so we read it aloud right you read it for us because you know everything about space already and what do you know have you heard the word lunar orbiter before do you know that phrase ,yeah yeah yeah okay yeah yeah so i just didn't really know what to like what to circle i just figured yeah but i know in the lunar orbiter is 
230.1,Luis,,okay do you know what a microscope is ,yeah yeah it's like what you look in like a like a like a magnifying glass but it's like you look at smaller things 
120.4,Jazmin,,right so very good very good so we know student oh sorry student and student let us know that we need a microscope to see the water on the moon right but what did student and student tell us about how the microscope got up there ,it said that 
120.4,Jazmin,,class want to ,yeah we said that basically that it was the lunar orbiter and it something that went to the moon and it was something like like that was the craft or the spaceship that like went up to the moon and landed and like found the water 
130.2,Farrah,,okay thumbs up if you agree with student thumbs down if you think something it needs to be added to that answer okay class student what do you think do you agree with student or no ,well i agree with student i'm because i'm not really sure like well student had a question about it yeah so my question was like how do you like i'm not quite sure why it sounds like maybe the lunar orbiter is the answer but i'm not really sure why the microscopes not the answer you know 
120.3,Farrah,,sure so student why don't you go ahead and read our discussion question to us ,um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.2,Farrah,,very good and student what do you think the most important word in that question is ,equipment 
120.4,Luis,,equipment okay so we are looking specifically for equipment class else have a different answer so we're we're we're stuck between microscope and lunar orbiter right seems to be where we're at student do you have something to share ,okay yes i think that the most important word is discover because like finding it okay and student you had your hand up what would you like to add yeah i agree with student i i think i'm around now to thinking that the lunar orbiter is the thing that discovered the water 
210.3,Farrah,,right so discover is our most important word in that question and so when we look at our text we're trying to find the thing that helps us discover the water or find the water right so the microscope does help us see the water but what's the thing that helps us get to the water in the first place yes student ,um well it's basically it's the lunar orbiter i think i think that's a lot more clear now we actually have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and i wanted to thank you for working with us today and especially i wanted to thank you for really like working patiently with each of us and like drawing out the answers kind of piece by piece and letting us do our own kind of like thinking as we went along and then like connecting with each other's thinking was really cool since because we don't always get along as a class so that was pretty cool thank you so much 
210.3,Luis,,thank you student and thank you thank the rest of you hello welcome back class ,um thanks teacher 
120.4,Luis,,so looking over your responses and it seems like class has read the article yes you had a question ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
210.4,Luis,,yeah and what is one thing that you know about space that can help us ,okay so i know that astronauts can't breathe and space so they need to wear oxygen mask so that they can walk around and stuff 
210.2,Luis,,and that is absolutely correct and i appreciate you sharing that with us and in fact our article today discusses the importance of oxygen hold your thought we're going to get to your your comment because you talked about suit scientists using a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and oxygen masks in space my question for you is what other equipment does our article say that scientists use to discover water right because we also need water in order to survive in space ,mm hmm um maybe they use like i'm a shovel to dig it up 
120.4,Farrah,,let's pause and let's let class look at the question question number one what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and i want you to either circle or star the word that you think is most important in that question i think you're on the right track i'm going to give you about five more seconds 4321 all right so what did we decide was the most important word in that question somebody raise your hand so that we can answer yes ma'am ,okay i think the most important word is equipment 
230.1,Farrah,,why do you think equipment is the most important word ,um because it's like the first noun in the question 
120.4,Chris,,but let's hold that yes you have your hand raised what do you think the most important word is ,"Yeah okay, I'm Chris. I think the most important word is water. "
230.1,Chris,,water now student why do you think water is the most important question or word ,the whole the whole story is called water on the moon so 
230.3,Oliver,,so can class summarize this article and tell me what water and equipment have how did they work together in this article and i think you're absolutely right that we need to look at our title so we have water we have equipment ,okay i can do that it's me student okay so um so like there's water on the moon they're looking for the water and then they find some water on but it's not a lot of water so then they have to use a microscope to see the water 
120.4,Jazmin,,perfect summary thank you so much for summer for us but i loved your summary and you mentioned one piece of equipment that's used let's go back and look at paragraph one into and see what equipment we use before the microscope we know that we have to use oxygen in space and so specifically in paragraph two we have nasa sending not humans out because they need so much oxygen but a different tool when you have that tool identified or that piece of equipment go ahead and raise your hand ,teacher 
120.4,Jazmin,,yes ma'am ,i thought i did that so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.3,Jazmin,,so you did point out that nasa a small machine but a microscope is a small machine right ,yeah 
420.2,Chris,,and we know that a microscope isn't the only tool that's used so can you give me a little bit more detail in your answer like what was the name of the small machine that was used okay see if you can find it ,if it's jazmin's i saw that one the name of its lunar orbiter 
210.4,Chris,,very good so we have a small machine called a lunar orbiter so jazmin's answer was was right almost there teacher and then student was able to help push that answer a little bit further to identify the lunar orbiter and we have found out that the lunar orbiter helps us find the water which in turn we use the microscope because we know that there's not a lot of water on the moon ,you know what i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.2,Oliver,,that i love that i wish i could go to nasa but i'm very far away but i think that's really cool and and i love that you all have this experience about space and you all know that there's these different types of equipment that work together so let's recap question one what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what did we decide ,okay well you said that it was what student and student said but i i don't understand why me and student are wrong 
230.3,Farrah,,why the microscope is not the answer ,cuz that looks like it's still the answer to me 
210.2,Oliver,,okay so let's look at our question again we have what equipment we used we already know about the different types of equipment what keyword in this question lets you know that we're looking for a specific piece of equipment ,i thought it was something that would find some water but i feel like that's not it now 
210.2,Oliver,,i think you you're absolutely right it is find water the question uses the word discover which is the same as find so what we need to look at in our in our article is what was the first piece of equipment that was used because discover is like when you find it for the first time right ,oh oh ok ok so the lunar orbiter comes before the microscope in the story 
110.1,Oliver,,so do we do we understand why lunar orbiter is the correct answer to question number one you are correct very good ,okay um yeah it's cause it's cards it comes first in the story 
230.3,Oliver,,very good so it comes first in the story and then we use the microscope to identify the water ,okay okay well it's time for us to go um so i want to take thanks for coming to work with us and we'll see you next time 
230.3,Oliver,,absolutely thank you for having me ,bye bye 
230.3,Luis,,start simulation hey kiddos so looking at question two i'm seeing everybody's responses and it looks like we are split between water being valuable and if there's evidence for and water not being valuable yeah go ahead ,think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good 
230.1,Luis,,all right and what do you have figured out ,okay so i read the story and i looked for the evidence and i pulled something right out of the story and not out of my big massive brain 
210.3,Luis,,that is true your response is very good because it uses pieces of text evidence my question for you would be how do you know that water is valuable even if it can be split what can we use those two parts for would be my question to you ,okay wow i mean i know that we can use oxygen to breathe i don't remember what what you can use hydrogen for 
210.4,Jazmin,,so you're absolutely right we can use oxygen to breathe and that is one of the neat things about being able to find water in space is that we can use water on its own which we use for what ,we use it for drinking that was my answer 
120.1,Jazmin,,but there are other ways in which we can use this water that's found on the moon absolutely student we can use the water for drinking we can also use the oxygen for breathing so i want class to look at paragraph five and see how else we can use the water on the moon raise your hand when you find find an answer yes student ,okay so i see the thing that i said about how you could drink it um but then in the paragraph five that you said there was a thing about how you can make fuel so the spacecraft can move 
210.4,Jazmin,,absolutely so we can use water as rocket fuel okay now how student do you can you tell me how we can use water as a rocket fuel because we can't just pour water in a rocket and make it go ,no okay it says oxygen hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel um that's what it says 
210.4,Jazmin,,that is that is a great piece of text evidence that you found do you think we use the water plain water as rocket fuel or do we have to split the water and use those two separate parts ,i guess it would be like how student said where you do split it 
110.4,Jazmin,,very good ,good split it in two parts 
110.4,Farrah,,absolutely so now my question to you yes ma'am student ,oh yeah so i see what you're saying but i'm still kind of confused 
230.1,Farrah,,what are you confused about ,well cuz i found a different answer and so if if they're right that it could be valuable but what the story says that i'm okay so i said no not for a long time because then the next paragraph it says that it will take a lot of time and energy so it it sounds like they don't actually have the time or the money to do it 
120.3,Farrah,,and i like your reasoning there because it's going to take time and money that that it would be difficult to get right now but read the question to me one more time ,okay um is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable 
210.2,Oliver,,alright so what i'm asking you is based on the ways we can use water do you think it is worth investing in do you think it is worth trying to get the water out of the moon ,okay okay okay well i have that same answer as student because i read that class para i i think i think yeah yeah 
230.1,Oliver,,why do you think it is a valuable resource student ,okay cause on the thing that student said about drinking it i mean like class needs to drink water and then rocket fuel seems like pretty important you know you need rocket fuel in order to go to space 
110.4,Farrah,,student can you think of any other reasons why water would be a valuable resource because based on what we've talked about today right so we have water we have rocket fuel ,okay um so i was thinking about what class said and i'm oh yeah i would say the thing about us breathing the oxygen to 
230.3,Farrah,,right so we can use it to breathe as well and i think breathing and staying alive in space is very important ,yeah i think so too 
210.3,Farrah,,oh student would you change your answer or do you want to keep it the same as what you've already put down ,no no i would change it because now we can see that there's a bunch of stuff that that does say that waters valuable in the in the story 
210.3,Chris,,very good student what would you like to add ,and well i read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024 
230.1,Chris,,whoa that would be crazy if there's a moon base on the moon then that means what what do you think that would mean ,that they could use the fuel to like fill up the rocket and then to go back home 
230.1,Chris,,yeah so if we if we can find water and use it we've already said it's valuable and we can put a moon base on the moon then that means the water that we found can be used directly on the moon which means what if we can refill up on the moon what do you think that would mean go ahead i'm sorry ,um if we call refill on the moon people wouldn't get stranded on the moon 
140.1,Chris,,they wouldn't get stranded you are right think about like a gas station so if you drive very far and you need to fill up on a gas station at a gas station what does it allow you to do if you have a way to fill up your car halfway through a trip ,we wouldn't run out of gas 
140.1,Jazmin,,you won't run out of gas and it lets you like you're not gonna if we're going to the beach and we run out of gas halfway and there's a gas station we're not gonna turn back around right ,no we'll just get more gas 
230.3,Oliver,,we'll just get more gas and keep going so i think i think you class have it i think we are understanding that water is valuable because it allows us to do all these different things especially if we can put a moon base on the moon ,yeah yeah okay thanks so much mr teacher i'm a class i do feel like you helped me i'm looking keep looking up a question more cuz me and student had a good answer but i think we missed some of the other evidence and the story to build our answer so um thanks for helping us think about reading my question and all the words in a question and i'm looking for all of the best story 
230.3,Oliver,,oh absolutely and thank you for having me and providing all these different answers so so that i can understand what we might not have fully understood and what we have fully understood i really appreciate it ,thanks mr teacher we'll see you next time 
230.3,Luis,,you all have a wonderful day start simulation yes student what's your question ,um don't excuse me but i don't think i need to be in this class because i already corrected my answer 
220.1,Luis,,yeah well that's good that you corrected your answer and we are going to look at it again and we're going to see if we can dig deeper together and figure out a more precise answer something with a little bit more evidence okay ,okay yeah i can stick around for that right 
420.1,Oliver,,i'm glad you're joining us okay so we have just read the article water on the moon and class answered some questions class revised your answers but what i want to do before we start is take a minute and look back at question number one you class are going to be looking for keywords in the question important words that you could look for back in your text that way we can answer the question okay who would like to share a keyword that they found student what keyword did you find ,okay so i found the keyword i thought equipment was really important 
130.2,Chris,,that's wonderful i do believe that that is a correct answer so good job there did class find a different word than equipment in question one ,um yeah i i thought water was the important word 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay so water is important but how many since the article is about water it says that the whole time throughout the article so what's another word somebody help student out what is another word that is maybe only said once or twice that we could look for in the text what's another keyword somebody else found student what did you find ,so for me i thought discover was maybe the most important keywords and so i thought is like you think the equipment that then you're like discovering using the equipment so i thought discover 
210.4,Farrah,,okay so now that we know that we're looking for equipment that discovered it and i know that some people had mentioned microscope are being microscopic yeah i agree equipment and discover are two very important keywords for our question number one but let's go back and look at where it talks about the microscope so that is in question or paragraph number two or a paragraph number three is where they talk about using the microscope student do you have a question ,oh yeah i was just gonna say i had changed my answer 
220.1,Farrah,,yes i noticed that you changed your answer and we're going to hang out i do like that you what you changed your answer to and so we are going to use some of what you thought and how you got to your answer we're going to help other people in this class use that same thought process okay ,thank you 
420.3,Chris,,okay so if we are looking in paragraph number three look and reread that real quick and remember we are looking for the words equipment and discover let me know if you find either of those words in that paragraph alright student what did you notice from paragraph three ,they said that the waters microscopic and so i thought like if that was a keyword than that but you said that will actually okay you said that that wasn't like all over the text so actually what i was looking at is that they said you need the water they found that was it the water they found because i was thinking discover like that keyword and and i thought found was the word 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah so found and discover they play hand in hand with each other so once you've discovered it now you found it and now you can look at it so the microscope is what's looking at it now student in your answer in your response you named a type of machine what was that machine ,in my in my revised response yeah so i said the lunar orbiter was how they discovered the little bits of water 
230.2,Farrah,,yeah and student where did you find your answer for lunar orbiter were in the text did you find that ,so i saw it in paragraph two and that was yeah that was right 
230.2,Chris,,well good all right student do you have a question ,yeah i just wanted to check actually that okay is my new answer okay it's the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic 
420.1,Chris,,and your answer is closer to a correct answer but what were what was the keywords in number one what were the keywords ,"um okay it wasn't water it was equipment and discover right Oh. No, it doesn't. So that actually makes sense. So I didn't really answer the question, I just was I did. I understand. Oh, that's exciting. I really understand "
210.4,Oliver,,yeah say student said that she found her answer in paragraph two student what do you have to say ,um i just wanted to say unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go to our next class i just really wanted to thank you for working with us was really fun to work with thank you so much 
210.4,Luis,,hey student what's your question ,um yeah hi so i think i got this all figured out so i think i'm all good 
150.1,Luis,,well let's double check our answers that way we know for sure that we have answered the question the way that it's asking us to ok ,ok 
210.2,Farrah,,so moving on to question number two it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable so we are going to use the same strategy the same technique and take about 30 seconds and find any keywords in that question okay keywords something important to help us find it back in the text all right good job student you found a word what word did you find ,i thought was like my keyword was convincing and then valuable 
130.2,Chris,,yeah so convincing is an important word and i do like valuable valuable is a good one also convincing what is it convincing convincing what what are we being convinced of does class have a word to go along with savannas word convincing student what did you find ,um well i said evidence as as well so like i guess it goes together like convincing evidence 
120.1,Jazmin,,yeah exactly that was a great thought process putting convincing evidence and valuable together so we know what headings are in our text so there are two headings here the first heading is the moon is a desert it's the bolted words who can read to me what the second heading is student what is the second heading ,water is a valuable resource 
210.2,Jazmin,,excellent so what keyword from our question have we already found from this heading student ,well actually i was just saying i'm still kind of confused 
420.2,Jazmin,,okay so when we are reading our question and we have found those keywords we're trying to find those words back in the text so that we know what answer to give so student your answer that they can drink water and stay hydrated is a very good answer and it is mentioned here in the text there are a couple other of your friends that are needing a little bit help with the guidance of where to find their answers so the best place to start is the keywords in the question and then going back to those headings to try and see if we can look underneath that heading for an answer ,did i give like convincing evidence in my answer 
110.2,Jazmin,,you did um ,yeah cuz i said that yes that there's convincing evidence and i said astronaut drink the water and stay hydrated and that you can't survive without water 
230.2,Luis,,yes and that is correct and i like that you found that because you used that text heading to help lead you in the right direction is that the only paragraph that provides us with convincing evidence no where else has somebody found something that's convincing evidence student ,um yeah so for me like okay so i was looking at the text this time because you were saying we should do that like we should read it closely and i thought that like convincing evidence is like the fact that i even it's all the paragraphs like it says in paragraph four water on the moon could be valuable useful in lots of ways could be astronauts could drink it and then also in paragraph five it says moon water could be useful in other ways it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen 
420.2,Oliver,,that is correct and i like the way that you've gone back and put the keywords from the question into your answer What what they what those parts are going to be used for how are they going to use oxygen. How are they going to use the hydrogen? yeah so you and student class see if you can figure out how they are going to use oxygen and how they are going to use hydrogen okay so class talk about it for a minute and let us know in just a second okay all right student do you have a question ,"um yeah so i was just gonna say that i read that there was that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 I was actually no, I think I forgot what I was gonna say So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I really just wanted to thank you and like specifically i wanted to thank you for a couple things like you help us understand like how to look for keywords and how to make sure that we were like "
120.3,Luis,,all right so we just talked about and read the story on discovering water on the moon and the question was what did they use to discover the water on the moon so let's go back up the text has one two and three so in looking at the one two and three they're short little sentences ,excuse me 
120.3,Luis,,yes ,i shouldn't be on this class i already know all about space 
120.2,Luis,,i know i could tell by your answer that you really enjoy space that you know that they use oxygen tanks to be up in space and to explore up there so did they need oxygen tanks on the moon and i think that's super cool but the question was what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon ,yeah definitely because they can't breathe on the moon without the oxygen tanks 
210.3,Luis,,that's true that is very true did people go up on the moon though to let did people go up on the moon in this article what we just read did it say anything about people being on the moon in this article ,um let me see 
210.2,Jazmin,,yes let's go back and look class taken another second i'll give you a few more seconds to look back over the text let's look at number two the sentence starts with nasa okay so reread that okay so that number two we just read read about 10 more seconds is class done reading and it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater the ice deposits are very small so coming back to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon okay when we read that question what are some words and let's do let's do student what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what's the word in that question that gives you a hint at where to look in the passage ,well i don't understand why my answer is wrong cuz i did pull from that i said a small machine and that's a word to look for like equipment machine you know 
210.3,Jazmin,,that is true is there a title of that machine is there a name of that machine in number two ,the lunar orbiter 
130.3,Jazmin,,yes so with the lunar orbiter and that is the name it's not capitalized like your name jazmin's capitalized student is not is capitalized but lunar orbiter is not but when it says called a lunar orbiter that's the title and that would be the answer they're looking for ,thank you 
230.3,Chris,,so you were extremely extremely close you are welcome and student you looked at found craters full of water on the moon right do you think that ,yeah yeah cuz i found that in the in the story like it was really cool that they have all these craters and like and and they thought the moon was a desert but then the craters like it's got all this water in it 
120.3,Chris,,yeah so it would be cool to to if you went home and told your mom and dad about this story then to know what they used right so that's where the question is coming from because what if your parents asked you what did they use and that's what this question here is asking what did they use so reading back through and what student had just talked about with this small machine ,want me to read read where i got my answer from or you want me to read where student got her answer from 
230.2,Chris,,where did you get your answer from student ,my answer from the first part where it talks about the the craters because it says scientists have evidence the water can be found deep within the moon polar craters so that's that's where i got my part but i do hear what you said about like why what did they use to find the polar craters i guess 
210.3,Chris,,yeah and after number one where you got your answer did you read the rest of the response the rest of the article ,yeah yeah i read the whole thing and and i wanted to tell you when you were talking student about you know the oxygen tanks that i went to nasa with my dad and so i know also that like scientists use a lot of different equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too 
110.3,Chris,,yeah and this lunar orbiter like we are talking about that's super cool ,so yeah i think i might have seen that at nasa i just realized that cool 
230.2,Farrah,,yeah so student you talked about the microscope where did you find your answer ,it was in paragraph three when it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.3,Oliver,,yeah so they did talk about using a microscope and that is equipment but is that what they used on the moon was there a microscope up there on the moon that they use to look at it or do they need them something else before they could use the microscope ,well i have the same answer as student and i remember when i was looking in the story it was saying the water they found is microscopic i'm told me that they found the water and and and it says you need a microscope so i figure they must have brought a microscope to to see the water 
110.1,Oliver,,that's true but that is true so with the microscope ,i'm sorry i'm sorry to interrupt teacher i know this was really short and and we just met but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch so i want to say thank you i really appreciate how you gave like all of us like a chance to kind of talk you know and to share our ideas so that was that was pretty cool okay bye 
110.1,Luis,,bye hi class can you hear me ,yeah 
110.1,Luis,,okay so i looked over your question yes student ,excuse me and i shouldn't be and this class um i already know all about space 
140.1,Luis,,do you ,mhmm 
230.1,Luis,,can you tell me some facts from the story that we read ,yeah sure okay so like astronauts go to space cuz are looking for water on the moon and they they have to wear as spacesuits because they can't breathe on the moon and they go up in their space shuttle that's how you get from you know like from from the earth to the moon those are some facts about space that i know 
230.1,Luis,,do you know what people are called when they go to space like what is their job title ,yeah they're astronauts 
130.2,Oliver,,exactly so in that reading piece astronauts went to space and the company called nasa sent a piece of equipment up to space does class remember the name of that piece of equipment ,i think the equipment was a microscope i had a microscope too 
210.3,Oliver,,they used a microscope but what was the name of the machine that they needed to use in space do you remember ,well a microscope is a machine 
130.3,Jazmin,,nope so in the text it said nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ,that's close to my idea cuz i said in my answer i said that nasa since the small machine but i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Farrah,,that is correct but if you want it to be more specific in a good answer you could have said nasa sent a small machine and it is called a lunar orbiter so student you were on the right track and then student can you explain your answer ,yeah sure okay like in the third paragraph they were talking about finding the water and it said the water they found is microscopic and then it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i was thinking you know like a scientific tool is kind of same thing you know as equipment so that's how i came up with that answer 
230.1,Oliver,,good job student what made you come up with your answer choice ,well i know that the question was asking for water and i know that we have to find equipment so i was looking for a place where they talked about discovering the water in paragraph three it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it you need to have a tool called a microscope so kind of like what student was saying about how microscope is a tool i was thinking you know like how you said um like is equipment and the paragraph says that they found the water and that was what the question was asking about finding water yeah that's what i have 
230.1,Chris,,student when you talk about scientists found craters will have water on the moon how did you come up with that answer ,yeah sure cuz question was asking you know them finding the water like like how student said so i was looking at the text okay where do they find the water and it says in paragraph one that at first they didn't think that there was any water and they realized that they were wrong and they found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar crater so like that's where i found my answer 
210.4,Chris,,okay so if we go back and we look at this reading passage does class know any reading skills we could have used to have answered these questions what key pieces could we have highlighted in the passage to help us answer this question ,i highlighted the part in the question that says discovery water but i didn't see discovering there so i just i found that found and water and so that's how i use that you know i also want to tell you that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too 
210.2,Chris,,exactly student when you hear the word equipment what comes to mind ,like those oxygen tanks so that they breathe and like there's the suit so that they don't like freeze to death you know 
210.4,Chris,,good so we can take the word equipment and we know that equipment means a physical object so when we're reading the passage and looking for this answer we know that we want to find physical objects that scientists used to discover water on the moon so when we read this passage we know that water has been found on the moon and then we need to find the equipment so as you're reading what physical objects came in the passage to your mind ,like in paragraph two nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter lunar orbiter okay that's the one that student said i think and they say that's like four glasses glasses is is an object but that's not that's not so i mean it's the same one that student said right the small machine called the lunar orbiter right 
420.2,Oliver,,wery good job so when we're reading and we know that we want to look for equipment yes nasa used a small machine what equipment is scientist you discover water on the moon and then to be more specific in our answer we could have put the name and what is that machine called ,i definitely well i i know it's called a lunar orbiter cuz i'm student just set it and student said it too and you said it but i'm sorry to interrupt you i know it's it's it's time first of all to lunch i know this was really short and i really appreciate how you really took some time to help us really kind of think about the words in the question and and look for other words and the story too bye 
150.1,Luis,,simulation hi class so today we are going to talk about our answers to the question that you class needed to answer and i want to first say thank you for answering the question so what i want us to first start with is i want us to all look back to the student do you have a question ,um yeah basically i was just gonna say like i kind of know all ready all about space so i don't think i need to be in this room 
110.3,Luis,,okay well we're going to work on reading comprehension in this class and if you i would like you to use your knowledge that you already know to share with the other students in the class okay so ,yeah i can do that 
210.3,Luis,,today we are going to look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon circle evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question so you class have already came up with an answer to this question and i want you class to first start with looking back in the question i want you to either underline highlight or circle keywords in our question that we need to use to help us answer this question so take about 30 seconds to look back over the question and i want you to circle the keywords in this question word in our question that we need to use to help us answer this question so take about 30 seconds to look back over the question and i want you to circle the keywords in this question okay now that you have circled your keywords i would like for you to turn to the person beside you so student and student youtube can talk student and student you can talk and then eighth and you can share your answer with me i want you to talk to the person beside you about the words that you underline that you thought were important to help you answer this question to go ahead and take 15 seconds to do that student what do you underline ,yeah so i underlined let's see when i looked at it i underlined equipment and i'm um i underlined equipment that was the main word that i underline ok 
210.3,Farrah,,ok so now that you've had time to share with the person beside you i would like for one person in each class to share their answers with the class so student and deb you want to view give me what words you class underlying the question ,yeah absolutely okay so what we underlined when we were looking at it we underlined and discover and i was just gonna say like i was kind of wondering if i was to kind of use like what my answer was wrong 
210.2,Chris,,okay we will get to that in just a second okay and good i like how you underline the equipment and discover because those are the two keywords to help us answer this question student and student what words did you class underline ,so we actually had a kind of a decision about my so i underlined up with ben and water and student underlying discovery 
230.1,Jazmin,,okay justin why did you underline discover ,and so basically i repeat visits as he like the question say like what did they use to define the water or like discovered the water so it seems like that would be an important thing to look for 
420.2,Luis,,that's correct discover is the verb that is going to help us answer this question so the equipment used to discover that is how you know what type of equipment you wanted to find so talk about your answers and how you could have improved those answers to be more specific to i want you class to talk about with that same partner so student and deb you talk together student and student you talk and then student you can you can talk with me So Luis You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. How could you be more specific to the passage ,um you mean like to the reading 
410.1,Luis,,yes so you are correct on how scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks but if you were to underline the words equipment and discover how what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon oxygen tanks are pieces of equipment but they don't really go with the water on the moon ,so so i 
410.1,Luis,,question again i ,guess more specific well i guess like i guess i'm not totally sure like what what to look for because i thought like the equipment was anything that they you know anything that they use to like find the water so like if they were on the moon they'd have to use like suits and masks and stuff um but like you know what i mean like i'm not quite sure like what else like to say 
210.4,Luis,,well that's why it's important that we know the action which is discover water on the moon so we can look back in our texts and find where it talks about a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon and in the text it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate can you show me where it says that in the text can you point to it ,yeah it was um in paragraph two it's in the first sentence 
210.3,Farrah,,good okay so the rest of the class we can come back together now student you had a question on you were wondering why your answer wasn't the best answer correct yeah okay so do you know why your answer could have wasn't the best answer ,well i guess i guess i'm still because like oh you know like i think that the microscope was what they use like it feels like i guess i don't know does it seem like that was what they used to find the water because they said in the in the writing that you couldn't see the water unless you use the microscope so i was thinking like that's what they used to discover and unfortunately we have to go to our next class but thank you so much okay 
210.3,Luis,,yes i can see you now so today i want us to work on finding okay class student can you hold your question for me for a couple minutes keywords in questions to help us better answer questions So I want you to take a look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon. so i want you to take a couple seconds and talk to the person but sachi circle that evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question what words can we underline in that question to help us answer the question so student and deb you can work together student and gel together and student you can work with me okay so take a couple seconds student what keywords could we underline in this question to help us answer with the best answer ,so i put in for my answer i underlined equipment 
210.3,Luis,,okay i like how you underlined equipment that is a good word to underline you are correct is there another word in that question to help us under to help us answer the question ,um well maybe discover 
210.3,Farrah,,i like how you said discovered that is correct discover and equipment are two very important question or two very important words in this question okay class so let's come back together as a class that may not in depth can one of you tell me what words you class underline ,oh yeah okay so the underlying reach every reader equipment and discover 
210.3,Jazmin,,great so those are two correct words that you would want to underline in that question because the equipment it's wanting to know a piece of equipment that scientists did use and then discover is our action word to help us answer this question so i want you class to look at the answer that you put for this question i want you to read over your answer and i want you to think to yourself how could you be more specific when answering this question student how could you be more specific and answering your and your answer yes student ,well i guess i was just gonna ask if if if we should all answer but it sounds like we should actually under sure like which is why my answers wrong and i realized that should be more specific but like you said totally sure like how i should be more specific 
310.1,Jazmin,,so if you look back in the text and paragraph two it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter you're right nasa did send a small machine but to give a more specific and best answer you could have put nasa sent a small machine and gave the name Answer and asking why ,it makes sense so he needs to say like like he might be more specific about like what it is 
210.3,Farrah,,so next time you have a question you can underline your keywords to help you be more specific student how could you be more specific in your answer ,i'm i'm not totally sure i think i feel like our answer is right each 
210.3,Farrah,,okay you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that is a tool that they use but the question asked about discovering water on the moon teacherr so how could you look back to find that answer ,well i guess when i think about discovering the pot i think like they used the microscope because they they say in the in the meeting that they can't see the water unless they look through my school so i thought like that's how they discuss 
210.3,Chris,,Chris. Did you notice how anything that you could be more specific and your answer. ,well i i went to nasa with my dad and i know that um you know scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks asks and so i guess like should i should i add that to my answer 
420.2,,,"But yes, it's looking for something specific. So that's when you would want to refer back to the text. So when it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. that is when you would want to look back into the text to find your answer because you already know they use various tools like you said a mask microscope and stuff like that but then there's one specific tool that it states in the text that that is why you would want to look back in the text to find your answer ",so is the tool i guess i'm wondering like is it like we're still or it sounds like the other one that just was still 
510.1,Oliver,,the correct answer is masterson a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate because that is this specific piece of equipment that scientist used to discover water on the moon so that is why it's very important to highlight those keywords so you can give the best answer def do you have a question ,um yeah unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just really wanted to thank you for working with us and i especially want to do that like that thank you for helping us really focus on the word discover and like really focusing on like how important that word is and like also like you really encouraged us to use evidence from the text and like make sure that we were on that like we were looking at the text for what we were saying um i really appreciate that was really fun working with so thank you so much 
510.1,Luis,,so i've heard all yes student ,um yeah so i was just thinking and i wanted to share that basically like i already know like all this stuff about space so like i don't really think i need to be in this class i don't need any help 
110.3,Luis,,well student and who knows you might even learn something new as for me response you do know quite a lot so maybe you can actually help me teach the other students here i might as well as well to ,know to do that yeah 
230.1,Oliver,,so i saw responses and student my question for you just you said that you sort of the same thing is student so can you explain how you also got the same answer for me ,um yeah so basically what i was thinking about was that um you know like that the microscope was was the tool and the reason why i thought that and i think it's like pretty pretty important is like so like is it's in the text because it says like you know we use a microscope or you couldn't see the water 
120.3,Jazmin,,And thank you. so i think that if we are able to work together and kind of pull their resources in there we can come up with the right answer and i think that with all of her answers we're all getting on the right track but how about first we go back to the question itself oh yes student ,well i was just when you say i wasn't sure why why my answer was bob do you mean like i just wasn't quite sure 
120.1,Farrah,,i'm not saying i'm not saying it's wrong they didn't use machinery i think whenever we talked about the question you get to find out that you're actually went wrong you were you are getting to the right answer so i think i think you're gonna help us learn some stuff too so going back to the question right which so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so going over that what are the some of the main main words in that sentence so just for a second here go back to the question maybe underline what you think the main parts of that question is what you need to get out of it and whenever you're ready just let me know you can raise your hand yes student oh ok i think we're all there so student what did you get out of the question ,i underlined it 
210.4,,,okay so equipment and discover did class else underlying equipment okay so we all did i think that's what it's mainly asking so we know that scientists discovered water on the moon so we know that part already and student even pointed out in your part that scientists found craters will have water on the moon so now we get to figure out with the equipment was and so student and student your answers are the same so you both said that they the water is microscopic right what does that mean that the water is microscopic ,um it's like really small 
210.4,Oliver,,yes and so from the passage student what do you need to see the water ,and you need a microscope to see the water 
120.4,Chris,,in a microscope so student let's uh let's start with you for a second so for equipment from the passage the moon is a desert what equipment or do you see mentioned in there ,and i see and i guess like well okay so i that's a question i have and i think that student had the same question yeah i was wondering like that okay so here's what i thought like i've been to nasa with my dad and we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and suits and stuff like that like luis's answer so i was thinking that like i'm wondering why that wasn't the answer 
120.4,Jazmin,,so talking about equipment that can be anything from a microscope to a giant rocket or anything so i think what might help us is to maybe you know over the passage a little bit i think specifically part to see if we can all find the passage and why you're looking through that student here response jimmy do you want to repeat that for me what your response was to the question ,yeah i was this i said yes nasa sent a small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,yes and what was that small machine called do you remember ,yeah it was just or big 
210.4,Luis,,that would also count as a piece of equipment right yes and so a finch you buy it ruth me that so we know the water is there and so and student why was the lunar orbiter sent to the moon oh yes so ,the next class has to come in but i just wanted to thank you so much for being with us before we have to be to thank you so much for everything um yeah i just wanted to remind class that my dad is actually an astronaut i just wanted class didn't know that 
110.3,Luis,,well thank you for letting us know student hopefully one day kevin unless i'm tell us a little bit about his experience there as well ,yeah 
230.2,Luis,,so student i'd asked you about the lunar orbiter and so i guess for student student i have one question for you class so you had both mentioned the fact that water is found in student you had mentioned equipment they had been used so from the passage itself because you had mentioned oxygen tanks and and other things from the passage what were some specific pieces of equipment that you see in the passage ,oh so like i gotta do like from not my like knowledge but like from the passage um well yeah i saw you that i knew were kind of cool like i saw that i'm like there was the lunar orbiter which is a really cool spacecraft and then there was also like a talked about microscopes but i don't think microscopes are the answer 
230.1,Luis,,what do you say that ,um yeah well actually it's a really good question i think that why like here's my thinking on this like i think that they asking the question they're like what equipment it scientists use discover water on the moon and i'm thinking well maybe they studied the water with the microscope but they discovered it right with the learner or so that's what i was thinking like as we as we look 
210.4,Oliver,,okay i can see how you got there i can see that so good job reading into that good job they're reading into that i guess so you can have what we talked with student and student here right which if you don't mind so effort there for you for the water how small was it what did what did how was the water described in the passage ,um so they said the water was like they said microscopic which is crazy small 
230.3,Chris,,yeah and so so we know the water the water is there right i mean student you even said yourself that they found craters full of water on the moon ,yeah 
210.3,Chris,,yeah so i guess student also soften your answer so if the water is microscopic student can we just see it from let's say a lunar orbiter above the above the moon or do we have to see it with a special kind of equipment ,well i guess i'm not sure like which equipment exactly because you could do a scanner or like something like that you know what i mean like i'm assuming they're like probes stuff like that so maybe you didn't need the microscope i'm not sure 
120.3,Jazmin,,well how about we look at the passage there so in the third part would you be okay to read the final sentence there oh yes yes student ,"i will i will just be about like i was wondering if this was maybe the answer is nasa use a small machine to get to the water this is that a good answer Like you have to say what it is, so that not just small machine, you have to say they like to say like what equipment so like the lunar orbiter like nasa use the lunar orbiter to get to the one "
120.3,Chris,,that's jethro student so you steve you weren't wrong after all but thank you student for that now student the for part three that last sentence there what's that say ,so in part three it says which part that means the moon is still drier than the dry desert on earth 
120.3,Chris,,yeah the one starts with that the final sentence there my apologies oh ,gotcha you need a scientific microscope to look really close 
210.4,Chris,,yes so according to that passage student what is the what is the passage saying that scientists had to use to see the water ,oh well i guess like the passage is saying like you have to use the microscope i guess is that right 
210.2,Luis,,that's exactly right so the question what equipment did scientists use this river water on the moon it's asking from the passionate itself so yes student ,um yeah i'm so sorry but unfortunately that's the end of our time but before we go we just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular we really wanted to thank you are like making sure that we use like the stuff from the text and we didn't just make up like our own thoughts on what was happening and you also really helped us to clarify like you asked us a couple times like what we were thinking and it was really interesting to like think about like why did we come to dance you know and then when you did that it really helped us to understand like okay like that's what you're looking for us to teach this and there's like you know what i mean like it's hard to know like what the teacher wants us to do and i feel like it was really clear so thank you so much 
210.2,All,,well thank you ,bye 
210.2,Bennett,,so student what did student say what more could you add to that maybe ,um well my my answer came from the same from paragraph three where i said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look closely 
210.2,Luis,,yes ,excuse me 
210.2,Luis,,so does class know ,i'm sorry i shouldn't be in this class i know a lot about space 
220.1,Luis,,we're all going to be in the class to learn together and discuss what we read ,okay 
230.2,Farrah,,so student they used the microscope to look closely at it but what did they send to the moon ,um a space shuttle 
120.3,Farrah,,can you look back in the text and see ,reads text to herself quickly nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
120.2,Chris,,very good see sometimes it's okay to go back and reread to find the answer so student they you what did they use to find the water on the moon in the craters ,what student said 
120.2,Chris,,what ,oh whoa whoa to find the water the craters i figured they use their eyes cuz it said there was a lot of water there 
120.3,Chris,,so let's look back and can you reread paragraph three for me ,yeah but my answer is in paragraph one it's not in paragraph three 
210.4,Jazmin,,let's see what paragraph three says uh maybe we can discuss the difference ,okay okay reads paragraph three to himself in a whisper okay but i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
220.1,Jazmin,,it's not wrong we're just having a class discussion now that we've read ,oh oh okay 
210.3,Chris,,so student after after reading paragraph three do you think that they were able to see the water with their eyes ,rereads to himself oh no it says the water they found was microscopic meaning you would be able to see it if you're looking straight at it oh okay 
130.2,Chris,,very good very good so student your answer was that nasa send a small machine so student do you think that they use that machine to look at it because we couldn't see with our eyes ,the machine the microscope 
130.2,Chris,,yes ,well yeah i think i think if it if you can see with your eyes and then chapter three or the part three yeah that's you got to you got to use a microscope 
230.2,Luis,,very good student you said that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen and tanks what are they using that for ,they use that to breathe because you can't breathe in space because there isn't any oxygen there 
120.1,Luis,,very well so they do use that kind of equipment on the moon to breathe like you said what did you use to discover the water on the moon though ,um is it the microscope i'm not sure 
120.3,Luis,,can you read paragraph two for me ,okay um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits ina large polar crater ah oh yeah so that's what's going to find the water in the craters you know i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit and stuff ok the lunar orbiter will look for ice deposit in the polar craters 
130.3,Oliver,,very good so like student said they do use equipment like oxygen and tanks to get to the moon and be able to survive on the moon but however they use the small machine to find the ice deposits correct ,yeah yeah well i guess i mean i hear what they're saying but i guess i don't know why i don't know how how we got this answer about the small machine to find the ice deposits i was looking for the keywords and the question 
120.2,Oliver,,so if you look back paragraph two can you read that for me so the question is what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon ,yeah nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter investigate this is the one that student just read right that's lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small scientists think about one ton of the top layer of the moon's surface would hold on total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about one person might drink in a day 
210.4,Oliver,,so if we look back at the question what do you think the keywords in the question are ,i thought it was equipment and discovering water 
120.4,Oliver,,exactly very good so what equipment did they use to discover the water ,well i mean i guess i guess they use the lunar orbiter to go to the south pole and then they found more water on once they got to the south pole so um yeah i guess that that will be it oh i'm looking at the clock and it that it's time for us to go to lunch i know we just met um and it was a really short time but i do really appreciate how you you you kept asking us questions and asking us to read back the paragraphs to to help to help us understand the text 
120.4,Oliver,,i hope you class have a good time at lunch ,thank you okay okay bye class say bye bye 
120.4,Luis,,bye start simulation yes student ,um yeah so i was just gonna say like i don't think i even need to be in this class because i already know like all about space already 
150.1,Luis,,well that's okay it doesn't hurt to learn a little more right ,yeah i guess so 
150.1,Farrah,,how are you class this morning or this afternoon sorry ,we're doing well we're excited to work with you 
210.3,Farrah,,i'm excited to work with you class so i looked over all of your answers for the question and i wanted to start by trying a strategy and see if we have different answers so if you could find the question on your paper and circle the key points or circle like one or two words in the question that could lead us in the text to find the correct answer does class want to share what they circled student ,yeah okay so what i circled in the question was i said let's see i said equipment and discover 
210.2,Oliver,,good job i like that you circle the word equipment that will really help you find in the passage what the answer student ,um yeah so basically i circled the same thing as student 
120.4,Oliver,,what was that ,i said equipment and discover 
210.2,Chris,,student good job i like that you circled the word equipment just like student because that'll help find the answer in the passage will have to look for the word equipment and see if you can find the correct answer ,yes so for me i circle let's see i circled scientists and water 
210.2,Jazmin,,i like that you circled water because that's the key point of that question we're trying to find out how they found the water on the moon very well done student ,yes so basically i circled i kind of circled much the same thing i circled discover and equipment i was kind of wondering like why my answer was wrong 
110.2,Jazmin,,i didn't say it was wrong your answer isn't wrong ,oh okay 
110.2,Luis,,student ,um yeah so for me i circled on equipment and scientists 
210.3,Farrah,,good job so we're looking to find what equipment they used to find the water on the moon so look back in your passage and see if you want to change your answer from the beginning using those keywords that you circled look back in the passage i'll give you about two minutes if you're ready before then just raise your hand okay student did you find anything that helps you to change your answer by circling the keyword in the question ,so i when i went to circle the keywords i basically ended up with the same answer and that's because i was thinking about what equipment was used to discover the water and i still think it's the microscope so i thought extra hard about it but i still have the same answer 
110.1,Oliver,,well done student ,um yeah basically the same as student and for me like i was thinking about science equipment and discover and so i also think that like it has to do especially with the microscope 
130.1,Oliver,,what did they use to find the water the what the designed to send to the moon to find the water do you can you find that in the text yes i know what you mean they use the microscope to look closely at the water ,um yeah i could try to see like i'm not quite sure 
130.2,Jazmin,,they use the microscope but before they could use the microscope what did they use to get to the moon does class know student ,yeah i was gonna say they use the small machine to get to the moon and they use the small machine to find the water 
210.4,Chris,,student yes they did doesn't can class go back into the text and find out what the name of that small machine was called ,oh well i was just gonna say that okay so i went to nasa with my dad and when he and i went to nasa together we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks so i was kind of wondering about that 
230.1,Chris,,wondering about that in what way ,well like it wasn't in the in the meeting but i was thinking like they had to use it you know so like i was thinking maybe that's the answer with the equipment 
130.1,Jazmin,,but that's not what we're looking for right now we're looking to find what equipment they used to find the water on the moon they did have to use that equipment while they were in the on the moon and stuff like that yes student ,so i was gonna say us with the machine was and i was gonna say the machine is the lunar orbiter 
230.2,Jazmin,,very good i'm so how did you find that answer did you look back in the text using your keywords ,yeah because you said look for this specific machine and so when i went back and look for the specific machine that was the equipment itself lunar orbiter and unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go to our next class i just wanted to thank you for working with us it's really fun to work with so thank you so much 
230.2,Jazmin,,thank you class i hope your next class goes well good afternoon class how are you ,we're doing good 
230.2,Luis,,yes student thank you for raising your hand ,up yeah i was just excited i wanted to tell class make sure class knew that actually my dad is an astronaut 
110.1,Luis,,is he really we'll have to talk to him after school about all this stuff that you're learning about ,oh yeah i totally well 
120.4,Farrah,,sounds good so our next question was one second is there convincing evidence that there's water on the moon can be valuable student what was your answer ,ok so my answer was basically no like i don't think it's very convincing but not for a long time 
230.2,Oliver,,gotcha so i want class to take a second go into the reading and circle where you found your answer and raise your hand when you're ready okay student where did you find in the text to support your answer ,okay so i had basically i said that know that it's not ready yet and i was looking in paragraph it's paragraph under the water is a valuable resource and it basically was saying that like in paragraph six it says like um that scientists need to come up with a plan for getting the water and then making this plan will take a lot of time and money and i guess i was just thinking that like basically it's not ready yet to get the water from them like you'd have to do a lot of other stuff to get the water 
310.1,Jazmin,,and student would you like to go let us know how you found your answer however i think that they have a plan for the water yes that is true i like that you went back in the text and had some support to support your answer and i do agree with you ,yes okay see i said that yes that the water would be valuable and the reason that i said that so astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water and so what i was looking at basically i wasn't a paragraph four and they were saying that basically the astronauts could read the water you know what i mean and also was gonna say like something that i thought was really cool is that you could use the water and you could grow a garden and you can have all these plants and things like that with the water that's up there 
110.1,Luis,,that's a great idea i wonder if that could happen we'll have to do some more research about that another time student ,um yeah okay so for me basically what i said i said that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and the part where i got that from was let's see where did i oh oh okay in paragraph five purify water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket 
230.3,Chris,,yes very good i am very glad that you went back in the text and were able to find support for your answer yes student so the water can be used for two different things for the astronauts to drink and as the fuel if they break it into two parts so that was two of the ways that they could use it ,oh i was just going to share my answer okay so water is heavy so it's good they don't you know have to carry it in the ships anymore and i think for me like where i i saw it like what is it it says in paragraph or the waters happy it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft and that would be a big deal to have that and then i also said like student water can be broken down into two parts into hydrogen and also into oxygen and you can use both of those things Thank you. 
210.3,Farrah,,student did you student and student were you able to find in the in the paragraph where they were talking about the air answers and why it is a yes ,yeah we saw the answers i think that well do you have any thoughts um yeah i mean basically my thinking is that it's not that it will be useful like in the future but i think there's just so many problems on the way costs too much money and like we don't right now like how much like to do in space like i don't know i guess i'm still kind of wondering you know what i mean 
210.4,Jazmin,,yes student and based off the paragraphs as student said we're able to see that they can use the water for two different reasons i agree but we're reading the paragraphs and we're wondering what based off of our paragraphs what knowledge are we getting from those ,unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i wanted to really thank you for like taking the time to make sure that we were circling keywords and making sure that we were like using our keywords you know me and like you're even more than that that we were like that we were using evidence like that's a really big deal because sometimes we don't always like base our answers on the text that you really like wanted to make sure that we were using evidence so i think class went back and and like really closely with you'd like everything they needed to do you know we take the quiz this was really cool so like thank you so much for working with us and it was really cool that just like you were really made us feel valued and i guess thank you so much 
150.1,Luis,,thank you class are we have a good lunch alright friends thank you for sharing your answers with me about what equipment did scientists use from our text so now i want to dig a little bit deeper into your answers okay yes student do you have your hand up ,um yeah so i was just gonna say i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know all about space 
120.2,Farrah,,hmm well i'm glad that you know a lot about space okay but we're all in this class to work on answering some questions alright okay alright so thank you again for sharing all your answers okay so our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon okay do you have the text in front of you ,yes we do 
420.3,Oliver,,okay good so i want you to go back and i'd like you to look at paragraph number five i want you to think about what equipment was used and if you see any equipment mentioned if you can use your pencil and underline it okay so i'm going to give you a few seconds to do that yes student ,paragraph five is that the one from the second reading about waters of valuable resource 
420.3,Oliver,,yes excuse me i meant paragraph two thank you for the clarification student ,gotcha just wanted to check 
420.3,Chris,,yeah thank you paragraph two alright take another few seconds student and student right so let's start with student what did you underline in paragraph two that might be a type of equipment ,um okay so i underlined um let's see machine lunar orbiter i guess glasses but i don't think they mean it that way those things 
110.1,Farrah,,awesome job thank you for sharing all right miss student what did you underline and paragraph two ,i said the same thing like small machine and lunar orbit just in paragraph two i'm still confused like why are my answers wrong 
110.2,Luis,,okay well we're going to get to that in one second all right student and it's not wrong we're just going to see if there was a different way to answer it okay all right student can you share what you underlined in paragraph two ,um yeah so imperative to well i underline the same thing like small machine i underlined lunar orbiter because i figured that was something that you know that's that's i know about that crap um yeah that's what i put but i also like wrote down like some other stuff because there's lots of other equipment that they used 
230.2,Farrah,,okay very good all right so i heard a few of you class say that you underlined a lunar orbiter and small machine okay and so student why did you underline that in paragraph two ,it was the only equipment in paragraph two 
230.2,Oliver,,okay student why did you underline that i'm paragraph two ,um yeah basically that was on the same because it was all the equipment that i could see 
120.1,Farrah,,good okay so does that help us answer our question of what equipment was used to find water on the moon ,still confused because i i i guess why the microscope is it you know what i mean is it an answer too because it says what equipment is used to discover water like they said that you have to use the microscope to see so how did they discover what if they couldn't see 
130.1,Farrah,,well that's very good so the microscope would be part of the answer and lunar orbiter would also be part of the answer right student ,okay yeah so so microscope and lunar orbiter 
230.1,Farrah,,yeah because the lunar orbiter helps with the ice right and the ice helps do what student hello so i saw your responses to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon um student how did you come up with your answer ,okay so i got my answer from paragraph three and i basically was thinking like you have to use the microscope to see the water if you were going to like discover it how could you discover it without without seeing 
230.2,Luis,,okay thank you for that student where did you come up with your answer ,ah yeah okay so i got my answer from like i know about like space and stuff so i already kind of knew the answer to this question i don't think i really need to be in this class because i don't really need help with this stuff you know 
220.1,Chris,,hmm student what do you have to say about your answer okay well we're all put in this class to help each other learn um ,um well i mean i guess i don't i don't know i don't really have anything to say about it like i think it was like i think in the in the in the text it talks about like how the craters have a bunch of water um and like that made me think like that's you know what i mean like that was what they had to find 
210.3,Chris,,do you think that your answer answers the question student ,i'm not sure 
120.2,Chris,,let's read the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,oh okay yeah i guess not 
120.1,Chris,,okay do you have another answer at this time do you think ,um yeah okay so i actually was kind of agreeing with student like my dad took me to nasa and we went like all over the place and like looked at different stuff and like saw that like astronauts had to have like um like boots and oxygen tanks and all the stuff you know what i mean like they needed all that stuff to go up into space so i guess like i kind of thought maybe that was missing 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay student do you have anything to add to what student said ,well i guess well i guess what i thought was that it was this small machine that they sent was how they discovered the water i'm not really sure about chris's answer but um like student and oliver's like is my answer wrong was it not the small machine that discovered the water 
210.3,Oliver,,well let's look at our texts and figure it out together so in paragraph two it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small so student do you think there's another part to your answer other than the small microscope ,um yeah i guess actually okay so when when we talk about it together like i guess you need the lunar orbiter but um i guess it kind of still think it's like i kind of still think it's the it's the microscope because like student was saying like you have to see the water to know that it's there so like maybe the microscope was on the lunar orbiter 
130.2,Farrah,,that's good thinking student does class agree or disagree with student yes student ,um yeah okay so i agree i think that um like i think that that probably that's true that like the microscope was maybe attached to the lunar orbiter or something cuz they had to discover the water but they say that the water is um that it's basically like they like to use the word microscopic like it's so small that you can't even see it 
150.1,Jazmin,,okay student what do you think do you agree with student and student ,well i guess i'm not totally sure i mean i guess maybe maybe that's the case like maybe the lunar orbiter could have like a microscope attached i think that could be possible 
120.4,Luis,,okay um student what are you thinking ,well i guess like i'm kind of thinking i don't know like i mean i guess yeah i see that they could probably use the the lunar orbiter to go up there um i guess it's not really it doesn't really say if they're astronauts are not like if they're astronauts up there then that would be one thing but i don't really think there are 
230.1,Chris,,your text doesn't say if there are astronauts does it student what are you thinking ,um so like i'm kind of just i'm kind of thinking i mean i guess i'm kind of thinking that if it was a like an unmanned craft like like a like a probe that they sent up with the lunar orbiter was like didn't have any astronauts then then i guess they don't need the the gloves and the stuff so yeah they could use the microscope like on the orbiter and like control it with a computer or a robot 
120.4,Oliver,,mm hmm and then what did we use to go back and find our answer ,"um i'm not quite sure what wait when you say what did we use like what did we use in class Um, well, actually, um, I would say that what seemed to help us find our answer was all like listening to each other. um and actually we have to we have to actually go to lunch but before we go i did want to thank you for that specifically because i think that we all did like have a chance like to work with each other and to like really like listen to each other carefully and closely and really hear what we were saying to each other so that was pretty cool and i really really appreciate that you did that because we don't always get to listen to each other and kind of learn from each other's like thinking so thank you so much "
230.1,Farrah,,thank you okay i'm going to start with student student you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to really look closely what made you say a microscope student ,so i was thinking about like what equipment like i know about microscopes from like science class and so i was thinking like you know if you want to see like the water and it's really small that you could only find it with a microscope you know what i mean 
110.1,Luis,,yeah yes i can see are you can you say that yes student do you have a question ,um wow it's kind of more of a statement um i think i should be in this class because i know like all this stuff about space like i practically know everything about space 
230.1,Luis,,okay student let's look at your answer you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks that is very true you know when they are in space they need the oxygen to be able to breathe but right now we're looking to see how they found the water what equipment help them discover the water on the moon so could you tell me what made you say the oxygen tanks so could you tell me what made you say the oxygen tanks ,um yeah yeah so i was seeking about oxygen tanks because like well okay so i was seeing whenever i see like movies with astronauts or whenever i think about like like watching a moon launch or whatever i think like the astronauts would have to have you know what i mean like if they were going up into space you have to have that 
110.1,Jazmin,,and student you said nasa sent a small machine could you tell me maybe what small machine or where you found that in the expert except of the story mm hmm yes that's correct i could see how you could come up with that answer ,okay so when i look and small machine she basically i was looking in paragraph two and i was in the first sentence it seemed like that's what they sent they sent a small machine to go look at the water so that's why 
230.1,Chris,,okay very good i could see how you could say that yes student let's look at yours you said a scientist found craters full of water on the moon could you explain a little bit more to me about how you came up with that answer ,i was thinking that when they were saying in the reading like they were saying okay so there's ice deposits in the polar crater and i was thinking that like ice is is basically frozen water and i like i kind of know that i'm from science class and um it made me think like well that's where the water it you know 
230.1,Oliver,,yeah yes i could see how you say that yes student let's look at yours that you told me that you circled the same as student so could you explain to me where you come up with your answer ,um yeah so what i was thinking was when i was looking through the reading i was seeing like so in the in the question in the question it says what equipment did scientists use and it made me think like look for equipment so then i went i looked for equipment i saw microscopes and i totally know about microscopes 
110.1,Farrah,,okay fair enough student you have a question ,um yeah i guess i'm still wondering like cuz you know we're in the small class to try to help our answers like i guess i'm wondering like why my answer's wrong 
120.3,Chris,,okay so we're getting ready to look at that one to hear from each person we're going to take a look at that so our question that was posed to us was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so we needed to decide about looking back into our text there and try to underline or find evidence that tells us about the small machine or the equipment that scientists use so we need to look and paragraph number two in paragraph number two the first sentence it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon surface so they use that small machine and the small machine was called a lunar orbiter said the lunar orbiter was the small machine or the piece of equipment that the scientists use or the south pole and look for ask deposits in a large polar crater vast deposits are very small student did you have a question ,um yeah so i guess my my question was so like i went to nasa with my dad and i guess kind of like what he was saying like you know like scientists use all this other equipment like oxygen tanks and mass and suits i guess i was wondering like on the lunar orbiter like why that ones the answer and not like other 
210.4,Oliver,,ok so the scientists they do need to use other other equipment so like the oxygen tanks when they go up into space that does help them they did need the microscope as student and student mentioned what helped them found the water was the lunar orbiter but that doesn't help them find the water what helped them found the water was the lunar orbiter they did need the microscope as student and student mentioned to be able to see it because those deposits were so small you couldn't see it with your naked eye you needed the microscope to be able to really zoom in and see it so they did use other pieces of equipment to help them but the one that helped them find it and investigate it was the lunar orbiter yes def ,thank you so much for working with us it's time for the next class so we have to go 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay so student you said nasa sent a small machine you know the name of that machine they sent ,i think but i think student has his hand up should you call on him first or i guess student 
210.4,Jazmin,,why don't you look back at the text and paragraph two and can you tell me the name of the machine that they sent that nasa sent ,okay let's see so paragraph two the name of small machine was the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Luis,,very good student do you have a question ,um yeah it's kind of more of like a comment i guess than anything like i don't think i need to be in this class like i know all about space already and like i feel like i kind of know all this stuff so i don't really need any help 
210.4,Luis,,okay we're just going to continue to keep going and dig in a little bit deeper into our text so student you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks that is true they do need oxygen however student do you see in the paragraph where it talks about the machine that they sent ,um yeah i guess so i guess so i guess i just like i kind of know all this stuff you know 
150.1,Luis,,and our question again was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon okay let's look at paragraph two student are you looking at paragraph two there ,um yeah i'm looking right now did you want me to give the answer 
150.1,Luis,,yes you can ,okay um i guess in paragraph two um let's see i guess it could be the lunar orbiter 
430.3,Chris,,very good very good and student you read your response was that scientists found craters full of water on the moon i just want to make sure we understand can you look at paragraph three and see if they found craters that were full of water or maybe not so full water can you go ahead and look there and give me a response ,okay um the water they found is the water the found is microscopic like so i guess so was the water like are they talking about the water molecules are like the water i'm kind of confused 
120.3,Chris,,so what do we think student microscopic means so the water they found is microscopic and it says meaning that you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it ,microscopic's kind of like really small 
210.4,Chris,,very good so the water they found was microscopic you couldn't really see if you're looking straight at it so it was really small there's a small amount of it so the scientists would need a microscope to look at it very closely ,so like a small amount of water 
150.1,Farrah,,yes there was a small amount of water that they found mm hmm does that make sense ,oh 
150.1,Farrah,,student do you have a question ,yeah i have a question so i was kind of wondering like why my answer might might not be right like in terms of the question 
130.3,Farrah,,so you said that they needed a tool called the microscope to look really closely and that is true so it did help them find the water and they would need the microscope to look very closely at the water because it's so microscopic it's so little and such a small amount the small machine that they sent was caught a lunar orbiter and that was to help them investigate ,gotcha so did they discover it with the microscope 
130.3,Farrah,,what does it just says that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look at it really closely it doesn't tell us that they did use the microscope ,okay so you just needed to see 
210.4,Farrah,,wrapped if they were going to really and truly look at it and try to see it then they would need the microscope to look at it because it is such a small amount ,okay 
210.4,Chris,,student ,um yeah okay so um i was just went to nasa with my dad and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so did they use that stuff to find to discover the water 
130.3,Chris,,well again it says that nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate so i do not believe that they sent any astronauts up there to look at it at this time that they just as they sent their small machine ,gotcha okay so so was like like they may be need that stuff but they didn't like use it necessarily this time 
110.4,Chris,,right ,okay okay 
120.4,Oliver,,student you said that you circled the same as student so can you tell me what equipment the scientists use to discover the water on the moon ,um yeah so it looks like um student and i circled at the beginning we circled the microscope because that seemed like the equipment that was probably used to see the water that was so small but um i'm guessing that they probably used other stuff as well it sounds like they they used this on the lunar orbiter to go also and like discover the water 
210.4,Oliver,,very good very good so they did send them lunar orbiter up to investigate and then if they were to really look at the water very closely they would need the microscope ,so um we have to go to lunch unfortunately but before we go i just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us today and also to really thank you for like getting us to try to listen to each other's opinions and also really listening to our responses and to making sure that each of us had time to work with you today that was a big deal that we each had time to have a chance to work with you thank you so much 
210.4,Luis,,thank you class very much text is in the way give me just a second student i see your hand is up you have a question ,yeah okay so here's the thing i kind of know all about space so i don't really know like i don't think i have to be in this class i don't really need any help 
120.3,Farrah,,you believe you don't need any help well we're going to work through this together and we'll actually see what we can learn along the way does class else have any questions before we begin alright seeing no hands let's begin we all have answered the same question which i'm going to read now what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and it seems like we have some understanding of what it is that we're trying to find out but we're not all quite there just yet so what i'd like to do is i'd like us to go around and read this little by little one person at a time and then we're going to work through this question together sound like a plan all right who would like to read first all right student let's have you read the first paragraph right where it says one ,okay um let's see the moon is a desert scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines 
120.3,Oliver,,very nice who wants to read the second second paragraph student saw your hand first let's go with you ,um okay um second paragraph and number two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small 
120.3,Jazmin,,alright paragraph number three who's next hi student i saw your hand first let's go ,so let's see paragraph three that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific to call the microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Farrah,,exactly now while i'm reading this i see a lot of words that maybe i do maybe i do not quite understand in a moment after our answer farrahs question i'd like us to go through and identify some of these words student what's your question ,yes so okay i was just wondering as we were reading it through like because i know we're in this class for for help like i was wondering why my answer about the microscope might not be right or what was wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,we will get to that in just a moment give me a moment to identify some of these words because i don't know about you class but some of these are kind of difficult to understand at face value so look at this for just a moment on your own and see if you can find one or two words that maybe you don't entirely know what they mean or maybe just need some clarification take just a moment raise your hand when you find one alright student i see your hand what did you find ,basically i wasn't quite sure about microscopic i think i know what it means but i wasn't totally sure 
230.1,Jazmin,,what do you believe it means ,it means something that is small 
130.1,Jazmin,,yes small but it's actually smaller than small microscopic is a really big word that means very very small small enough to where we can't actually see it without a special tool ,It's the microscope. That was Farrah's answer. 
120.4,Chris,,exactly exactly we need that special tool called a microscope to see these little microscopic whatever it ends up being in this case it's microscopic amounts of water yes does class else yes student what did you find ,you yeah i didn't actually so i didn't really see anything in here but i kind of i did have a question that came up from reading and it was like i went to nasa with my dad and there was like like we we saw all these spacesuits and like oxygen tanks and all the stuff that the astronauts had to use like did they not have to did they not need those things is that whether or not in the reading 
120.4,Farrah,,"Alright, so we have identified the word microscopic. Now I'm going to reread the question once more, just so we get it back into our heads. The question is this. what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon now the next step i'd like for us to go through is which of these three paragraphs actually addresses the question all right take a moment look through and see just which one actually addresses the question class have any ideas student saw your hand up first ",okay so to me i thought that um well i think it's to paragraph three because they're talking about the water that they found and they're talking about how you'd be able to see it like how can you how can you discover it if you can't see it 
130.2,Jazmin,,but is that all we use to get there and be able to observe said water that's a great question you're partially right we're not entirely there you're very right when we say that you did actually use a microscope to see the water absolutely we're not entirely there just yet student what you got to add well we are absolutely on the right track student what do you have to add ,okay so like i don't really think that it's the microscope i think that it's the machine the lunar orbiter and the reason that i think that is that it it talks about like using that to investigate and that sounds like the like the thing that the question like discover what it does 
130.3,Jazmin,,"they actually use that to find it yeah absolutely they did use that to get to the moon didn't they but really could they have seen such tiny amounts of water without the microscope as well i don't really think they could have it's that small i don't think really we could see it with that that special tool that scientists created for us to actually use so now what i want you to do you class know what elbow partners are good i'm seeing some head nods i want you class to discuss amongst yourselves just pair up in groups of two and then a class of three over here Alright, it looks like we're starting to come back together. Good. Jazmin? ",so unfortunately we have to go to lunch now but before we go i wanted to thank you for working with us and especially i wanted to thank you for really like helping us kind of work together as a class and really focusing on like having us explorer answers together as a class and like not sort of just like giving us the answers like sometimes teachers just kind of give us the answer and we don't really we don't really think about like what we're supposed to be thinking about and we did a lot of thinking today i just wanted to thank you because that was pretty cool 
130.3,Farrah,,you're very welcome i thank you for giving me the opportunity to come here and work with you all right hello class how's class doing today ,we're excited to work with you 
150.1,Farrah,,fantastic i love that amount of enthusiasm real quick before we begin i would like to just address one thing that i tell all of my students whenever they walk into my classroom for the first time student i see your hand you can put it down i'll get to you in just a minute so you're not just standing there holding it up the whole time one thing i like to mention to my students that i'd like to mention to all of you as well as my philosophy on answering questions might be a weird thing to hear at this age but i'd like mistakes that's a weird thing to hear a teacher save right i like mistakes you're probably not going to hear too many say make mistakes in my class in my room i have a favorite word it's called confidence and not everyone's confident are we i know at least growing up i was not always the most confident when i came to answering questions even if i knew you know i knew the answer easy two plus two is four maybe i actually wouldn't answer out of fear of ridicule from my friends or even the teacher i don't want you to have those feelings in my class even if you're not confident i want you to well fake it and see what happens if you think you know the answer let me know and then i will do my best to guide you in the right direction if you don't come to the correct conclusion on the first trouble work together does that make sense ,oh yeah that sounds great and i think that we all feel really confident now that you said that thank you so much alright 
120.2,Luis,,i apologize i have skipped over luis's question when i said i would come back to him student go ahead so i'm going to reread the question for all of us so that we can hear it again the question is what equipment did scientists ,oh no that's okay i was more of a comment really i was just gonna say like i don't think i have to be on this class cuz like i kind of already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,so you're very enthusiastic about space you enjoy it ,yeah 
120.2,Farrah,,we'll use will use that enthusiasm here in just a minute so bear with us for a little bit i hear that you class have already shared out your answers and add honestly just like to go left to right and pick apart everybody's answer start with student would you mind reading your answer to me what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,sure no problem ok so my answer was you need to see typical color microscope to look really close 
230.2,Farrah,,absolutely thank you for using full sentences full complete sentences full of correct grammar and all that nice capitalization i appreciate that now do me a favor look back in your text and help me understand what led you to that conclusion what made you say you need it scientifically tool called the microscope in fact class look back in the text and see where you found your answer and help me understand what what it was that led you to that conclusion when we get to each person student have you found it ,yeah i have a good idea 
230.2,Farrah,,to go ahead and read me where it is in the passage ,good okay so when i look at the reading the thing that connected was a paragraph and it says the water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope really close 
210.4,Farrah,,exactly microscopic that's one of the words that pops out to me what does that mean student do you know ,it means really small 
110.1,Oliver,,yeah it means so small we actually can't see it just looking at it can we so we do indeed need that microscope comes from the word microscopic microscope to be able to see it that's absolutely right but we're only halfway right it's as if we have you know we're we got a foot in the door but we got to get the rest of the way in so we are halfway they're going to come back to that in just a minute let's move on let's move on to the name is tiny student i believe i'm reading your name right is that right ,yeah that's right my name is student 
110.1,Farrah,,absolutely not see you said you circled the same thign as student ,go ahead i was just gonna student and i have the same answer i think that we were still little bit about why he was wrong 
150.1,Jazmin,,yeah and that's exactly why i pause for just a moment because you both do have the same answer so i'd like to dress you both at the same time so you have the same answer as student that's great you do use a microscope to actually see the water but is that all that they used in order to find the water i don't think it quite is helped me look back i'm looking at let's very quickly i'm just going to quickly read because we're crunching on time i'm going to very quickly read starting in paragraph two follow along with me well the first three paragraphs the answers in there somewhere it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon's south pole and look for an ice deposit in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small scientists said that up to one ton sorry one ton of top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water is the answer in there or is that just a partial answer in there what do you class believe what do you think student and student i see jazmin's hand let's move on to student for a moment you got some insight let's hear it ,so when i was looking i realized that i think the answer is the lunar orbiter so that seems like the right answer to me 
110.2,Oliver,,yeah absolutely if you look back let me scroll up if you look back direct quote from it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate you read the rest of the paragraph it leads them to the water right so student and student yes you absolutely use a microscope to see to actually see the water however they use the lunar orbiter to actually physically get there right but if we were to choose one answer to be correct i would probably go with the lunar orbit does that make sense you three so in essence kind of both of them are correct ,um so i think that i understand that the equipment like the answer to the question is the lunar orbiter but i think i'm still not quite sure why and i'm unfortunately we have to go to our next class but thank you so much for working with us we really enjoyed working with thank you 
110.1,Chris,,student would you remind me what you were saying just so we can catch back up allright class just to recap for my own sake i believe we went over student and student and student you hopped back in believe student you just had a question student hold on just one moment ,yeah so i was just say um let's see i think it was talking about like the before lunch i was talking about like craters well so my answer was that the craters were full of water on the moon and that that was like you know what i mean like they found all this water 
110.1,Chris,,yeah that's where we were yeah we were on your answer and your answer i'll read it verbatim scientists found craters full of water on the moon so student do me a favor go back into the text help me understand what led you to your conclusion so let's go back student put your hand up for just a minute we'll get to you in just a moment your next up ,okay so when i was reading i thought that okay so one of the keywords in the question was what so i said okay so you have to find quiet and you both do the bidding and then when i was looking at the meeting i saw that there was all this water that it was mostly located in the craters so i thought yeah that's where they'll find it 
230.2,Chris,,"but i believe we've had just a little bit of misunderstanding does that make sense just a little bit we can easily Sure, if I were to so do me a favor, which paragraph. Did you find the information about the crater. ",um let's paragraph one 
120.3,Chris,,yeah i see i see in the last minute so would you mind student would you mind reading paragraphs one and two for the class please ,yeah okay scientists have known for a long time that the moon is it desert because it has no opposite like we have however a usable that there was no water on and we can imagine that i read the rest it so you have plenty of time yeah 
120.3,Chris,,yeah there we go alright so after reading it good thank you for that so let's look specifically at paragraph number two both of them mentioned craters right however if we look at paragraph two it goes a little bit more in depth from what i see let's look specifically at well i'm just going to read the whole thing quickly for myself nasa send a small machine called lunar orbiter to investigate that lunar orbiter would land in the south pole deposits these ice deposits for very small sounds it says that one of the top 10 layers okay good that was for myself thank you class and that they would contain water how about we look halfway down do you see the sign the sinister begin scientists said that one ton you see that sentence is that a lot of water student i'm going to read that for all of us scientists said that one time of the top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water and if we continue that's that's only about four glasses of water ,um no i guess it's not 
210.3,Chris,,yeah maybe not so if we look back down at your answer which was there full of water on the moon is that completely accurate ,no because they're not as there's just a little bit of water like not a lot of water 
150.1,Luis,,yeah and if we go back it actually says that we need a microscope to see the water so it's really really small and spread over a really large area isn't it but for time we're gonna move on over to student we just need to take it a little bit further I see. You had a question. yes sure ,yeah i i think i've got this all figured out so i think i'm good i was just gonna say i think i can go back to my seat 
230.2,Jazmin,,actually let's go on to your answer i'm going to read it for class so we can remember says scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks i'd actually like if we stayed together as a class i like the small class dynamic would you mind staying with us and following along sure i bet they absolutely did have to use some a lot of equipment to get to the moon i can't imagine just you know stroll up to the moon so absolutely use a lot of equipment to get up there so you're not wrong in that regard but i'm going to reread the question for myself and for the class what equipment did scientist used to discover water on the moon so your answer was that they use oxygen tanks essentially is what your answer was i'm going to go over to student since we're low on time student you had your hand up what were you gonna say so would you mind going back in the text and finding that for me while you're looking ,i was just gonna say that i was still a little bit confused about some of the stuff like i think they understand like so in this being the right answer and i understand that like the nasa scientists machine called a lunar orbiter to discover the water like that that seems like the right answer right so i understand that but i think what i was confused by was that there were like i guess i'm wondering like why like why that was the right answer and like student and oliver's the answer was like about the microscope like is the or even like this stuff about like the spacesuits and the masks that is it just the lunar orbiter part of the answer or should you answer like with all the thing 
210.4,Jazmin,,in reality i'm not sure any teacher would count it wrong myself included if you put every bit of it you know if you put the lunar order and the microscope and just about anything i don't think i'd counted wrong because technically that is correct every little bit that us to get to the moon and find the water is technically correct however if we read the question itself specifically what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon that's our buzzword right there discover the water so if we go back up and we see that if we look at the microscope more specifically that you're looking at it and actually seeing it in order to see it you would need to have already discovered it by this point right does that make sense ,makes a lot of sense yeah so does that make sense in that makes sense to me but like i think that yeah okay so it's the orbiter was like that thing actually found the water and then they studied the water later but first you have to find is that right 
110.1,Luis,,"Luis. Help me, help me with yours. I asked you to find where you found your information in the text. Where'd you see it. student let's move back over here real quick before we hop over to student i see your hand you can put it down ",so i think it was a trick question because i did not find it and i think that was the thing right like it wasn't there i think i just brought that in from outside you know what i mean like it wasn't in the text there was nothing about like face masks and stuff like that like i think pretty much like i got that from like what i already know yeah 
430.3,Farrah,,"I'll just kind of rush through and pull information from other bits of what I've already read about music, or in this case about science into what we're already reading. so in essence yeah they should probably do use oxygen tanks when they go to space they need to breathe right but not necessarily applicable to this specific text so maybe in the future use that information but just make sure that you take it maybe a little bit slower find all the information there and and then apply that alright student i believe we were hot hopping over to you next have any can put your hand down i see that you're waiting if ",i'm sure thing so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for helping us to really make sure that we were using evidence from the text in our answers and you really asked us like about our thinking and you really like had us kind of like prove what we were saying by also like explaining what we were thinking and let us take time you like really let us take time to explain our ideas like sometimes we interrupt each other but like you're really made sure that class was listened to and like i think class thought really value and like finally you really explain what we needed to work and you gave us ideas about what what we needed to do to like improve our answers so i think like every single one of us even if we're not like totally on the answer or totally understanding class knows like what we need to work on to get to the right answer and like that's really cool because that doesn't happen all the time so just wanted to say thank you bye bye hi how are you today 
430.3,Farrah,,okay ,we're doing well 
430.3,Luis,,i'm good how are you ,oh um so i have a question i have a question 
430.3,Luis,,okay ,yeah okay so i already know like all about space so like i don't really think i need any help i don't think i need to be in this class 
110.3,Luis,,well i definitely think it would help if you stuck around and maybe you can help encourage your classmates to learn a little bit more and even learn a little more yourself ,okay yeah i can do that 
150.1,Oliver,,awesome okay does class else have any questions so far ,um yeah i have a quick question um so we were we were just discussing the text and looking at the question how did scientists or what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and we each had our answers um what would you like us to do do you want us to keep discussing our answers um what would you like 
130.2,Oliver,,okay so i think right now what we can do is discuss with your neighbor or even the class and kind of talk about where you class got your answers from and what you'd like to know more about ,okay we can do that 
130.2,Farrah,,yes ,okay so my my question was when i was looking at the text again and we were when we were talking about it um i still think my answer is right like i think that my answer about the microscope is right so i really don't understand why my answer is wrong 
420.2,Farrah,,we just want to dig a little bit deeper into the text and maybe help your fellow students figure out some more details about what nasa did to find water on the moon ,okay 
120.4,Jazmin,,what else did you class decide with your class discussion go ahead ,who would you like to go it's student and then student have their hand raised 
120.4,Jazmin,,um student go ahead ,okay so basically what what we were discussing we didn't agree but i thought that the answer was the small machine which when i was looking was saying that was a was the lunar orbiter um yeah was the lunar orbiter and so with the small machine i think that's what they used to discover the one and that's the answer but i think that student and student thought something else 
130.2,Chris,,okay well let's see what student and student thought as well ,okay so i'm like here's the thing i basically like my dad took me to nasa and when we went to nasa we went and saw like all of this like um like all of these like space suits and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff that like student was talking about so like i was just thinking like i think that's missing from the text like i think that's important to have those things you know like how could they go up there without oxygen tanks they had to use that to discover the water 
120.4,Oliver,,yeah so i would say based on our text here they've used different equipment to discover that there was water on the moon and student you mentioned that they did use the lunar orbiter to investigate so we know that they sent up that small machine and student we know that we have to use a microscope to actually see the water so i think you class are on the right track with that and then student and student you class agreed that there was other equipment used but since they sent a small machine i don't know that we would have needed the equipment for actual people like oxygen things to check that out student you have a question ,oh yeah um well actually at the end maybe i'm thinking a little differently um like i was thinking so you'll have to use all the things to discover the water is that the idea 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah so um in paragraph two it says that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and basically look for these ice deposits and since the water was so small we then have to use a microscope to see it ,okay gotcha um well we have to go to lunch unfortunately but before we go her just wanted to thank you for working with us today and i wanted to thank you for being so patient with each of our answers and for making sure that you were able to listen to each of our answers because sometimes we don't always each like get called on in class and it's really nice that we each had a chance to talk this time so thank you so much for working with us 
210.4,Luis,,awesome thank you class you all did a good job yes student ,um yeah so i kind of know like all this stuff about space so i don't think i need to be in this class 
110.3,Luis,,well i think we're all going to work together to form a deeper understanding of the article and maybe if you do understand everything you can help out some of your classmates ,yeah i could do that that sounds cool 
420.3,Farrah,,awesome well class i've taken a look at the answers that you gave to the question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon and while each of you had really good thought processes i want you to take another look at the article and i want you to either underline or circle words that are similar to the question or words that you think would be really important Yes. ,okay so in in the text i picked out the word microscope microscopic and let's see what else yeah microscope and microscopic 
230.1,Farrah,,okay great so what made you choose those two words ,um well i chose them because i think that that's the equipment that the scientists you use and i think that that tells us why it's the equipment because it says that the waters microscopic and then you can't see it without the microscope so i'm thinking like you know you can't find it if you can't see it 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay that's a really good thought student i want to hear from your classmates and then we're going to come back together and see what class thinks about your key terms okay student would you like to go next ,i was trying to figure out why my answer was wrong and when i looked at it so the word that i circled i circled keywords in the question i circled equipment and then discover then i looked at the text i also circled in paragraph two investigate 
230.3,Luis,,and so let's hear from student and see what he has to say and we'll come together with a class response okay okay that's a good job student so it looks like so far student and student you class have both talked about equipment ,yeah yeah yeah absolutely i always like to talk so i basically um yeah so what i was looking at when i was looking at the reading was i basically was saying like i said equipment too and then i said like what else did i put on yeah but i basically circled equipment and that was it 
210.2,Chris,,okay great so the three of you class have chosen equipment as a key term which is really good because it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon student you also said that discover and investigate were really similar so maybe we can use a combination of equipment and see what equipment helped us discover water and although it was microscopic um let's see what nasa sent to the moon and if there any other equipment pieces that you class think are really important student would you like to add something ,yeah i okay so i went to nasa with like that and when we were there we saw that scientists like use oxygen masks and two and things like that so i was wondering like is that part of you know what i mean is that part of how they found the found the water 
420.2,Farrah,,i definitely think that those pieces of equipment could be important but i think that we're looking for a little bit more specific piece of equipment that helped us discover water i want you class to break up into small groups so student student and student and then maybe student and student if you class will work together for just a little bit and if you have questions while you're discussing you can ask me but this is what i want you class to focus on i want you to help each other understand the text and so now that we know the keywords that class thinks i want you class to reconstruct your answer to give us a little bit more detail about the equipment that specifically helped us discover water yes ,so unfortunately we have to go to our next class but i wanted to thank you so much for working with us this was really fun thank you 
420.2,Luis,,awesome thank you so much yes student ,um yeah so i kind of i think i got this all figured out so um yeah i think i'm all good 
120.4,Oliver,,all right class let's bring it back together as a as one class and let's see how our answers may have changed based on your class discussion i want to ask you class after you've talked to your partners or your class members and we circled are underlined key terms in the text and in your questions how do you class think you could reconstruct your answer to be just a little bit more detailed student would you like to share first ,um yeah so i was thinking when you said like more detailed like that we need to use like a complete sentence and like like draw from the from the text right like from the things that we circled or underlined and like say this is why i think that's right so if i was gonna say my answer like i guess well i guess can i still say microscope or i guess it's the lunar orbiter isn't 
310.1,Oliver,,"And now that you've chosen to answer that gives us more detail, instead of just circling the same as Farrah. Your thought process is a lot deeper as well. ",yeah i'm trying to think like how to explain it in my own words you know 
130.2,Chris,,sure well i know that a couple of you class had your hand raised but student would you like to share how your it's your may have been reconstructed and maybe that will help student with his words since you class may have similar answers ,i wasn't really answering the question so i ok so my answer now would be like that scientists are found craters full of water on the moon by using the lunar orbiter 
120.4,Jazmin,,Let's hear from your partner Jazmin and see what she has to say. ,okay so basically the first thing i was gonna say is that i'm still a little bit confused and i think what i'm confused about is how like how we can make sure that our answers are complete i think i understand what student did but i'm not quite sure how to make my answer more complete i said nasa sent a small machine then i could add lunar orbiter but i'm not sure how to do more than that 
420.2,Jazmin,,sure student so i think that you're on the right track because they did send a small machine and now that you've added the name you've definitely added more detail one thing that may help you in the future is to answer the question as if you were teaching about the question so if somebody was new to reading this passage just like you class were how would you best explain it to them so that they would get a full picture of what you class are reading ,oh that's really interesting i just want to make sure that they they answered the question so that whatever they said like i would want to make sure that it was like it answered the question about equipment and discovering water 
420.2,Oliver,,sure so you can also remind them if you were teaching or even from your perspective as a student if you can answer the question and then give us a little bit more detail as to why that your answer that will help you with a with a more concrete answer sure student ,um so i was just gonna share and i thought this was kind of interesting based on what we're talking about that i read somewhere that there could possibly be a base on the moon like a settlement by by 2024 like that's what nasa was trying to do 
120.4,Farrah,,yeah so i think that's really good information and i appreciate you sharing with us i want to bring us back to the question though and i want to make sure that class has a really good understanding of why it was the lunar orbiter that helped us discover the microscopic water does class have any questions remaining about that student would you like to go first ,yeah i don't think it's actually i guess i guess i don't really have a question because i understand why it's the lunar orbiter because it's not it didn't say those tricky in the in the reading it didn't say that they discovered it using the microscope they studied using a microscope so is that right is that the right way to look at it 
120.4,Farrah,,sure i think that um you know earlier we discussed how discover and investigate were two really big key terms in the question and the article and since we're looking at the question when it says discover the water on the moon that gives us a path to answer lunar orbiter because that is what the scientists use to discover it student would you like to add anything to that ,yeah we have to go to lunch i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and like in particular i wanted to thank you for making sure that we were using the words from the question like the word discover in what we were looking at and not just that but like you have this use evidence in our interests and you also like you asked us a lot about like you help us to clarify what we were trying to say because you asked us like why did we say this or what were we thinking even me and so i think we all really valued in a minute we all you know like like you really were listening to us and it was pretty cool and so thank you so much for coming and you also like beginning explain like what we needed to work on and like how we could improve our answer so i think we learned a lot thank you so much how are you doing 
120.4,Luis,,hi student ,i have a question i already know like all this stuff about space already um like i don't think i need to be in this class i don't really need any help 
120.2,Farrah,,okay well we do want to focus your attention on the article we just read and we're going to examine this article and try to determine how scientists have gone about finding water and the craters on the moon and turning our attention to that question and you all have read what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,we can go one at a time and give you our answers again 
120.2,Chris,,yeah ,okay so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and yeah i circled the same thing as student um so scientists foudn craters full of water on the moon 
210.2,Farrah,,and just for a second let's examine what student and student just said they said that scientists need a microscope to find water in the craters on the moon and that and what do you think about that does this text actually support that idea that you need a microscope find water on the moon ,i agree i think so 
210.2,Farrah,,and what part of that passage do you see that reference that you need a microscope ,i would say okay so in paragraph three it talks about how you need the microscope you wouldn't be able to see the water without the microscope 
110.2,Farrah,,exactly good job student is exactly right you look at paragraph three you will in fact see that it says you need a microscope ,but i know that we're here in the class to sort of help with our answers but i am not really sure why my answer is wrong it seems it is the microscope 
210.4,Oliver,,in fact it is the microscope and part of the answers is right it is the microscope and you type in your answer you said they need the microscope to look real closely why do you think they need to work real closely at the water that's on the moon what is it about the water on the moon that necessitates the fact that they need to look closely at it yes student ,um okay so you have to look really closely because you can't see it with just your eye you have to see it through the microscope 
210.4,Oliver,,exactly and why can't you see it with your eyes what is it about water ,because it's so small like the the particles of water are so are so tiny 
120.1,Jazmin,,absolutely they're small so you know you think about water on earth we look at ponds lakes oceans we can see that water we all need a microscope that's going to make tiny objects appear large but on the line as conveyed in that passage we can see that the water is small and we need this microscope to make it appear large and that's the purpose of the microscope so good job there that's exactly why we need it because we cannot see the water that's in these craters what other instruments do we we determined that we need an instrument called a microscope we know what the microscope does and why we need it is there any other equipment that we need ,yeah i think that we would need the small machine that they sent up into space and i think i guess i'm confused like why is my answer wrong 
230.2,Jazmin,,they need a small machine could you elaborate on that what exactly do you mean by a small machine and go ahead and refer to the text and see if you can find textual evidence that supports the fact that they need a small machine ,well i guess what i'm trying to find it says that in paragraph two that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
110.4,Chris,,we can see they send a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter in this case they do need a small machine and more specifically as you just said in paragraph two we can see they send a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter in this case exactly exactly so you're right they do need a small machine and yes student ,yeah so i went to nasa with my dad and we saw like all like spacesuits and and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff that people had to use so i guess i'm kind of confused like did they not have to use those things like was that like did they not not need them 
410.3,Oliver,,and you're right whenever they go into space there's a lot of equipment they have to use to get into space to get to the moon to land on the moon but specifically this paragraph address is just a small part of that process and that is actually investigating the craters on the moon so that is right student but specifically this paragraph addresses just a small part of that process and that is actually investigating the craters on the moon so that is right student they do need a lot of equipment to get there you know a lot of equipment to land and they need equipment to examine the craters but this article that we have here is examining just one little part of that whole process yes student ,um yeah so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to um i just wanted to thank you for a second for working with us today you were very patient with us and you were very positive the whole way through and we i think we really feel like you were very positive listening to our answers and talking to us today and it's really nice when a teacher listens so thank you so much 
410.3,Luis,,thank you oliverin thank you all for being such great students hi student ,um yeah so i was just gonna say like um i think i have to be in this room because i already like all out space oh 
120.4,Luis,,okay and student so you have read the text right the text that is water on the moon yeah there is a question the question is what equipment the scientists use discover water on the moon what was your answer to that question ,so i said that scientists use a lot of it like oxygen tanks and stuff like that 
230.1,Luis,,and what made you say that answer in relation to the question that was asked and the text that you read ,so i thought well in terms of the question i was thinking like what did they use to discover the water and i was like well i know that they use like they have to have oxygen tanks and they have to have that kind of stuff in order to breathe so i was like oh yeah okay so that was something that happened to us like even if it's in the reading or not i was like oh yeah well that's gotta be part of the answer 
420.3,Luis,,"However, you really have to go to the text and find specific equipment that is mentioned in the text. so student if you would right now go to the text and find some equipment that is specifically mentioned in the text and see if your answer is there if you see oxygen tanks mentioned and if you don't what is mentioned ",okay yeah i guess they don't really talk about like oxygen tanks they talk about lunar orbiter and microscopes 
110.1,Farrah,,that's great you have mentioned two pieces of equipment that are specifically referenced in the text the lunar orbiter and the microscope i'd like you to focus on just the microscopes does it mentioned in the text that the microscope was used to find water on the moon and in fact yet student you keep on looking for that and i know that student in fact did mention microscopes in her answer why did you say microscopes in relation to that question and you said that they use the microscope so student i'd like to turn to you and student you keep on looking for that information i'll turn to student student ,so i was i'm still i'm still a little confused about why my answer is wrong but i can't tell you what i was thinking so basically when i looked at the text like i saw i think it's in paragraph three they were talking about how it's like microscope and he said you couldn't even see it unless you would look through the mircoscope so i was thinking like you know how did they find the microscope if they decide how could they find the water if they if they couldn't even see you know what i mean oh ok so the microscope has to be the answer 
210.3,Farrah,,however i do want you to look at that part of the text again and ask yourself Was the microscope used to find water on the moon? remember he uses a microscope humans look through a microscope right scientists look through a microscope were their scientists on the moon to use that microscope to see the water deposits ,interesting um i'm not sure i have to look at again okay so it looks like well i don't see anything about scientists so i'm guessing no so my question like how did they find it if they didn't use the microscope 
420.3,Chris,,right so the microscope if a human or a scientist wanted to see those water deposits they don't have to use a microscope however scientists were not on the moon what was on the moon was there a piece of equipment referenced in the text that was on the moon and student get to in just a minute all right was there a piece of equipment that was mentioned on the moon so i want you to look for that student look to see if there's a piece of equipment that was on the moon and student what would you you had your hand up ,yeah i was i was actually gonna say i'm thinking about what student was saying that like i went to nasa with my dad and we saw that like scientists use a lot of like masks at suits like student was saying and so i guess i was wondering like i guess that doesn't if i'm remembering from what you said to student it's not in the reading so it's not in the answer but it seems like that was an important thing to have thing to have like an even if it's not masters i guess i'm confused yeah 
430.2,Chris,,you're right scientists are going to be using a lot of equipment when they go to the moon in the text you need to look for specific equipment referenced in a chapter so student what was your answer to that question did you find specific equipment that was referenced in the text itself ,"No, I didn't find equipment. what i i was looking at was the water so i said that scientists breeders full of water "
210.4,Oliver,,So I would like you to do Chris is go back to the text. you know they found water in the moon you know they found it in the craters and that's great i want you to ask yourself what equipment did they send into the craters to find that water as on the moon student ,so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us thank you 
210.4,Luis,,all right thank you yes student ,um yeah so i think that like i got everything pretty much figured out so i think i'm all good 
150.1,Luis,,okay and you did read the text right which was water is a valuable resource ,yeah i read it carefully this time 
120.4,Luis,,okay and you did answer the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable what was your answer to that question ,i said on water can be split into two parts oxygen and hydrogen 
230.1,Luis,,okay and i do like how you have referenced something in the text that is specifically mentioned it does in fact say that water can be broken down into oxygen and hydrogen and what was your thinking when you said that is your answer why is that valuable that it can be broken into oxygen and hydrogen why does that make water valuable ,i was thinking looking at the meeting because i made sure to look this up and i said like they said i'm that like you can well you could do all the steps of oxygen can like astronauts can breathe it and like hydrogen and oxygen can be used to make rocket fuel you know what i mean like that would seem very valuable to me 
420.2,Luis,,absolutely that's a great answer so your initial answer kind of got started on that process you said it can be split the oxygen hydrogen but that detail you just added is critical that's why it's valuable the fact that when i break it down the oxygen hydrogen astronauts can breathe the oxygen and they can use the oxygen and hydrogen as fuel so that second part that you just gave me that's why it's valuable so that's a great answer so that second part that you just gave me that's why it's valuable so that's a great answer ,oh thank you 
120.4,Jazmin,,and student what was what was your answer to that question ,i said yes and i said the astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water 
230.1,Jazmin,,absolutely and that is great because you obviously went to the text and the text does in fact say that astronauts could drink the water you did kind of explain that you said that they need water but why can't take a spring water with them could the astronauts you just bring in the water with them what do you say and why does that make it valuable what's your thinking there ,okay let's really see cuz i'm like i was still use like maybe why my answer wasn't quite right but actually that makes a lot of sense 
110.2,Jazmin,,i will say student and your answer is right ,"What he said you could you could, but it's super heavy so it takes it takes up all this room like a rocket ship. exactly it seems like it would be really good to have it with your phone right beacuse then you wouldn't have to take as much with you "
420.2,Chris,,absolutely so your initial answer was correct they need that water to be able to drink be able to survive but it's even more valuable because they can't really bring that water with them they could but it's going to take up too much space and that when you go into the moon spaces valuable you know you need to save as much space as you can and it takes a lot of money to get stuff up to the moon so the less weight i can turn that rocket the more money i'm going to save student what was your answer so your first answer was correct but that added detail kind of gets to why it is even more valuable than what you mentioned ,ok so my answer was that water is heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it in the ships 
230.3,Chris,,exactly and student you got you got to that part i just mentioned with student right that water is heavy so was there anything else in the text the fact that it's on the moon means they don't have to carry it on the rocket and that does make it extremely valuable right so you have mentioned something that is valuable they can what else is valuable is there anything else in the text that you can add of why water might be valuable they don't have to put that water on the rocket ,as well so i read somewhere that they were maybe going to try to put in a moon base by 2020 or like some kind of base and i guess if that was true then like it would be really important to have like not only water but like the other stuff so like what he was saying like with the rocket fuel so i'm thinking like the oxygen and hydrogen on that you can make from water like that would be useful as well 
120.4,Oliver,,"And like you said, I think they are planning on building a base on the moon. as a stage to go further into the solar system like mars so they're going to need fuel they're going to need oxygen they're going to need hydrogen and you're absolutely right water can be used to make those fuels and that can be used for that base they might potentially build that's not referencing the text but i do believe you are right about that student what was your answer to that question ",so my answer was i said no because it's not ready yet 
230.1,Oliver,,okay and and what exactly do you mean when you say it's not ready yet ,like the water first off like the water is ice so you know what i mean like you'd have to make it into something that you could bring and then like they said in the writing they said like later on in it they talked about how that the it would take a lot of time and money to like make it happen and so i thought like you know like maybe someday it might be valuable but like it doesn't seem like it's very convincing right now that there's very good 
210.3,Oliver,,like what you've done you got to that last paragraph where it says that scientists need to come up with a plan for extracting the water so you're right that water isn't ready yet they're going to have to oliverelop a plan to extract water so it can be used and but let's let's consider this hypothetical situation where we do have yes student ,unfortunately we have to go to lunch again we have to watch this but um i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us today and like in particular there was all these things that you were doing with us that i think really helped us along as like students so like not only did you make sure that we used evidence from the text but you also really asked us lots of questions about like our thinking and you listen like really closely as we explained how we got to our answer you took all this time for us to explain our ideas and like i don't think class ever felt rushed like you know class like yeah i think class felt like they had time to do everything and like not only that but like we also felt really value so we all got to really feel like you know like like like i think like we all had good ideas even if we weren't right and then finally you like helped us to explain what we needed to work on and then you gave us ideas on like how we could improve our answers but then you let us improve the answers so it was pretty cool working with thank you so much for being here today 
150.1,Luis,,bye thank you bye i appreciate it thank you alright so class you did really well with your response and i'm with the text but i have a couple questions when to help us further our knowledge and understanding of the texts are you class ready ,excuse me teacher 
150.1,Luis,,yes ,um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,whoo that's fabulous maybe you can help us understand even more about space so stay with this class you might be able to help us ,okay 
120.2,Jazmin,,all right so here's my first question what tools and equipment did you see that the astronauts were using in space miss student ,i saw that they used to small machine 
230.1,Jazmin,,do you remember what that machine was ,no 
120.2,Farrah,,well do you think that you could maybe find what machine you're talking about inside your text miss student i saw that your hand was raised what what kind of toll or equipment did they use ,have i said that they use the microscope 
230.1,Farrah,,awesome what is the microscope d ,is when you can look at things that are like really really small 
140.1,Farrah,,so like an ant ,yeah yeah just like an aunt or something like that 
140.1,Farrah,,can i look at something that's smaller than and because i didn't see an am with my eyes ,i'm walking yeah yeah like in science class we look at like these little bitty um oh i don't remember the names of it but we look at things that are like little bitty teeny teeny thing 
140.1,Oliver,,oh like organisms ,yeah like an amoeba also have an hour with a cold amoeba 
120.4,,,oh they can ask you this ,um i i mean i guess i can see it on the microscope we 
120.2,Jazmin,,see we have to use a microscope to be able to see those okay so was there any other equipment that we used ,excuse me i see i see more words in the sentence but i still don't understand why my answer is wrong 
430.2,Jazmin,,you're answer isn't specific enough about what the details of the small machine so there was a small machine used but what exactly was that small machine used for didn't they give us an name ,yeah is they said he was caught the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Jazmin,,who don't want an orbiter what did it say that we did with it ,they said it lands at the south pole and looks for ice to pass it and a large polar crater 
210.4,Chris,,oh well hmm if you have that machine and you have a microscope are you class thinking that we're going to be looking for a big pond of water or are we going to be looking for water that is extremely small i see some hands shaking and ,yeah i see what you're saying um i guess we wouldn't look for a big pond of water with a microscope because we can see that 
210.4,Chris,,right so do you think based off of what you class just told me that are you going to see water that is in large areas or are we looking for little bitty areas of water is a main full of water ,when i read it i sort of put the craters were full of water 
130.1,Chris,,mm hmm but what miss student just read and what's advantages told us it makes me think that there might not be full of water that we can see what do you class think ,i don't know you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks shoots 
210.3,Jazmin,,they do use those and article even talks about using those different things but the water when you think about water on the moon are you thinking about oceans or are you thinking about those small those craters filled up with small amounts of water ,oh well definitely thinking about the craters i'm student i don't remember what did you say about the craters oh 
210.4,All,,well let's look at paragraph three reading is the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so from that scene it's are we going to look at large bodies of water ,no 
110.1,Luis,,right so we're looking at microscopic micro being small the reason why you have to use a microscope you can't see it with your naked eye but student you brought up a great point they use other equipment to like oxygen tanks and there's another one do you class remember what the other equipment that they used so you class are completely right about the winner equipment and the microscope pursuits ,face masks they use masks true to green 
230.1,Luis,,whoa man so hmm why do you think that they have to use mass to breathe on the moon ,cash because there isn't the same kind of air that we breathe here so we can't breathe that era there 
140.1,Oliver,,oh who knows what the periodic element is for oxygen so you might know what that is what is oxygen for what we breathe i don't know okay so on the periodic element table there is owed to that stands for oxygen water is h two o mr oliveron ,yeah i'm sorry to interrupt you miss i burnt i think i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch so thanks for working with us 
140.1,All,,you're welcome ,okay bye 
120.4,Luis,,alright class so where we left off we were talking about and the periodic element table and mr student in your response to this second question do you remember what you said about the water ,um let me see but i did want you to i just want to remind you my dad is an astronaut okay let's see what i said water can be split into two parts 
230.1,Luis,,what were those two parts that you said ,hydrogen and oxygen 
130.2,Luis,,okay so where we left off we were talking about the elements and water in the element periodic table is h2o so mm hmm if you can split water up into two elements like you said how can you and mr student that said that they had to use oxygen tanks come up with what the astronauts could use water on the main for ,um okay so f fair water is h2o all you're saying hydrogen and oxygen mm hmm and you said that student said oxygen tank okay 
130.2,Luis,,water on the moon be valuable by using what you and mr student and mr student you can talk to student and see how good your response and student just wanted to work together to help astronauts ,okay so so i was talking about the meeting debrief and you said that to student and you're talking about them needing to drink on okay so i mean that makes me think you know like water is important to breathe them to drink wait but that's we don't we don't breathe water um okay um no we don't breathe water but we do breathe oxygen okay okay so if water gets like split up into on hydrogen and oxygen then okay help me out student okay so we can drink the water and we can break the water okay so then that's as that the answer was ms abernathy 
120.4,Jazmin,,you are so close and i love how you class are trying to think about this so let me help you with this okay you're telling me that i can split both of these things up to us and help benefit the astronauts when they go to the moon we do drink water because we have to have it for our bodies but we breathe oxygen mr student you said that those two elements are can be broken apart so hydrogen and oxygen think about them being separate now so your water molecules are now broken apart you're left with hydrogen and oxygen what can the astronaut use miss student what do you think ,well i was thinking about the water can use you can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon 
210.3,Jazmin,,okay well what do we know that the moon doesn't have ,of plants 
210.3,Jazmin,,right what are we trying to make by student tanks and luis's two elements oh ,it doesn't have enough water to grow things 
210.4,Jazmin,,Breathe in. what did you just breathe in ,oxygen 
210.4,Jazmin,,but guess what the moon does not have ,it doesn't have oxygen 
210.3,Jazmin,,so is it going to have a moon garden ,no that could be something valuable 
120.1,Chris,,so mr student mr student i want you to keep thinking and miss to it would definitely be valuable but not something that is feasible on that moon student i want you to think about the microscope again because i really loved how you were able to tell me that a microscope is used for something i can't see so ,"Okay, yeah, I remember where that was cuz i encircled it before okay so miss abernathy i was thinking and okay so water can be broken down into parts hydrogen and oxygen the oxygen a brief um what what do we use the hydrogen for "
130.2,Farrah,,oh i think it takes can someone find it let me see ,okay um so in paragraph three is where it talked about this the microscope and 
210.4,Farrah,,macroscopic right yeah so let's think about this macroscopic is it going to be very heavy ,no no 
210.4,Farrah,,cuz it's right but think about when you go to the grocery store and you buy two gallons of water is that heavy ,yeah yeah my mom always makes me carry the groceries inside and my arms are always like hurting so much 
210.3,Farrah,,so hmm is this patient very large ,ah i think it's got to be pretty big yeah maybe 
210.3,Farrah,,maybe but do you think they had to have a lot of equipment on there ,um yeah to go to space i figure you got to have a lot of stuff 
210.3,Farrah,,i would tell you so do you think that they would have enough space for gallons and gallons of heavy water or do you think we could use something on the moon ,okay okay thinking about that they wouldn't might not have enough space because i got a bunch of stuff 
120.3,Oliver,,do me a favor i want you to look at paragraph five ,okay one word or can be useful and other ways okay um water can be broken down into parts hydrogen and oxygen and i swear i swear i'm password student said astronauts could breathe oxygen can we say that one already the oxygen 
130.2,Oliver,,now now you class have not but you class were so close so have mr student and history student out death ,okay so so it sounds that water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and and that it says that i should not breathe oxygen and that's important 
120.4,Oliver,,mm hmm so that's something valuable about this water on the moon right even though it's microscopic all right miss some vana have you figured out what what they can do ,i'm sorry to interrupt miss abernathy but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thank you for helping us keep thinking more and more and more about the thinking and really making us have to keep on talking to each other and thinking about our ideas 
120.4,Farrah,,you're welcome thank you thank you hey class ,how are you 
120.4,Luis,,good hope you class are and i hope you enjoyed reading our text about the moon is a desert yes student ,um yeah okay so here's the thing i know all about space like i don't think i really need any help i don't really need to be in this class 
150.1,Luis,,okay but um and i appreciate that you know so much about this but at the same time we can always learn more so why don't you stick with us and we'll see what we can discover together ,okay yeah i can stick around 
150.1,Oliver,,okay so um you class were asked the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and you class had some really great responses i just want to talk to you about some of your responses and let's see if we can dig a little deeper that work ,that sounds great 
230.1,Farrah,,okay so um miss student you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely what do you know about a microscope ,so a microscope is like something that you like you use to see something that's really small 
140.1,Farrah,,yes yes you do do you know anywhere else that they might use a microscope ,like well we use it in like science class yeah like to like look at samples of stuff 
230.2,Chris,,yes correct and and then i loved and student you said that there was craters full of water on the moon can you tell me where in our texts that it said that there was craters full of water on the moon ,um yeah i can do that um okay let's see so um i guess in the i guess in paragraph one it says that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters um and then like in paragraph two it it says that the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
210.4,Chris,,okay so let me ask you to close your eyes and think and draw a picture in your mind of what you think a crater looks like is it small is it big how are you picturing it ,um i guess it could be a couple like it could be any size because depending on like how how big it is like it could be bigger or it could be small 
230.3,Jazmin,,okay so with your eyes closed and you've got that picture of the craters in your mind i'm going to read you this paragraph okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic and student told us that microscopic means you have to look through a microscope to see it meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so what did you class see in your mind when i read that student you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ,so i guess what i saw was like that the moon is really like a desert like it's really dry and there's just a little bit of water there i guess that's kind of what i saw 
210.3,Jazmin,,yeah i like that student do you still feel like it would be craters full of water on there do you think it's gonna be a little bit less than what you said ,"well because it sounds like i guess it sounds like there's a little less water but there's not that much water but there's just a little bit of water Actually, I have a question. So if it sounds like then that we needed to use the microscope, but so is my answer wrong. Like, did they not use the small machine? "
230.2,Jazmin,,okay so we're going to i was coming to you miss student and you said that they sent a small machine they did send a small machine but can you find in that paragraph why they sent that small machine and what it was used for ,so in paragraph two it says that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this machine and it was like the lunar orbiter was looking for ice 
110.2,Chris,,but is that the only thing that they sent the only thing that they used hmm i suppose it's in a large polar crater right okay now your answer is correct they did use that equipment to see if there was ice deposit ,"i guess not i guess they must have used all of them like different like the microscop and the lunar orbiter Um, yeah. I have a question, like so. My dad took me to NASA. And we saw that like astronauts have to use like space suits and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff like, um, do they, do they like, do they have to use that stuff, didn't they have to use that to discover the water? "
210.3,Chris,,they will if as if an astronaut went to the moon they definitely would have to but when we look at this this text do we have evidence that an astronaut or a person went to the moon or was it machines ,oh okay yeah i guess they don't really i guess they don't really say 
410.2,Oliver,,mr student talks about how they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in our texts but it doesn't say anything about oxygen tanks do they do use them yes but not in this text ,um yeah so um unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us today and i really wanted to thank you for hor having us listen to each other's answers closely because we don't always really like have a chance to listen to each other really closely and it was really nice the way that you like had us listen to each other and try to learn from each other so just like thank you so much because that doesn't always happen thank you 
410.2,Farrah,,more than welcome thank you class for hanging out with me ,thank you yeah we can hear you 
410.2,Luis,,all right class can class hear me okay okay so real quick we're going to take a quick look at your responses to these selection um class remember what your answers where you came up with ,yeah yeah um but i have a quick question 
410.2,Luis,,yes student ,okay so i can know like all about space and um i don't think i really need help like i don't think i really need to be in this class 
110.1,Luis,,you don't well i'm again this is a more of a discussion based exercise so maybe you have something you can contribute to this class ,yeah okay i see that 
120.4,Farrah,,okay so real quick back to the last question student can you repeat the answer in that you came up with for this ,oh yeah okay so basically you just need a scientific a tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.1,Jazmin,,okay now in the test we did hear about how you might need a microscope to view this this these water molecules right now the question is asking for the tool that we use for this you might want to take another guess at the tool used to get that to get those microscopic images yes student ,so i think that it was the small machine that they sent that's what they used 
120.3,Jazmin,,okay so yes they used a small machine does class class have the specific name of the machine if you class have your text handy i would use it ,the lunar orbiter in paragraph twol 
150.1,Farrah,,lunar orbiter right correct this is the that's what we were looking for does class agree with this any responses yes student ,okay so i'm actually wondering like why is my answer wrong 
210.2,Farrah,,with your answer is not wrong well you had the right idea about the microscope about the microscopic water molecules but if you look closely at the question it was asking what the tool was to get that sample your answer was the tools to see it you had the right idea right right ,gotcha so they used 
210.2,Oliver,,student you had your hand up ,so they used lunar orbiter 
130.3,Chris,,yes ,yes they use the lunar orbiter to discover it and then they use the microscope to study i think is that right okay that makes a lot of sense that makes a lot of sense um yeah but i'm okay i have a question 
130.3,Chris,,yes ,okay so i went to nasa and with my dad and i know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff to go up into space like they didn't did they not use that stuff to to discover the water 
130.1,Chris,,in a way yes but this is also why science questions are a little tricky if you look back at the discussion question it's looking for the specific tool or oliverice specifically used for that purpose each each oliverice has a particular purpose it is designed for for example like you said the oxygen tanks the question was looking for the specific oliverice us to find that one doesn't mean that all the other stuff is a used it just means that's not the is the specific item that they were looking for what are the oxygen tanks usually designed for class know yes they did use oxygen tanks to find water you know but that was not exactly the purpose that those oxygen tanks were designed for ,well they're they're yeah they're designed so you can you can breathe in space 
210.1,Chris,,right so they used to help people to breathe air to breathe in space but is that the specific oliverice used to find the microscopic water samples ,no no that that was the the lunar orbiter 
410.1,Jazmin,,right so even though it wasn't even though that they didn't use the oxygen takes to help them in their mission to find those samples it's not the specific tool used to get to the water to get those samples that's what the question was asking yes student ,unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us and especially i wanted to thank you you were so clear with helping us to understand like what we were looking for and we were able to really listen to each other's answers really closely and you made sure that that class had a chance to talk which was awesome because we don't always get a chance to talk during class so thank you so much because i think we all really learned a lot from from each other thanks to you too thank you so much 
410.1,Oliver,,hope you class enjoy our lunch ,hi how are you doing today 
410.1,Oliver,,good how is class doing ,great excited to work with you 
410.1,Luis,,yes student ,yeah so i don't think that i need to be in this class because i know like everything that there is to know about space all that stuff already 
110.3,Luis,,well it's always good to go back and review things that you've learned and maybe you can help some of the other students because for some students this might be their first time learning about space ,okay yeah i can do that 
120.4,Farrah,,okay does class else have any questions before we begin okay now i believe you class have been reading an article on water on the moon you class want to share your responses to this article ,sure we can do that um okay so i said you need a microscope to do the water 
230.2,Farrah,,okay so a microscope to find the water okay yeah okay would you mind reading a section of the passage where you found this answer ,um yeah i can do that let's see um i said the water they found is microscopic meaning you would be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a special tool called a microscope to look really close 
130.2,Chris,,so what other kinds of equipment would you class say that you would need to find water on the moon other than a microscope yes student ,you'd need spacesuits and like stuff for astronauts like i've been to nasa so i know that you have to use all that stuff 
130.2,Jazmin,,"okay okay so looking at those yes you wouldn't need those for space exploration Does anybody have any ideas, Jazmin. ",i said the small machine but i'm not quite sure why my answer is wrong 
230.2,Jazmin,,okay small machine okay let's see here okay so let's take a look at the text could you share with the class the section that mentioned this tool ,okay so in paragraph two and it says nasa send this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay so what so class what would you tell me the purpose of the lunar orbiter would be based on the text yes student ,like is it i mean i guess it's to find the water to like you know what i mean like to go get the water 
110.4,Chris,,correct student ,well i guess i still am thinking like i went to nasa so i know that the scientists like us all this equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that kind of stuff 
210.4,Oliver,,okay they do us all a lot of tools like that now for this particular article that we're looking at we are focusing on the specific action of locating water now we've talked about how we we have this small lunar module right and this is one of those tools that you probably saw at nasa student when you went to go visit this lunar module again just like student said was sent to the moon to find ice deposits and large and large polar craters this would help them find water now is there any convincing evidence that you class can think of the water on the moon could be valuable ,mmm hmm actually we have to go to lunch but thank you so much for working with us 
210.4,Luis,,hey start simulation students welcome back now for yes student ,yeah you know ah i just want to remind you that my dad is an astronaut 
110.3,Farrah,,okay all right now that could actually help out with this next question now the next question we were covering is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable you class have any ideas from the reading that you want to share with the class and needs and these can be things that you're dad can use being an astronaut okay we'll start over here with student ,um yeah okay so i said no no not for a long time 
230.1,Farrah,,okay you want to explain that ,um yeah so like you know like is there convincing evidence that of water on the moon could be valuable i don't think it will be valuable like now cuz you know cuz we don't we don't know how to i guess we know how would you i mean like it would be really hard to use it so i don't think it's valuable right now 
120.4,Oliver,,okay now so so you're thinking we may not have the technology yet okay yeah okay so we'll we'll we'll come back to that here in a minute first let's hear student what's your response ,yeah i kind of had a similar thought that basically no it's not ready yet you know what i mean like that we can't we can't just use the water because it's all ice you know 
120.4,Chris,,okay great student ,um yeah so i would say water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships 
110.1,Jazmin,,okay so we have it's heavy and we have the we believe us not valuable yet student ,i think it would be valuable because astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and like you can't survive without water and i was thinking basically what you could do is you could use the water to grow things you could have a garden on the moon in the craters 
110.2,Luis,,okay so that could be a one use of water student ,um yeah like water can be split into two parts it can be you know hydrogen and oxygen 
230.2,Luis,,right okay now do you want to describe where in the text you found this ,on yeah yeah i can do that okay so let's see um in paragraph five moon water could be useful in other ways and water can be broken down to two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
210.4,Luis,,and now what do you think we can use those two for hydrogen and oxygen there's a clue in paragraph five yes student ,um yeah i think like okay you could use it or okay well you could breathe it um and then it says oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel 
210.4,Luis,,what was that ,as well rocket fuel 
110.1,Chris,,rocket fuel so rocket fuel will be a use and student you could drink it you can use it to grow things student ,on yeah i guess i just wanted to say this like water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and they both are important 
210.4,Oliver,,okay and like student said oh we can use them for rocket fuel it is very heavy going back to your first statement so transporting it would be something that we would have to do now student and student you class mentioned that during our discussion that the technology might not be ready for that yet but however there are some possibilities that we can use water this question in particular is asking is there is there convincing evidence of water alone can be valuable water can be valuable yes we do have some olivereloping to do with the technology to be able to move and transport the water and to split those chemicals up to form the rocket fuel see all these are good points because this allows us to go back into this paragraph and look at the clues that they have left in this article to help us find an answer to this discussion to this discussion question okay yes there are a lot of uses for water day now is the technology ready i would say i would say probably no but there are some uses that we could use water for in the future even for some now we would just have to use technology to make that happen yes student ,and we unfortunately have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us and especially i wanted to thank you for really listening for answers and really making us feel like 
210.4,Luis,,okay so we have just read a text about water on the moon yes student ,um yeah so i i know all about space so i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know all this stuff 
220.1,Luis,,well guess what we're going to learn some new things today you might find something that you didn't know ,okay that sounds cool 
120.2,Farrah,,and i have your answers so student you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close did you see any other tools that you may need alright so we are going i had asked the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,whoa i guess i kind of like um no i just saw the microscope 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay right did class else see anything else in the text that you might use so we have a microscope student ,basically what i thought is its a small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,a small machine can you you know what that small machine called can you go back in the text and fine what that small machine is called ,yeah okay it's called the number 2 paragraph 2 so nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
130.2,Oliver,,alright so lunar orbiter and a microscope can we find any other tools that scientists use think that's it so now we know they have student you remember what i tools the scientist used ,um yeah so i guess they used the microscope and the lunar orbiter is that right 
110.1,Farrah,,with job yes right so you all now know here student ,i have a quick question 
110.1,Farrah,,alright student ,oh yeah i i was just wondering like is my is my was my answer right or was it wrong 
130.1,Farrah,,well it was right you had one thing but then we had to find the other tools that scientists used so you had it almost right we just had a fun one more tool ,gotcha 
130.1,Chris,,yes student ,"yes so i was just wondering like so like here's what i know is that like i went to nasa with my dad and he like we went we looked all over the place and i know that that like you have to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots and stuff like that but is that is that not part of the answer Oh, so it's like whatever's in the reading, ok. That makes sense. "
130.1,Luis,,yes yes student ,i'm still kind of wondering about the like so did they did they not have to use like did the astronauts have to use um did they not leave the the lunar orbiter did they stay in the in the lunar orbiter like how did they use the microscope 
110.1,Luis,,so i'm not real sure we would have to read more on that and see exactly how they used it and what they felt maybe they discovered with it so we might read another article and see what we can find out ,oh okay 
110.1,Jazmin,,student ,i just wanted to thank you for working with us today thank you very much for especially for like really just like helping us to understand and be really kind in how thoughtful you are with sort of like talking to us today so thank you so much 
110.1,Luis,,thank you all alright so now you have read water on the moon and you have answered your question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon so i've seen each of your answers so student you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to work really closely yes student ,excuse me teacher i don't think i should be in this class i already know all about space 
120.1,Farrah,,all right we're going to learn some more stuff okay so you hang with us and we'll learn all kinds of new things so student okay you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i love how you found that a microscope was used to find water but what other tool was using the story to help find water on the moon ,oh i don't know 
130.2,Chris,,so see let's see if we can look back and find the answer in the story so if we look back in the story under paragraph three it says that means the moon is still drive and the desert dries desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning it wouldn't be able to see see if you look straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely So that's where you found about the microscope. nasa send a small machine called a lunar lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon south pole and look for us deposits in a large polar crater these deposits are very small alright so from what i read what other item that they need on the moon so maybe is there somebody student would you like to help her out ,yes had to be from the craters the craters for the water 
130.1,Farrah,,so let's look back in the story and see if we can find those tools so there's two tools okay so you you said that they found the crater for water so student helped us by saying that there was a matter microscope but we're still trying to figure out what other tool even do you have any audio ,teacher i don't understand why my answers wrong 
120.4,Farrah,,what was your answer ,i mean this is me student i looked at over and i don't understand why why the microscope is raw 
210.4,Jazmin,,ok so the microscope is it wrong but we've answered one part of the question so now we want to it says what other what tools so we found one tool we want to find the other tool so microscope was correct but we want to find the other tool also in our story so even you had said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks so but we want to look back in the article and say what tools they used on the moon you use those so student you said that nasa spit seeing a small machine i love your answer that can you look back and tell us what that small machine is called ,okay 
520.1,Oliver,,it's a lunar orbiter and we want to make sure that we're using everything to answer the questions awesome alright so student was back in the story and she found that the other tool is called a lunar orbiter so you all did an awesome job of looking back in the story so now that you've figured out the full answer what will you do next time when you're looking back in the text ,"look at the story again to find a full answer Okay, well thanks teacher, um, it's time for us to go to lunch. Thanks for working with us. "
120.2,Luis,,right thank you bye wow start simulation responses to your questions or to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon go ahead student what's your question ,um well i was just excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.1,Oliver,,well awesome i'm glad that you know all about space maybe you should can share some other things with your friends today while we're talking okay so so student you said you needed a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i lock that answer all right dave you said you circle the same thing as student and here's an use its scientists film craters full of water on the moon so we're going to look back and we're going to see if we can find it in the text all right men student you said nasa send a small machine and then student you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks alright so so student i love how you said you needed a scientific coats tool called a microscope let's look back in the text and see if we can find the answer to our question so you have one of the items we they needed to find water on the moon let's see if we can find the other item that i needed on the moon in the so let's see if we can find the answer in our story so let's look back and see what we can find story so student said nasa send a small machine okay so i love how you did that so paragraph two says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater that means the moon is still draw than the driest desert on earth and then paragraph three this is where student got her answer the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely can you help me figure out what tools that scientists needed to find water on the moon can you tell me one of those items alright so student can you help me out after reading the story again ,microscope 
210.4,Jazmin,,alright and student can you tell me the other item that they needed awesome alright a microscope okay so let's continue to look maybe student can help you out student you said that i sent a small machine do you remember what the name of that small machine was ,i guess i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.2,Jazmin,,it's not wrong so you said you are 100 correct and it said nasa send a small machine i just would like the answer what the machine is called student do you want to try to help her out to but it's asking what the name of the tool is so let's go back and see if we can find what the name of the tool is even ,see if you can look the shark oh i see if i'm a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
520.1,Jazmin,,"Awesome. So, so he's a lunar orbiter and a microscope in order to find water on the moon. Alright so next time. so now that we have talked about this how has this changed your thinking alright so next time go back and look in the story to find your answer about the story ",i still think it's interesting story um i guess i just needed more words in my answer 
110.1,Oliver,,Right so y'all did an awesome job. ,okay oh thank you so much teacher for really helping us by by telling us the things that we did do well and then i'm like helping us to look back at the story again to find our answer 
120.2,Luis,,hi class so what did you class think for the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon ,i thought it was pretty easy excuse me i'm shouldn't be and this class i already know a lot about space 
120.4,Luis,,oh whoa whoa what did you respond to that question ,well i said that um you know that they could use um maybe that's uh 
120.4,Luis,,huh ,I'm oxygen tanks. 
210.4,Luis,,close i bet you they didn't use oxygen tanks while they were there maybe we can take a closer look at the reading to and get some other feedback ,okay 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah what did you think ,well i probably use the microscope arm because it says that thing they let me see what it says it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close 
310.1,Oliver,,so you found that directly in the text that's really good ,yeah so i don't know why why i'm here honestly cause i gave an answer from the text 
150.1,Jazmin,,everybody's answer was correct huh yeah i sometimes class is just in groups to kind of talk more about it doesn't mean you did anything wrong but there's some answers that maybe can be just give more information to them what did you think ,well i don't understand why my answers wrong um cuz i pull mine from the text to 
110.2,Jazmin,,i don't think your answer was necessarily wrong at all it was a small machine ,so so how come i'm in this class 
150.1,Jazmin,,the point in this class was to just elaborate more on you class his answer is not that you class answered anything wrong at all just to kind of think more about it ,okay 
150.1,Farrah,,student what did you think ,oh well i had the same answer is def so um i know the teacher said that that we we like you said we've got to elaborate on our answers but i used i used all of the like the words from the text and she said we have to use evidence from the text and i did that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i mean it's right there so i don't i don't know why why i'm in this class either 
120.3,Farrah,,why don't we all take a look at number two on the worksheet good somebody read that for me ,and i repeat it i'm nasa to small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate lunar orbiter south pole for look for ice deposits this is deposits are very small scientists that have that window of the top layer of a moon surface into about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink and 
110.2,Oliver,,so did you hear the beginning of what you said there was a specific name of a little tool that they used to investigate in water the lunar orbiter yeah so that was definitely it was a form of a microscope it was a small machine i'm sure that they didn't use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like student said but there was that one little piece in the text that gave the specific name of the tool and that's what this question was specifically looking for but you class all gave answers that were very valid ,okay so you're saying i'm over answers okay but we just had to write more 
150.1,Chris,,yeah definitely writing more and reading very close in the text and looking for because that was a very small piece of information that was very easy to skim over and it was definitely tricky to find and it would maybe take even reading it a couple times to find that ,i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks in suits to i know a lot about equipment but i didn't see that part 
110.1,Oliver,,yeah and that happens ,well i can see that it's time for us to go to lunch and i know it was really sharp but i do appreciate how you told us that we have we just have to look and look again and look even closer at the story to find more information i guess so thank you 
110.1,Oliver,,of course ,okay class say hi 
120.2,Luis,,class hi class so today we're going to talk about after the reading do you think that water is a valuable resource to astronauts student ,yeah okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
120.4,Luis,,okay do you want to share with us what you thought is water a valuable resource ,yeah okay so um i said water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
210.3,Luis,,yeah that's right water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen do you think that they would use both parts one part what do you think ,i think they use both parts 
230.3,Luis,,does class know what they use you either the hydrogen oxygen for within the water no let's think about oxygen student you said about the last question that they use oxygen tanks right on the moon ,yeah right 
130.3,Jazmin,,maybe they could use the oxygen for the oxygen tanks ,yeah that makes sense that's okay so then that's that would be helpful i did too 
120.4,Chris,,yeah so that's one reason does class have any other reason that they thought that water was a valuable resource ,i did 
120.4,Chris,,will do student and student you can go afterwards ,okay so i said all that water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore 
130.3,Chris,,yeah that's really smart class drinks water right you need water to stay hydrated so if they could just pick it up on the moon then they wouldn't have to bring it with them and then they could maybe even bring something else that they liked maybe like a favorite stuffed animal or something ,i don't think the astronauts are bringing stuffed animals they're like grown ups and scientists and stuff 
120.4,Jazmin,,never know student what do you think okay so um ,hmm okay let's see i wrote yes i astronauts should stay and drink the water and stay hydrated oh like how you said you can't survive without water 
230.3,Jazmin,,yeah so you class kind of had the same idea that they have to bring water anyways so they could just pick some up while they're there ,so it me and student had some good ideas then how come we're in this class 
150.1,Jazmin,,is just a class to talk about the questions they don't mean anything specific ,oh i thought we were here cuz our our answers weren't weren't right 
220.1,Jazmin,,no we just wanted to talk about the answers and kind of see where you class got your answers from ,so then mine is good 
110.2,Chris,,yeah it was a good answer ,i don't have to change mine either 
220.1,Jazmin,,well we're all gonna collectively talk to each other if you wanted to add an aspect of another persons answer as well you class could totally add to it it's all about getting different parts of it ,oh okay i'm still confused 
230.1,Farrah,,mmmhmm about what ,i had a different answer from from them but if they're all right then the my answers right too 
120.4,Farrah,,well let's let's talk about your answer now what did you say water is a valuable resource or not ,i said no not for a long time 
230.1,Farrah,,not for a long time why do you think not for a long time ,because the story says that it'll take a lot of time and a lot of money um and they'd have to build new equipment and do you think this will be a good investment so i said no 
210.3,Farrah,,mm hmm that's definitely an aspect of it um so do you think that it could be used as oxygen or water for the astronauts ,i mean yeah that makes that makes sense what the said exactly 
110.2,Oliver,,yeah no that's a very well olivereloped answer ,um well i i said it wasn't ready yet so i said no too 
210.2,Chris,,mm hmm so you and student had the same idea it's kind of a two part question if you think about it because you're weighing out what would be valuable about the water to the astronauts like student and student and student brought up the idea of oxygen and you need water but then you and student thought about what it would take to get that so you your opinion on it is whether or not it would be worth it to do it but as long as we gathered all of the information about the values of it then your answer is correct whether or not you think it is or not and so some would say yes and some people would be no ,you know i i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
110.3,Chris,,wow that's pretty soon that's not very far away at all ,right it's all so maybe they if they have a base then they could have water there 
110.1,Oliver,,yeah ,so that we all did really well i thought that i thought that i'm wrong since you said that they were right okay 
130.1,Oliver,,no i think you all helped each other come to a big conclusion with a bunch of answers that you all might not have thought of after you read it for the first time it's nice to talk to other people and get ideas right ,yeah well well thanks teacher it's time for us to call but i wanted to say thanks for asking asking class about our thinking thinking that lead our answer so it it felt good to take some time to explain my idea so you know i felt valued 
130.1,Oliver,,yeah i loved hearing about it ,thanks okay bye bye okay 
130.1,Luis,,doing today ,i feel good i'm excuse me but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
220.1,Luis,,but I do love that you brought your outside knowledge into the conversation. for what i'm kind of hoping from you is that you search them a text and kind of show me what you learned from the text so for this class we're just going to focus on some of the things that we read and how we can change our answers to better fit the reading does that sound good student ,yeah 
110.2,Farrah,,okay great so i'm just going to go one by one so student i just want to start with you i really did enjoy your answer you really picked up from the text and you really picked the object which was a microscope and you basically kind of described what it's used for outside of the text and you were using language that i really appreciate it And ,thanks to 
420.2,Oliver,,welcome and then student i really liked your answer to that you also were thinking about the microscope i would have loved if you give us another example or maybe added on to mars venus thought i definitely did like your answer and how you were you were going with it ,"yeah i mean i just happen to have the same answer as it wasn't i didn't i didn't copy offer anything extra she said horse first i'm sorry i was like oh well that's the same thing i found in a story to Hi, I'm so on while i'm looking it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely on i mean i guess are you saying that i should i shut off i could say but sometimes above that one to the waters founders microscopic "
420.2,Jazmin,,"Why they're using microscopes, like when you're reading the text. Why do you think they're using microscopes. Do you think it helped them to find the craters. Do you think it made it easier to look for water on the moon, just your thought process. Yes, Jazmin. ",i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,i would have loved if you just said what the machine was or just talked more about what the machine does okay so your answer wasn't completely wrong you did mention how nasa did send a small machine we did read that it's called a moon lunar orbiter just said what the machine was or just talked more about what the machine does we're just going to try and adjust the sentences just a little bit i would love for you to use the actual your your answer was not completely wrong and that it investigates so that's why nasa sends it up there ,okay 
210.4,Jazmin,,so do you have another question ,yeah i guess i'm just thinking okay so then what what are the words that i was supposed to add like i'm masses i should put the whole sentence matheson to small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
150.1,Jazmin,,They use it so that they can see what's going on on the moon that does that make sense student ,I think so. I think i think you're saying that um but i should say more stuff um but my my answer is too short and i needed to say more more stuff like that 
420.2,Jazmin,,yeah like we should fill in the blanks just to make our sentence a little meteor ,okay i guess 
420.2,Chris,,student ,i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment mike oxygen tanks masks and suits to 
420.3,Chris,,Classmates said don't know so your background knowledge really does help. we're looking for what's actually mentioned in the text like the microscope or the lunar orbiter so you can talk about your background knowledge just make sure you add a little bit of what is in the text that way i know that you understand what we're talking about ,was my answer right 
220.1,Oliver,,yeah your answer was right that the scientists did find craters full water on the moon you're right so you're in this class because i wanted you all to kind of work together and hear each other's answers and kind of tweak them a little bit and improve them and adjust your sentences to just show that you understand what the text is saying i just wanted you class to use examples exactly from the text that way i know that you class had an easy time reading ,okay well i'm oh sorry student i just looked at four o'clock and it's actually it's time for us to go to lunch i wanted to say thank you teacher for giving us specific suggestions and hopeful ideas on how each of us can improve our answers okay 
220.1,Luis,,okay i think i'm ready start simulation how's class doing today ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
220.1,Luis,,okay well today we're going to experiment with different kinds of groups and if you know a lot about space then maybe you can help your table mates that we probably don't know as much as you do it sounds good to you student ,okay yeah okay i guess that's fine okay 
220.1,Jazmin,,good to hear so today i put you on a class because we're going to focus on today's lesson which is about scientific tools that are used on the moon and other than that we're going to talk about whether the moon has valuable resources for people to be able to live on the moon there was a short reading and i gave you class two questions just to remind you what the questions are i'll read them out loud for you class the first question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon yes student ,the teacher said that we would only work on question number one right now 
220.1,Jazmin,,okay we'll just work on question number one thank you for letting me know so did you class will be time to write down your answers to questions ,yeah we put them down on our tablets to you 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay sounds good can i hear some of your responses ,do you want to hear mine 
120.4,Jazmin,,yes please ,okay i said that nasa a small machine 
210.3,Jazmin,,okay so when you say nasa send a small machine do you know what the name of it was ,oh the lunar obiter 
420.2,Jazmin,,yes okay so you can always rephrase your sentence to say that nasa sent a little bit over there that way i know that you're using the information that's in the text does that sound good ,okay i can do that 
120.4,Farrah,,does class else want to share they wrote ,oh well i don't understand why my answers wrong 
150.1,Farrah,,okay let's talk about it then what to do right student ,i said you need a scientific microscope to look really closely 
110.2,Farrah,,teacher maybe we can rephrase that what do we use the microscope for do you remember i don't think your answer is wrong we did read that you do need a microscope to look closely at the moon maybe we can rephrase that what do we use the microscope for do you remember ,you yeah to look at really small thing 
110.1,Jazmin,,exactly so we can always write that too i think your answer right now is just as good though good job ,i'm sorry teacher but how can it be right and my answer be great because we have two different answers 
210.4,Oliver,,so you're both right because we read three different parts of the text where they talked about two different equipments that are used on the moon the lunar orbiter is used to investigate what's on the moon and the microscope like student said is used to look at small particles that the lunar orbiter wouldn't really pick up so you're both re they're just used for different things ,i circled the same thing with student so i guess i am right too 
210.3,Oliver,,yeah nor did you notice anything about will you circle anything special about the microscope ,well i noticed that he said the water that they follow those microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it 
210.4,Oliver,,that's a good point so you could always write that to that even though scientists use a microscope there might be so some things that are so small they still can't see ,it can you say that again you're talking kind of fast 
420.2,Oliver,,okay you can always write that even scientists use a microscope ,"Okay, I got it now. "
120.4,Chris,,good i'm student student didn't want to do you want to share yes student ,yeah i was just i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks 
140.1,Chris,,okay thank you for using your outside knowledge to contribute to the conversation do you know what they use oxygen for them suits that your classmates might not ,oh yeah so they use on a breathe because while the oxygen tanks are to breathe because there isn't any oxygen up there in space and then the suits because it's so cool that if if the air touch their skins they would they would freeze to death and then shattered pieces 
120.4,Luis,,thank you thank you for your answer and thank you for explaining in case class didn't know student do you read something different or similar ,actually i wrote about the oxygen tanks too because that equipment and the question as our equipment and so i said you know the equipment that scientists use on them owner oxygen tank 
110.1,Luis,,so good answer to or like how different everyone's answers were and i felt that you all explained what the tools were used for in a perfect way ,so i'm right too it could be oxygen tanks or microscopes or lunar orbiter 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah so all these tools contribute to scientists being able to discover if the moon is truly habitable which means that people can live there for humans like us usually they try to find the similarities between the earth and the moon try to see if class from earth can be able to live in the moon yes student ,i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll see you later bye 
210.4,All,,high class ,high 
210.4,Luis,,all right yes student do you have a question ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Chris,,no worries so even though i know you class all know lots about space and student you may know more about space than class else in the class but i just want to talk with you class a little bit more specifically about the texts that we just read to make sure that class understands the water on the moon text sound okay ,yeah i also know about space as i went to nasa with my dad 
150.1,Luis,,awesome well that's really cool and the fact that you class know so much about space already means you definitely have some good background knowledge that you can connect what do you think was the most important piece of equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon to the text but i want to talk a little bit about how class responded after reading the text and i just want to kind of ask one more time ,i think the most important equipment was the microscope 
150.1,Luis,,okay ,i've got my tone 
210.4,Jazmin,,awesome so in the texts that you class read they definitely mentioned the microscope at the very end there but i want to kind of make it a little more clear for class because the microscope you would need a microscope to look really closely at the water that they found on the moon but that's not actually what these scientists use to find the water if one of us went into space and we wanted to look at the moon water we would need a microscope however the scientists actually used the lunar orbiter to find the water so this tool it was mentioned in the text and i want to see it does class remember what was said in the text about the lunar orbiter yes student ,oh i don't remember what i said in the text but that was kind of my answer so i don't have to say my my answers wrong 
150.1,Jazmin,,okay no worries so student you said that nasa send a small machine to the moon right yeah so that is a pretty good response because the lunar orbiter is definitely a small machine and it is what they sent to the moon and student i just want to tell you that your answer wasn't wrong so i just want you to go a little further in your explanation and use some evidence from what you read about does that make sense ,i have to i have to write more stuff in my answer 
420.2,Jazmin,,so i just want your answer to be a little more specific and sometimes that does mean writing more stuff ,okay 
110.1,Luis,,right so looking at the other responses i'm student i want to talk about your response you said that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right ,a hack 
110.3,Luis,,and that is a really awesome response because that is definitely true scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they would need those on the moon and i know you said you know a lot about space so that is a very good response ,"Um, yeah i mean we're we're reading about the mon and so i i wrote about em and an astronaut equipment and so i'm like well this is some equipment i know they need on the moon "
410.3,Luis,,yeah no you definitely did and i do like that you used the oxygen tanks as the equipment but in your answer i also would have liked to see you mention the lunar orbiter because that was the big idea of the text that we read and that was the most important piece for specifically finding water on the moon ,yeah i guess so 
150.1,Chris,,um but i think i'm going to talk about chris's response really quickly so student you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon okay if you have any questions let me know ,yeah yeah i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment my oxygen tanks and masks answer 
420.2,Chris,,yeah they definitely do use all of that equipment and that is a great answer student i also just want to make sure similar to student i know that you class have lots of knowledge about space and but when you're answering the discussion questions for the text that we read just try and incorporate something specifically from the text so the text mentions the lunar orbiter so that would have been a good thing to include in your response in addition to what you said about finding craters of water and they're like suits masks and oxygen tanks something specifically from the text so the text mentions the lunar orbiter so that would have been a good thing to include in your response in addition to what you said about finding craters of water and they're like suits masks and oxygen tanks does that make sense ,yeah i think you're saying like okay i gotta i gotta use more more stuff in the text and use what i already know 
510.1,Oliver,,yes that is exactly what i would like and that goes for class not just student so when you're answering these questions try to use what you already know as well as specific information from what we're reading so now dead i talked about your response ,yeah yeah i felt like i did that you know i mean i looked at the question and the question asked about equipment and and asked about like what equipment that they use to discover water and so when i was walking in the in the story and i saw that on microsoft is equipment and we're using a microscope to look at the water so i felt like i get all the right thing i don't know why white minus wrong 
410.3,Oliver,,okay so that is a really good thing to bring up oliveron i appreciate that so again your response isn't wrong you just focus on a different section of the text so you kind of focused on that microscope that was at the very end right uh huh yeah and they definitely do need to use a microscope but the big idea of the story is the lunar orbiter and that that is the most important piece to discovering water on the moon so your answer was very specific and it definitely use information from the text which is really really good uh huh yeah and they definitely do need to use a microscope but the big idea of the story is the lunar orbiter and that that is the most important piece to discovering water on the moon but i also just want to make sure that you're focusing on what the big idea of the whole reading is instead of just one specific part ,i'm a big idea not just one part okay okay well i just looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short but um i i do appreciate that you helped us all kind of look more at the text to try to use more evidence and our answer so thanks for that okay bye 
220.1,Luis,,bye hi class so i pulled you all into a small class because i think you did a really good job in answering our discussion question about the water on the moon texts but i want to work with each of you a little more and just make your responses more academic and a little longer yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.1,Farrah,,yeah you do know a lot about space um and i don't want to say that this class is for people who don't know about space because you all did a really good job but this class is just to work on giving responses to questions from a text so i'm gonna go one by one and give you each some feedback on what you said to the response i'll start with student for our first question you said that scientists use a microscope to look closely and i wanted to say that that was really good and that i liked that you used the specific name of the tool that scientists used make sure that when you are using the specific name of a tool it's the tool that the question is asking for so in this question what equipment was used to discover water on the moon is there another tool you can think of that the scientists used from the text ,well i thought that was the correct tool because it says in the third paragraph that they used it to look really closely at the water and the question is asking about looking at water 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah so you're definitely right they need the microscope to be able to look closely at the water but when they're doing this they might not be doing this on the moon so if you look at the second paragraph can you read the first sentence for me ,okay let me see sorry my my tablets not loading oh give me a second 
210.4,Farrah,,okay ,okay okay so you said the second paragraph 
120.3,Farrah,,yep the first sentence of the second paragraph okay ,nasa sent a small machine to the moon to investigate 
150.1,Jazmin,,"right so in that sentence we can see that the text is using the lunar orbiter as the tool that is actually finding the water But I want you to go a little bit further and be able to say that the microscope would be needed to see the water, but the Lunar orbiter is what found the water. does that make sense yes student ",i don't understand why my answers wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,okay student so you said that nasa sent a small machine right yeah so that is a really good answer and you're definitely correct but i want you to elaborate a little bit more so yes nasa sent a small machine but what was that small machine called ,i guess it was what student just read right the lunar orbiter 
150.1,Jazmin,,right so when we use the term lunar orbiter we're using evidence to support our response and so that's something you want to make sure you're doing because it shows that hey you really know what you're talking about and it also shows that you found your answer from the text does that make sense class ,yeah it makes sense to use that i have to use it okay 
120.4,Luis,,awesome um okay so student i know you are unsure about being in this class can we look at your response ,yeah yeah sure 
130.3,Chris,,"okay so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right Like Farrah, though, I want to push you a little bit further, and while I do like that answer, and I think you could keep that I would want you to add on to it and talk a little bit about the Lunar orbiter. because that is the piece of equipment that ultimately the question wants you to pick out of the text yes student ",and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits yeah 
150.1,Chris,,yeah that's awesome i'm glad that you have that background knowledge of what astronauts use he already knows a lot about space and he learned the astronauts use these specific things so that's great to keep in mind when you're reading the text. but you also want to make sure that when you're answering the question you're specifically using evidence and examples that the text gives you so it's awesome to make connections with your background knowledge but in order to answer a question you want to make sure that it comes from the text does that make sense ,yeah yeah yeah okay but my question did come from the text i mean my answer did 
150.1,Chris,,your answer was that they found craters of water on the moon right yeah yeah and you're definitely correct the scientists in the text they did find craters of water on the moon however again when you look at that question it asks what equipment found those craters of water so that would be similar to student where you just want to make sure that you're using a specific piece of evidence to support what you said when you said that there's craters of water does that make a little more sense ,i mean i guess i can see it for student because she just had to add more the specific name but they didn't say like the more specific name of the craters in the in the story 
130.3,Oliver,,yeah you're right i'm sorry i think i said that in a bit of a confusing way so you want to make sure that you would say scientists found craters of water on the moon and the machine that they used to find these craters was the lunar orbiter yes ,i'm sorry teacher but i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll see you later okay 
230.3,Oliver,,start simulation hi class so i really appreciate you all giving your responses to our second discussion question which was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable so i want to just talk through each of your responses and we'll start with a student this time so you answered that um no the water on the moon is not ready yet correct ,correct 
230.2,Oliver,,okay um so what in the text makes you think that ,ok so when i was reading it and i'm in the last paragraph it says i'm making this plan will take a lot of time and money do you think about you decide and so i'm like well if it's gonna take a lot of time and i mean it's not ready yet 
210.3,Oliver,,right i definitely appreciate that you were able to find exactly where in the text you found your answer is asking could water on the moon be valuable at any point um and so you said no but i'm wondering if you think that the answer could be yes um and why it could be yes ,so why could it be yes i'm thinking 
210.3,Luis,,yes student ,okay um while he's thinking i got this figured out this time so now i'm all good 
230.1,Luis,,okay i'm glad that you're feeling more confident um why do you think you are feeling more confident ,okay because i i get it now that i'm supposed to like you know read the question and then read it and then find the evidence so yeah i think i'm good here 
230.3,Luis,,that's a really good strategy um so in your response you said that water can be split into hydrogen and oxygen right yeah ,straight from the text 
210.3,Farrah,,awesome yes it is um but i do want to ask you while that is from the text does that tell us if the water on the moon is valuable ,oh okay oh okay all right while student is thinking um i had a similar answer to student and so i think i'm still kind of confused 
230.1,Farrah,,okay so student and student you class did have similar answers you class said not ready yet or not for a long time um so where are you confused student ,okay um because it asks is if it's valuable right 
230.1,Farrah,,right ,and so it said okay they would need to study the moon surface and build new equipment so that sounds like it would take a lot of money which if it's not ready then it's not valuable right 
210.2,Farrah,,that's a really good question to ask and that's something that i think all of you should definitely be asking some sort of version of when you're reading so if the water is not ready yet is it not valuable well to me when i think of the word valuable i would say that i think that could be either now or in the future so looking at the question the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable so even though it's not ready yet student do you think that the water on the moon could be valuable in the future so when we see it could be valuable that kind of implies the future ,yeah yeah 
420.1,Farrah,,"you're fully understanding what the questions asking, because that could be makes a big difference from the present to the future. ",okay 
150.1,Oliver,,does that make more sense to you two or are you still confused ,um yeah i think i didn't really look at that word could be so yeah that makes sense 
150.1,Chris,,yes student ,talking about the future i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
140.1,Chris,,that's really cool fact student where did you read that ,me and my dad had been reading this book about aviation and then we went to nasa so there was this whole exhibit about the traveling to the moon and then what their plans are in the future 
420.2,Chris,,yeah that is really cool um and again that's a good example of some background knowledge that you have about the topic and what you could do with that so in your response you could have added something like in another article i read it said that there could be a base on the moon and then connect to the article we're reading now so do you have any idea of how you could do that ,okay okay so there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and so then they won't have to carry the water in the ships anymore so how's that 
420.2,Chris,,pretty good i would maybe just add a little bit about how like you said they're not carrying the water on the ships anymore because they're keeping it at the base that they're going to build on the moon ,yeah yeah yeah okay okay 
150.1,Chris,,does hat makes sense so you're connecting both sets of text with just a few words there ,yeah yeah yeah yeah i think 
150.1,Jazmin,,okay awesome um so student do you have any questions about your response ,well okay i think i did what what student and student didn't do is i answered the question i said yes and then i also did the thing where i i i pulled the evidence from the text so i guess i don't know why mine is wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay so your answer i would not say that your answer is wrong so you said yes water on the moon could be valuable because astronauts drink water that is a very good response and i like that you provided a use for the water that was evidence that you pulled from the text i would probably just expand your response so you could go back and look at the text so in that first paragraph there paragraph four um it says you know future astronauts could drink this water water is heavy and it takes up a lot of room so do you have any idea of how you could connect astronauts drinking water to water being too heavy to put on a spaceship ,okay yeah yeah yeah i have an idea 
120.4,Jazmin,,do you want to share ,you want me to share now okay okay um so yes astronauts could drink the water and because it's heavy they won't have to carry it on the ship they can drink it from the moon 
530.1,Jazmin,,awesome that is a really great response so how did your thinking change there what did you do differently ,well i i use two sentences i use my sentence and then kind of student sentence and then i set it up because in there too 
150.1,Farrah,,yeah so because statements are a really good way to make sure that you have enough evidence to support what you're saying yes student ,well it's time for us to go to lunch but i do want to say i appreciate um how are you kind of explain what each of us needs to work on and how we can improve our answers yeah me too bye bye 
150.1,Luis,,hello class ,hi 
150.1,Luis,,alright so we're in a circle here today just us to go oh yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Farrah,,oh no it's not anything like that i'm sure you all have your own great knowledge of space we're just going to discuss a little bit of how we read and responded to the passage do you class remember the passage about water on the moon ,uh-huh yeah i have it on my tablet right here yeah it's on our tablets on our desk 
120.2,Farrah,,perfect so we're just going to go over so you class get a bit of a more clear understanding of this passage can someone raise their hand and let me know what it was so when you read it you should have known what the equipment was that scientists use to discover water on the moon student ,yeah the equipment was the microscope 
110.1,Jazmin,,exactly that's perfect ,oh but miss teacher i didn't have the microscope i said the equipment was a small machine from paragraph two 
150.1,Jazmin,,yes and that's why we're going to talk about that because when you read a passage sometimes things be hard to understand because they use certain adjectives to describe the machine but the real name of the machine was a microscope so you did a great job finding that it was a small machine student but student was just a little more clear and how she said it was a microscope so does class understand that now from the passage ,um i mean i think so but i okay i'm going to listen more and then i'll see if i have a question 
120.3,Jazmin,,okay perfect that sounds great so the question sometimes can be a little bit hard because you do read so much in the passage but because the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon we only want to answer that question right so in the passage it does say that there there's evidence that water can be found within the moon's polar craters which that's a great piece of knowledge that's something we always want to keep with us but the last passage has our answer in it it says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth so water they found is microscopic meaning you would not be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look real closely ,um 
120.3,Jazmin,,so yes ,oh i still don't understand why my answer is wrong because i i looked in paragraph two and it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,yes and that's great that's a great answer it is a small machine that's what a microscope is but the real word that we want to do to find here was in the last paragraph so we know you're reading everything and making sure you see everything in the paragraphs right so you you caught that first in paragraph two but if you kept reading in paragraph three you would have seen the real word for the small machine right ,um ok 
150.1,Jazmin,,okay does that make sense ,um i mean i i did read the third paragraph but i didn't think that the microscope was the right answer because it said it said you that you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it is that you would need a scientific tool so that means you would need a microscope to look really closely but it doesn't say that they had a microscope to look really closely and so that's why i thought it was the lunar orbiter in paragraph two because they said that that was that they sent that to look for the ice in the craters 
150.1,Chris,,yes you are completely right that there is there's a lot to kind of dissect in this so you're right so does class else have anything that they were confused about ,it's not so much confused but i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
150.1,Luis,,yeah that's really cool that you got to experience that i bet not class has i definitely haven't but that is a really cool thing to to share with the class nice job student does class else have questions on the passage ,okay well i don't know why mine was wrong because i mean i know i know a lot about space and so i know that um scientists and astronauts like they have to use oxygen tanks to go to go to the moon they can't breathe 
210.3,Luis,,right you you did mention that in your response which was great i'm glad that you could acknowledge that it's just the oxygen tank could you use an oxygen tank to find water on the moon ,umm huh 
130.1,Luis,,it would help you to get to the moon right but it would it wouldn't be the thing that found the water ,okay okay yeah 
150.1,Luis,,that was a really good thing to if i asked about anything you needed to go to the moon that would be a great part of your response but do you see where the question was a little bit different than your answer ,um cuz yeah well i mean yeah cuz well when you said okay you don't need the oxygen tank to find water you need oxygen tank to breathe so yeah yeah okay 
120.4,Oliver,,but still really great thing to think about because not class thought about that intheir response but you did so that was good student do you have anything to say ,well i mean i i circled the same thing as student um so i guess i mean i don't know why i'm in this class if we're right then what's wrong with with my answer 
430.2,Oliver,,you just um didn't really have anything to say that you found on your own you just said you circled the same thing as student so i really wanted to hear in your own thoughts not in farrah's thoughts um what you found in the passage and how you did it ,oh ok ok well yeah i mean i just found i read the whole thing and then in the last sentence of the last paragraph i saw where they said a scientific tool called a microscope so i was like okay yeah that's that's equipment and we use that equipment in science class and they're looking at the water 
110.1,Oliver,,good i'm glad i could hear your own words ,okay okay okay miss teacher i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch um i know it's what's a short time and we just met but i i did appreciate how you you helped all of us kind of talk about and ask questions from you and i heard how you told student that his answer was cool but it didn't come from the question and so i'm going to think about that when we go to lunch 
120.4,Luis,,thank you student all right well class have a great lunch see you soon okay class do you mind giving me your answers again really quickly before i give you some feedback ,um yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Luis,,okay well after we asked the question your answer maybe didn't include what the question was looking for but we're going to figure that out right now so can you could you remind me what your answer was ,yeah okay i said ah scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
210.2,Luis,,that you did discover that they use oxygen tanks that was really good however can you elaborate how did they use oxygen tanks to find water on the moon okay so the question asked what equipment did they use to find water on the moon ,um well i mean they have to use oxygen tanks to breathe because they can't breathe on the moon without the oxygen tanks you know 
120.4,Jazmin,,exactly good job student student how about you ,um my answer was nasa sent a small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay what is that small machine what did the small machine do what was its purpose on the moon ,um nasa since a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ok it investigated 
210.4,Jazmin,,what specifically did it investigate use your evidence from the text ,um it investigated um the lunar orbiter um to investigate to look for ice deposits 
210.4,Jazmin,,right and ice is water correct just frozen ,oh yeah yeah 
210.4,Jazmin,,the small machine as you recognized is the lunar orbiter that was sent to investigate and look for water on the moon good job student ,oh i did it that was the right answer i did it 
110.1,Jazmin,,it's one of the right answers yeah ,student okay go me 
120.4,Chris,,good job all right student your turn ,uh huh okay so i said or something different i said umm that scientists found craters full water on the moon 
120.2,Chris,,so you discover that there was water on the moon what equipment did they use you can look back in the text to help you okay let's think back to the question the question was what equipment did nasa use to find water on the moon ,what equipment did they use oh it's what student just said 
120.1,Farrah,,yes that's one example that is an example of a piece of equipment can you find a different one that wasn't student or luis's answer ,oh well i i i had some equipment but i don't understand why my answers wrong 
120.4,Farrah,,alright so we're student do your best let's look through the text again and we're going to come back to you okay student what was your answer ,oh my answer was that um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely but if jazmin's right and she has a different answer than me um i don't know why why is mine wrong 
150.1,Farrah,,um so you're right they do use microscopes to look really closely so can you elaborate on why they use the microscope what did they do using the microscope and how does that relate back to the question do you need a reminder of what the question was ,oh no i can see it um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon well i mean it says that they look at the water with a microscope that's equipment um 
210.4,Farrah,,why did they need the microscope ,because the water was really small 
120.4,Oliver,,that's right um student how about you ,um okay well i i had the same answer as student cuz i i said the thing the same thing about how they went um so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely um cuz cuz okay well that's the only that's the only paragraph that says says water and has an equipment in it 
150.1,Chris,,so student and student also found different paragraphs so there are multiple answers if you need a second to look back and find another piece of equipment we can come back to you and i can move on to student again ,yeah so i went to nasa so i know that it is used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.2,Chris,,mm hmm did you find any evidence of them using those masks or suits in the text ,oh no no um ok so the only things that i saw was the microscope that student and student said and the lunar orbiter that student said so i don't know which one is the right 
120.4,Chris,,well there's multiple pieces of equipment so they're all right um what was your original answer let's build off of that ,okay so i said that they found a lot of water in the craters yeah 
210.4,Chris,,okay so if you go back to the microscope that student was talking about how did they find water using the microscope ,you can't really find water using the microscope it's not like it's like binoculars or something you could only look at water um using a microscope yeah 
210.4,Chris,,that is true so they had to use the microscope to know that there was water on the moon right ,well how did they find the water first to even put it underneath the microscope 
210.4,Jazmin,,that is a good question does it say it in the text ,well that's why i thought that maybe my answer was the right one because um cuz the the lunar orbiter i think that they sent to investigate um i think maybe 
210.4,Oliver,,right so that's how they found the water student using small machine that student identified and then they took the microscope that student found in the text and used that to look at the water student ,i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but i was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch so i wanted to say goodbye and thanks for for for working with us you know um yeah that was kind of fun like i i see how we have to keep going back you kept saying okay go back to the text 
230.2,Farrah,,thank you hi class so so student your response to the question you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely what led you to using a microscope as a piece of equipment ,okay it was in the last paragraph 
110.1,Farrah,,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space okay thank you student we're gonna get to your answer in a few minutes ,okay so it said i'm in the third paragraph the water they found is microscopic you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.1,Oliver,,alright awesome student i like how you told me how they used the microscope for the water that they found on the moon and you were able to find that in the text good job that was a great answer so student you circle the same as student what led you to seeing that a microscope is a piece of equipment that the scientists used ,well the question was asking about where they discovered the water and that was the only part where they had equipment and water and finding it so i looked for all the keywords and that's what's this the section of the story with the keywords 
210.4,Jazmin,,all right so if you go back to the first texts and moon is a desert and microscope is one of the pieces of equipment but remember equipment isn't always going to be defined as equipment equipment could be a machine a piece of technology do you see anything in this text that is not a microscope but is a piece of equipment ,teacher i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
110.1,Oliver,,we will go over your answer in a few minutes right now we're focusing on student but i'll have time for you to explain your thinking ,okay i see one more piece of equipment in paragraph two 
210.4,Oliver,,paragraph two all right can you tell me what it is ,yeah i saw lunar orbiter 
210.4,Oliver,,okay great that is a piece of equipment that they use can you tell me what a lunar lunar orbiter is ,okay it's a small machine it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
210.4,Oliver,,alright perfect awesome now if you go back to the question the question asked how did they use this machinery to find water great job pulling that out of the text now how did they use the lunar orbiter to find water you said that they looked for ice deposits right great and yeah ice is also what when it's melted ,ice ice is also water 
120.4,Chris,,right right there you go oliveron or student all right now student what was your answer can you remind me ,yeah i said that scientists found crators full of water on the moon 
230.1,Chris,,okay great so what led you to finding that waters are full craters are full of water on the moon ,in the first paragraph i was looking for like the keywords like how student was saying you know and i'm looking for like finding water on the moon in this sentence had like a bunch of those words scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters and so that's got like all of the things about finding water on the moon 
210.4,Chris,,great job that's a good strategy finding those key clues and keywords to help you find your answer now they did find water on the moon but what equipment did they use to find that water can you find any in the text ,is the one that student said 
140.1,Chris,,there's the possibility there's what student said what he said is there any others that you have found okay what about equipment that's not talked about in the text how did they get to the moon ,i do know that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.2,Chris,,absolutely good job way to think outside of the text so how do you think they would use oxygen oxygen tanks and stuff like that to find water on the moon what are those use for ,use to like breathe or walk or you know to protect themselves from from the elements because it's really cool i guess they don't use them to find water 
110.2,Oliver,,um well you're correct they do because they're on the moon they need to be able to breathe to do their research to find the water correct yes ,yeah yeah i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but it's time for the next class 
110.2,Oliver,,okay thank you ,you're welcome bye 
120.4,Jazmin,,alright so student now it's your turn can you remind me what your answer was for the question number one ,yeah so i said nasa sent small machine 
120.4,Luis,,okay great student you have a question ,okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
120.3,Jazmin,,alrighty then you'll be able to explain your thinking to me as soon as i'm done talking to student all right thank you alright student so you said that nasa sent a small machine now where in the text did you find that nasa sent a small machine all right can you read that to me please ,nasa small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,all right perfect good job finding that out the small machine is a piece of equipment that the scientists used like there you were able to find that same answer as student so in reading that you also found that the small machine was called what ,a lunar orbiter 
210.4,Jazmin,,right and this paragraph also tells you what a lunar orbiter does can you tell me what the lunar orbiter does ,it looks i used to pause it in a large polar crater 
210.4,Jazmin,,perfect now what about looking for ice deposits in a large polar crater has to do with finding water on the moon ,okay well i had always seen those two machines that the equipment was the microscope or that the machine the small machine called a lunar orbiter and i guess i was thinking about looking for ice deposits is the same as like trying to discover water cuz ice is just frozen water 
110.4,Jazmin,,yeah absolutely they had to use okay so to review what you were saying they use the lunar orbiter which looks for ice deposits in the craters on the moon and ice is just frozen water so a lunar orbiter is a piece of equipment that finds water on the moon awesome job student okay ,why why what's wrong with my answer then if i had the right answer 
420.2,Farrah,,well i just wanted you to be more specific and answer the full question you said that nasa used a small machine i wanted you to tell me what the machine was called and why it was used to find water on the moon okay okay so when you're answering so next time when we have questions make sure you're answering all parts of the question and as much detail as you can okay oh ,yeah i think there's still evidence in the text at the microscope 
110.2,Farrah,,yeah there's multiple pieces of equipment that's why i have you class answering any excuse me equipment that you find whether it's in the text or you think of it in your head ,okay well i added like a longer answer than jazmin's one and i and i said the name of the equipment in mind so so why is mine wrong 
150.1,Farrah,,not necessarily wrong i think that you did a good job identifying that the microscope was the equipment and a microscope does look at things closely but i wanted you to Do you understand that? ,how it's used to find water and it's not used to find water on the moon 
420.2,Farrah,,it is you explained to me that it was a piece of equipment and what it does but i wanted you to tell me how it was used to find water on the moon ,oh so i have to add that to my to my answer 
230.1,Chris,,yes which you did so awesome now student your answer was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks what made you think of oxygen tanks is a piece of equipment that scientists used ,okay so i know about space and i know that they can't breathe up in space and like student said you know they use a lot of different equipment and so on oxygen tank is one that they have to use yeah yeah and i heard there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
210.3,Luis,,all right awesome job student i like that you didn't have to use the text there's a ton of other equipment that scientists used and this one you thought about using your knowledge of nasa so how did they use the oxygen tanks to find water ,wow okay i guess i guess they didn't use oxygen tanks to find the water they use that to breathe air 
210.3,Luis,,right they didn't directly use that as a piece of equipment to find water like a microscope would be looking at water but in order to be on the moon like you said you need an oxygen tank because we can't breathe on the moon right ,right 
210.3,Luis,,so yes so tell you told me that um you need oxygen tanks to be on the moon and that is a piece of equipment yeah were the scientists using oxygen tanks when they found the water ,if they're on the moon then i have to student you can't you can't be walking on the moon without an oxygen tank you can't breathe 
110.2,Oliver,,yeah absolutely good job ,oh okay teacher i just looked at the clock it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for kind of valuing all of us like i felt valued too and my answer and i'm thinking about what hearing what like i'm student needed to work on is kind of giving me an idea on how i can improve my answer to 
110.2,All,,awesome thank you hello class how are you ,we are good 
150.1,Luis,,oh sorry student i'm so sorry you had your hand up that's good that's good um so you class read a text water on the moon and we're gonna be talking about what you said like your responses ,yeah no problem um so basically i was just saying that like i kind of know like all about space so i don't think i really need to be in this 
150.1,Luis,,oh well you know class learn something new no matter how much you know about it there's always something to learn about something ,well i can stick around 
420.2,Chris,,"great we'd love to have you student um class class else have any questions before we start alright sounds good sounds good so we'll start with student i your response was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely I think you maybe could have gone in more depth to it, but like as a start like is a very good start. Good job. Farrah. so student your response was scientists found crators for water on the moon that's good observation But in the future when, if you have a little more text to it. Try to try to deepen your thinking and like kind of think of it in different way. I guess maybe thinking about it like outside of the box. You know, I have you guys heard about thinking outside the box. ",yeah what does that mean exactly 
420.2,Jazmin,,"Oh, yes. Jazmin. ",i was just wondering what's wrong with my answer like i was trying to figure out why what i said was wrong 
430.2,Jazmin,,um well technically you weren't wrong and what you said by saying nasa send a small machine but um you could have talked about what that machine was and how it but um yeah so you weren't you weren't wrong oh it's just i'm a little too broad ,i need to say something specific because i i needed to be like a big it's a small machine and like what it's called or like what it does is that what i need to say 
150.1,Jazmin,,yes those are perfect things to add um do you have any other questions before we move on ,no that makes sense so like i should just say like in detail like what it was 
110.1,Luis,,yeah so like yeah for i'll do an example so that you can like hear an example of it um so there's a small machine that cleans the house you class have heard of vacuum right so say the small machine that you said in your sentence was the vacuum you can expand upon it by saying this small machine caught a vacuum is used to clean up stuff off of a rug or hard like hardwood floor but like you don't really have to say both of them you could just say a rug so yeah that's kind of how you could have done it but yeah this was a good start yeah good foundation student so you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks your responses very good and though ,"Okay, well that that makes sense. Like so, like you say like more details. So like if I was gonna say equipment like I need to come up with like a few different pieces of it.Is that right? "
110.1,Chris,,yeah yeah that is correct harris and i saw your hand up ,oh yeah i was just gonna say goodbye to nasa so with with my dad and i saw that they use like all kinds of equipment like shooting baskets oxygen tanks all that kind of stuff 
140.1,Chris,,that's super cool i wish i wish i went to nasa maybe i might have to go there soon awesome yeah awesome well since you've gone there um could you think of like two things that that you saw there ,oh yeah absolutely so i saw that they use like these are core to keep them like attached to the ship if they had to do like you know what i mean like a spot and you also saw that they had these really cool like they like the food that they eat is crazy like they eat this food they like so they like put water in and then it kind of comes out like like tires 
140.1,Jazmin,,yeah i think i saw something with eggs or something i am i am i have been for the military or they both might use it but i saw something like that that that's really cool that's really cool yeah ,unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and in particular they really wanted to thank you for reminding us to use evidence from the text in our answers and like make sure that we didn't just like talking you know let me just say the thing that you had to back it up with evidence and also just wanted to thank you for like listening to our different interests and our stories because i think we were really interested in sharing our stories so thank you so much 
220.1,Luis,,no problem have a great lunch right okay okay hey class how are you class doing hope it is doing well yeah it's good good good to hear so i brought you all and you know it's a as a class because you class all had very various answers to the prompts so we're going to be discussing them and trying to expand more upon this sentences um so um i would like to just ask one other passages yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
420.2,Chris,,"oh well you know the the greatest minds in the world always always now i learned something new every day so you know you try give it a shot you know keep an open mind to it because we'd love to have you here your expertise could help us all as well okay okay so um we'll start off with student you your applied to it was scientists found creators full of water on the moon so your sentence isn't wrong and you bring up a good point that um the scientists found for creators full of water on the moon on To maybe not like bulk it up, but to add a little more background knowledge to it um was you could say why the water on the moon is important and how it can help. Pretty key to all this um. so um yeah just maybe next time just try think of like so yeah like it said in a text on that the water if they find enough on the moon they couldn't make like a gas station so now it's time that could be important so do you have any questions for me on that well so yeah just maybe next time just try think of a reason why the thing that they found is important ",i was i was trying to think about the question because this the first question what equipment that scientists use to find water on the moon and i feel like i did answer it because i talked about where they found the water 
110.1,Jazmin,,do you you could mention um what equipment they use to find the water i think if i'm i'm pretty sure is a lunar orbiter that wasn't one that found the crators so yeah just kind of thinking about more like that but you did great you know it was it was a good answer you did awesome i'm excited you know class forgets once in a while even i forget i'm so we'll move on to student ,i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,"A suggestion I had written down when I looked at all the responses um I saw it, you could instead of saying NASA sent a small machine, you could say. um do you have any do you have any questions about that, so far, well, I just i'm gonna try to write it down, so I was trying to remember what you said. so maybe like adding a couple words to a sentence and rephrasing can really make a huge difference to the sentence ",so nasa to smell machine 
130.3,Jazmin,,yeah i'll i'll read it for you ready i'm ready okay nasa sang songs a equipment called the lunar orbiter which its purpose is to travel around the moon and discover new findings okay yeah ,it was a long sentence but i wrote most of it 
420.2,Chris,,"there was a lot i know i know me as well can help you complete the sophomore because it's not it's not a terrible thing to add an extra sentence to it, because it will help you in the long run um so um. teacher ",sorry you were talking about equipment i remember something so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
130.1,Luis,,wow you're you're a super right and that was perfect timing because your classmate student his his sentence was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank so two great minds think alike am i right well i'm so student for your sentence i have seen anything terrible wrong with it but um you could just kind of expand more because you said use a lot of the equipment and then you only said oxygen tanks you can maybe mentioned like the soup thing where because that's also equipment because they needed to be up there on the lunar orbiter is another equipment on and then as their fellow classmate also mentioned in her sentences shall be getting to sort of them said microscopes yeah um so just maybe adding a couple more equipment to the sentence can help it not just bulk it up but give more understanding to follow reader who is reading a sentence ,okay okay i can add a couple more names of equipment 
110.2,Oliver,,yeah um but other than that i i thank you class like all the class i think i understood the passages like well yes that ,i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but it's time for us to go so we'll see you later 
110.2,Oliver,,all right well i had so much fun talking to you class i hope you launch and resources awesome thank you okay ,we'll see you later bye 
110.2,Bennett,,bye bye ,okay i'm sending you in your chat 
150.1,Luis,,so we'll be talking about your responses to the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable um so first of all i your i like your responses all they're all different and i like that so what's what's taught was start with student so you're your teacher ,yes i don't mean to interrupt you but i think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good 
150.1,Luis,,i'm sorry could you repeat that again my i didn't get to you the first time ,yeah i think i got all of this figured out so i'm all good now 
150.1,Luis,,oh come on stick around for a while but you can learn something new from this you know some i'm almost 20 years old and i was reading some of this and i don't even know about it now ,ok ok ok 
150.1,Luis,,let's try to keep an open mind and student i feel you like this science stuff right i'm ,sorry 
230.1,Farrah,,it won't be boring trust me it'd be super excited i'm so student your your response to it was no not for a long time um what what made you say that well cuz ,in the story at the end of the story they talked about how it would take a lot of time and money for the thing to be made and it said well do you think that'll be a worth while investment or something like that do you think there will be a good investment and so i'm thinking no it's going to take that long 
230.2,Farrah,,"For your answer, which is really good so i'm keep Keep up the good job of looking at the evidence on before they even asked that question. You know, someone could have given like a shorter and simple answer, I guess, but your answer was still very good so good job on us man, thank you very much, no problem, no problem so i'm dead, you said. no it's not ready yet um can you remove show me the evidence of that if you could um ",yeah i read it last story 
420.2,Farrah,,can you tell me in your own words why it's not ready using using what's in the passage but in your own words ,i'm okay okay so it says that they need to come up with a plan and making the plan that's going to take a lot of time and money and they have to build new equipment so it's that's not ready at all because that'll take a long time 
110.1,Jazmin,,good good good job i like that i like that could reply student i see your hand up ,yeah i'm still kind of confused 
150.1,Jazmin,,what do you confused about ,well cuz you said that so the answer was a good answer but my answer was completely different and and no offense but she like only wrote a few words and i wrote like a lot of words because you told us to expand our answers but they're different 
150.1,Chris,,"um you're right i did say to expand on your answers um and you know i try to thing everyone's answer can be right i mean um Sometimes i'm used to mess up but i'll go on to yours and your responses, yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water on. i mean i as i said last time adding an extra sentence to it can only help it sometimes and never make it worse i like how you added evidence that you have to stay hydrated because you can't survive without water so i like how you paid attention to that and you paid a lot of attention to details um so i like how you paid attention to that and you're you paid a lot to attention you paid a lot of Group. i had a really good answer um well i i brought you class all together because you class all had varying answers so i'm hoping that when you class hear your responses like your classmates responses you can get ideas for them as well because even the smartest people in the world work with other people to make things better because if you can collaborate then you class all learn at the same time i'm so student you said water is heavy so it's good and they don't have to carry it in the ship anymore um is there any other reason why it's good that they were not to carry it in the ship other than its weight to amazing that is just what i was looking for that was a great response so see how and see how it kind of thinking more on that helped you figure that out ",i think it was what you had said before about wanting us to to just add more add more details to our writing yes yes what else i read that there could be a moon base or a base on the moon by 2024 
150.1,Chris,,when the happy core right on the moon ,i'd love to go to that place it would be real cool 
420.2,Luis,,"that would be amazing i will do anything to do that Why, it would be important for the water to be able to be split into hydrogen and oxygen. ",okay well i know you can breathe oxygen and so maybe they could make like a breathing room or something and then hydrogen oh okay it says oxygen hydrogen can also be used as rocket fuel 
120.4,Luis,,all right good good good so i like how you said that and is um and it's obviously super important there be able to breathe and then um i'm sorry when you say for hydrogen again while ,the story says that they can put them together oxygen and hydrogen can be used as rocket fuel 
110.1,Luis,,okay yes good way it's super important ,for you fuel which is what the as on student said that in 2024 they could have a gas station so being able to split up the hydrogen and oxygen efficiently would be very important so you can have the breathing room and then the gas station that's cool down for that 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah when you know um so yeah i'm to so to bring us all to you and your your your responses were great and i love how you class saw more about it and added an extra sentence to it um because again as i said adding extra sentences can go from making a sentence slightly like vague and not as detailed to something very detailed and and it can help you learn it better as well so i'd like to thank you class for taking the time to answer the questions as well oh ,well we want to thank you teacher for asking us questions cuz i i like how you you explain what we needed to work on adding more details but also how you asked about our thinking that led to our answers because sometimes teacher just tell us what they think we were thinking about and you asked us what we were thinking about 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah yeah i like that i appreciate that a lot that that makes me very happy i always had teachers asked me that those questions um yes class ,bye 
150.1,Luis,,bye bye hi class ,okay so hi so we're going to go ahead and repeat our answers for you so you have all that okay so my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close arm yeah and i circled basically the same thing as student um i my answer was scientists found craters water on the moon and basically what i said was i was saying that nasa send a small machine yeah and what i said basically was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and you know all kinds of stuff like that 
230.1,Oliver,,way thank you student why did you circle the same thing that student didn't what was your reason ,oh that that's a good question so okay so my reasoning was basically that okay i agree that you need a scientific tool called a microscope like that's the equipment that the scientists use that the scientists you and i think that if you can't like okay they said in the reading that the a to where did they say it exactly they said that oh yeah okay in paragraph three the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so like i know that you need a microscope to study the water 
110.1,Luis,,that's a good feedback yes you can ,um yeah so i was just gonna say like i i kind of already know like all about space and i don't really feel like i even need to be in this class 
110.3,Luis,,so you know a lot about space and you think that your answer was good of how you know some final words like oxygen and you know what an oxygen tank is and you know all the equipment they use ,yeah i know all about it my dad's an astronaut 
110.1,Jazmin,,"okay Yes, Jazmin. ",thank you i was wondering like why my answer was like why my answer was right 
420.2,Jazmin,,it was right but i wish you had a little bit more information like what was the small machine that they used ,so this small machine was called the lunar orbiter 
150.1,Jazmin,,does that make more sense of how what i wanted from you student ,oh yeah i think that makes a lot more sense thank you 
150.1,Chris,,you're welcome student did you have something to say ,well i was just gonna say that i never like student sets up that way basically um you know scientists like well they basically like i went to nasa so i know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and master too so i was wondering like why that you know i mean like where does that fit in if it's not in the meeting but we know that they 
110.3,Chris,,see you already have some background knowledge on this ,yo yeah yeah i love space 
110.3,Chris,,so you know a lot about what the scientists use on in space and what they actually use them for ,oh yeah i know like all kinds of stuff about that and i like i really know about 
140.1,Farrah,,does class here have any any knowledge on space or is it just a couple of you ,it's just a few of us i don't think class like student and student are really obsessed with space and i think they're the ones that 
140.1,Farrah,,that's really good if you don't like space ,i think space is fine but actually i really am interested in space but for me i like science fiction 
140.1,Farrah,,i wish your answers had a little bit more detail but you class have some background knowledge and it's really good i like what you class came up with is there anymore knowledge you class have yes student ,um so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just really wanted to thank you for working with us and in particular i wanted to thank you for helping us to use evidence from the text and like making sure that we were you were using that and then like the way when you were talking to student like you know you were basically able to like say to him like you know like what were you thinking like what was your thinking in your answer and i thought that was really cool i think you did something like that with student and that's really cool to be like asking them to think about like what you mean like what they were thinking about to thank you so much and it was really nice to meet you bye 
140.1,Luis,,hi class yes you can ,get so i was just gonna say that i don't think i need to be in this class because i know that you're helping class who needed help because i already know all about space 
110.1,Luis,,is that so ,oh yeah 
120.4,Farrah,,so we asked the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what are all of your answers who wants to share first student ,is it okay if i go first 
120.4,Farrah,,yeah go ahead ,okay so i said and we can just go around so i said you need a scientific tool microscope to look really close 
130.1,Farrah,,you are correct student but not the answer is exactly looking for ,okay 
210.4,Oliver,,a microscope is would not work because you need to discover the water first to use a microscope to look at the water so you actually need the lunar orbiter to find the water on the moon student what was your answer ,so my answer was that i circled the same as student 
230.1,Oliver,,and why did you circle the same as student ,okay so here's what i thought was i was looking for equipment right because it said what equipment did the scientists use and i thought well microscope is a piece of equipment i thought that maybe like the lunar orbiter maybe it wasn't a piece of equipment because it's a machine so i was thinking equipment was more like a tool like a hammer or like a microscope 
230.3,Oliver,,so we're using your background knowledge on the word equipment and like tool you like ,yeah that's what i knew about equipment 
230.3,Oliver,,so here's what you're using our already background knowledge on what scientists had already used for previous things correct ,yeah 
230.3,Jazmin,,yes student ,i guess i was kind of confused about why my answer was wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,"If you read the question carefully, you would have noticed the keywords equipment scientist and discover you use the Lunar. orbit to discover the water that is already on the load and you would use a like semana and student said you would use a microscope to look at the sample the water that you found on the moon if that makes sense ",was my answer is it is so i said nasa centers small machine but was that not quite the the answer small machine oh okay that makes sense so i gotta say like what exactly is okay that makes sense 
210.4,Chris,,student would you like to give us your response ,sure so my response was basically that scientists craters full water on the moon 
130.1,Chris,,the creatives are not full of water it was a little bit of water in the craters on the moon that the lunar orbit does that that is true but it's not fully insured ,oh ok so my answer was right i just said that basically there was too much water okay 
130.1,Chris,,student would you like to share yes student ,oh yeah i'm okay yes so i was just thinking and wondering cuz my dad took me to nasa and when i was there i saw that scientists and astronauts us all kinds of like suits and oxygen tanks and equipment other kinds so i guess i was thinking like i guess what i was wondering was like didn't they need that did they leave that out of the reading because that seems really important 
210.4,Chris,,i don't think they are exactly what it out of the reading i think they they didn't feel that it was appropriate to writing with what the reading was about which wasn't discovering the water on the moon yes if you were to go up to the moon you got all that equipment but that wasn't exactly what it was about ,gotcha okay thank you 
210.4,Luis,,lets see student would you like to share your answer please ,yeah okay so what i said was that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks mass and stuff kind of like what harris was saying 
130.1,Luis,,as i said class else your answer is correct but it's not exactly the answer i was looking for nasa did ,gotcha so what's the background knowledge like is incorrect. 
130.1,Jazmin,,know your background knowledge is correct but he's not the answer or the way that i would have where did the answer okay yes student ,i'm just gonna say unfortunately we have to go to my next class but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with you thank you so much bye 
210.3,Jazmin,,hi class so if you i have a question for you based off of your answers that you have now in the information i've already given you on what your answers could be changed how would you change your answers exactly based on the information that i've given you explaining a little bit more of what i was expecting from you class who'd like to go first student ,okay so for me i would change my answer initially i said that like you know the the scientists use the small machine but i would make sure that i will use my evidence and say that completely answer so i would say nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to find water on the moon is that right 
120.4,Chris,,"class else like to share what they would change their answer to Chris, what would you change your answer to. ",so i would change my answer what i would say as i would say like um so i said initially scientists craters on the water and i would say instead that scientists found craters with small pieces of ice in that on the moon 
120.4,Luis,,Luis What would you change your answer to? ,and um so actually for me i was just gonna say that i think that i've got everything all figured out now so i was gonna say i think about good can i go back to my desk 
130.1,Luis,,no what would you change your institute because your intro wasn't exactly what we were looking for ,um so well i guess i would change my answer to um i don't know a machine so lunar orbiter. 
210.3,Luis,,yes orbiters what found the water on the moon so how would you change your answer from what you originally had ,um i would say the lunar orbiter went to the moon 
120.4,Oliver,,okay i like that answer would class else like to share what they would change their answers student and student you can go because you already went yesterday ,um okay so basically what i said okay so initially what i had said was that i circled the same as student student she has some really good ideas but also i thought the same thing as her which is that the microscope was the tool that they looked really closely and how they found the water and it sounds like there was the other things that they used to find the water and i'm still a little confused about if they use the microscope or if they use the space suits but it sounds like the answer to this question from our conversation is the lunar orbiter but i think that in the text it still says they use the microscope so it makes me think like put the microscope beyond like a second answer 
210.4,Oliver,,but the microscope cannot exactly go up to an object and find something you have to put the object you want to look at under the microscope you use a microscope to zoom in on something small that you cannot see with your eyes ,gotcha so um i i read somewhere that they were going to try to build a base on the moon for 2024 do you think that they did that because they found water 
120.4,Farrah,,i dont know maybe student do you want to share what you attend your interview ,yes so it seems like for me okay so originally i said that that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and what i meant by that when i was thinking about my answer like i meant that because it says in the in the text that the water is just like little microscopic ice crystals so i thought how can you find if you can see that so i guess the lunar orbiter like that that that makes sense that that's the machine at a sense and it was looking like maybe the lunar orbiter had a microscope on it like how could you find the microscopic water if you couldn't see it 
120.4,Jazmin,,that's a very interesting idea of maybe the lunar orbiter does have a special quality of it that it can zoom in on something and pick up very small details of the water and like what it's what micro like what's in it and stuff the micro service student do you want to say some things i know you add years before ,so actually fortunately it's time for us to the lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i wanted to help you for a while i wanted to thank you for helping us understand some of the misconceptions that we like you really helped us to understand like you know the meaning of the kind of words especially around discover like when you were saying like what we needed to focus on the question i think that was really like helpful because like words like discover yeah like i think class like thought that that was really helpful because it helps us to figure out like what to look for you know what i mean like it's not always obvious like what we should be looking for in you know in the thing so i think it really helped us to understand like the word we should look for and you also encouraged us to make sure that we use evidence so you know what i mean like we we couldn't give an answer that didn't have evidence from the text and i think that was really good practice for us to thank you so much 
150.1,Farrah,,hi class did you enjoy reading ,yes we enjoyed it and we're ready to share our answers awesome basically ok so my answer what do you want to give us to give it one by one or do you want to call on us how would you like 
120.4,Luis,,why don't we go around the table so student you can start and then it will be oliveron student and so on ,sounds good okay you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really close and i basically circle the same thing as student scientist scientists don't printers for water and i said a small machine and scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks stuff like that 
420.2,Farrah,,so i think you class all did a really great job thinking while using our text so i'm going to go around the room and give a little bit of feedback to each of you so student to start i think you did a really great job pulling from the text but i also think maybe next time and your responses you could give us a little bit more of a personalized approach to your response so maybe what you found from the text along with what you thought about it does that sound good ,yeah so like what my opinion on what i thought Okay I can do that. 
420.2,Oliver,,awesome thank you and student your response was just comparing to student is which was a great point she was absolutely correct but like i said to her maybe personalize it a little bit add your own views sound good ,okay yeah 
430.2,Chris,,and then student so what you said related to the text really well you had some of your personal views along with some thoughts that came from the text so it was a great response but we weren't didn't pull anything directly from the text like a quote so do you think maybe next time we could look back into the text and add a quote or something to directly ,reach every rader yeah i can totally do that 
310.1,Jazmin,,thank you student and student i think you had some great vocab ,actually my my answer was well 
310.1,Jazmin,,it's cutting out sorry ,oh i was just trying to figure out like why my answer was wrong 
230.2,Jazmin,,So the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. And you talked about that NASA send something. Is there a place in the text where you found that Jazmin. ,yeah basically i saw that in paragraph two nasa send a small machine or better to investigate 
230.2,Luis,,sorry excuse me for one second student how can i help you student ,"Oh, well, actually I was just gonna say that like i already know all about space like i don't think i need any help "
150.1,Luis,,you know i think it's awesome that you already have so much knowledge but nobody can know everything about one thing so the more we learn the better off we might be so maybe we should just keep our minds open to what's going on and maybe we can learn from it okay ,okay 
150.1,Chris,,thank you and student ,oh i was just gonna say i know because i've been to nasa that up you know scientists like us a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks stuff like that you know what i mean 
420.2,Jazmin,,but from this point on i think i'm going to need to finish with telling you class what's going on and then you can raise your hands after okay that's really cool student i want to thank you for sharing your personal experience with us that really helps us build on what we're learning thank you so student like we were saying i think you had a really good response just maybe go the next step read a little bit further and then add to your answer before you respond okay ,okay 
420.3,Luis,,thank you all right and student sorry i'm looking at the response again so you also had a great answer scientists can use a lot of things and like you said you know a lot about space so you've seen that they can use a lot of things but in this particular text we're learning about one specific thing so maybe next time if we can look back into the text and pull something directly from there along with your personal opinion we'd have a stronger response is that okay ,um yeah i guess i'm trying to figure out which the thing is because there's so many pieces that go into the spaceship you know so i'm i'm trying to figure out like which one it is 
210.4,Luis,,and also if we continue our readings outside of class we can learn a little bit more like you said you know a lot about space so the more we continue reading about it the more we can learn about it okay yeah and i think if we look back into our reading we can find specifics ,yeah okay 
210.4,Farrah,,thank you student ,so unfortunately it's time much so we have to go but before we go i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and in particular i really wanted to thank you for drawing our attention to you know to me and asking us to share our thoughts like i was really glad to be able to share my thoughts out so thank you so much for working 
210.4,Oliver,,thank you so are they responding first am i saying your responses first and ,what you'd like us to say them or or do you remember that 
230.2,Luis,,i'm sorry i thought you were gonna say them first i have them okay alright class so you all have really great responses so now i'm going to ask you each question and that question is where can you reference the test the text from your answer and how does it answer the question do you have a question student ,um yeah so i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know like all about space 
150.1,Luis,,that's awesome that you know a lot about space but there's infinite learning that we can have none of us know absolutely everything is because none of us have been to space i don't think have you been ,no not yet but i will 
230.2,Luis,,and i'm sure one day you will get there but until then let's try to focus on learning a little bit more so all right i'll repeat myself just so you class remember so easy why don't you start for me where did you find your answer in the text and also how was your answer answering the question the questions that i'm asking you is in your answer where can you refer to the text so where did you get your answer from in the text ,um so i didn't really need to read it because i already knew the answer because i know a lot about space so i knew already that that scientists had to use that 
230.2,Jazmin,,so in our reading we did learn a little bit more about what they used to find the water and the first question i'm sorry discovering the moon so we found that we found different answers and what you found and that that's okay we'll just have to look back in the text to find these answers and maybe from listening to your classmates you might see in the text and see new things and learn from what is really happening along with what you have found in prior knowledge okay you then so let's listen to our classmates all right thank you alright student so nasa sent a small machine where did you find that in the text he ,so basically what i was thinking that it was in the second paragraph and they were talking about the end of the machine 
210.3,Jazmin,,yeah that's awesome i see it right in the second paragraph nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that's a great answer so the question asking what equipment did scientists use so is there any way you think that you could expand on your answer yes student ,i don't understand why my answer is wrong even though you say we really want to expand 
420.2,Jazmin,,your answer is not necessarily wrong i just think we could expand on it further so if you could look back in the text and see exactly where you have your answer so in paragraph two is there any more knowledge that you can add to your answer now ,well it says that its looking for ice sheets is that what it's supposed to be 
230.2,Jazmin,,adding more information would make your answer a little bit more what's the word i'm looking for specific and a little bit more on task what's the word i'm looking for specific and a little bit more you know on task what you said is good but it's a little it's a wide range for an answer so this kind of pinpoints more so if you were to be a little bit more specific so that's a great answer but next time just try to lead read a little bit further just for a little bit more information okay all right awesome thank you alright student so your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon where did you find that in the chat ,oh ok so i saw that i'm excited the first paragraph it they were talking about the yeah the craters and how there was all the water you know 
230.1,Jazmin,,yeah so let me ask you now how does that answer what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon ,oh well that's where they discovered the water 
210.3,Oliver,,that is true that is where they discovered the water but the question was the equipment that they used so maybe as we keep listening as you heard from student and we might hear from oliveron student we're talking about the equipment so you did name where we found it but the question is more focused on the equipment that okay so next time we'll really read the question through a little bit harder i'll read it more myself to help you understand the question better and then we'll we'll find the equipment okay okay awesome alright student so your answer was just circling the same as student is there any more in depth that you'd like to go and your answer ,student is usually right and i also thought that too 
230.2,Farrah,,okay well that's great why don't we go to her and asked her about cars and we'll come back to you to see if there's anything more you can add afterwards okay all right thank you so student where did you find your answer in the text ,so i was looking for and the only equipment that i could find it pretty three paragraphs with me and i thought it was a like you know how are our test as like the kind of trick questions and it says what and you have to find that exact i was like what and i thought oh the bikers right so even though i wasn't quite sure about like how it works i figured the microscope had to be 
130.1,Chris,,i liked that you looked through multiple paragraphs to find that answer wide range you could have multiple answers like how student said they use the machine to get there well they couldn't find the water if they didn't get there right so they use the machine and they use the microscope excuse me yes student ,um i i actually saw like a spaceship one time 
520.1,Farrah,,that's really cool and i'm sure we can circle back to that when we finish our discussion then we're just going to finish up first okay student alright so student as i was saying there's multiple tools that were used to find the water because we had to get there in order to find the water right so that's a really good answer so next time you are answering a question like this how do you think you can make your answer better ,unfortunately we have to go too much but thank you so much for people it was really fun thank you so much bye 
150.1,Luis,,thank you simulation alright so i believe we left off the savanna talking about the microscope being the only thing i'm sorry student how can i help you ,oh well i just was off i was gonna say that like i think i got everything figured out now so i think i'm all good to go 
150.1,Luis,,okay well i appreciate your thoughts but i'm just going to ask that we keep listening and that maybe we'll find new knowledge okay so let's just keep listening to our classmates make sure we're all respectful to each other and let's keep our hands down until i come to you okay unless you have a serious question okay ,okay 
210.3,Farrah,,thanks class alright so student we were talking about the microscope and how that's the only object that you found after looking through the first three paragraphs but since we've kind of brought in our knowledge now about how it takes time and equipment to get to space to find the water how can we brought in our answer ,oh well i use it sure cuz when i think of equipment i just think of like a wrench or hamper you know like that equipment right so a microscope like maybe like fancy equipment but it still don't see any other equipment you know look that up 
210.4,Farrah,,and that's okay um if we think back to jazmin's response she talked about the spaceship and if you think about it equipment can be anything that you really use to get to the water or anything that helps you find the water so now thinking that way thinking anything that can be considered equipment to help us find the water is there anything more that you can think of that you saw ,oh like a robot 
230.2,Farrah,,let's see where where did you find that in the text ,oh no no sorry i was thinking about like what would be like oh so the lunar orbiter is like you would use and i guess they had a robot but no they just use the lunar orbiter 
210.4,,,absolutely so student is there anything you'd like to add to that now that we've looked through the text and if you want to review it again see if there's anything else or add yeah that's a great answer thank you so now we can see that we've used the microscope and the lunar orbiter to that ,i think samantha's right 
230.2,,,yeah i totally agree do you want to point out exactly where in the text she found the answers for us ,um well i think it was next to the robot part 
230.2,,,so we know that student said that we found small machine in the second paragraph so i'm gonna talk with student and just a second the student can you find where the microscope is in text can you find it for me because i don't think that we had a robot part in there but that's okay ,yeah okay i see it 
110.1,Jazmin,,alright so we'll come right back to you student how can i help you how so ,well i guess it's just what is the leader is that like you that's equipment like it too 
150.1,Jazmin,,so equipment is considered to be anything that helps you get to the water in this point or helps you get on to the moon so basically you could even say that the food on the ship is equipment for the people to stay alive to get there so it can be taken in multiple different directions some people could be very like how you class each said one thing but if we bring it all together we have all the equipment we need to find the water on the moon does that make sense ,yeah 
230.2,Oliver,,awesome alright so student where did you find the information about microscope and the text ,okay so when i was looking at it you know more seriously i saw that that they had like that they were using the microscope to look at the release small like particles of water and so that's kind of like why i thought that might have been cool as well and then i actually do understand like how student was say like that the lunar orbiter is also a piece of equipment because just like semana like i only saw the microscope i didn't think that the lunar orbiter was really like equipment the same way that like you know she was saying you know like a screwdriver or like you know something like that seems different so i kind of had the same thing she did 
130.2,Chris,,"Now Chris, now that we've heard everyone else's responses, do you have anything to reflect on or add about what you've heard and how this equipment was used to get to find the water on the moon. ",yeah i guess so i i think like i read that there could be a base on the moon by maybe 20 or that made me think that you know like i don't know like it made me think that this is something that could make that possible 
420.3,Luis,,that's a really good connection so the note the news that you're hearing outside of the text so yeah this equipment will definitely help them get there thank you for adding that and student now that we've heard from class we've learned that we use the spacecraft and the microscope to see the water on the moon is there any other maybe we could look for some harder words in the text like spacecraft and reflect on that to find the answers do you think you can do that for me ,oh i maybe i kind of feel like i don't know i feel like the stuff well i kind of feel like i don't really understand why they wouldn't like if they have all those astronauts they would have to use oxygen so i think my answer was still pretty right 
420.3,Oliver,,but your answer doesn't reflect on our text and the main point here is that we're trying to find in the text what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so if you can reflect on your texts for me and find some bigger words harder words that maybe you didn't understand and we can go over them to help you better understand the text yes student how can i help you ,so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i wanted to thank you for really hoping to sort of value the answers that we had and then like helping a lot of us sort of work through like our fusion and like also you really had us focus on using evidence which was pretty cool because that made sure that we were able to tell you like why we thought what we were thinking and like why we had our answer which was pretty cool so thank you so much it was really fun 
420.3,Luis,,bye bye hello students oh sorry go ahead ,i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
420.3,Farrah,,well that's great that you have some background knowledge we're just going to build that in this class and expand your knowledge on the subject to all class so all of you class read the text and gave good answers so to start off we're gonna start with student But you use great academic knowledge.nd great academic vocab in your response. so that was good but next time i want you to dive deeper into story and think about what they used to discover the water ,"okay i guess i thought that what i wrote i was what they used to discover the water Okay, I'm looking. the water they found was microscopic "
210.4,Farrah,,if you look in the second sentence ,the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking at it closely 
210.4,Farrah,,no the one that starts with nasa sent ,nasa sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate lunar orbiter when the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large public crater these ice deposits are very small scientists said the one top of the top layer of the surface will hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about one one person might drink in a day 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay do you see where it says the exact equipment they sent student ,i'll let me read it again teacher i think my answer from paragraph two but i don't understand why my answers wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,student you started off your response really well you just needed to go a little further to name the machine they use or the equipment they use so you noticed that it was a small machine which was very good and which was also stated in the text it shows that you used your context from the text which is very good you just needed to go a little further to name the machine they use but so far so good ,okay okay 
210.3,Farrah,,now student did you see where it said the equipment ,is i guess the one that student said the nasa sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Farrah,,so you see how that was the equipment they used to discover the water and then the microscope was the equipment they used to go closer and see if the water was sufficient ,well i mean i see where it's at that the lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater but i guess i didn't i didn't it doesn't look like they found water in there 
420.2,Oliver,,they um the water they found was microscopic that's why they need it on my microscope to look closer okay okay i'm moving on to student student you realized that student had a good answer and you agreed with her but next time i would like you to either add on to something she says based on the text or you can make up your own answer so you're adding on to the discussion or adding your own opinion to it so you're adding on to discussion or adding your own opinion to it ,but but i mean i had the same answer you just asked her how first so when it was my turn it was just the same thing 
420.2,Oliver,,for next time i would just like you to add on so you see how she said they use a microscope to look closer at the water you could have added on to say if you saw another equipment in the text or if you disagree or anything just add on to the discussion so we're not all saying the same things Or if  you disagree or anything. Just adding on to the discussion. So we're not all saying the same things. ,okay 
420.2,Chris,,yes student ,went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
420.3,Oliver,,"yeah that's great background knowledge to bring to the table and since we're in a small class we're supposed to discuss it here for next time i just want you to look closer at the text It was talking about how they didn't find a lot of water that they had to use a microscope to like look at the water that they did find so for next time. I just want you to read closer and if you don't understand the first time just reread as much as you need, or ask a pair or a teacher. but you used great academic vocab in your response next time i just want you to get a closer look into the text and think deeper about the question ",okay okay it's time for us to go to lunch but and i know this was really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you helped me think about how i should kind of give my own ideas i mean it's not like i copied off student but maybe you how i always want to add on a new idea or more more things if somebody else has the same idea as me 
150.1,Luis,,exactly well you class have a great lunch was nice meeting you all okay so to start off class had a great start answering the questions um yes student ,i'm gap so i was just gonna say that i don't think i need to even be in this room because i already know all about space and all this kind of stuff ready 
110.1,Farrah,,well it's always great to expand your knowledge because you can always learn something you wouldn't have thought you needed to know before so it's always a good experience to build upon our responses and our knowledge of the subject as i was saying you class all started off great and we're headed in the right direction and we only need to build your response a little more to fully answer the question so to start with student first student i see what you were saying when you said the tool the scientists needed for water was a small microscope um ,"So, like how they found even I mean like today yeah cuz I thought the. the microscope you through the microscope really close "
420.2,Farrah,,"My suggestion would be to look at the passage the paragraph before it, where it stated the the equipment they use to find the water in the first place before they could even look into it with the microscope they use something else to find the water so my suggestion would be to add that and then revise your response. ",okay 
210.3,Oliver,,and then for student let's see student your response i understand that you had a similar response to student and i would like you to just dive a little deeper and either add on or revise your statement to like either add on or say something different to what student said so is there anything you wanted to add on ,um well i guess what i was thinking about was kind of a same thing that they used a microscope to look really closely because i was thinking like if you're gonna see the water like the ice crystals they're really small and so i was thinking like that's the only way to see that 
430.2,Jazmin,,"exactly but before they could see them water with the microscope they had to use an equipment to find the water in the first place So I see where you agreed with Farrah. My suggestion would be to Either if you're gonna if you're gonna agree, I need you to add something was almost there but then quite fully answer the question so next time if you're going to add like just add on something extra Yes, Jazmin? ",like like i guess i wasn't sure in this class you're helping us because we weren't quite right it is still kind of confused like why my answer was wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,it actually wasn't wrong and i see where you answered your question i just wanted you to be a little more specific of what the equipment was called so you had a good start and you were almost there you just needed to name the equipment so you you were on the right track ,i know the equipment can i say it 
420.2,Jazmin,,yes you can ,so the small machine it was the lunar oriber right 
420.2,Jazmin,,it was one second i'll tell you if it's correct yes that is correct so you just needed you were on the right track you just needed to name the object so for next time when you're given a response make sure you're as specific as possible but you had a great start ,in that makes sense that it was like i just tend to be more specific like see what it what 
420.2,Jazmin,,exactly ,thank you that makes a lot of sense 
420.2,Chris,,so for student i'm just looking at your response ,so i was also going to say that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and stuff like that 
420.3,Chris,,"and for your response Chris, I would just like to ask you to just look a little closer into second paragraph. To see the exact equipment they used. ",gotcha okay yeah I can look close. 
150.1,Chris,,okay and then moving on for student i'm I just want you to look into it and find the evidence to support your answer. most of you have an answer so just basically look closer and it stated in the text but you just need to read it thoroughly to answer the question you had a great start Exactly. ,okay yeah i can look more closely and see what what else is going on because yeah i was just connecting to what i already do but i think i see what you're saying like i need to i need to look at the paper look at the reading and my kind of pull it from from there as well right now ok cool thank you 
150.1,Luis,,yes student ,so unfortunately we have to go to our next class but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us this was really fun thank you 
520.1,Luis,,ok so now that i have given you class some feedback i want you to think about how you started out thinking then how that changed and how you will apply what you learned in your next task so i'm gonna give you class a couple minutes to think about it and then we will go around in the circle answering so we can start with student and just to repeat i want you to state how you started out thinking how the strategy you used changed based on the feedback i gave and what you will do next time to make sure you are fully answering the question yes student ,um well i was gonna say i'm excited to share because i think i got it all figured out so i'm all good 
510.1,Luis,,"um well there's always room to grow for class when answering a question or doing an assignment so for your answer What do you think you can include after using a background knowledge to answer your question so after you use your background knowledge, what do you think what strategy, do you think you can use to help promote learning and answering the question. ",so i thought like i was thinking about what you were saying and you were telling me like i needed to look more closely at the reading and not just not just use my background knowledge so you know like it was an interesting question you know like what equipment do they use and so i was saying like oh they use like oxygen tanks and stuff which i do but then when i look at paragraph two i realized that the equipment maybe that they were really focused on was the lunar orbit and and then in paragraph three was the microscope so it looks like maybe i can read more closely in the um you know what i mean like in the reading to understand like what i'm trying to answer 
520.1,Jazmin,,exactly that's a great observation nathan and a growth strategy to continue with we're just going to go around student what do you think first you're going to say what strategy you used and how you will build on to it for your next assignment or task ,so for me what i noticed was that basically what you pointed out was that my answer was right but it was incomplete so like what i needed to do was make sure that well a that i was like saying like you know not just this small machine but like what this machine was and if i didn't say that theni didn't really answer the question because they were asking like what equipment and i just said small machine i didn't say like lunar orbiter you know what i mean 
120.4,Jazmin,,exactly great observation and another thing is if anything you can always use direct evidence from the text to answer your question as long as you use the quotation mark for the evidence but good job yeah exactly student ,can i ask a quick question 
120.4,Jazmin,,yes go ahead ,so i guess i was partially still a little confused only on one section and so i understand why this woman she like the lunar orbiter was what they used to discover the water and i was wondering like if they use the microscope as well you know like student and oliver's answer like it seems like that might be an answer and i guess i was confused like why that might not be the right answer 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay yeah no problem so the reason why it wasn't the answer we were looking for is because we wanted to know the machine that help find the water and the microscope after they found the water they use a microscope to look closely at it so the microscope help them to see the water better but i did it help them find the water ,makes perfect sense thank you so much okay that makes sense i'm not confused 
120.4,Chris,,student what about you ,um i think for me like what i noticed is like kind of similar to like i i bring a lot of my like background knowledge because i know all about this stuff but i wasn't reading as closely about the question because i was saying like you're saying this craters full of water moon and they use oxygen tanks and stuff like that but they didn't i didn't say really the answer i said like that they found the craters and then they use this other stuff but i didn't really say like what it meant that they fought with just what you've been pointing out to class so i think that that's why my answer was incomplete 
120.4,Oliver,,yeah exactly and similar to what i said to the other two students Oliver What about you? ,i'm so actually i understood a lot so i was thinking about it and then when you were talking to student and jasper it really made me think that like i'm i understand now that like when i said that they use the microscope just like the statement survey and i said i realized that they did use it but first they had to find it so i didn't read the question as closely as i could but what you pointed out was that i needed to read it closely and understand what they were asking 
150.1,Oliver,,exactly and um always you class want to always build on each other's thoughts so even though if you agree or if you have the same thought you have to think of a way that you could either add on or ask questions yes student ,so i i read that they weren't going to try to build a moon base on the moon by like 2024 and it was just making me think like the questions always make me think of other things so i was wondering like when when should i bring in that like that knowledge and question like you know what i mean like because that seems like that would use a lot of equipment but i guess i guess it's not answering the question is that right 
420.1,Oliver,,"But we want to focus on exactly what the question is asking us, so we can answer it completely. ",Okay. 
520.1,Farrah,,and last but not least student what about you what do you think what strategy did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future ,so i started by saying that it was the microscope that they found the water with because i was so my thinking was if they couldn't see it they couldn't find it but when i read read it sounds like they had other sensors that could find the water then they studied it using the microphone so that's that's pretty cool and where it makes me think like going forward is that i need to think really closely about what it's asking because sometimes like when we take our our leap test it always is hard for me to know like some of the tricky answers like they asked like what's the best answer and i think i'm understanding that there's like you can still see an answer and it still is connected but like what's the best answer and it seems like the best answer was the lunar orbiter like you were saying the student because that's the best answer that says like how did they find it like maybe they proved it with the microscope and they sort of found it but like what did they do to even find that it was there like they didn't have a microscope like i thought there was an astronaut but with a magnifying glass on the moon but that's not at all what it was like they had a little machine so i think what i would do is read really closely and try to understand like what what they're asking 
150.1,Farrah,,exactly these are all great reflections and for the next text you can always think back to this and see how to build on yeah student ,so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i really wanted to thank you for a couple things that are really important in this class so like one thing that was really important as you help us understand our use evidence better so you really helped us to use evidence like in our answers so that we weren't just using background knowledge and also you have this there you know by by asking us what we were thinking that led to our answers you helped us understand like what we were doing right and maybe what we could do better and you also were so patient you let us explain our ideas and like you didn't interrupt this what we were trying to to understand and that made us feel really valued right class 
150.1,Farrah,,well that's what ,i felt really valued so i just wanted to share that that was something that up and then finally you also like give us your concerns so you let us know like exactly what we could work on which helped us because rather than saying like oh you need to just work on your answer you were like we think about like what you're saying think about what's be asked and then give your answer so that like helped us to have a much better set of answers thank you so much that was really fun working with you 
150.1,Luis,,hi class how are you ,i'm good 
150.1,Luis,,good awesome job awesome alright so um we remember the other day we read the text water on the moon do we remember reading that yeah awesome so the reason that we are meeting today is because we're going to try to work on your responses class did a great job yeah yeah student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
220.1,Luis,,i know that you know all about space but this isn't about learning about space it's about we're going to work on creating better responses when we read texts does that makes sense ,oh yeah yeah ok 
150.1,Farrah,,okay okay so we remember we read the text water on the moon remember reading that and digesting the text so in the text remember we we learned about how scientists found evidence that water can be found on the moon's polar craters these craters are in dark places that the sun never shines nasa which is the big space station that sends stuff to the moon does class know what microscopic means sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to to look for these polar craters that have the water in them and then we found the water but the water is microscopic microscopic means that you can't see it with your eye that you need a scientific tool called a microscope in order to see it does that make sense ,yeah we talked about we use a microscope in science class 
420.2,Jazmin,,yeah so um you all gave responses and i just want to like we want to meet in a class just so we can work on our responses does that make sense alright so we need to make when we are given a question remember the question that you class all answered was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon remember answering that question so there's just a few things that we need to work on in order to create better responses and better understanding of the text okay so one thing is we need to make sure that we are answering the question fully so the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon so what you want to say in your response is you want to say scientists discovered water on the moon by using blank equipment so we could say for an example we could talk about the microscope because they used it to see the water you can talk about the lunar orbiter that nasa sent those are some options yes student response is you want to say scientists discovered water on the moon by using blank equipment ,well i don't understand why my answers wrong because i did use one of the equipment 
150.1,Jazmin,,you did you said i remember your response you said that nasa sent a small machine which is good that you mentioned nasa but you said small machine and we want to be a little bit more specific we want to be specific on our answer and pulling things from the text does that make sense ,so after i have to write more stuff 
150.1,Oliver,,"Alright, so You said that scientists use a lot of equipment which is good. You, you talked about how they use equipment. But you said that they use oxygen tanks and oxygen tanks were not mentioned in the text. so if you class are having trouble thinking of an answer you know that you can go back to the text and look at the text that makes sense good also another thing that i noticed student i remember you said that you have the same answer as student and i don't want you to just say that you have the same answer even if your answer is going to be the same as the person next to you i still want you to say an answer because i want class to be giving an answer so i know where class is at learning so i can help you class further if you need it does that make sense ",okay it does it was just that it was exactly the same because she circled the last sentence and i circled the last sentence too 
150.1,Oliver,,and even if you circle the last sentence i still want you to say something it's for good participation and i want to make sure class says their answer ,okay 
110.1,Farrah,,all right and then so student you gave a really good response you said that use the tool a microscope to look really closely that's a good response but we just need to add a little bit more talking about and being specific you want to say that they used it to find the water because the whole purpose of the text is finding water on the moon we want to be using that good language and good vocabulary that we're learning from the text okay so in order to do that like in your response you you said they use the scientific tool called the microscope awesome awesome awesome job ,"So, i guess kind of like student i have to add more words "
110.1,Farrah,,add more words ,or i have to change my answer 
420.2,Chris,,You want to make sure that - it's all about being specific. You want to use good examples from the text. ,reach every readers i went to nasa 
140.1,Chris,,alright okay and then student you talked about how they found craters you went to nasa really ,yeah with my dad i went to nasa so i do know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits yeah they they they need a lot of equipment to go to the moon 
410.1,Oliver,,"that's awesome so i that's great that you have really good knowledge about nasa which can come in handy in the future but right now we're just going to focus on what's in the text and answering the question from the text but you didn't talk about the equipment all right so you said you talked about how the scientists found craters full water on the moon awesome that's what the text was all about finding water on the moon the question asked for you to talk about the equipment Yes, Oliver. no problem ",um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just met but i really do appreciate how you helped us to think about using more evidence from the text in our answers bye 
220.1,Luis,,bye class hi students how are you good okay awesome so we're here because i have concerns about each one of your guys's responses to the water on the moon passage and we're going to work on improving them yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i know all about space 
210.2,Jazmin,,"you may know all about space but this doesn't really have anything to do with learning about space it's going to be about improving our responses to questions when we read passages so the five of you just all told me what your response would be to the question so looking back the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so student and student the two of you in your responses mentioned actually student you as well so student student and student the three of you mentioned some type of equipment that was used So going back again, the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so the key words, and this is for all five of you, the keywords are equipment and discover water for the passage. so for the three of you student student and student when you go back and read i want you to go back and reread the passage with the question in mind Farrah you mentioned a microscope which is mentioned in the passage which is good, you just need to reread the question again and take it a step farther because i'm concerned that you didn't fully understand what the question was asking. student you said that nasa sent a small machine you're correct that nasa was mentioned so you got that part of it but um so i want you to go back and reread and be more specific because we want specific answers you didn't mention what type of machine you just wrote a small machine and that's not very specific and student you said that the scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks so oxygen tanks weren't mentioned in the passage so for you i just want you to totally um scrap the answer and we're just going to start fresh and new and we're going to improve and build so i want you to reread the question so for now student for you you said that scientists found water found craters full of water right and then look for equipment that helped to discover water so those are your keywords ",excuse me teacher i was looking and i still don't understand why my answer's wrong 
420.2,Chris,,so your answer it's not okay you're not it's not wrong you're just not fully there okay so um your you your answer was nasa sent a small machine so you're right about like a small machine is a piece of equipment you're right about that but it's not specific so rereading the question asking what equipment was used to discover water i want you to keep that question in mind and reread the passage to rework your answer so student back to you you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon correct yeah so i want you to reread the question because i don't think you fully understood what the question was asking so i want you to reread the question because i don't think you fully understood what the question was asking because your answer didn't have anything to do with equipment it just said that water was found on the moon as i've been saying to class those keywords equipment and to discover water on the moon is really really important when finding the answer in the passage so it's good to reread the question and go back to find those words to help you get the answer that you need and student for you you just said that you have the same answer as student and as i talked to student she said microscope which was mentioned in the passage but for you my concern is that you didn't have really your own answer you just said that yours was the same as student so i would love if you go back reread the question and then go to the passage and come up with your own answer because i want to know your own ideas and thoughts for the answer ,i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.3,Jazmin,,so student you may have gone to nasa but we're going to be focusing more on what the passage is saying because the question is specific to the passage has class had a chance to reread the question in the passage ,yeah 
210.3,Jazmin,,okay does class want to start ,okay well you told me that i have to be more specific so i have nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
110.4,Oliver,,awesome that is so so good that is what i wanted you to look for so in the passage you read that it talks about how nasa sent a lunar lunar lunar orbiter to investigate and then if you look at the sentence right after that it says this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater which is good awesome which shows that you now the equipment that was used was the lunar orbiter to help discover the water on the moon awesome student yes ,sorry to interrupt i was just looking at the time and it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later 
230.3,Luis,,okay bye bye hello how are you class good awesome so we just read the passage that is called water is a valuable resource and the five of you had answered the question that is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable so the reason that the five of you are with me today is because i have some concerns about your responses that i would like to address so we can improve on them so you class can better understand how have a better of understanding of how to answer questions that are given to you after reading a passage awesome so i have a specific little notes for each of you so let me start off with student student you said no not for a long time for the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable so student yes ,okay i think i got it now and i'm all good yeah 
110.1,Luis,,you do okay well give me one minute i'll keep i'm going to tell student what i want her to do and then i'm going to come to you ,ok 
210.2,Farrah,,and i'm going to tell you exactly what i what i want you to do and i want you to apply that you may understand it now but i still want to tell you my concerns just so you and i are both on the same page okay so student back to you um so the question is is there evidence and you said no not for a long time so the reason that the question is saying is there evidence is when you read the passage i want you to go back and look at the question so the question says is there convincing evidence that water can be valuable ok so the word evidence what is it what is evidence can you tell me what evidence is ,it's like facts 
120.4,Chris,,facts yeah yeah so it's facts information details that can help so and then is there so is there facts that can show if water is valuable what does the word valuable mean can class tell me ,valuable means like has a lot of value 
120.4,Luis,,yeah so ,like it's worth a lot of money like money 
210.2,Jazmin,,yeah so when we think of value most of the time we think of money so valuable can also be something that we need so something that can be helpful helpful is another word instead of using valuable it's something that's helpful to us so is there evidence that let's rework the question just a little bit so it can be easier to understand because there are some big words in there like evidence and valuable so is there facts information that can help the water that water on the moon can be helpful to us Jazmin yeah. ,i think i did that so i don't know why my answers wrong 
230.3,Chris,,"let's let's take a look at yours and then we'll go to luis's um you said that yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water so you yes you did but there are some more evidence that can be used and also you said how you can't survive without water which is right we all know that's a known fact but i just want you to go back and look for more specific evidence because there is more stuff where you can be super super specific so reread the question and go back into the passage to find more specific evidence so you had said that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen you are right that is from the passage so you did get that from the passage which is good but you didn't answer the question so i know i know so the question said is there evidence that water can be valuable so, as I was just saying to Jazmin she said that for in the future astronauts can. ",I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024. 
230.2,Chris,,really i didn't know is that did you get that from the passage ,no no me and my dad have been reading about aviation and we went to nasa and i read that maybe they could put some a base up there so it'll make things easier 
110.1,Chris,,yeah so which is why we this passage is pretty important since we need to know if the water and nasa can be valuable to us so going to you i'll go to you next and then student i can talk to you ,yeah yeah 
120.1,Oliver,,student you said water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore so did you get the part about water being heavy from the passage okay so your answer you're almost there you're almost there so you talked you got stuff from the passage but there is evidence from the passage that can be used on why it is so why water can be valuable i want you to like for class else go back and reread because in the small the first paragraph is where you got that from where it says water is heavy and it can take up a lot of room on the spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and other things which is good because it's pretty much what you wrote in your response but that it doesn't really explain why water being on the moon would be valuable it's almost there you're almost there but you just need to reread the question and reread the passage because there is more information that you can use to include student what's up it's your turn ,yeah well i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go but i was listening to what you're telling class else and i think you did help me think about if i'm answering the question and to try to find all the evidence and the answer yeah I think I think I know that that's what I need to do. 
220.1,Luis,,okay bye hi class so today i heard you read water on the moon is that correct class did class read yes ok so i want to revise our answers because i saw you had an understanding of it but i didn't see that you had a deep deep understanding so we're going to try to fix that today so i want one yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Oliver,,well that's ok because we'll all learn all of us are learning anyway so all of us are going to keep learning so that's ok if you're in this class you're going to join us i'm happy for you to join us today so i want student to go first and i want him to remind me of what his answer was ,yeah sure ok so i circle the last sentence in the text you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Oliver,,right ok now that is correct but i want you to look i want class to look on paragraph 2 where it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small do you think that this refers to the question at all ,well i'm thinking because you're asking that maybe it does 
210.4,Oliver,,yes so we're we're going to look at i want class to look at the machine it's referencing to and i want someone to tell me what the machine it's referencing to ,the machine is the lunar orbiter 
130.2,Chris,,student let's have class look first before you share class besides class else student what did you come up with ,in that paragraph two it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
150.1,Chris,,so would you think that would be a form of equipment used by nasa ,yeah because a machine is equipment 
120.1,Jazmin,,so i want someone else to answer my question again previously what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and i want someone to revise their answer from last time so student do you want to try ,well i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
110.1,Jazmin,,ok well if you think your if you had the answer then someone else who didn't have that answer want to try again ,ok 
130.2,Luis,,good job for knowing the answer class else want to try student do you want to go yeah go ahead ,so i feel like the answer is lunar orbiter 
230.2,Luis,,ok now i want you to give me specific detail from the text about why you think it's lunar orbiter ,ok so it says that nasa's sent a small machine called a lunar orbit well i mean and you told us to look at this paragraph so 
210.4,Luis,,what does it do though so what does the machine do ,it investigates 
210.4,Luis,,what does it investigate ,lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits ice deposits in a large polar 
210.4,Farrah,,i want someone else to answer this do you think ice deposits correlate with water by any chance ,oh yeah right oh yeah because ice is just frozen water 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah exactly so going back to what student said the machine looks for ice deposits so does class can class understand that ice deposit is water they're looking for does class agree with that ,yeah i wasn't thinking about that i was just looking for the word water and i didn't even think about the fact that oh yeah like you said today and ice and water is the same 
420.2,Luis,,good point of the storywise they were looking for ice deposits but ice deposits are water so that's the important part of the reading so going back to what student said again student if you want to try to finish your statement because you're on the right track that the lunar orbiter is a small machine but what does it do to answer the question in context ,it look and looks for ice deposits 
210.4,Luis,,yeah and what are ice deposits ,frozen frozen water yeah frozen water 
210.3,Luis,,so what is the overall goal with this machine i want you to say it in one complete sentence for me ,ok so the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit 
110.4,Luis,,yep ,and ice deposits are frozen water 
110.4,Luis,,yes so that is the equipment ,oh yeah yeah 
110.4,Chris,,go ahead ,i know i know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and 
120.1,Farrah,,yeah that's really interesting yeah that's really interesting but that's not really quite part of our reading but that's really it's something interesting to share with the class i'm really glad you shared that does class else want to try the question again besides student that thought maybe their answer wasn't up to par from last time maybe student do you want to try it student do you want to try ok ,"i'll try ok so the lunar orbiter sends the lunar orbiter OK. NASA sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter-- OK, OK, OK. OK. The lunar orbiter-- the lunar orbiter to investigate ice deposits. "
120.1,Farrah,,yup continue you're doing good ,ok 
210.4,Farrah,,and what are the ice deposits ,they're very small oh ice ice deposits are frozen water 
210.4,Farrah,,yes ice deposits are frozen water and so they use that equipment to what ,to find them to investigate to investigate 
210.4,Farrah,,to investigate what ,the ice deposits 
210.4,Oliver,,the water because the water is the ice deposit so they're using it to investigate the water on the moon does class have any questions about that ,i don't have any questions but i did look at the clock and i see that it's time for us to go to lunch 
210.4,Oliver,,ok inaudible ,oh you're welcome i wanted to say thank you for really helping me to think more about how to find more evidence in the story to put in my answer so thank you for that 
150.1,Jazmin,,yes bye hi class so today we're going to be looking at questions from our readings class know what i'm talking about yes good okay so our first question is what the equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon now before you share the answers with the class i want you to independently for one minute circle keywords or words that you think are important in the question i want you to circle them and then i want you in one minute to share back with me what you circled is class done ,yeah 
120.4,Farrah,,ok so what keywords did class circle ,i circled equipment and water 
120.1,Jazmin,,okay what else ,i circled water and moon i circled equipment 
210.2,Chris,,ok what else equipment as well okay so the two words that i think are the most important that i heard from was equipment and the second word would be discover does class know why discover would also be an important word in the question ,because it's an action word 
210.2,Chris,,it's an action word yes because what what are we doing what is the question asking ,what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.2,Luis,,so they're trying to discover the water does class agree so now i want class to look at the reading yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Oliver,,oh that's okay because we're still revising our answers and i know you had an answer to the questions so that's okay you're going to learn anyways i appreciate you sharing that so we're going to look at the reading and the first part and i want you to circle again independently equipment that you see listed in the reading ok everyone's done so i want some people to share what equipment they circled student you can go first ,i circled ah microscope 
110.1,Farrah,,microscope ok ,i circle microscope too so i don't understand why my answer's wrong 
130.2,Jazmin,,well it's wrong in a sense that we're going to get to in a moment i want before we get into that i want class else to share any other equipment they may have circled class else ,i circled two i circled small machine and lunar orbiter 
120.3,Luis,,so that's correct so now we're going to reflect on what student shared there so i want class to look at lunar orbiter and read the first and second sentence of paragraph two class want to read out loud the first second sentence of a paragraph about the lunar orbiter ,i'll read it i'll read it ok nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
210.4,Oliver,,thank you so much so when we look at the second sentence we can see ice deposits does class know what ice deposits are have a guess what is deposits are ,oh maybe like ice that gets put down somewhere 
120.4,Farrah,,okay class else class else have any guesses no it's ok so is there any similarity between ice and water does class know the similarity between ice and water go ahead ,ice is frozen water 
210.4,Chris,,ice is frozen water so ice so ice and water on the same thing they're both water just in different forms so going back to what student said earlier nasa a small machine called a lunar orbiter that is a type of equipment so going back to farrah's question before when you said why is the microscope the wrong answer well the microscope is looking for something and i want you go ahead student ,well i'm sorry to interrupt but it just made me think of something yeah so i went to nasa and so i saw that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and mask and suits 
130.2,Jazmin,,yes yes that's a good point but we're focusing on the equipment they used to find the water not what they wear we're looking for something to find it but that as a good point thank you for sharing so i want to get into some small groups really quickly so i'm going to put with student and student and then student student student are going to work together and i want you to compare and contrast the difference between the lunar orbiter and microscope ,Okay um so. i have a lunar orbiter as my answer okay yeah i didn't have that one i'll look at all the paragraph three again the water they found is microscopic you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely okay so that's pretty much easy you know you use a microscope to look really closely okay and then for the lunar orbiter thing it says the lunar orbiter will look for ice deposits so they're both looking for things okay and well it says that the lunar orbiter okay so they both look for things and it says that the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater and the microscope looks really closely at water i mean i guess that's different except it's also the same 
210.4,Oliver,,okay so i want class to come back to class for a second come back into class i noticed from your small groups that you class are talking about you class are looking but the way it's written in paragraph two they first use a lunar orbiter to look for the water then they use a microscope i want you class to think for a second in your head about why they would use a lunar orbiter before they would use a microscope i want you to think go ahead student ,i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but it's time for us to go so okay love to finish later 
220.1,Luis,,okay thank you hi class so today we're going to be revising our answers from the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon class had a good understanding of the reading but i do want to work out answers just a little bit because i think we're getting a little confused between two big aspects so first before we share our answers with the class i want you to independently for one minute look at the question yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
210.3,Farrah,,that's okay student because we're revising our answers and we're all learning today so i appreciate you sharing that it's okay you can be in our class so looking back at the first question i want you to independently for one minute i want you to circle any keywords or important words that you see in the question that you think are important i want to do that for one minute and then come back does class want to share what words they circled student you can go first ,i circled equipment and water 
210.3,Oliver,,okay student what did you circle ,i circled the same thing i circled equipment and water 
210.3,Jazmin,,okay class else any other words yes student ,well okay i guess it's the same thing i circled equipment 
210.3,Luis,,you only circled water what about you student you're one who hasn't shared yet what did you circle ,i circled equipment and the moon 
210.3,Jazmin,,okay okay so yes student ,i forgot i thought that i only circled equipment but i actually circled equipment and scientists 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay all of these answers are correct but i want to look at the word equipment and the second one i noticed no one circled was discover does class know why discover would be an important word in the question because it's an action word because the scientists are discovering water but how does sorry discovering it that's the action word excuse me sorry i was confusing so now what i want you to do so i want you to look at the reading and looking at the reading i want you to circle the moon is a desert and we're looking at the reading the moon is a desert and i want you to circle any important equipment that you see in the reading i want you to do this with a with a small class so student and student can do it together and student student student can also be a small class and i want you to circle any equipment you see in the reading that you think is important and then i want you come back in one minute ,okay um so the first one that i see is the small machine teacher i don't understand why my answers wrong 
130.2,Luis,,i'm not saying any answer's wrong right now i just want you to collaborate with your peers because they all have different answers then you so i want you to collaborate with them okay thank you for the question ,ok all what do you see ok well student i see a small machine that's equipment okay i'll circle that one ok class i'm going to circle small machine like student said they've got microscope in here that's equipment okay i'll circle that too reach every reader okay we're done 
210.4,Luis,,ok you're done so from what i've heard from you class you class circled two words the first word was microscope and the second was the small machine does class know the difference between these two types of equipment anything any guesses is fine from what you see in the reading student go ahead ,yeah well i mean i think that microscope is like small well a small machine could be small too ok then they're the same well they could be the same they could be the same 
210.4,Farrah,,does class know why they might be different luis's on the right track but does class know why they might be different look at the reading i want you to look at the reading i want you to think why they might be different it might help you ,well no it says on the small machine is called a lunar orbiter 
210.4,Chris,,that is correct what about anything else class else noticed anything in the reading ,it said that the lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits you know what teacher i was i went to nasa and i know that scientists used a whole bunch of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
410.1,Jazmin,,but student you're on the right track with finding ice deposits does class know the similarity between ice deposits and water yeah that is correct but that's what they wear we're looking at what they used to find the water ,ice is frozen water 
210.4,Oliver,,ice is frozen water and ice ice and water are the same thing because they're both water and from what we know in the reading that the small machine called the lunar orbiter is finding ice deposits which are really what are they really ,they're really small 
210.4,Oliver,,they're really small what else are they what are the ice deposits what did we just say ,oh they're water they're water 
210.4,Luis,,so the lunar orbiter is finding what we're funding water so do you think does that make any sense so what is the microscope what does the microscope do ,we use the microscope you know to look at really small things in science class 
210.4,Farrah,,so what are we using the microscope in this reading what are they using the microscope for in this reading ,i wrote this one in my answer they're using the microscope to look really closely at the water 
210.4,Oliver,,at the water that's right student so they already found the water when they use the microscope so the microscope isn't the right answer because the water's already been found before they use the microscope so if you have any questions about that if you don't understand why the microscope would be the wrong answer no so no so what are they using the find the water ,they're using the lunar orbiter to find the water 
210.3,Oliver,,so what is the answer to our question you just said it ,scientists used the lunar orbiter to find water on the moon 
130.3,Oliver,,that is that is correct so the reason why we did this was because people were thinking the microscope is what we were using to find the water but in reality it was because we're using the small machine the lunar orbiter to find water does class have any questions about that ,no no and i i was i just want to say aw thanks teacher it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to thank you for when you when you kind of helped us keep looking at the story and thinking about what the meanings of the words are i think that kind of helped me to think about the answer okay bye 
150.1,Luis,,hey class i'm so i just heard your great responses i just wanted to touch base and maybe see if we can get a deeper understanding we have a great start but we there's a couple pieces were missing so can we work together to do that yeah ,yes excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,okay well i pulled you aside because me as the teacher i saw that maybe we could all help each other get a deeper understanding of space ,okay 
150.1,Luis,,that makes sense ,i guess 
150.1,Luis,,all right no one's wrong i want to make that very clear no one's wrong we're just getting a deeper understanding of why your answers are right does that make sense ,um maybe i think 
150.1,Farrah,,so student would you mind if i started with yours ,no i don't like 
410.2,Farrah,,all right so you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look more closely that's right you picked up wonderfully in the part where they asked what equipment you would need so you said i know what equipment you need you need a microscope to look really closely you had the what and the why one part you were missing though is what they were looking at what they were looking at so what were they looking at closely ,water 
420.2,Farrah,,Could really just push through your answer. That makes sense. ,so i just got to add at the water all my all my sentence 
420.2,Farrah,,um yes so just make sure when you're writing answers like this you need to be very clear about the what and the why so you had part of the what you just needed the second piece ,okay 
110.1,Oliver,,and student you said you circled the same as student ,uh huh 
230.1,Oliver,,can you explain what that means ,when she read her answer she had circled the last sentence i'm an animal story and i i circled the last sentence and the story to 
230.1,Oliver,,why did you circle the last sentence ,"on cars well though the question asked about equipment and so i was looking for like an equipment and and i saw the microscope and i know that that's equipment of course we use it in science class Um, well, I think I understand that. i think so "
150.1,Oliver,,i didn't see you didn't i just want to make sure that we're on the same page ,oh 
150.1,Jazmin,,so you're right on what you said again just make sure you have all those pieces yes student i'm sorry i see your hand what's up ,i don't understand why my my answers wrong 
130.1,Jazmin,,it's just we need more specifics right so when we're answering questions like this you need to have the specifics you don't necessarily have to take the whole paragraph you read answer is not wrong so you're on the right path you just need a bit more so that makes sense ,oh yeah 
130.1,Jazmin,,so when you huh ,um i guess i don't know what more just write more words 
210.4,Jazmin,,all right so it's okay so you said nasa send a small machine what was the machine called look back to the reading ,the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Jazmin,,right so and do you know why based on the reading they sent the lunar orbiter so they sent a lunar orbiter to look for something in the craters what were they looking for ,deposits to look for ice deposit and a large crater 
210.4,Jazmin,,right so when we're answering questions like this you need to have the specifics you don't necessarily have to take the whole paragraph you read student can you one minute i'm almost done with student and i'll get right with you okay so student when you're looking at these answers you need to be able to look at the what they're asking for so you got the equipment next time just make sure if it has a name include the name look at the what they're asking for so you got that you got you got the equipment So like the Lunar Orbiter. OK. ok ok so ,"just at the name You say, i need more details Okay, okay. "
210.4,Chris,,student thank you for patiently waiting ,no problem i just wanted to tell you that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and lots of other stuff to 
110.1,Chris,,they do use a lot of other stuff like that um so your answer you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon so ,"I mean, I know Jazmin said something about a lunar orbiter. "
210.4,Chris,,why don't we look at the reading student let's look at the reading together okay so what does it say in the second paragraph ,nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large pool of crater these ice deposits are very small scientists say one of the top layer of the moon surface will hold in total about 32 ounces of water 
210.4,Oliver,,that's good thank you for reading that it was very helpful so looking back in that what did you find what kind of equipment yes student ,i'm sorry to interrupt i'm teacher i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch um i know it was a really short time but i did appreciate how are you you asked us to a look more at the text to add more evidence from the text tool to our answers thank you for that 
210.4,Oliver,,no question ,okay bye 
210.4,Farrah,,hi friends how are you can you class hear me ,yes okay can you hear us 
210.4,Farrah,,now i can yeah ,great we're excited to work with you today 
120.2,Luis,,i'm excited to work with you so we're going to focus on the question what do a quick what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon yes student ,i'm excuse me i should be and best class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,oh that's awesome we're going to really dive into this material and you're probably going to learn something you didn't already know you knew so we're going to still stay in this class and work together and then by the end you probably could teach me something about space ,yeah sounds good 
120.4,Jazmin,,you can look over what you have and then we're going to come back together and we're going to answer the question alright perfect so i'll give you class a second if you want to read the first three paragraphs just read if you class have any questions at any point you can just raise your hand and i can answer all right perfect which student wants to speak out first about what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon student ,i said nasa centers small machine 
230.1,Jazmin,,okay so what made you say that why did you say that ,well i said because there's a sentence at the beginning of part two that says that 
420.2,Jazmin,,and that was great to use the reading to help us with our answer awesome so i see what you did so if you keep reading that sentence why did nasa send that to the moon what about it what about the water did that did they need to send something to the moon for do you know why but we need to be a little more detailed ,they needed it to investigate the craters 
120.3,Farrah,,they did so we're going to look at the next paragraph after that paragraph three it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely student ,um yeah so i sent a microscope that was my answer um so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
150.1,Farrah,,but we it's not complete so there's a little bit more that we need to add to your answer to make it complete you're almost there but we just need to make it a little bit big we need to make it a little bit more detail so your answers not wrong that makes sense ,yeah i just don't know what to add 
120.4,Farrah,,yeah so what did you said your answer was what can you tell me again ,yeah my answer is you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
130.2,Jazmin,,but we can add a little bit more so we could say nasa send a small machine called a what does class know what that what it's called that they sign awesome so that's what it says in the text which is great that we used our resources do you class know what did nasa send to help investigate student ,they sent the small machine 
210.3,Luis,,yeah what was it called ,i know 
120.2,Luis,,who was that student what is it called ,lunar orbiter 
210.4,Luis,,perfect so nasa send an lunar orbiter to investigate and they needed that they were using that to help discover the water on the moon what do we know about the water can you see it with your eyes ,no it's too small 
210.3,Oliver,,so student you have one part and student had the other part and we need to add it together right it's too small so they needed to use a tool called a microscope to view it so can someone new share out what our new sentence could be that helps answer this question in a lot of detail student ,i'll try okay um so for the equipment the scientists used the machine called the lunar orbiter and a microscope 
210.3,Chris,,I Chris. ,well so i i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.2,Luis,,"For this question we're talking about what equipment, did they use to help discover water on the moon. so you class now that we've gone over this again and really dove into this material and answered the question and looked at it in different views can you class understand do you class understand what was used what scientists used student ",i'm sorry yeah i mean they use the orbiter and they use a microscope but i also know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for water and definitely using oxygen tanks so i think chris's right 
110.3,Luis,,no okay well see i told you we're going to teach me something about space that i didn't know and there it is nice job ,so we could say like all of the equipment for the answer 
230.1,Luis,,you could say can you explain what you mean ,yeah so i could say lunar orbiter and microscope and oxygen tanks and masks on suits 
120.2,Luis,,so while oxygen tank and a mask and suits are part of the equipment they use for this question we're only focusing on what they use to discover water on the moon so yes they did use masks and suits and oxygen tanks but to discover water on the moon remember what they used ,just the orbiter and the microscope 
210.3,Oliver,,microscope yep that's right so do you see how they're a little different so while they did use the things that we talked about suits and mass and oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon they only use a lunar orbiter and a microscope ,i'm really sorry but we have to go now 
120.3,Luis,,okay perfect thanks for working with me i enjoyed our time together you class know what we're gonna do is we're going to focus on the question i'm sorry i lost it is there convincing evidence that water is on what on the moon could be valuable so before we share our responses and possibly revise and change them i want you class to reread and look at the paragraph four five and six in your reading once you class are done we can look at we can keep going with this lesson ,um excuse me 
120.3,Luis,,yeah student ,um i think i got this all figured out saw on god 
120.4,Luis,,oh well i really want to work with you because i want to hear how what your answer is and i want to know what we can do to make it even better teacher but then i also want you to tell me the evidence that you have that makes you that made you come up with this quick answer so i'm going to ask you to look at i'm going to have you told me your answer ,okay you want me to say it now okay um my answer is water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and that is right from the story 
230.2,Luis,,listen can you show me where you found that can you tell me where you ,paragraph five agile oxygen hydrogen can also be used 
210.2,Luis,,okay so i see where you're coming from but let's think about this a little differently we're trying to see is there convincing evidence that could it be valuable do you know what the word valuable means ,like important 
120.3,Luis,,and then we're going to come back together and figure out a really strong answer as a group that answers the question completely sound good. what i want you class to do is to look at that reading one more time ,okay 
210.4,Jazmin,,perfect alright can one of my friends tell me in the first paragraph in paragraph four in that sentence there's something that tells us about why the water having it there could be important can someone tell me why it could be valuable that the water is already on the moon student ,oh well and they drink 
210.3,Chris,,they could drink it yeah so if astronauts right now it's something about the water there what do we know is the water light or heavy student ,on it's heavy and that was my answer oh they don't have to carry the heavy water in the ships if it's already on the moon 
230.3,Farrah,,exactly so that's one of our possible answers that could be one reason why it could be valuable is that it's heavy so if it's already there they already have access to it and they don't need to worry about bringing it to the moon student student ,i i'm kind of confused 
230.1,Farrah,,yeah what are you confused about telling me ,well my answer is that i'm there it's not ready it won't be ready for a long time 
230.1,Farrah,,what won't be ready ,the water on the moon 
230.2,Farrah,,so be ready what made you choose that answer can you tell me the evidence that you had from the book that made you think that ,yeah um so like the last part of part six it says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money so i don't think it's that valuable 
430.3,Farrah,,you don't think it's valuable so i see where you're coming from because it does say right here that making a plan will take a lot of time and money but that doesn't mean that it's not valuable it just might take some extra time and work so so student can you look back at your text and find me one piece of evidence that tells us why it is a good thing if there's water on the moon ,okay oh okay um oh well this is interesting okay the moon can serve as a stop as crafts to refill their gas tanks 
210.3,Farrah,,that's true but how does that relate to water ,i don't i don't know 
210.4,Farrah,,it doesn't totally relate to water but that is a really cool fact so student i want you to read this paragraph and the fourth the fourth paragraph i want you to read it right here and it says i'm in the last sentence can you read that last sentence and tell me in paragraph four and tell me what that sentence means to us so why do we know that can you read that ,i'm having water on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things 
210.3,Farrah,,exactly so what does that mean how is that valuable ,well it could bring more astronauts they don't have to put the water on the ship 
230.3,Oliver,,that is student and we know that water is heavy so if there's less space for water than we can bring more people that's awesome a student ,um well i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
230.2,Oliver,,did you read that in the article ,i read it online and well if there's water on the moon it sounds really believable but there could be a base there in three years 
210.3,Jazmin,,"that's really cool i appreciate you telling us and teaching the rest of our students that fact that's a really cool fact alright my friends let's look at the last sentence it says So, knowing that we could have more people on the spacecraft knowing that water is really heavy and knowing that water um and knowing that it's already there, so people could drink it do you guys think that it's valuable that there could be water there. student ",yes i think it's valuable because you can't survive without water and that's very valuable 
110.1,Luis,,yep 100 true student ,um yeah i i also think it's valuable because if you split the water like i said i'm astronauts can i can breathe the oxygen 
110.1,Chris,,awesome student ,you yeah yeah it's valuable i think having more money the spacecraft's definitely valuable 
110.1,Oliver,,perfect so now that we've taken the oh yes ,um well i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch now what i want to say thank you so much for giving every one of us the space to share our responses and opinions it really felt like you cared what we had to say and some teachers don't make us feel like that so thank you so much 
150.1,Luis,,of course thank you hi class so i liked hearing your responses about the water on the moon text but i brought us all together just because some of us yes student ,i'm sorry to interrupt excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,well we're all here together because we're going to deepen our deepen our understanding of what we thought of the text so i think that we all have a reason to be here together so just listen to what i have to say please ,all right okay 
210.4,Farrah,,student so i really liked your response you said that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and do you remember what we were looking really closely at ,water 
410.2,Oliver,,yeah that's great and student i noticed that you said that you circled the same as student so this was an activity where i kind of wanted you class to discuss the question of what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon could you tell me what you think i really wanted to hear your personal thinking and what you thought the answer to the question was not what student thought ,yeah cuz you asked her for her answer first and she circled the same thing that i did have i circled the last sentence which says arm you need a scientific poll on a microscope to look really closely 
120.2,Oliver,,yeah so i just wanted what do you know what the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon was ,i think it's the microscope but i guess since we're in this class it's not the microscope but i thought it was the microscope 
210.4,Oliver,,so the microscope really did help it helps you see something really tiny and if you remember in the reading we learned that they discovered that there was water on the moon but it was so small that they had to use a microscope to see it ,okay 
150.1,Oliver,,do you understand ,by water we're so small they have to use a microscope to see it 
210.4,Chris,,yeah perfect and student i also really liked your response but do you remember what the scientists used to find in the craters to find the craters ,what do they use to find the craters 
210.4,Chris,,yeah ,no i don't know i mean i know a lot about space but i don't know that 
130.2,Jazmin,,does class in the class remember reading about what they use to find the craters ,well i put in my answer that nasa sent a small machine i don't know why my answer is wrong 
130.3,Jazmin,,all right so yeah you're right they did send a small machine but just so class knows the small machine that nasa son was the lunar orbiter does class remember hearing the lunar orbiter ,oh yeah i read that part too 
310.1,Luis,,"yeah so the lunar orbiter was small machine that was sent from nasa to help discover the craters on the moon I knew you were using your background knowledge because in the reading, we read, we didn't read anything about oxygen tanks, but you knew that when you're on the Loon. You need to have oxygen to be able to breathe, right? ",yeah yeah 
210.4,Luis,,so can you think of any of the equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon ,i'm on the thing that i'm like student said or maybe that you said are student your set i don't know um i think that that's probably the equipment the thing that they said 
130.2,Jazmin,,do you want to add student what was the equipment that you had said that may be luis's thinking about ,it was lunar orbiter 
130.2,Oliver,,yeah and ,i yeah yeah so that was it 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah and do you remember what the lunar orbiter did ,um it's a center 
110.1,Oliver,,yeah ,so it flies flies through space 
120.4,Jazmin,,does class want to help out student and tell him what the lunar orbiter was student student maybe ,and oh gosh i don't even remember what the question was now 
120.2,Jazmin,,we're just trying to help student remember what the lunar orbiter was ,okay student it says nasa send the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so it was a small machine that investigates 
210.4,Farrah,,and what did it and what wasn't looking for class remember that one ,oh ice deposit it's it's looking for ice deposit 
150.1,Chris,,yeah perfect so student just go back so the lunar orbiter was used it was a small machine sent by nasa to look for ice deposits and craters you understand ,okay yeah yeah yeah i got it oh i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots um lots and lots of different equipment 
230.3,Chris,,yeah you need a lot of different equipment to be able to go into outer space don't you ,yeah yeah 
120.2,Chris,,yeah so you know what equipment the scientists used to discover water on the moon oh yeah student ,hey i'm sorry no i will wait go ahead 
120.2,Chris,,are you sure you're all set ,yeah 
150.1,Oliver,,alright so does class have any confusion about what equipment the scientists used to discover water on the moon no yes student ,i don't have i don't have confusion but i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch um i know this was short and we just met but i really appreciate how you help us look for evidence from the text in our answers 
150.1,Luis,,start stimulation hi class so we're talking about how we just read the moon is a desert and i know that yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.1,Oliver,,we're going to learn even more so i'm sure you're in the right place so so so student i noticed that you said that you circled the same as student ,yeah so she went first i figure i don't have to say the exact same thing as her because i found that same answer 
230.1,Oliver,,And she went first and you're telling me that that's why you circled it but can you tell me why you what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon. ,yeah sure i have the same answer as her because i i think it's the microscope 
230.3,Oliver,,you think it's the microscope so sorry ,yeah yeah i do 
150.1,Oliver,,you understand why it's a microscope ,uh huh because looks like the teacher went offline so we'll wait a moment 
150.1,Oliver,,sorry could you just repeat what you were saying ,yeah sure so i was saying that i do think the microscope is right because it says i'm a water they found us microscopic blah blah blah blah you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
430.3,Jazmin,,so i can see why you think that the microscope is important but i do think that there's one thing that's just a little bit more important because it's the machine that was used to discover the water on the moon if you want to look in paragraph two and maybe scan it and tell me if you see anything that talks about the machine used ,teacher i don't understand why my answers wrong 
110.1,Oliver,,i'll get right to you in just a minute ,okay i see your machine called the lunar orbiter they don't say anything about that one off finding water 
210.4,Oliver,,so maybe i told let me just backtrack really quick all right so what it's really having us do here student is it's having us infer that they use the lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon so i can see why you are confused but am i helping you clear this up at all but the lunar orbiter help discover the water on the moon ,okay so i read a thing right and i'm i see where it says that it was looking for ice deposits i hold in total 32 ounces of water i mean they say but it could hold water but they don't actually talk about water in the first part 
210.2,Jazmin,,so at this point we're just trying to figure out what we what what what machine was used to investigate if there was water it's the water so microscopic that it's still drier than the desert so i'm just trying to get the answer of what equipment started is used to discover the water itself ,thats why i think mine is right teacher because i mean they did use that one and i think it that it was the ice is water so when they were looking for ice deposit they were looking for water 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah so student and i remember your answer was that nasa sent a small machine so i can i i wanna i wanna i noticed that you that you said you know that it's a small machine they said but can you tell me anything more about it like what did you find interesting about it maybe the name of the machine ,oh oh yeah the name is a lunar orbiter 
230.1,Luis,,"And then I want to talk, I also wanted to talk to Luis, you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. so can i just ask you what made you say that ",i know a lot about space astronauts can't breathe up there so boom oxygen tanks 
410.1,Luis,,"which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and do you think that scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon. ",oh um yeah no i guess they don't use that to discover water 
210.4,Luis,,so what do you think that the scientists used to discover water on the moon okay let me see maybe we could think back to the first reading ,oh okay yeah i see student why you said you didn't know why yours was wrong place yeah cause ice deposits is water 
150.1,Luis,,deposits well ice the ice has to it if we are well meaning one so but yeah a student is responsive originally was nasa send a small machine so she was able to gather that nasa did send a small machine and that's why me and student just spoke a little bit longer just to make sure student understood what the name of the machine was i'm just trying to so student do you understand what the name of the machine was and what it did ,yeah the lunar orbiter yeah perfect and i looked for ice deposits 
230.1,Chris,,perfect and now student i also wanted to talk to you you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon right so i want to i'm i just want to wonder what made you say that ,was looking for the keywords like how you said to student you know from the question because it talked about the question was asking about water on the moon so then in that first paragraph i saw that it was also talking about water on the moon 
410.1,Chris,,"But i'm just concerned that you are understanding the full question itself, because the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so my suggestion sorry. ",i was just gonna say that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
510.1,Chris,,But right now we're talking about this one question and my only suggestion my suggestion for you is. you told me before that what you did was you read you noticed that the word water was in the question so you scanned through and you looked for things that related with water ,"Okay, so different a different key word from the question. "
510.1,Oliver,,"machine, maybe. ",yeah i'm sorry teacher but it's time for the next class so we'll have to see you later okay 
510.1,Jazmin,,have a good day ,okay bye bye 
120.4,Chris,,hi class so we're going to go one by one on the text and you class can show me what are the equipment that the scientists use does that sound good so on the first text it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within moons create polar craters us craters are dark places that the sun never shines is there any what student what was your answer can you tell me again ,here that on the phone craters full of water on the moon 
210.4,Luis,,did they use any equipment going to look back at your text is it on your tablets ,excuse me 
210.4,Luis,,yes ,i shouldn't be on this class i already know all about space 
210.4,Luis,,oh that's okay it's always fun to be with groups do you did you see any textual evidence in the first quote that says anything about equipment ,um okay let me look again 
210.3,Chris,,student have you found anything ,no not in that paragraph i don't see anything about equipment 
210.4,Chris,,that's good there wasn't anything mentioned about equipment you want to move on to the next quote ,yeah yeah 
210.4,Farrah,,i'll we know nasa has sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks like a night looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small so vana can you point out any equipment used ,okay i'm saying small machine machine is like equipment lunar orbiter is to pass it on surface i'm just just a small machine 
210.4,Farrah,,just the small machine can you specify what they called it though ,oh yeah they called it the lunar orbiter that's great thank you 
210.4,Jazmin,,now let's move on to the last quote ,excuse me 
210.4,Jazmin,,yes ,that's what i have my i answer i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,um can you repeat your answer for me ,yeah i said that nasa found a small machine and that's the same thing student just said and you said it was good 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah you are correct student can you explain though to me i'm so in the text explains the lunar orbiter does something can you tell me what it does and how it helps scientists maybe ,lunar orbiter land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits it in a large polar crater 
110.4,Jazmin,,yeah that's what i was looking for your perfect ,oh ok 
120.3,Oliver,,for the third call it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic microsoft def can you tell me if they use any equipment in that quote microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need to scientific tool called the microsoft look very close ,know you'll be used the um the microscope cause that was my answer was a microscope yeah 
210.4,Oliver,,can you explain to me how the scientists use it to look for water maybe ,i'm yeah i'm okay and i said you may use a microscope to look really closely at the water yeah 
210.4,Luis,,that's right student what do you think do you agree with death or did they mention anything more about equipment ,mmm hmm okay i was kind of spacing out for a second there um what you say def i said but they use a microscope to look really closely at the water well i mean you do use a microscope to look at things but i don't know why they would bring a microscope all the way up into space i mean they usually use a microscope when they get back down or on their space shuttle or something i think i don't know i don't know about that one 
210.4,Luis,,i believe the microscope is attached to the lunar orbiter ,right oh i'm i'm all okay i don't know 
210.4,Chris,,yes student ,i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits 
140.1,Luis,,yeah has class else seen anything from nasa you can reach out so student has as well yeah yeah ,well i didn't go to nasa but i did um i've seen that in box yeah 
210.1,Chris,,did you see the lunar orbiter or microsoft that was referenced you can answer that student as well ,and we didn't see the lunar orbiter but we did see something also be sent up to the moon i don't remember exactly the name of it um oh yeah i don't remember the name of it but it was something small that they sent up to the moon before 
210.1,Chris,,yeah it's probably a s machine just like a little lunar orbiter ,i'm not clear on so which one is the right answer is usable microscope 
150.1,All,,because the question was what equipment the scientists use to discover the water on the moon so there's actually two answers and in the second quote it mentions the small machine called the lunar orbiter so that was the equipment that the nasa had sent up to the space it's equipment using it um help to find the water and then the second equipment that was mentioned in the quotes where the microscope because that's an equip up piece of equipment that can be used to help look at small little things and the water particles up on moon were so small you wouldn't even be able to see it with your regular eyes does that make sense ,yeah 
150.1,Oliver,,def what's up ,well i was looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thank you for asking us some good questions that made us have to look back at the story to see if we can actually back up what we're saying like i saw that student couldn't find equipment and then i think for student to what what they were saying so that was that was really helpful thank you 
150.1,Luis,,you're welcome have fun at lunch high class ,excuse me hi um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,um well actually you might know a lot about space but we're gonna go over what you class read in the text so it might be something that new that you might not know ,okay 
150.1,Luis,,all right um so have you class already read the text ,um yeah and i want you answered our questions so i'm not even sure why why we're in this class 
420.2,Farrah,,ok so the discussion question was what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon and your answers were okay um so i think so maybe you class do have a good understanding of the text but i think we can go dig a little deeper and relate the text to your answers and pull out evidence from the text in from the reading so do you class see anything that could support your answers from the text yes ,yeah in in in paragraph three is where i got my answer and i think it's supportive in in paragraph three 
230.2,Jazmin,,where specifically in paragraph three do you see that ,at the at the end of the paragraph um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely yeah um but i i don't understand why my answer is wrong i'm student i think the answer is the small machine like that's the right answer i'm not sure why mine a while i am in this class but i know that the correct answer is the arm the small machine or the lunar orbiter the small machine called the lunar orbiter is the correct answer 
230.1,Jazmin,,and student why do you think that is the correct answer to the question ,um cuz well we we got the answer sheet and so i know our answers didn't all get 100 on them and so that's why we got pulled into this class and so the teacher told us that was the answer so that's how come i know 
230.1,Farrah,,well ,fine if that's the right answer but still so how come my answer is not the right answer 
110.2,Jazmin,,actually i think i agree with savannas answer ,the question asked what equipment that they used to discover water on the moon and that's why i said i'm the small machine i that's why i picked the one from paragraph to because it says i'm that is going to investigate and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater and to look for ice deposits that that means like to discover them to find them for the first time 
110.1,Jazmin,,nice job student ,thanks 
110.4,Jazmin,,i think you've convinced me ,that i guess i still don't know how come i'm in the class kiss my answer was right i got it from the right place 
130.2,Oliver,,well i think you're thinking could benefit class else and how you just does class does class else want to explain why their answer could maybe be right ,well i mean in paragraph one it does say that there's the the the waters deep in the craters so i don't think i'm wrong either 
210.2,Chris,,that's true but the question is asking what equipment so craters full of water means what they found but we're asking what equipment was used so what tools do they use to find those craters ,well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks in suits 
130.2,Oliver,,yeah definitely they use all that stuff but specifically here in the text where do we where can we find that it talks about what tools they use to find those craters does class want to help student oh ,well i mean i i support what's the microscope cause my there's a tool as equipment and they're talking about looking at water and in that part of a story 
210.4,Jazmin,,that is true they are using the microscope to look at the water however i like how student really looked at the question and she looked at the word discover and when we think of discover we think how did they find water on the moon so although they did use a microscope to look at the to look at the water what did they use to find the water you see in the text ,paragraph to paragraph two oh 
130.2,Oliver,,student what do you think ,okay well i guess i gotta look in paragraph two ice depository small on top of the top layers i was just like for glasses blah blah blah on your original land look for deposits okay i mean i guess i see at an end that where they say they're going to look for deposits yeah i mean i think i think i think um but it isn't paragraph two because they say that the lunar orbiter is gonna look for the ice deposits so yeah i think jazmin's right okay okay um okay well it's it's time for us to go to lunch um anyway i know this was really short and we just met but i do really appreciate you having us to keep looking back i felt taxed and to think about the words and the question too i think about that helped me think about my answer something like i gosh i don't know 
130.2,All,,thanks class see you next time ,okay bye 
130.2,Luis,,good morning class ,good morning 
150.1,Luis,,so today we're going to be reviewing the answers to everyone's discussion question that we recently did over water on the moon yes student ,excuse me um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Jazmin,,you probably do know a lot about space however i think it's important that sometimes even if you know the material i think it's good to work on how we word things and just really working on our answering questions skills so this really helpful but yeah so today we're going to be reviewing the discussion question and answers that you class had over the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon does class have the text in front of them yes awesome okay so uh huh one second okay so does class want to explain their answer to the question initially yes student ,oh i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Farrah,,your answer isn't addressing what equipment the scientists used to discover water so first let's maybe dissect the question a bit to really understand the question so the question is asking what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon so let's think about the words in this equipment usually means tools or systems and then discover is another big word in there and discover means how did they find water so find something or know that it exists on the moon so what tools did scientists use to find water on the moon jazmin's answer was nasa sent a small machine let's go back to the text and see if that's true can class find in the text where it says where it talks about what tools they use to find the water ,well i mean in my answer i i said a tool uh the microscope because i use that to look at the water 
210.2,Chris,,"However, um, the, they did use the microscope to look at the water. however the question is asking how did they find the water so they use it to look at the water but what did they use to find the water ",okay so i saw the part where i found it in the story where i i saw it at the beginning of paragraph two and it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that was the equipment that i thought oh yeah i could see that because student said microscope for equipment and student said on the lunar orbiter for equipment 
310.1,Chris,,And thank you Jazmin for explaining your answer and using the text really well. ,and i went to nasa so i know that time does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits 
210.4,Luis,,"that's really good that you know all those things student those are really good things to know it's really interesting but back to the text um student i really like your And, yeah. They might -Also in the text, they don't really, when they say water, we don't really see the word water in the text, a lot right? Did you guys notice that? ",i noticed that too and that's why i oh i looked for the part that had the most stuff about the water yeah i didn't see that much 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah that's true right so they say that they looked for so that like student said they use the they use the small machine the lunar the lunar orbiter to investigate and they found water in ice deposits so ice is just dried up water and sometimes they the text is saying that in the third paragraph the water they found is microscopic so this in the beginning of the end of paragraph two they say ice deposits are very small and then when you think of microscopic microscopic means that they have to look through a microscope to to see it which means that it's really small if you put those two together you can infer or guess from that that ice deposits is where the water was stored so if that's where the water was what did they use to find the ice deposits can class tell me can class refer to the text ,um i don't think it's mine it's in paragraph two um it's ok i'm gonna look because i did see it oh yeah yeah you're right student it is um these eyes deposits are very small oh just like you said teacher oh scientists said that one of the yeah so so this paragraph's about the lunar orbiter yeah like i said so it's they use they use the lunar orbiter to find the ice deposits 
210.4,Oliver,,"Yes, Oliver. ",i'm sorry to interrupt teacher i know this was really short and we just met but it's time for us to go to lunch well i really appreciate how you made class feel so valued with their answers and how like you know i heard you tell student and student that they did a good job finding evidence from the text and then i remember now that i i picked the microscope because i was thinking about how it was looking at the water but you said to discover means to find the water and so you helped me think about what some of the meanings of the words discovered mean too so oh thanks so much it was really nice having you 
210.4,Luis,,really nice being here see you class soon hi class how's class doing today ,i'm good but excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,um that's interesting thing to say i don't think even science all like scientists that have studied space for years know everything about space ,i mean ask me anything i know i know everything that i need to know 
220.1,Farrah,,that can be true however today we're using science to drive our reading skills so we're actually going to be using science a reading about science and about as you class have done we're going to be using that reading and we're going to be reviewing our our responses to those questions and we're actually going to be using the reading as a to work on our reading skills so we're going to be learning but we're also about science but we're also going to be learning how to work on our reading and writing skills and how we work to break down questions and such um so i think does class remember their does class have their responses in front of them are remember what they said ,i couldn't remember it but i have it on my tablet i have mine on my tablet too 
120.4,Farrah,,awesome okay um so looking at the responses um does class and just raise your hand but does class would class like to share their response with us that they had yes student ,okay yeah i can share mine oh i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
110.1,Farrah,,okay awesome ,i don't understand why my answers wrong 
310.1,Farrah,,well i don't necessarily think any one answer was just outright wrong i think it was more that we can work on our answers to make them a little bit more to the expectation of using specific language that the text uses and as well as just working on our writing skills like i said to student earlier we're not just working on our science skills we're also working on our reading and writing skills so student i really liked in your answer that you mentioned the evidence from the reading you quoted the reading really well and i really liked that and you also found in the text where it talks about specific things that the question asks it talks about specific things that the question asks ,thank you 
120.3,Jazmin,,um would class like to read the question the first question for us so thank you for sharing thank you um would class like to read the question the first question for us okay yeah student ,i can read the question okay the question says what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon 
210.2,Oliver,,okay um so breaking down the question does class know what the word equipment means ,yeah it's like something that you use to do something like in pe class coach always says okay go get the equipment and then we get like the balls and thing 
210.4,Farrah,,yes that's a great example student thank you for explaining that to us so we're looking for the equipment that scientists used to discover on the moon so can class find in the text where it mentions um discovering where it mentions discovering water or discovering something on the moon ,i thought that that's why i thought my answer was right because in paragraph three it says the water they found is microscopic so that means that they found the water and and then they talk about the microscope in the next sentence 
210.4,Chris,,yeah so and i really like that you took us to a very specific part in the text student you are um you are on the right track you do mention the microscope yeah so we are microscope is part of that however um not to put you on the spot student but since we are a small class i think you just be comfortable maybe you sharing with us your res your response which i think points us to a different part of the text that also mentions um discovering something on the moon ,yeah sure and you know i also i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Chris,,yeah awesome and that's awesome knowledge and thank you for sharing that with us um just to redirect us bit back to the to the text and to the topic um ,it's in the first in the first paragraph 
210.4,Jazmin,,could you share with us where you found where you read um or just i can read your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon so could you like just show alright thank you so much so i think can class recognize that there are two places in the text that talk about where we find something or water on the moon ,and my answer came from the second paragraph so i guess it's all over the story 
130.1,Oliver,,huh yes student yeah we're just getting closer and closer to the answer ,i was just looking at that time so i'm sorry it's time for us to go so we'll see you next time okay 
130.1,Chris,,all right thanks for participating in the lesson today have a good one class hi class how are you sorry student are you gonna speak ,i was just saying hi 
130.1,Luis,,hi ,well i was gonna speak excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,yeah i don't think even scientists like scientists that have been studying space their whole lives know all about space space is so big ,i mean well i know a lot about space 
220.1,Farrah,,yeah that's awesome and um hopefully you can bring some of that knowledge into today's lesson i'm excited about that um yeah but we also are using today to not only does the reading help us know a little bit more about space like student knows a lot about we're also going to be using that reading to learn and to practice our reading and writing skills and understanding how to break down information that we might not even know about yet so how do we do that and stuff ,yeah we have it on our tablet 
210.2,Jazmin,,so to get started today um does class have the their materials in front of them the reading their responses just give me a nod or thumbs up awesome thank you student um so first i just want to start by saying um just reviewing the question real quick just so i can make sure that class knows what the question is um so the question that we're that we're going to be reviewing the answers for today are what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so does class know what the word equipment means ,yeah 
210.2,Oliver,,yeah can someone raised their hand and offer to explain it for us thank you student ,um ok equipment is ike what you use to do things so like in pe class coach always tells us go get the appointment and then we get like the balls and stuff 
210.2,Jazmin,,so yes that is what equipment is equipment is just some tools or machines that we use to decide to do an action yes that's a great example thank you student for that so for example in the text we can say that some of the equipment that astronauts use or maybe not in the text but just in general astronauts use helmets yes student ,ok i i used equipment in my answer so i don't understand why my answers wrong 
220.1,Farrah,,okay um well just by going over the word equipment i wanted to make sure that class knew what the word equipment was just because sometimes not class understands the question and then sometimes our answers are a little bit just they're in the right direction but they're not exactly meeting expectations so we just want to make sure that class is using the right language and class understands how to find the find the evidence for their answer and such um student you had your hand up well i was student you had your hand up ,well i was kinda gonna say the same thing as student because i used equipment and my answer too 
210.2,Chris,,yeah i would yeah just to reiterate what i said i think that a lot of people use a lot of good language in their responses um student and student you class really use a lot of nice language specific language from the texts that i really appreciate um however i think that some some mistakes that i saw across the board in some answers or maybe not some mistakes but just some places that class can work on um i believe is maybe just sorry i'm just going to backtrack a little bit um so class understands the question can somebody explain the question to me real quick ,i can 
210.2,Chris,,thank you student ,it asks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so it wants us to enter what what did the equipment well i don't know how to say it in another way yeah what equipment do they use to find water on the moon i guess is another way 
210.2,Chris,,all right thank you student yeah so what we can say what tools or what instruments did they use ,oh that's good yeah yeah you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
420.2,Chris,,that is really really cool information and i know the text references oxygen tanks too so that is really awesome for you to bring up thank you student just moving forward with the lesson but just some common mistakes i think are that some people just didn't use specific words from the text we want to really reference the text just so that we show that we found our evidence in the text you know i think it's important that when you say something you know you have evidence to back it up so in case somebody asked oh how do you know that how do you know this is true you can say oh i found it in this source or you can say you can quote the text um so would class maybe like to revise their answer and maybe just include a piece of evidence in there or a specific word ,well i know mine has some evidence from the text yeah mine too i pulled mine right from the story too 
110.2,Jazmin,,yeah that is very true you both do use very specific evidence um i think maybe we can student would you mind if we use your response ,no i don't mind 
210.4,Oliver,,now if we look at the text where it talks about These. these small the small machine can class find the name of the small machine and just raise your hand ,it's the lunar orbiter oh sorry i'll raise my hand it's the lunar orbiter 
420.2,Jazmin,,alright thank you student yes lunar orbiter so now that we now that we know that that that the expectation is maybe using more specific language student would you maybe like to revise your answer using one of the words that we just discussed or one of the phrases that we just discussed ,ok um nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter 
310.1,Oliver,,"is really, really nice way to phrase that. ",good excuse me teacher i was looking at the clock it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for explaining more that some of us needed to do a little bit more specifics from that text because i guess i didn't do that too like jamine so now i know 
110.1,Luis,,thank you class have a good one hi class so you class just finished reading water on the moon i noticed that and i also noticed that you class tended to have some answers that weren't thought about as best as i think you class can think about i think you class can come up with better better responses to the question that i'm asking because i know you class are super smart and you can do that all right so student you said that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look super closely and ,excuse me teacher 
110.1,Luis,,yes ,excuse me i should be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,i just want to make sure that you understand all of what what we just talked about and stuff and what we read this is just to help you understand just a little more i know you know all about space i'm i'm sure you all know a lot about space got is that alright okay awesome ,yeah yeah 
210.4,Jazmin,,alright so student you indicated that we would need a tool called a scien a scientific tool called a microscope to look super closely and if we actually take take a take a look back at the text you can actually see that that they that they do use use is so you can see that they are using a scientific microscope to look at it and that's true but we want to talk about what what else they used so yes they use the scientific microscope to look super closely at it but let's think about what else they used so if we look in the reading we can even see that that it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that's another tool and then now that we've all understood that we're going to need a scientific microscope like student said and now we understand that we're going to need a lunar orbiter to investigate and now we also can keep looking at the reading if we look in paragraph three we can see that they said that the water that they found is microscopic so if you were looking straight at it you wouldn't be able to see it so definitely what student said yes student ,i don't understand why my answer's wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,because well your answer is not wrong you're definitely well you class are all definitely right with your answers that you class that they did use a microscope they did send a small machine but what we want to do is we want to make sure that that you're using terms that are in the reading like just just like the ones that we just talked about like microscope like orbiter things like that so we want to make sure you're using the most strong vocabulary you can from the reading like orbiter things like that so we want to make sure you're using the most strong vocabulary you can from the reading does that make sense ,i have to add more vocabulary 
410.2,Jazmin,,yeah so what's your your response i'll read it to you was nasa send a small machine which is true nasa did send a small machine but i want to hear more specific answers like what kind of small machine that they sent we need to be able to understand what small machine it was because it tells you what small machine it is in the reading i just need to like we need to be able to understand what small machine it was because it tells you what small machine it is in the reading right ,see oh yeah nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter so it's called a lunar orbiter 
110.4,Jazmin,,yeah there you go so that's awesome ,oh that's it 
120.4,Oliver,,well they use an orbiter and then let's keep reading paragraph three in the last sentence that says you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really clearly so with that in mind who can tell me what are the two tools that we need ,that my answer i said that um the microscope already um ah but like just like sabrina did um and i guess the one that student said too 
120.4,Chris,,which is what like ,i went to nasa 
120.4,Chris,,who went to nasa student you went to nasa ,yeah so i know that scientists yeah me and my dad we went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too so they use a lot of different equipment 
210.3,Chris,,"that's really really cool so going off that the equipment that they used to find water on the moon you class all had responses that were definitely you class were all mostly right in your responses yes student you said you circled the same as student and that's right student did choose a correct objects But I want you to make sure that before you answer that you're looking at the reading you're reading all three of the paragraphs, you're definitely taking the time to look at the words that are being used. so student you're right you need a scientific tool called the microscope that's right you're right we also need a small machine called the lunar orbiter so that's that's so all you need to add is what other machines that they needed to use because i know you have really good words and you can use them and you're able to tell them i know you can tell me student i want you to be able to come up with your own answer in your own words the reading i know you can tell me what small machine they send and i know you can tell me what what they used to see it student ",yeah uh huh 
120.2,Chris,,i understand that you read the reading because you know that they found craters full of water on the moon but So I'm going to read the question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. ,ok ok 
430.1,Oliver,,so you didn't quite answer the question there you did say a fair point but the question really was what type of equipment did they use to see the water what type of machines did they use so if you take a look back in paragraph two and three to tell you what they use all right and student your answer i'm sorry ,i'm sorry to interrupt teacher i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was a really short time um i appreciate how you encouraged me to use my own words and then i heard you tell some of the other class that they should make sure that they read the whole question 
150.1,Luis,,thank you student start simulation hi class so i've just been reading your responses and i wanted to pull you class into a smaller class because i feel like we can all do a little bit of improving on our responses and that's okay yes student excuse me ,i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,oh i know you do we all definitely know all about space and i know you all wrote some well all a lot of great answers but we just want to take the time to make sure that your sentences are out and understanding and so that we can definitely take a look at everything that we've written about shall we start with you student ,yeah yeah let's start with me 
210.3,Luis,,alright so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks you're right they definitely do use a lot of equipment like awkward to use to find water that's right so we want to dig a little bit deeper than that okay okay so you you did the reading and you found that they found oxygen or that they needed oxygen tanks to dig up so now my question is did you see any other types of equipment besides the oxygen tank ,i don't remember 
210.3,Jazmin,,okay well if you don't remember my suggestion to you is to keep the word equipment in your head when you go back and i want you to do the reading again try and highlight or underline some of the types of equipment that they use and then maybe we can try and adjust your answer again okay okay okay thank you student are you ready i'm ready awesome so you said that nasa sent a small machine you're right they definitely did send a small machine and that's great we i know that you can dig a little deeper than that i know you're smarter than that and i know that you have more complete sentences that you can give me so if we were to read the question again the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and yes they did use a small machine but i wanted to go through with you and i wanted to come up and help you so that we could give an example sentence so that i could help you start so i'm going to show you my example sentence right here this is how if it were me i would start this sentence but keep in mind there's a million ways to start the sentence i would say to discover water on the moon the scientist used blank a small machine a small machine what else do you remember ,oh i just underlined it that's the lunar orbiter machine oh that's 
210.3,Farrah,,awesome that's perfect do you know any other tools ,teacher well jazmin's looking i don't understand why my answers wrong 
420.3,Jazmin,,alright student will student you keep looking and try and find an answer for you read it again if you have to and highlight and underline keywords or examples you find know student your response was you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really clearly again that's the correct answer and you wouldn't need a microscope to look really clearly and the reading did say that but i know that you have more i know that you can give me more than that i know if you go back to the reading and you look you can find at least two more tools that you can pull out and use in your response you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope you'd also need blank and you'd also need blank does that make sense yeah yeah that would be a good start so again my suggestion is to think about the question in your head and then go back in the reading and try and underline all of the types of equipment that you can find in the reading alright are you ready ,yeah i'm ready 
420.3,Jazmin,,i'm sorry ,i was saying i wrote this intense now i found a more equipment name 
210.4,Oliver,,perfect i will get right back to you after that okay okay perfect your answer i didn't really see that you understood the reading well because your answer was i circled the same as student now i'm sure you did circle the same as student but i want you to come up with your own words and your own answers but that wasn't necessarily what the question was specifically asking the question was asking for what types of equipment and i know you circled the same thing as student but i want to hear from you what types of equipment did you see in the reading so again the example sentence might help you to discover water on the moon scientist used blank can you remember what the scientists use on the moon ,yeah the microscope 
210.3,Oliver,,perfect anything else ,was that was the one you were looking at the lunar orbiter 
120.4,Chris,,Underlining if you have to it will help you a lot. student do you want to share your sentence with me really quick oh student yes student well ,i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.1,Chris,,you are right about that thank you can i ask you why if you knew that you didn't write that in your answer ,that wasn't what they were asking i was trying to answer the question 
210.2,Chris,,well i think that the question was asking was sort of asking that if you knew that nasa used oxygen tanks and microscopes that's what the question is asking would you say that's good equipment is ,i would say that's equipment because we were talking about equipment but then it's saying specifically to discover water on the moon and so that you don't use their suits to discover the water they use their suits to stay warm 
110.1,Oliver,,you're right yes does ,upside interrupt teacher but i was looking at the clock it's time for us to go 
150.1,Luis,,so after a leader all right thanks class start simulation thank you hi class alright so i know this is a little smaller and i wanted to explain to you class that before you get worried i want you class to know that your responses were all great and they all had great information in them i just pulled you aside because i think we can each dave a little deeper okay yes student excuse me ,i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,i know you class all know all about space but i just want to make sure that you're capturing the reading and the question clearly ok ,ok 
150.1,Chris,,ok now i'm going to go through each of you individually but before i do that i want you class to do something first okay i want you all to take 35 seconds and i want you to reread the reading but i want you while you're doing that to underline or highlight at least two types of equipment mentioned in the reading can you class do that all right i'm going to count and then i'll let you class know and time's up okay all right go ahead finished reading i'm almost done all right raise your hands when you're all done reading okay ,well i need a two on underline just equipment right 
130.1,Farrah,,please i want you to underline at least two types of equipment that was used in discovering water on the moon okay all right we're all done yeah alright perfect now i'm going to go through each of you so that we can try and build your responses a little better okay can you add another tool to that all right student you talked about how you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's a great sentence great start ,yeah i saw in paragraph two there was a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
420.2,Jazmin,,perfect now can you add that to your whole sentence and make a whole new sentence for me ,yeah let me try teacher i said the small machine couple lunar orbiter so i don't understand why my answers wrong 
150.1,Farrah,,your answer is totally correct class has correct answers in this class i just want to make sure that you class are getting it and i want to make sure that you have a little more understanding so student are you ready to take your time yeah all right ,i got an answer to 
120.4,Farrah,,oh perfect what's your answer okay ,um scientists used a tool called a microscope to look really closely and a lunar orbiter to investigate 
420.2,Jazmin,,that is perfect clapping for you that is awesome thank you perfect alright student you said that nasa sent a small machine that's perfect nasa did send a small machine but i want you to add more i want you to build on that now you went back and you highlighted the lunar orbiter as one did you highlight a second one ,i highlighted the microscope to 
420.2,Jazmin,,perfect can you rebuild your sentence for me in a way that explains both of them ,i need i need a minute 
110.2,Chris,,alright perfect you take a minute while i go over to student Chris your response was great you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon that's correct ,yeah i did the same ones that student did i highlighted the lunar orbiter a small machine called a lunar orbiter and the scientific tool called a microscope 
210.4,Chris,,i'm seeing a pattern here we all like the microscope in the orbiter now were there any others are those the only two that you could find i stopped after paragraph three but if i keep going ,well there's spacecraft i think spacecraft as equipment 
120.1,Chris,,awesome you're right okay so why don't you think that's perfect i mean now you have three different types of equipment so why don't you go through and rewrite your sentence take a minute to rewrite it and then come back and i'll ask you for your sentence okay okay ,teacher i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.1,Oliver,,There you out. ,i'm ready 
120.4,Oliver,,"all right now i'm going to take a look at your answer and i want you to miss one you said i circled the same thing as student that you have a you have a friendship with Farrah where you're circling the same things that's crazy, but I want to know what you found in the reading for yourself, did you find did you highlight or underline to yeah I did. what did you have ",the same ones i guess class else because also the only two that i saw full lunar orbiter and paragraph to another microscope i already had circled on my on my tablet awesome let's see. what's the question what equipment that scientists use their equipment that scientists use was a lunar orbiter and the microscope 
110.1,Oliver,,student that's awesome that's perfect that's a great sentence and you got great answers ,teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i want to say thank you for for helping us i'm really look for more details in the story because i thought i did find everything but that one you said to read and highlight i found more 
110.1,Oliver,,awesome thank you class so much and enjoy your lunch bye bye ,see you 
110.1,Luis,,hello class are you class doing today ,i'm good i'm ok i'm good too excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,well that's awesome now you can help the rest of your friends learn about space too so i think you should stay with us ,okay 
120.4,Farrah,,does class have the article water on the moon pulled up on their tablet that's great so after you class read the article we have the question to talk about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon does class know the answer to that question ,i got my answer that they use the microscope my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
110.1,Jazmin,,that's awesome that is a perfect response good job student ,i got a different answer 
110.1,Jazmin,,what was your answer student ,i thought it was i thought it was a lunar orbiter i wrote down you know nasa sent a small machine 
150.1,Jazmin,,yes that is correct and that is in the second paragraph nasa did send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate and the lunar orbiter just looks for ice deposits in the in the craters but when you reach the third paragraph you'll see that small machine they used is actually called a microscope and that's what actually finds the water do you see what i'm saying ,okay let me look again so nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so investigate um so i was thinking about you know like when you watch the investigator shows where they're looking for clues so then i was like well investigate is when you're looking for something and i didn't choose the microscope because they were looking at the water not looking for the water so i don't understand why my answers wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,so if we look back in the second paragraph you're right the small machine is called a lunar lunar orbiter to investigate and investigate you're right that's looking to find the water but as we see it in the third paragraph it says that the water they found is microscopic so the water that is found you need to look at it with a small machine called a microscope because you can only see it with the microscope not the lunar orbiter ,oh okay 
120.4,Chris,,does class else want to share their answers ,well yeah i had a completely different answer than them i said let me look at what i wrote down yeah scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
410.2,Chris,,and that is true student the scientists did find craters with ice in them but the question is what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water not where is the water found so if we take a closer look at the question and in the text we see that they use a microscope to find the water do you understand but you didn't take that extra step to look for the small machine's name ,um so it is correct that they found craters full of water on the moon but i didn't see the name of the machine 
110.1,Luis,,that's exactly ,okay okay yeah i can get that okay fine but me i mean i know my answer is right too because i talked about equipment and i know that it's appointment that scientists use because you know i read about space all the time 
120.4,Luis,,okay let me hear it ,oh scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
410.1,Chris,,alright student so when we look back at the question it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon while it may be true that scientists do use oxygen tanks and probably very often it's not the equipment that they use to find water on the moon ,okay they do use oxygen tanks but they didn't use them to find the water okay okay okay i guess yeah i could go for that you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits 
150.1,Jazmin,,yes and that is very true they use those equipments so many times a day in many different things but it's not actually what they used to discover the water on the moon do you class see that ,okay yeah yeah yeah yeah i could okay okay well so then what would be my how would i tried to change my answer to to make it like a complete answer 
230.3,Jazmin,,so your answer was nasa sent a small machine ,uh huh 
420.2,Oliver,,"That's all you need to do, because you did say it was a small machine and you just needed to put the name of it. So NASA sent a small machine called a microscope and then your answer would be perfect. ",okay i just have to put the name of it on there oh i crossed it out i guess they didn't need to cross it out oh okay wow okay oh man um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for for keeping us to like look back at the question i kept hearing you say oh but student that's a good answer but it's not in the question that's true student but that's not in the question so i guess we have to we have to like read the question a little bit more closely next time 
420.2,Luis,,well thank you class for participating simulation hi class yes student ,um yeah so i was just gonna say that i know all of this stuff so i don't think i need to be on this class i don't need any help 
110.3,Luis,,okay i'm glad that you know so much about this already but i think you should stay so you can help me with this assignment with your classmates does that sound okay ,yeah yeah okay i can do that 
120.4,Farrah,,okay so does class have their tablets out with the reading perfect who wants to share their answer first okay um savanah yeah let's hear yours ,okay yeah so my answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close 
230.1,Farrah,,can you tell me why you chose the microscope as the answer ,"yeah so my thinking was that Okay, so if you're trying to play, you have to first be able to see it. how do you find if you can't see right so when i was looking at the different types of reading i thought microscope was the best answer because you couldn't discover something unless you could see right and and we know we know that the water was microscope "
210.3,Farrah,,"and I love, how you said that you look back at the reading to like determine which machine you thought would be the best one. The question asks what small machine to do to discover the water, so if the if they're using a microscope to find the water they're already on and you look back at the reading what small machine, do you think found the water? ",that's a really good question i'm not totally sure because well i can look and see because i'm not really sure is it still seems like the microscope would be the first thing i guess i could second look at 
110.2,Farrah,,yeah if you just take another look maybe at the second paragraph the first sentence says a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate but i it just means that you need to look a little bit further into the reading yes and in the question asked what machine discovered the water so your answer is correct ,is the answer to the lunar orbiter 
110.1,Oliver,,yes it is excellent yes student ,um i also got that answer from from what said and i said that it's the lunar orbiter 
230.1,Oliver,,did you work with savannh on this question ,um i did the first time and then i heard her say lunar orbiter and now i know it's the lunar orbiter 
410.2,Oliver,,i love how you worked together with her and i think it's great to work with your classmates in class but for your answer i want to hear what you have to say ,okay um well i think it is the lunar orbiter cuz what you were saying was that we needed to look for you know what i mean like something that actually discovered the water was in the question and like found it and then you said they they they looked in the microscope after they found it so then it has to be the lunar orbiter that out 
110.1,Jazmin,,that's excellent student so glad that you're listening and paying attention in class yes student ,i think i am just a little confused i was confused because i also thought it was the lunar orbiter like why my answer was wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,what was your answer let me hear it one more time ,yeah yeah my answer which really was nasa send a small machine 
230.1,Jazmin,,can you tell me why you picked that as your answer i'm not saying it's wrong but i want to hear where you're coming from with that ,yes so i was thinking that when i was reading like it was saying basically that like okay where does it say i can read it it says nasa sentence for me she called a lunar orbiter to investigate so i thought that was the answer the question was saying like what equipment that the scientists used to discover the water and so that makes me think what had to be the lunar orbiter right so i i was saying that it was the small machine that they you know they sent this fall machine it that was the the answer 
420.2,Jazmin,,and it's the lunar orbiter is a small machine and i really like how you look back at the reading and really understood the question because you totally did my only suggestion for you like your answer was almost perfect is just to put the name of the small machine that's it that's my only issue otherwise your answer is perfect ,okay that makes perfect sense so like to make a complete answer it has to include the name of the thing yes awesome thank you 
420.2,Chris,,yeah yes student ,um so okay so i was just you know i was a little bit confused because i was thinking like well okay i was thinking that i went to nasa so when i was there with my dad i aw that like they had stuff like oxygen tanks and masks and i was thinking like they have to have use those to discover the water so i guess i'm confused by that tonight and 
130.3,Chris,,"In the question is asking what did they use to discover water on the moon, and while they use so much equipment up in the moon, I couldn't even tell you half the names of them, the article, the reading says that. does that make sense they use the lunar orbiter to discover the water and they do use the other equipment but the lunar orbiter purpose is to discover the water ",oh so it's like a like maybe they weren't astronauts up there like maybe it was a like a nasa they call it an unmanned pro and that's like you know maybe that was it 
110.4,Oliver,,it definitely could have been just up there lunar orbiter yes student ,i'm so i unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go i really just wanted to thank you um this was a really interesting conversation so thank you so much for working with us bye 
110.4,Luis,,bye hi class hi ,so i just wanted to say that i kind of know like all about space already so i don't think i need any help i don't need to be in this 
110.3,Luis,,well i'm so glad that you already know so much about space but do you think you could stay and help me answer the questions for your other classmates too ,yeah i get i can stick around for that yeah for sure 
120.4,Oliver,,thank you so who wants to share their answer first student you can go first ,awesome 
230.1,Oliver,,okay so what i said was that i circled the same with student did you work with student on the question ,oh yeah we work together a lot of help each other out 
420.2,Farrah,,well i'm so glad that you worked with your classmates and i think it's really important to work with your classmates but when answering your question on your own paper i really would love if you could explain your answer rather than say you didn't listen to someone else ,"oh yeah i can do that so basically what we said was we thought that you would need a scientific tool called the microscope we thought that was the equipment that the scientists used to discover the water we agreed that it was the microphone right student yeah Farrah, do you want to tell me why you guys pick the microscope? um yeah so basically we we picked microscope because i think he was that the waters microscope no not a telescope you need like a microscope to see microscopic water it says you can't see it unless you have a microscope or like i guess yeah so you need to be able to see it and basically if you can't see the order like how are the astronauts like finding like when you know what i mean like how are they supposed to discover the water if they can't even see it "
150.1,Farrah,,i totally understand where you're coming from and i think that's a great way that you class interpreted the reading but the question is what small machine discovered the water so if we look back at the reading the microscope is what they use to view the water not what found it does that make sense ,um i guess but actually it's kind of music because like i still think like that question like yeah they could see the water and they could study the water but how could they do that if they couldn't find it 
150.1,Oliver,,"One second, Jazmin. what i suggest what you class do next time is look at the question and look at the reading for keywords when we look back at the reading it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter and the lunar orbiter looked in the craters to find the water does that make sense ",yeah i can see make sense i guess yeah that makes sense we need to look kind of but i think that we okay so we were looking at the keywords right there yeah we were looking at the keywords and we were trying to find like okay so we were looking for equipment and we found other equipment in the reading but we still thought the microscope was was the answer because we thought it had to be the first equipment that they use other than like a spaceship 
150.1,Oliver,,"and i'm glad that you guys didn't notice that when you guys read, but the microscope was to look at the water that was already discovered does that make sense ",yeah okay so if it was used for the stuff that was discovered how did they discover 
130.3,Jazmin,,that's perfect that's the perfect question that is what we're trying to find the answer to and if you class look back you'll see that it says the lunar lunar orbiter discovered the water i'm going to move on to student real quick but i'll come back to you class ,so i just had a question i was just like why my answer was wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,can you read me your answer one more time please ,yeah what i said was that yes it's it is 
420.2,Jazmin,,"And the only only recommendation I have, for your answer, because it's almost there is to just name the small machine that they used. That's it to make your answer perfect. ",oh oh so like that so they so this is the leader or better to discover or rather the scientists discovered water on the moon using the lunar orbiter right 
110.1,Jazmin,,that is perfect ,yes 
110.1,Chris,,yes student ,okay so i was just the key because my dad and i went to nasa and i i know that they use like equipment like oxygen masks suits and stuff like that so i was just wondering like should that be in the reading 
410.1,Chris,,so you're definitely right about how nasa uses so much equipment to do so many different things but the question is only asking for one specific machine or equipment that they used to find the water so i don't think it's necessary to include the other equipment when the question is only asking for what found the water ,like okay i think that makes sense oh okay oh okay does that make sense like okay i think that makes sense 
150.1,Luis,,does that make sense does class else have any questions or confused about anything yes student ,um so was my answer right 
120.4,Luis,,can you read me your answer please ,yeah so i said that scientists use a lot of equip like oxygen tanks and stuff like that 
410.1,Luis,,does that make sense that is true and it's basically just what i told student that the scientists do use a lot of equipment so much equipment for so many different things but the question is only asking for one specific piece of equipment that was used to find the water ,yeah but didn't they use like oxygen takes to walk around and see the water 
130.3,Luis,,"but when we look back at the question its assets only asking specifically what machine they used to find the water, not all the other machines. so if you wanted to write as your answer that they use the lunar orbiter and they use so many other machines for different things you could and that would be right but i think just saying the lunar orbiter is perfectly fine too ",interesting 
130.3,Oliver,,yes student ,so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular it was really interesting and helpful how you asked us about kind of like like how we got to the answer you know because it was helping us to understand ourselves how we got to the answer and then you helped us by like you really made us feel value because every answer that we had like even if it was like kind of wrong on you made sure that we knew that it was you know a still a valuable answer so thank you so much 
120.4,Luis,,of course you class all right hi class so we we just read the moon is a desert and i asked the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and so your responses were all a bit little bit different so i love that because we have a variation of answers but i just wanted to go over these responses to see if we can get some really great answers so student i'm going to call on you first so what did you say when you answer this question ,excuse me teacher i shouldn't be ms great i already know all about space 
210.2,Luis,,you bring up a really great point i saw that you used your background information when you answered that question describe your intro which is awesome because i could tell that you know so much about scientists and space so i love the fact that you knew about the oxygen tanks but i really wanted you to use some information from the text when answering this question Answer the question because often chicks are definitely use. but what would be used to help scientists find water on the moon and maybe use your texts to answer that question ,hmm ok ok i'll 
120.1,Farrah,,give you time to think about it then all right well so let's move on um so student did you see you said that you saw the microscope and it was used to look really closely so what did the microscope look really closely at okay i'll call on you in a second ,the water 
210.3,Luis,,okay great so next time when you're doing this maybe explain what the microscope was used for Luis Do you have anything. Have you thought of an answer. Yeah. ,um well i see a couple of pieces of equipment and the text you you you're right there isn't anything about the oxygen but they have talked about a lunar orbiter and i talked about the the microscope like what student said 
210.4,Luis,,so what did the lunar orbiter do to help find water on the moon ,um well it says that it landed on the moon um let me see what that means about finding water i'm not sure 
130.2,Jazmin,,so it says that this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater so student what do you think ,well still don't understand why my answers wrong 
430.2,Jazmin,,"oh so student i let's clarify i don't think any of your answers are wrong i think all of you answer the questions i'm with a different type of answer but i don't think any of your questions were wrong i just think that i could see a little bit more room for improvement so What this small machine was so you said exactly what the texts needed, which was NASA send a small machine. to the moon so that's correct but i wanted to know maybe what was the small machine and how did it help find water on the moon so do you think you can look back in the text and maybe figure out that will give me a little bit more information ",okay so i should look for what the machine did 
420.2,Jazmin,,and maybe add what the machine was called ,okay 
110.2,Chris,,but i was wondering could you find an instrument that helped the scientists find this one on the moon and for your tax all right student how are we doing so your response was scientists found craters full of water on the moon which is completely true ,an instrument okay i guess it probably be something that you can say 
150.1,Chris,,or you could use maybe something you found on your own you don't need to use what you said ,okay okay i'm gonna read it and see a small machine called investigate look for ice deposits in a large crater i suppose well the only other paragraph that talks about the waters paragraph three so what does it say in paragraph three that they use for an instrument to find water 
210.4,Chris,,and microscope and what is the microscope ,it's something you use to look at really small thing 
210.4,Chris,,right so how did they use a microscope to find the water ,well it didn't really say it just says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely you know i went to nasa so i know that i just use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits right 
110.2,Chris,,you use those but i don't think they use those to necessarily find the water instruments they used to find the water which was microscope so that's really great ,you put it doesn't i don't know i don't know how how they got bad answer from the question because the question says what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon and you need a scientific to column microscope so it's the same answer is student ducks into that 
230.3,Chris,,but what we did with student if you remember if i had student student gave me the answer that said my cursor tropes will really Be used to find a water and she said to me that microscopes looked really closely and then they found the water because some more. ,"I think so. Cuz she explained more of it. That's what made her that that's what made it a better answer. Okay. Yeah, I think so. "
230.2,Oliver,,so def you said you had the same answer as student do you want to explain a little bit what you found when you're reading ,yeah cause i read the question i'm like here are some words you're saying is that one equipment the scientists use to find to discover water on the moon so i was like a microscope isn't equipment and this paragraph is talking about water so so that's why i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
510.1,Oliver,,great so i really liked that response because you explained yourself really well you said that you read the question you saw what the question was asking for and then you found it and explained why so that was a really great response ,oh thanks okay good job 
210.3,Luis,,student did you figure out any answers after giving yourself a little bit more time ,okay so i i read the whole thing again and i think the answer is about the lunar orbiter because i know that um i think student said that it doesn't talk about water but it talks about ice and ice just frozen water and so that's why i think that's 
110.4,Oliver,,good so there are a few different answers that you could have but the lunar orbiter is definitely one of the answers that you could have um and what the question was asked before and it is right because i is being used to isis and different form of water it's the solid for so the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in the polar craters which helps them find water so yes that is one of the answers to that the equipment was used to find water on the moon so great job ,thanks thanks a lot hey i'm on excuse me teacher i just looked at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to her site thanks for helping us know that we needed to use more evidence because i heard your toll student and student that they had to pull from the story and all that for the rest of us that we should try to find more stuff in the story to us in our answer so thanks for that by 
210.2,Chris,,alright class so we just shared our great answers for the question but i just as we're going over our answers i wanted to think back and let's really look at the question to see what the question was asking so i'm going to reread the question and once i finish i want one of you to raise your hand and tell me what the question is asking for and it's answer so the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so what do you class think the question is asking for student ,it's asking for the name of equipment 
110.1,Luis,,right so in the question it says what equipment did the scientists use so now when you're looking back at your paper with the sheet describing all of this what you should be thinking about what equipment specifically you saw that was used to discover water the keywords in here i think are equipment and to discover water on the moon so now let's look at your responses so student you circled the same thing as student and so you said that you needed a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely now i mean ,i'm sorry teacher excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
130.1,Luis,,you do well student i bet you have a ton of background knowledge on all of your science equipment but i think that what this question was asking for doesn't mean necessarily background knowledge but more for you to look at the evidence from the text ,oh okay 
420.3,Luis,,right so i think that you and student and student all did this you used all of your background knowledge when answering this question which is great but for this question it didn't necessarily ask for background knowledge so what you said was probably would be used potentially to find water on the moon but in this text it did not specifically state that a microscope or oxygen tanks were being used so why don't we look back in the text and see if you can see specific equipment that was used to find the water on the moon and circle that answer ,okay 
150.1,Farrah,,okay so can we go and look right back and just quickly maybe skim the page and see if we could see any new equipment that was found and you can raise your hand if you finally found a piece ,ok so i found a small machine i found the lunar orbiter 
130.3,Jazmin,,good so student and student you both found specific information for the text so that is great um so a lunar orbiter is a the actual answer to the prompt so that's the equipment that was found in the text that describes what was used to find water yes student ,well i don't understand why my answer's wrong 
310.1,Oliver,,so let's see your answer was nasa sent a small machine that answer is not incorrect at all and i think none of your answers are wrong in any of this case i just think when we read the question it asked for what specific type of equipment would be used and your answer was correct but i think to answer the correct but the name of the small machine was the lunar orbiter to answer the question fully you would need to describe the exact small machine that found the water i love how you got the answer by using evidence from the text ,ok ok okay but they also a microscope is a small machine and it does say that they looked for oh they looked at the water using a microscope so that that should count 
210.2,Chris,,right so you said in your answer that the microscope was used to look at the water but if they had the water already that's means that the water was already discovered on the moon so the microscope seems to be used after the water was discovered and to analyze it but the question was asking for what was what equipment was used to find the water not look at it after it was found yes student ,"Ok, ok. as we're talking about equipment i was thinking so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
210.2,Oliver,,right they do so you it seems like class in this class has a lot of background information about space which is great so you probably when reading this article connected a lot to it which is really great but when we looked at the text it said for the question to look in the text to use the evidence and i don't think in the text it talks about oxygen tanks or microscopes when looking for the water when you went to look for the water to discover on the moon the equipment used was the lunar orbiter and then afterwards they definitely used microscope to look at the water and they probably had to have oxygen tanks when they are trying to discover it but that wasn't necessarily used to discover water on the moon more as an add on so i think you bring up a great point student that there are probably lots of different types of equipment used when people are on the moon but for this specific question we are looking for what equipment was used to discover water on the moon ,reach every reader ok ok so it looks like it's time for the next class so we'll see you later teacher 
150.1,Luis,,goodbye alright class so we just answered the second question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable and so you class had some great answers so um first let's go over it so the question can class tell me what off the bat the question is asking yes student that supported the question and i do see some more evidence from the text that we use that's really good ,okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
210.2,Luis,,okay so student then can you explain to me what the question is asking ,yeah okay sure and so it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable 
210.2,Luis,,mm hmm so what is the question looking for and it's answer ,um it wants us to say if water is valuable or not 
150.1,Farrah,,so let's all look back at the reading and see if we can find any important context clues that might tell us right away what the answer is good right so when we read that question we're trying to figure out based on the reading if water is valuable or not and raise your hand if you find any evidence that would right away tell you yes or now yes student ,okay um the um the first like title it says water is a valuable resource 
210.3,Oliver,,that is a great point so off the bat class we should be thinking that we are looking for now evidence that proves water is valuable as a resource because off the bat the title says water is a valuable resource great job student so in some of your answers student and student i realized you say you both said no it's not ready yet and so now after talking about this little bit um do you think your answer has changed at all ,okay well i mean i see how the that title says that it is a valuable resource but then in the story it says something different all right yeah yeah like okay i have the same answer as student because when i read the like a sixth paragraph it says it says that it's gonna be really expensive 
210.4,Jazmin,,right so you again you're using some evidence from the text which is great it although it's being a little bit expensive don't you think that some of the points from the text would say that it is a good thing um can you find a maybe a point in the texts that were explains a benefit to having water and why it would be valuable ,ok okay well i don't understand why my answer's wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,"um let's look at your you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water that is perfectly correct student and i don't think your answers wrong i just think And I don't think that that answer was based on evidence from the text, but I think it was based on your background knowledge which is great to use when answering questions, but for this specific question. i think you should be looking at the text and pulling evidence for a specific sentence that relates to explaining why water is valuable ",well i'm still kind of confused because i found this this one right in the story so how come it's not evidence 
230.2,Jazmin,,um let's see can you point out to me where you found that ,okay yeah it's in the the third sentence in paragraph four for example future astronauts could drink this water 
150.1,Jazmin,,The water is actually very heavy so it's really hard to keep in a spaceship so if we were able to have the water come through moon it would lighten up the spacecraft leaving more room for different types of materials so although your answer was correct that we do need to drink water the evidence that would relate to the text would be more focused on how the water being on the moon would relieve space on the spaceship does that make sense ,yeah i think so 
210.3,Jazmin,,ok so if you had to redo your answer student what would you say now ,well would i i think i'd still keep the first sentence right 
210.3,Chris,,mm hmm and then what would you add to it right ,um i guess the sentence after it astronauts could drink the water water is heavy takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft that's what i put in my answer um i did read that they they might have a moon base on the moon by 2024 yeah 
230.3,Chris,,right i love that you have some background information on that student that's great and so you're in your response you said water's heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry on the ships anymore which is true because if they do have that room on the ship it would be very valuable because they could store more things which is what it says in the text so that's a great response ,so how come i'm here because i used the evidence from the text and including the part that you told student she should put in her answer 
150.1,Chris,,let's see so you did explain the water is heavy and it does take up room on the spaceship but you didn't relate it back to the question of how that would be valuable you said it would be too heavy to carry the water but then your response should have something about why the water not being carried would be a good thing so just elaborate a little bit off of that not carrying the water on the spaceship would be valuable does that make sense ,um saying more about why it would be valuable 
210.3,Chris,,yes so you said you brought up a good point from the text that water is heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore but why would that be valuable to people in space in scientists ,cuz then maybe they wouldn't have to burn up as much fuel 
420.2,All,,so make sure to relate our answer back to the question that's being asked ,bye 
420.2,Oliver,,thank you hi class how are you today ,oh we're we're pretty good we're excited to see you 
420.2,Luis,,awesome i'm excited to be back with you i missed you class so we just discussed our water on the moon oh student do you have a question ,um yeah i guess it's more of like a statement like i already know like all this stuff about space so like i don't think i really even need to be in this class 
150.1,Luis,,right i understand but it's really important like when we listen to other students responses it only helps us better understand what we're learning about and it's also great i'm sure you'll have some great contributions today ,yeah i can do that 
420.2,Farrah,,awesome so i noticed student as you said that um scientists use this specific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i thought that was great response i noticed that you used your vocabulary but maybe we could elaborate on why they use this tool what does this tool help them with so referring to the water on the moon text can you kind of elaborate on that response can you tell me why you need a microscope ,yeah so okay so what i saw when i was looking at it is that it says the water is the water they found is microscopic we wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you don't like you have to have the microscope to even see the water do you know what i mean and see the water how do you find the water 
230.1,Chris,,right you just did a really good job using textual evidence to support your answer next student you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon but how what equipment did they use or in the text what equipment did it say they use to discover these things on the moon do you know can class help him can you elaborate on that response ,that's interesting because i was thinking about crater so you were saying that the question is like what equipment so well okay so like you know i've been to nasa so like i know that scientists use lots of equipment like on oxygen tanks and mass and shoots and i guess like that's something they use right 
210.2,Chris,,so referring back to your texts think about what's student said right but what more specifically did they did they use to discover water on the moon ,i'm not sure 
130.2,Jazmin,,that's okay can class help him student ,well actually the thing that i was thinking about was i wasn't really sure why my answer was well 
230.2,Jazmin,,so your answer wasn't wrong i think you had a really great start to a response there you said that nasa uses a lot of small machines they sent a small machine that's true that's correct um but i'm just wondering more specifically what small machine did they use how do you know they used to small machin like did it tell you in the text where in the text is that ,yeah yeah it's it in yet basically was like in the in the text it was saying and pick up three that no no no a pair of to this moment she was the lunar orbiter is that is that what i got wrong i didn't say this thing 
230.1,Oliver,,yeah that's great now you you've built on your response and you made it an amazing excellent well thought out response nice work so student i see that you said that you i mean you were all working in a small class which is great you're using each other to help one another but why did you circle the same thing as student what did you fully understand this question do you need me to to re explain it why did you think it is a right answer ,i had kind of the same thinking and what i was thinking was basically that like the water was microscopic and i was thinking like you can't you know what i mean like i guess i was thinking like how did they find the water and it seems like they found the water using the microscope 
110.2,Jazmin,,right so that answers the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon that's great nice work ,yeah i can say was just wondering since i was thinking like that it seemed like the lunar orbiter we see that they use to discover the water so is it both the microscope and the lunar orbiter is it just one 
210.4,Oliver,,so it's actually both of them so in our text in the second bullet point it says that nasa sent this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate they used both the lunar orbiter and the microscope to explore these things and the lunar orbiter helped look for ice deposits which is another form of water right i use is just frozen water so they use both of these things to explore the water on the moon yes student ,um so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for like first of all you really made sure that we kept going back into the text and being like what what does it say in the reading and you were really beginning to help us make sure we were using evidence and in our answers and i think that was really cool and like what seven and i you asked us like why we came to our answer and that was especially cool because it got me thinking about like how i think about stuff and like how i do it so it was really cool when you're asking us like how did we come to our answer so thank you so much for working with us it was a lot of fun bye 
210.4,Luis,,good afternoon class how are you today ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.2,Farrah,,it's great that you have background knowledge though well you know what it's actually really important to foster collaboration and listen to our peers responses to help build on what you already know so do you all remember reading and answering the question and your notebooks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon yeah all right and student can you tell me what you responded to that question the question what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon ,yeah i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.1,Farrah,,so that is a great response i'm noticing that you use the text to support your answer you used the two words scientific tool as asked in the question it says what equipment and that's answering what equipment they used and you said called a microscope so you referred backup to the text to help you answer this question can you tell me why that's that was what your that was what you said ,oh yeah okay um so cuz i was looking for like you said the arm the words in a question i was looking for equipment and water on the moon and i saw in paragraph three they talk about finding water which is what the question is asking about discovering water and then the lesson into the one that has the name of the equipment 
120.4,Jazmin,,awesome i noticed you said exactly to where in the text you found your answer in paragraph three i noticed that it said that they used a microscope to find water and this is exactly what the question asks i really like how you referred back to the question to help support your answer so now student can you tell me what you answered what your answer was ,yeah i said i said to small machine and i don't understand why my answers wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,so i don't think your answers wrong i think you have a really really great start to a strong response so in the text it does actually say nasa sent a small machine but if you think back to student response she said i referred to the text and i thought about the specific tools they used so if you look back into the text what do you notice about the specific tools it says they used to discover water on the moon ,small machine called i guess that it's called a lunar orbiter 
120.2,Jazmin,,awesome so see you just improved your response by just looking back you read that sentence and you strengthened your response so i think that's a great start yeah awesome okay so now moving on to the second question it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon excuse me could be valuable so considering this wiki i yes oh yes ,um so i guess i still don't know what what my answer should be do i just have to add the lunar orbiter to the answer to make it right 
310.1,Jazmin,,so you said okay well student said that they use a microscope she looked back she thought about the so it's not about right or wrong here right it's about building on our response strengthening it with textual evidence in and looking at the key ideas in the question by looking back in the text you found another thing that they use to discover water on the moon by adding those key terms you're answering the question and that's great ,so so if i say i'm nasa send a small machine quarterly in order to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,maybe even what what are they investigating if you think back to the question what are they investigating what was that tool used for ,to investigate well i mean the question says to discover water that's not the same thing as investigating water 
420.3,Jazmin,,it's very similar though right like they're investigating they're thinking about considering how they can find water on the moon so it's not always going to be super easy to find the same word in the text sometimes you're going to have to think what synonyms are in the text what other things might mean something similar to investigate or discover ,okay 
420.3,Chris,,student ,oh yeah i was thinking about some other specific equipment it's not in a story but i did i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks mask suits 
410.1,Chris,,right so that actually has to do with like the second question is great that you know that and you can use that background knowledge to help you understand this question this question specifically is asking what what equipment they use to discover the water yes they do use that equipment to help them discover the water but that is not the actual equipment that is discovering the water right ,oh yeah yeah okay i see what you're saying i see what you're saying okay um what for my answer um i guess i'm trying to think what did i miss okay so i've got the scientists on craters for water on the moon scientists found which one is student right or is student right which which equipment one is right 
430.2,Chris,,there both right because in the text it actually talks about both of those things that were used to discover the water on the moon so i'm i'm noticing in your response it says scientists found craters full of water on the moon so you're saying that they were able to discover water on the moon but you're not necessarily saying what equipment they used so in order to strengthen your response you might want to add something about the equipment that they use much like student and student added ,okay oh so like scientists use the lunar orbiter to find craters for water the moon 
430.2,Chris,,sorry what was that ,i was adding lunar orbiter into my answers oh scientists use the lunar orbiter to find craters full of water on the moon 
310.1,Oliver,,awesome so you started with they found these craters of water and then you you referred back to the question you thought about your peers responses and you ended up adding the equipment that they used yes that works it does ,oh sorry sorry to interrupt teacher but i was looking at the clock and actually it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later okay 
310.1,Luis,,all right thank you good afternoon class and welcome back how are you i'm good good to ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Chris,,you know what then we can actually just build on your background knowledge in your understanding that you already have i think it's great that you already know a lot about space but it's really important to build on that knowledge so today do you all remember answering this question considering our reading that we've already done we're going to consider the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon yeah yeah alright so today student could you tell me what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon could you read your answer to me ,yeah oh scientist phone critters all scientists fall for water 
230.3,Chris,,but if you look at the question can you tell me what a keyword you're missing is right so actually in the text it does say that they found creators of water on the moon so you're you're telling me that you know they did in fact discover water on the moon ,yeah i just heard it when i was reading my answer when you said what equipment was i'm missing equipment 
210.3,Chris,,right so just building on your response that you already have let's look back in the text it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that's the type of equipment isn't it yeah yeah and it says that if it landed at the south pole and looks for ice deposits and then if we look at the next paragraph it talks about how the water was so so tiny that they needed a microscope so if you build on your answer that you already have what might you add to strengthen your response ,scientists phone creators for water on the moon with the lunar orbiter 
530.1,Chris,,so can you tell me how your answer changed from the beginning when you said that they found craters of waterfall on the moon to the end when you added that they used those two tool ,i'm ok ok i didn't have the name of any equipment in my answer and then i added the names of pieces of equipment in mind 
120.4,Farrah,,alright so i'm noticing that you really strengthen your response from the start to the end you really use that you're thinking and you use the text to support you alright so now student can you tell me what you answered what you said ,yeah um well i took all the same thing yeah and i don't understand why my answer was wrong 
120.4,Farrah,,who said that sorry i missed that ,me 
120.4,Farrah,,ok ok so student can you tell me what you said ,yeah i said on scientists use know you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.1,Oliver,,so student and student so student can you tell me why you circled the same thing as student ,um yeah cuz i was looking for all of the keywords in the question like how you said i'm always looking for equipment and discover and water and the moon and that was the only place that had all of the parts in it 
210.4,Farrah,,awesome okay so student looking at your response and then looking back at the text you're saying you need a specific scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so if you refer back to the text and you think about what student added to his response you're correct in saying that you do need a microscope to be able to see this water but if you look at paragraph two can you tell me what machine nasa sent to discover the water ,they said the lunar orbiter well how do you know that they sent it to discover the water 
210.4,Farrah,,it says in the next sentence this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater and it says that how they're really strong and yeah ,yeah i was looking for the word water i forgot i didn't because they didn't actually say water in this in the paragraph about the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Farrah,,can you tell me building on the response that you already have what might you add to make it a little bit stronger yeah it's a little bit tricky you have to think about other forms of water like you have to think about ice or like gases you know it give me a little bit tricky so ,you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and a lunar orbiter to investigate 
150.1,Oliver,,awesome so i'm noticing you started with a really strong response and then you added the the actual specific tool that they initially discovered water on the moon with right so student does that make sense to you too ,yeah i think so so we just have to say both of the names of the equipment in our answer 
230.1,Oliver,,right but why why is it important to include both of those names of the tools ,because they used both of them to find the water 
110.1,Chris,,exactly yes student ,okay i was just thinking about some other equipment you know that the scientists use because i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks 
210.3,Chris,,yeah so that equipment is used for the scientists themselves right and but do they need that equipment to actually discover the water on the moon does the lunar orbiter where that equip excuse me equipment on the moon ,no no it's a machine 
210.4,Chris,,right so so maybe if an asteroid is going to lower the things the moon that would be beneficial and necessary for them to have in order to discover water on the moon but the machines they send don't need that equipment in order to successfully explore the water on the moon right ,right okay yeah i wasn't even thinking about that maybe they didn't have the astronauts on the moon that they just sent the machine by itself i just i figured the astronauts were there with the machine 
210.4,Oliver,,right so the astronauts maybe they're up in their spaceship their rocket ship up there and then they send this tool out to investigate before they would go right ,yeah yeah that makes sense when you were talking to student and student like why i would have to add both of the machines there until you kind of asked me until yeah so that was useful for me 
210.4,Oliver,,thanks for that feedback student enjoy lunch class ,thanks 
210.4,Oliver,,hi class ,hi 
120.2,Luis,,so can you class tell me a little bit about what do you think this equipment looks like student my name is teacher so you class just answered what object did i'm so sorry what equipment did the scientists used to discover water in the moon right ok ,well i was just going to say i kind of know all about space already so i don't even think i should be in this class 
110.3,Luis,,oh maybe you can tell us and share what you know it does so we also can know about it what do you think ,ok i'll do that 
120.4,Luis,,that sounds great do you want to start ,yeah so my answer to the question was that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that 
120.1,Luis,,that's right but do you know what object did they use to find water in the moon ,i think the same stuff like they use oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that i think they used the same thing 
210.4,Farrah,,they did use that because we can not breathe the air on the moon so we did use that student you're totally right about that one however they needed to use a specific equipment to really really find water because it was very very hard to find so even if you're looking straight to it you wouldn't be able to tell if it was there or not so they needed an equipment that would help them one second student i'll be right back with you they needed an equipment to look very very close to that little block of ice and then they would see if there is water in there student you want to share something with us ,yeah i guess i was wondering so it sounds like you were saying that they use something to find the small water and i was thinking that because i said that they must have used the microscope so i guess i was wondering why my answer was wrong 
210.4,Chris,,but for that they have something very similar that they take it to the space so they can actually find that ok yes that's exactly what's the word i was looking for they needed a microscope to really really see what the ice was like so it's basically a microscope so they can see really deep in the picture and then the name for it it's lunar orbiter ok so that's kind of like a little microscope and then it looks very very close to the surface and they look for ice deposit in li student ,oh i was just wondering because i've been to nasa with my dad and we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff so they didn't need that stuff 
130.3,Oliver,,they did need that it was just like i was telling student they use that as well student was right about that one but they also bringing a huge machine that it's called lunar orbiter and this is equipment that the scientists brought to the moon it was like a microscope oliveron i mean student sorry ,yeah i just was going to say unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and in particular i wanted to thank you for especially encouraging us to draw on our background knowledge that was really cool to be able to talk about the stuff that we already inaudible thank you for letting us share 
130.3,Luis,,thank you student bye class ,so i said that you need a scientific will call a microscope to look really close so i said basically i circled the same thing i student i i said that scientists craters pool of water on the moon i said you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely on yeah and basically what i said was that like you would need to um well okay so nasa has like all this stuff and so basically like you know what i mean you need all this other equip 
130.3,Luis,,ok yes student ,um yeah so i was just gonna say i kind of know all about space so i don't really think i even need to be on this because i already know all this stuff 
420.2,Chris,,there's always room to learn more even if we think we're the best at a subject there's always something new we need to learn thank you so much for sharing your responses to me i want to particularly point out student and student s responses you class did a really good job of highlighting the exact equipment that we use student you too you had agreed with student student and student i'd like to hear more concrete examples of what kind of equipment they use yes student ,well so i went to nasa so i know like from going that scientists use a lot of equipment like student was saying that but they use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that you know what i mean 
210.4,Luis,,that's good thank you for saying the exact names well that's exactly what i'm looking for because you've been to nasa you know all about it but i haven't and i love hearing what you've experienced yeah student can you think of any particular specific examples of equipment that they might use ,yeah okay so yeah okay so i think that what they use was like oxygen tanks and stuff like that like student was saying and i know a lot about space so they probably use like some kind of like pack to like drink water from and like all that kind of stuff 
110.1,Jazmin,,good job and they're awesome you class really good job thank you all for sharing those specific equipment with me you class did a really good job student go ahead ,i am just wondering why am i wrong 
110.1,Jazmin,,no student you did a good job your answer is great the first time ,it was right 
310.1,Chris,,i pointed out student and student both of you had done a really good job from the beginning naming the exact specific examples of equipment student did you have a question ,um no i just was i raised my hand by accident 
110.1,Oliver,,awesome ,alright welcome back so oh actually i believe one of the students had something to say hang on one second i'm so thank you for working with us for just a short time but we really wanted to thank you for like even though we only have you for a little bit we wanted to thank you for being so kind and for really making sure that class answered the question and that nobody felt left out so thank you so much 
110.1,Luis,,i loved hearing all your responses hi class how are you today ,we're good work excited to work with you 
110.1,Luis,,and excited to work with you to my name is kiera hey so hearing those responses yeah ,um so i was just gonna say that um basically um i i kind of already know like all about space and i know that we're like here in the class to to help us with our answers but i don't think i really belong here as i already know all about 
150.1,Luis,,a good attitude to keep is that never know too much there's always more that you can learn ,that's cool i guess i can stick around 
210.4,Jazmin,,thank you okay so hearing your responses i do want to do a little bit of work you class had some awesome answers but i want to make them even better so i'm going to give you two minutes to read the text and really closely read it with the question keep the questions in mind as you're reading next i'm going to give you another two minutes after that i'll time it and i'll let you class know and i'm going to give you two highlighters with different colors you are going to use one highlighter to highlight two examples of equipment that they used on the moon specific examples at least two examples and then you are going to use the other colored highlighter to highlight at least two examples of why finding water on the moon is important does class have any questions before we start go ahead student you had your hand up first ,because i well i guess we proceed with that is to look to see why my into what's wrong 
410.2,Jazmin,,okay yeah let's go back into your answer you had said that nasa send a small machine this is not incorrect they did send a small machine however in the text it provided the actual name of what that machine was so i'd like to see a bit more specific detail to know exactly what that small machine was actual name of what that machine was so i'd like to see a bit more specific detail to know exactly what that small machine was ,yeah okay i knew what it was i knew that it was 
410.2,Chris,,okay good student you had a question to right ,on i think i was just gonna ask like well okay so we with their highlighters we highlight can you tell me again we highlight the things that are that are different i wasn't able to hear you what fortunately 
410.2,Chris,,sorry can you hear me now ,yeah i can hear you 
210.4,Chris,,good i'm going to give you two colored highlighters they're going to be different colors with one color you are going to highlight two examples of specific equipment that they used on the moon then with the other colored highlighter you're going to start with the other colored highlighter you're going to highlight specifically two examples of why finding water on the moon would be well ,does that answer your question yeah that's that makes sense okay i think i can do that 
120.3,Oliver,,awesome i am going to start your two minute timer to read the text really closely if you finish before two minutes go ahead and read it again your two minutes starting now to read ,we can read super fast so we we did our two minutes 
210.4,Oliver,,all right are you sure you're already to move on yeah okay i'm going to give you another minute then and you can use your two different colored highlighters and find two examples of equipment news done the moon and two examples of why finding water on the moon will be helpful after the one minute i'm going to check in and see if you class need any more time and your minute starts now yes ,so i just was are we reading the the text as well like through paragraph six or just paragraph one through three 
210.4,Oliver,,you're reading one through six but you'll find your first answer the equipment in one through three and your second and your second question in three through six ,gotcha okay cool i think we found some cool stuff 
120.4,Farrah,,all right is class ready okay awesome um who would like to share what they found would class like to go first let's just go left to right student what do you have for the first question what are some examples of equipment found on the moon ,okay so i highlighted two things first i highlighted the microscope because i thought that was something that you really mean like would be important and then as i was reading closely i saw that like another thing like a piece of equipment that you use on the moon is this thing called the orbiter 
130.2,Chris,,you did an awesome job to that um to make this a little easier did class have any answers that were different from savannas now oh student did you have an answer those different from savannas ,um yeah i think i might be not quite right though but what i said was i said that the the craters i don't know if it's equipment but i thought that maybe you could think of it as equipment because it holds the water you know what i mean 
210.4,Chris,,backed up why you said because if you had just said that you put creator down i probably would have marked it as a wrong answer but now that you're saying to me that they used it is used to hold water it is a very good it's a very good thought um what i would say to that is that while it could be used as equipment to hold it's not necessarily something that the scientists used to discover the water ,oh so it's the the equipment that like found the water so even if it was in the crater it's not like the crater was equipment to find it 
210.4,Oliver,,All right. ,so unfortunately we have to go to our next part but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with you thank you so much bye 
220.1,Luis,,bye i loved your class responses looking at it but i think we could do a little bit better and get a lot more of a specific answer so i'm going to have us do the same activity that we did with the first question yes student ,on so i guess like kind of what i was thinking is that like so i learned a lot from our last session and i do that i'm probably pretty good now i think i understand that 
150.1,Luis,,well there's always always more to learn that's how you get really good at something you don't think that you've learned it all you always have an open mind to learn more ,okay i got it 
420.3,Oliver,,awesome alright so i'm going to have us do the same activities before i'm going to give you class each a highlighter and you are going to read the section highlighting keywords and phrases to help answer the uuestion reread the second section paragraphs three through six of the text and then i want you to highlight two specific examples of how water on the moon could be valuable so i'm going to give you one minute to review the text you class can let me know if you're done before that and then i'm going to give you another minute after to highlight those two examples and then we'll come together and share does class have any questions before we start no all right i'm starting your timer and i want you to really closely reread those stats second section paragraphs three through six go ahead and start ,all right 
420.3,Oliver,,you class are all finished yeah awesome so now i'm giving you highlighters and i want you to go through those sections that you just read and i want you to highlight at least two examples of how water could be a valuable resource on the moon all right go ahead and get started ,all right we got 
420.3,Chris,,oh awesome you class are quick all right so last time we started with student so i'm going to switch it up a little and ask student to go ahead and start ,all right 
210.3,Chris,,so what two examples in the text did you highlight that shown that water is a valuable resource on the moon ,okay so i saw a couple things that jumped out to me so one thing i saw is that like astronauts could drink the water and like that's really important because like you have to drink water to survive and so that was really important as you could drink the water so that's one thing that's huge and then another thing that's useful is that you can use it to make oxygen to people so like that was saying that maybe they were going to put a moon base on the moon and i was thinking well they could use the water to make oxygen and to breath 
130.2,Luis,,teacher great let's see student did you have anything different today ,um yeah i mean i kind of noticed a couple things so one of the things that i noticed was that like i circled the same thing as student for the first part i put down that you could drink the water because i know how important it is to drink the water but i also said that you could make walk it like that just just out of each to oh i think is the chemical sign for water you can rock it yeah yeah 
110.1,Jazmin,,those are awesome answers and i was great job knowing that i'm waters chemical was h2o that was awesome student what's up ,and see me a little bit is still in display skin my skin but i can say this one day like quite sure when i'm confused about like i'm not quite sure like a we certainly are we're highlighting the things that we need to do that that like we can use the water for is that right 
110.4,Jazmin,,yeah that is correct ,okay that makes sense because that makes sense 
210.2,Jazmin,,that's all right so yeah i'll clarify that a little bit when i say let's think of examples of why water is a valuable resource or a valuable resources something that we can use so we are highlighting what are some ways we can use water the water that's on the moon ,oh that's okay 
210.2,Jazmin,,thank you ,i just didn't quite get the question right the first time um yeah so i was thinking about the moon base and i was thinking about the fact that like they were maybe going to do that for 2024 and it made me think a little bit about like they couldn't do a moon base if they did have water because just like student and student were saying like you have to use water to bring but then you can also use water to make rocket fuel and you can use water to make oxygen so you can breathe in the in the space like the little the base on the moon which is pretty cool 
210.3,Jazmin,,i think so to water is a super valuable resource wherever you go all right you class did an awesome job student after i clarified that for you do you have any new answers ,yeah so okay so i think when i look at it one of the things that jumped out was was interesting so like they said that it might be hard to extract some of the water so it made me think like what kinda you know what i mean like what kind of equipment with the to be able to bring out the water but it seems like because we're able to drill on earth that we would be able to do it so i guess well okay so i guess i understand that like that the water is a big thing that you could drink the water and you can also it sounds like rocket fuel and you can make oxygen and then like to be able to do that like what they have like a couple plans for how they might do it it seems very possible to make it seems like something that they could do and i know that student and depth but maybe it will be a long time before they do it but i guess i think maybe could be done really quickly 
210.1,Oliver,,i think of a lot of people put their minds to it could be done a lot quicker but there's a lot of things like money and time and just everything that goes into it so hopefully it'll get done sooner than that but we'll see i guess yes stuff ,so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for helping us first off to like correct our misconceptions because we have a lot of different ideas but they weren't always like accurate so you helped us understand like kind of what we needed to focus on and you also reminded us to use the evidence from the text and like even more than that you asked us about how we were thinking about stuff so when we talk about how we like think about stuff you know what i mean it helps us to sort of figure out how we got the answer and maybe make even better answers next time and um yeah it was really interesting that you you really value our our answers and because of that it was really comfortable to share so it probably we could share out in the class even if we were you know wrong because you would help us to learn like maybe what was more correct that was really cool thank you so much it was really fun 
120.2,Luis,,thank you so much for that feedback hi class so before even before i answer your question i'm just gonna review what we're going to go over so we're gonna talk about the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon we're going to talk about that student what's your question ,um well i was just gonna say that i know like all the stuff about space so like i don't really think i even need to be in this class 
110.3,Luis,,well you can you can then if you know questions that you might know the answers to questions that some of i might need help with or some of our classmates might need help with so i think you're going to be a pretty vital part of our class ,yeah sounds really cool 
120.4,Luis,,yeah all right so student since you said you know a lot about space can you answer the question for us what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon from our water on the moon text do you remember what the equipment they used ,well yeah so i was i was saying that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and and stuff like that 
130.2,Farrah,,do you if you look back into our texts called water on the moon who can raise their hand and what isn't it yeah they definitely use those what is a piece of equipment that the scientists use in that text that student didn't say how about student what did what did what equipment and i use ,so i believe they use the microscope because you you said that we should look at the text so why i believe that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to see and then the text it's like saying that the waters microscopic so like i think that's it 
210.4,Jazmin,,But they never said they need to use a microscope. But since they use the word microscopic that kind of infers that they needed to use a microscope. Remember for the next for the next person who answers kind of look in the text and who can remember a type of tool that the scientists used while they were on the moon yeah student ,and so basically okay so to use the text that you sent so basically i was in say nasa sent this small machine and am i supposed to say like more than that 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah so i so that the sentence that student is referring to is in the second paragraph it says nasa send a small machine student can you read us the rest of that sentence ,yeah okay so nasa sentence she called the lunar orbiter to investigate so it's the lunar orbiter right 
210.4,Jazmin,,i think so who agrees with student who agrees that the lunar orbiter was a tool that the scientists use they're not saying it would make it more it would make more sense if they said that's right so the scientists did use a tool called the lunar orbiter nasa send a small tool because it's asking us or sent a small piece of equipment since we're talking about the equipment they use but a machine is also kind of like the equipment yeah student ,since i was just i guess i don't understand why my answers were wrong you know what i mean like i my original answer was saying like nasa sent a small machine i was just wondering like what was what what was wrong with that answer 
230.3,Jazmin,,sure great question so let's look back at the question we're going to answer and i think that might help answer your question student so the question we're answering is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so student you answered with nasa send a small machine so am i right to say that you you said the equipment they used was a small machine ,yes yes the equipment was the small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,sure so that that is a correct answer a small machine i guess i'm just looking for you to be more specific about what those small machine is called do you remember what the small machine was called ,yeah okay okay so i think i understand i said nasa sent a small machine but i should have said like what the actual like machine was and the machine was the was the lunar orbiter right 
110.4,Chris,,exactly exactly all right student ,yeah i just was gonna say i was wondering like scientists like when my dad took me to nasa we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and stuff like that and i wondering like did they not use those things 
210.3,Farrah,,that's a great question so when so who thinks who thinks that the scientists only use the equipment that they talked about in the passage or do you think the scientists use other equipment as well as the equipment in the passage do you think the passage list all the equipment they used or just a few of the common student ,i think just some of the equipment because they have lots like hundreds maybe even thousands of pieces of equipment so like how could they you and i mean i think that's the most an unfortunately we have to go to lunch but we don't have much i just wanted to thank you for working with us and in particular i wanted to thank you for making sure that we were looking at the text and like drawing from the meeting or like what we were saying and also you look help us understand like we were beginning to sort of clarify and things like this is how we thought about this you know what i mean 
210.3,Farrah,,yeah it ,helped us make sure that we were on like understanding the keywords in the question and helping us to use evidence from the text in the answer so thank you so much for working with us 
210.3,Luis,,yeah bye ,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group. I already know all about space. "
120.2,Luis,,oh thank you student right now we are not talking about space we are talking about including evidence to support our answers so do you have anything to share about including evidence ,well i know that we're supposed to do that every time we answer a question 
210.2,Farrah,,you're right does class have any ideas of how we can share evidence sometimes we can use a quote does class know what that means ,oh oh yeah yeah i do remember that we learned that if somebody says something then you can say what they said i think ok i don't know 
230.2,Farrah,,you're right student you can quote someone that said something or you can quote what the author says what the text says it doesn't have to be a quote of what someone says in the text it could just be anything that's written on the text so can we go back right now and we can all look at our responses think about what we said and can we all think about why we chose to say those things and see if you can find the part of the text that tells you to say that you can go now ok raise your hand when you're finished student what did you add to your thoughts how are you going to support your thoughts ,ok so when i looked back i actually circled a quote already from the text because my answer was the last sentence in the story 
420.2,Farrah,,ok so sometimes if we just include the quote we also want to include our own thoughts to make the quote expand our thoughts with the quote so it's kind of two pieces you need is your own thoughts and the author's thoughts or the writer's thoughts student i know that you talked inaudible ,ms mahoney inaudible yeah 
420.2,Farrah,,yes ,i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
150.1,Farrah,,so the more details we add can make our answer better also sometimes you might answer and your answer is not wrong but it's not answering the question that was asked so we want to also look at the question because sometimes we might find something that's in the text and we might say it and it's very true but it has nothing to do with the question that was asked Does that make sense? ,yeah yeah 
230.1,Luis,,awesome student i know that you were talking about all your knowledge and your background knowledge is very beneficial and i love how you have that so did you think about how that knowledge relates to the question and the story that we read ,well how my knowledge relates how my knowledge relates to the question and the story well i mean so i know that the astronauts need equipment in order to go to the moon so that part i feel like that's how my knowledge relates because i know that they need oxygen tanks in order to breathe on the moon 
230.2,Luis,,and did you find the part of the story that you could quote that said anything about oxygen tanks ,no i couldn't find anything in there 
120.4,Chris,,because part of what we're doing is not just to learn about science but it's also to practice reading strategies so maybe you already knew that piece of information but you can find another piece of information from the text so right now we're focusing on stuff you can find from the text and we always want to do that first and if you have more information to add that's great you can add that later but we really want to focus on what we're reading yes student do you have something to add ,yeah i mean it's about science though it's not about the story but i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.3,Chris,,that's really cool thank you for sharing and maybe when we're doing a bigger writing assignment about this unit we can include some of the details that we already learned from other places like maybe luis's read other books about space and you've been to nasa so that's really cool and i'd love for us to get a chance for you to share that maybe during a show-and-tell ,ok ok that sounds really cool 
120.4,Oliver,,student do you have anything to add i haven't heard from you ,well i was looking at my answer when you told us to all look for where we found everything but i circled the last sentence just like student so i was just trying to think if what you told student i guess is the same for me 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah so do you remember what i said to student ,"that she's gotta say stuff in her own words she can't just pull the quote from the story Yeah. Ms. Mahoney, I just saw the clock, and it's time for us to go to lunch. This was really short, but I really appreciate how you really helped us think about how we found evidence from the story and our answer or how we needed to add more work and not just the evidence from the story, like me and Farrah. "
150.1,Oliver,,all right well we can all line up now and put our tablets away so we can go enjoy lunch ok i cannot somehow make the screen big but hi class ,hi 
150.1,Luis,,ok so now hearing back from all of your responses and everything they sound amazing but we do have to talk a little bit about getting our minds a little bit deeper in the text yes student i believe ,yeah it's me student excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,and that's ok sometimes we need to know a little bit deeper and maybe just help our other classmates to understand just what we're talking about and maybe get our minds going a little bit ,ok 
210.4,Farrah,,sounds good ok now i saw a lot of vocabulary that you class used in your responses and that's amazing and you did a really good job with that so now we're going to go more into the thinking aspect of answering the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so let's talk about the actual tools that were used which i know some of you used in your explanation class want to raise their hand and just list maybe one of the tools that were used a specific tool that the scientists used student ,yeah i said that they used the microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,and that's right and we saw that in i believe the third part of the ,yeah in paragraph 3 
230.2,Farrah,,the third part of the article ok and they used that in a specific line which student noticed when they set the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a m now when student found that did you look at the text and reread it to notice that they said a scientific tool ,oh well i noticed that the first time because i was looking for the word equipment and then i didn't see equipment so when i was looking for it i was looking for anything else that might be equipment and also that it talks about water and so that's how i found it there but i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,It's not wrong at all. so what you did was you answered the question but we need more tools too maybe think further on our answers so that's what you did you looked through and you tried to find the word that fitted does class else have any ideas about tools but maybe we can use another tool like rereading through all of the text right and then if we reread through the text we can find a little bit more details and maybe even more of the tools that came up within the article ,they said that nasa sent a small machine 
420.2,Jazmin,,i'm sorry could you send it one more time ,yeah i said that nasa sent a small machine 
130.3,Jazmin,,and that is true they did and we saw that in the second part of the article number 2 where it said nasa sent a small machine called and you'd see that in the text they called it a lunar orbiter to investigate what they found on the moon so that is just another specific way of looking to see in the text what's happening so like you student you explained that they sent a small machine but if we use the tool of rereading the text we would have seen that there was a name for it which is the lunar orbiter ,oh yeah ok i see that one right there yeah ok i see that 
420.2,Chris,,it's a lunar orbiter so that would have helped out your answer and made it a little bit more specific so you're not wrong it is a small machine but just to add a little bit more detail and clarification so it's nice and clear ,ok ok well i went to nasa it's me student right here i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits like lots of different equipment that they need to use to go to the moon 
120.4,Chris,,that is right now student would you like to share your answer ,yeah sure i said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
420.2,Chris,,"OK, and let's look back at our question to see just what we need to answer. So it says, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? so even though you do have your background knowledge that we activated and even though you know that they use a lot of different tools maybe we could just look through the article to find what they specifically used ",the lunar orbiter or the microscope so my answer is wrong 
420.2,Chris,,to answer the actual question which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon we just need to go in a little bit more detail and make sure that we're rereading the text to answer the question ,ok ok ok 
210.2,Oliver,,ok because your answer shows and tells me that you understood what the article was about and that you know that there was water on the moon and the scientists were using tools to examine it and that tells me that you understood it but maybe we just need to look at the question a little bit further to know that ok you know what this says we need to focus on the tools we're going to focus on the tools ,ok ok miss lisa it's time for us to go to lunch i know it's been a very short time but i wanted to say i appreciate how you helped us look for more evidence in the text to put into our answers so thank you bye 
210.2,Farrah,,bye hi class how are you doing ,hi good to see you 
150.1,Luis,,good to see you too so right now we're going to kind of discuss your responses that you had about the the story about not the story the reading about the moon student do you need anything what's up ,um yeah i was just gonna say like i already know like all there is to know about space already so i don't think i need to even be in this class 
210.3,Farrah,,well right now we're working on olivereloping our responses so even if you know a lot it's about verbalizing what you know so that's what we're practicing right now so i'm student in your response you kind of talked about a tool did you want to kind of expand and talk with that tool and what it does ,yeah okay so i i said i was talking about the microscope is the tool that they use and i think that because of what they said in the beginning reach every reader he said in paragraph three you wouldn't be able to see it for the water is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so i'm thinking that they could how could they find the water if they can't see the water you know what i mean 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah so they use the microscope has any have have any of you class ever use a microscope before yes student ,and yeah i've used it 
210.4,Oliver,,so you have used to it have you ever what have you used it on usually use it on like a small thing right ,yeah yeah in science class last year we we saw mr anderson use one and like was he was looking at i think it was like i think he was looking at his spit or something it was like something like that we were looking at like really close 
210.4,Chris,,so that's a tool that we that you can implement in your responses yes student yeah and what we what we learned in the passage was that we that we were using it to learn to look at the water ,actually yeah i was gonna ask so i i noticed that like when i was like went to nasa that scientists use oxygen tanks at masks and stuff like that i was wondering like where does that fit in 
210.3,Jazmin,,yes yeah those are other tools that scientists use but they are tools that you use to help you acclimate to the moon in the gravity and this tools that we talked about in the passage are tools that use to discover something there was another machine student you actually mentioned it in your or just mentioned a small machine in your response do you want to kind of broaden that a little bit ,yeah when you say how would i broaden what would that look like 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay so when you say nasa send a small machine do you know exactly what that machine was called ,yeah yeah it was called the lunar orbiter 
420.2,Farrah,,So that could be useful in your response. yes student ,oh i guess i was wondering why my answer was wrong 
210.4,Farrah,,your answer wasn't wrong it had all the great all the good pieces in it but we just need to beef up your answer a little bit and use a little bit more academic vocabulary you said you'll need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely which is which is very true but do you know what we're looking closely at ,we're looking at the water on the moon 
420.2,Farrah,,you might want to add that into your answer as well to be very concrete and make sure you're using all your resources from the passage ,so like 
530.1,Oliver,,so what would you with our discussion today what would you say your answer would be and how would it change ,"Mmm hmm. Well, I guess. Okay, so if Farrah was like kind of something like Talking about the scientific tool and like more complete is like something. it uses academic language by like how do i know which language you use "
530.1,Farrah,,okay that's a really good question so anything that is ,"Oh, well, actually I was just gonna say that, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. have before we go i just wanted to add like in particular i wanted to thank you for encouraging us to use the text and also like that you were helping us you were very positive as we were trying to think about our answers thank you so much "
530.1,Farrah,,thank you thank you all have a great time at lunch ,thank you 
530.1,Luis,,alright class so i have some good answers here but i wanted to see if we can expand our thinking a little so student i'm going to start with you you told me that nasa center oh it's and did you have a question ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know a lot about space 
110.3,Jazmin,,you know a lot about space well i'd love for you to stay and share some of your ideas with the other friends in our class i think that would be i'm going to ask student a question first so she's will me that nasa send a small machine student do you remember why nasa sent a small machine and maybe what it's called you'd be a really great resource for us so why don't you hang tight ,no i don't remember 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay so if we look back to our reading it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter a lunar orbiter does class remember why they sent the lunar orbiter ,oh yeah i see that nasa sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will end at the south pole and look for ice deposits and so it can land at the south pole and look for ice to pass it in a large polar crater 
420.2,Jazmin,,great so incorporating that information in your answer really shows me that you understand the reading so i think that would be a great detail to add in your answers ,to write down all i'm sorry you think i have to write down all of those words 
420.2,Jazmin,,but if you can put that sentence into your own words that shows me that you understand ,um you're saying i have to take a big long sentence and then i have to write it but not copy down the exact same word 
150.1,Jazmin,,right do you want to go through it together so let's see what we can come up with together so we have nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small so student said nasa center small machine Does that make sense. Is that a little easier. ,yeah i guess that's a few less words okay 
150.1,Farrah,,Farrah do you have a question. ,yeah i don't understand why my answer was wrong 
210.4,Farrah,,let's see you're right you told me you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely mm hmm um let's see i so your answer wasn't wrong however you the you use the words exactly from the passage so it's good that you showed me that you read the passage and you understand but i want you to put it in your own words to show me that you know why they have to use a microscope so do you why do they need a microscope to look really closely ,oh much i'm not sure 
210.4,Farrah,,do you know what a microscope is ,yeah yeah a microscope is is what you use in science class to look at really small thing 
210.4,Farrah,,so if you use a microscope look at really small things why do you think you would need a microscope to look at the water found on the moon because it's ,it's really small 
420.2,Farrah,,it's really small so saying that in your answer shows me that you understand what a microscope is and that you know that the water on the moon is really small and that you got all that information from reading the passage ,ok ok 
420.2,Farrah,,ok here ,okay i think so you're saying kind of like student where i gotta i gotta put it in i gotta say more stuff in my own words maybe 
230.1,Oliver,,exactly put it in your own words to show that you understand that's perfect so deb you said you circled the same thing as student what is what does that mean to you why did you highlight that answer ,well cause when you asked class to say their answers and student said hers and i realized that she had the same thing that i had i talked about the microscope and the story the part where it says that they they arm you need assigned the last sentence you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's the same thing but i circled in my answer to 
230.1,Oliver,,can you explain a little bit more why you circle that ,yeah possible question asked about equipment and asked about looking at water and when i read the story that i only saw this was the only time where they talked about an equipment looking at the water 
210.4,Oliver,,awesome good job that's that's really good so you saw equipment in the discussion question and you highlighted the microscope just like student so next time it's good it's okay that you chose the same answer that shows me that you class are highlighting the right answers in the passage Chris. so student also that scientists found craters full of water on the moon which is absolutely correct they did so based off the conversation we're having now could you tell me what equipment they used to find the water and the craters ,student said the microscope student said i'm a small machine i think i think you said the lunar orbiter um i guess it's one of those i mean i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits mm hmm 
410.2,Oliver,,so so basically the words that your classmates have been using and what you already know from going to nasa those are some of the words i want to hear in your answer those are some of the words i want to hear in your answer so our question was highlighting the equipment that science scientists use to find the water on the moon you're absolutely right that they found water on the moon that's what our passage told us So the lunar orbiter the microscope and you said some masks and other oxygen tanks and equipment like that. So that's really good. but we need to highlight the equipment that they used ,i'm excuse me teacher i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thank you so much for giving all of us suggestions on how we can improve our answers and how you you listen to all of our ideas and suggestions i were different for each one of us so thank you 
120.2,Luis,,of course have a good day all right class so you just answered a question for me about our water on the moon passage or question was what equipment and scientists you should discover water on the moon so i want to talk about a couple of your answers so let's start with student oh student you have a question ,i guess i was just gonna say that i i i don't think that i need to be in that class because i don't think i need any help because i already don't our space 
110.3,Luis,,i'm so glad that you know a lot about space but i think you staying in our class would really benefit our other classmates because maybe you could share some information that you already know about space that sounds good ,awesome yeah that sounds great i'm super into that 
230.2,Jazmin,,good all right i'm going to call on student first let's talk about student answer so you told me that nasa send a small machine now where did you get that information ,i could click to when i will do a new paragraph and it basically said paragraph to that let's see nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investing so i thought this small machine was what they used to find the water 
230.1,Oliver,,"and you're absolutely right the small machine is what they used to find the water on the moon it's called a lunar orbiter so next time when we're giving our answers to these questions we want to make sure that we're including details like the name of the small machine that nasa sent but you're absolutely right you yeah that really clarifies your answer All right, yeah of course Okay, so you told me that you circled the same answer Farrah could you tell me what the answer was. ",um yeah so basically i was saying that they use the microscope in order to find the water because you know they couldn't they couldn't find the water unless they could see 
420.2,Oliver,,that's awesome so what student told me is that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and then what your answer showed me is the evidence behind that what a microscope does and why we needed to look really closely because it zooms in on the really small molecules in the water right so like i told for student when you're giving answers you want to make sure you have your evidence to back up your statement as well ,cool yeah i can do that 
420.2,Farrah,,awesome so then i see you have a question what's going on ,yeah i was just kind of thinking as i was listening to you talking to oliveron class i guess i was still confused because you know in our class this is to help us to understand better um i guess they don't understand like why my answer is like not correct why it's wrong 
410.2,Farrah,,i see okay so your answer is tell me that we need a microscope to look really closely so what that means is the question was what equipment we used to find the water on the space on the moon and while your answer told me the equipment that we use to look at the water does that make sense we need to be able to know the equipment that we use to find the water first before we analyze it ,oh i'm sorry 
410.2,Farrah,,no go ahead ,well i was just wondering like you i i guess it kind of had in my imagination like there was an astronaut who had a microscope and wasn't looking at the at the water but student was saying that there was something else that they use so maybe they didn't have any instruments 
150.1,Farrah,,definitely use your imagination i really like how you visualize the situation before giving your answer that's a really good strategy to answering questions but what happened first is nasa sent the machine so there might not have been any astronauts and the machine just went on to the moon to look for the water so we definitely use the microscope to look at the water but the question asked which equipment we use to find the water first does that make sense ,yeah so they use like some other kind of equipment or tracker or something like the student said the lunar orbiter that's what found the right and then they looked at the water maybe later after they found it so they didn't use the microscope buying the 
210.4,Chris,,exactly that's correct because the two equipments go hand in hand student what's going on ,um so i guess i was just picking up because i went to nasa and i know that scientists is a lot of equipment oxygen tanks and masks and sutent thing i was wondering where that fits in to the reading 
210.4,Chris,,so we're fits into the reading let's talk about that so scientists so at nasa they have like student said astronauts so they would use equipment like suits and helmets to go into space and then scientists a lot of scientists they were special jackets when they're in the lab and sometimes maybe they'll wear masks to protect themselves so where that fits into our reading if scientists so we sent the machine into onto the moon we collected some samples with them lunar orbiter and then that came back to a lab and then the scientists in the lab use the different equipment like maybe a microscope to look at the water that the lunar orbiter connected from the moon so it all goes together like a big web of ideas everything connects ,oh okay that makes a lot of sense so like okay so if there was an astronaut on food maybe they use that but the truth is that they did it is that right they didn't eat an astronaut because they sent the small sheet 
210.4,Chris,,yeah so the machine did all the work that an astronaut might have done on the on the moon but a tiny little machine did it for us so we didn't have to send class up there that makes sense ,yeah that makes a lot of 
210.4,Jazmin,,student what's your question ,my next class but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us this is really cool because i think we understand a lot more thank you so much 
230.2,Chris,,all right so student let's talk about the answer you gave me to the question so your answer was scientists found craters full of water on the moon so can you tell me where in the passage you found that answer where did you get it from ,yeah okay so basically when i looked at the end it ended i see it oh in paragraph one on it says that scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these traders are dark places where the sun never shot so that's where i saw the part about 
210.3,Chris,,okay so you're absolutely right about craters their work craters on the moon and there was some water in there but i want to reread it again i want to show you a sentence and i think it's a paragraph three paragraph three it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth they found water that is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so knowing that now now that we've rerouted do you think you would change your answer ,yeah i guess because the question was what equipment right did they use so i guess i was talking about the craters because i was thinking that like that's where they had the water you know and i mean with the craters so but the question is what was used is that right 
110.1,Chris,,yeah you're absolutely right so we talked about that ,we so 
110.1,Chris,,good ,yeah so i guess i would say like the equipment that they use so it sounds like they use if i was listening to class it sounds like they use on the lunar orbiter to find it and then they use the microscope to to study 
210.4,Chris,,absolutely and that shows me that you really understood the text and what everybody's saying and before we move on intimacy you have your hand up but before i answer you i just want to say that you want to make sure you don't want to confuse the amount of water that they found in the moon so there was a very small amount so instead of saying it's full of water the craters are full of water there was a tiny bit in there that we can look further into using our equipment or microscope all right ,oh i see yeah 
150.1,Chris,,that make more sense ,yeah that makes a lot 
120.4,Luis,,awesome student what's your question ,um so i was just gonna say that this has been really fun and i think that i've got it all figured out so i 
230.2,Luis,,i i'm so glad you're having so much fun but what i want i want to talk about your answer so you told me that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks so which is absolutely true scientists may be using oxygen tanks but did was that listed anywhere and article didn't say that we use oxygen tanks can you show me where you found that ,that's a that's a really good question um i guess let me look at see i'm well i don't see any oxygen tanks i guess i was using what i do because you know i visited nasa and i'm even student and i went together with his dad and so we saw that astronauts have to use the oxygen tanks but i remember you said that maybe there weren't any astronauts at all so maybe they didn't need oxygen 
130.1,Luis,,you're absolutely right so while your answer is right that scientists do use oxygen tank sometimes when we were talking about water being found on the moon i love how you use your background knowledge to answer the questions but i don't think it answers this specific question and you understand ,yeah i think so that you gotta do what 
120.4,Jazmin,,exactly what's going on student ,i was just when i was thinking about this when i think about and i'm like well they it says like what equipment to they used to discover the water and i'm thinking like well obviously they use the lunar orbiter have to discover it but like i guess in this case it seems like there should be more information like a lunar orbiter like probably has blocked it experiments but like what are the instruments like how do they find water without without seeing it with a microscope like i can simply use the mask 
210.4,Jazmin,,i understood confusion so and so so the lunar orbiter he looks for the ice deposits in the polar the polar craters and so your question is how exactly the lunar orbiter looks for that right ,yeah like the idea that like student and student and they were saying that like even i mean like you need other stuff like you up astronauts and other things like that and i guess it just got me wondering like could you use this to find water or do you just need to use the lunar orbiter 
110.1,Jazmin,,i think that's a great question and i don't think that our reading answers your question completely so that would be a great question to write down and maybe you can we can do some more research about it ,okay 
120.4,Oliver,,all right dave do you have a question ,um yeah i guess for me i so i read that they weren't going to put a moon base on the moon maybe by 2024 that was the goal and i was wondering like did they will they like us to you know what i mean to have water for the moon base 
110.1,Oliver,,you class have lots of great questions and i think you know a little bit more than i do even about what's going on up in space but they definitely my i think that's in like i said for student that's a great question to write down that we can look into as we talk more about the moon in the water on the moon ,that 
110.1,Farrah,,yes ,so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to take a moment and i wanted to thank you for working with us today and i in particular i wanted to thank you for pushing us to think about what we were saying like you really the first you really listen to what we said so you didn't like cut us off you like really heard what we were saying you let us talk to each other about like what we thought about each other and but you helped us to really understand like what you were looking for and so as a result i feel like we were able to have a really like in depth conversation which was really fun interesting i feel really interested by this stuff that we've covered to thank you so much it was really fun to work with wasn't it oh yeah it was awesome thank you so much bye bye bye 
230.3,Farrah,,start simulation hi boys and girls so we just finished our small discussion about water on the moon and you class all had wonderful responses but now we're going to go a little bit deeper into the text and really think about the question that's being asked so the question that was asked was what equipment do scientists use to discover water on the moon and student i noticed that in your response you actually talked about microscopes which help the scientists to see things closer is that sure you said that right in your response ,yeah that was my response yeah 
210.4,Oliver,,that was actually really good one thing i noticed was that you took the evidence from the text that scientists wanting to see things see the orbits the craters closer and you connected that to microscopes which is really good even though lunar orbiter is which is what the scientists used to investigate the craters are could possibly have microscopes to give scientists a closer look what we want to actually think of in our answer is the actual equipment that's being used which is the lunar orbiter and that helps us if you look in the text it looks for ice deposits in large craters now i want i want you to think about what other things that we might find in look in lunar orbiters that could be helpful for us to have a closer look and deb i saw that in your answer you had similar answer to student so do is there any tool or gadget that you could think of that would be helpful to have on an orbiter ,um yeah so i agree with student and i thought basically that like um you know you would need the microscope because they said in the reading that the water was microscopic and you couldn't see it with your eyes and so i was thinking like the scientists would have to bring a microscope with them to see the water and so i guess that's how they found the water 
120.4,Luis,,so in the text it tells us that the scientists actually send the lunar orbiters to to space that they don't actually go there themselves they send these machines like you said student nasa send a small machine which is called the lunar orbiter to earth student do you have anything to add i see your hands raised ,um yeah i was just gonna say that honestly like i already know all about space i don't think i need any help i don't even think i should be in this 
120.4,Chris,,oh okay i understand i think that we can always learn from each other and so i think we can what you can do is look at the responses of your classmates and see if there's anything that you didn't know which would be really cool and i saw that in your answer you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and as i was talking about with student that the scientists weren't actually sent out to nasa i'm fine nasa nasa sent out the lunar orbiters to look at the little to look at the craters in the earth so in that sense the lunar orbiter do not need oxygen but why do you why do you think that using the text why do you think that nasa would send lunar orbiters instead of scientists or astronauts could class answer that ,oh that's a really that's an interesting question um 
120.4,Chris,,yeah student go ahead you can respond ,um well i was gonna say that i went to nasa so like with my dad and so i noticed that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks but it sounds like you're telling us that the lunar orbiter went without any astronaut is that right 
120.4,Jazmin,,that is true it was it's like it's so as student was saying it's a machine so they send it up to space without the need or help of any astronauts student is there anything that you want to add ,so basically just what i was gonna say was i wasn't sure why my answer was well 
210.4,Luis,,i think that we can add more details to your answer so let's do a sentence spring and does class remember from the text what the lunar orbiter does yes student ,um well the lunar orbiter like it goes up to the moon and orbits the moon and it studies like different things like beams down stuff and maybe it sends a rover but it like goes down and looks at like what's happening on the 
210.4,Farrah,,moon yeah so basically it gets a closer look i was thinking student do you have anything you want to add that one of the helpful tools could have been a camera right there could be microscopes connected to the lunar orbiter but there could also be a camera that would help scientists here on earth get a closer look to the moon ,oh i think i was going to answer the question before but actually we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and in particular i wanted to thank you for asking us to use evidence in what we were like saying because that way we were able to back it up using the text and like you were helping us to really understand what the question was and i think some of us didn't know quite what what the question was looking at like the question was saying like you know if the lunar orbiter was was what they used to invest and discover and i think that also like you really helped us to like build value i think we all felt like our opinions were really worthwhile so thank you so much for working with us bye 
210.4,Oliver,,hi class how are we doing today ,all work good and we're excited to work with you 
210.4,Luis,,i'm excited to do you have a question for us to start student i see your hands raised ,yeah there's nothing i am kind of know like all this stuff already so like i don't really think i need any help i don't need to be in this class 
210.3,Farrah,,we're gonna actually go to the passage right now so i have student could you tell us your answer to the question to question one again well the good thing is we can all learn some more from each other right so our question for number one was what equipment and students us to discover water on the moon and you're right to say that the scientists need a tool called the microscope to look really closely do you remember from the passage what the scientists are using this tool to look at ,yeah you're looking at the microscopic water on the moon 
210.4,Jazmin,,yes exactly and those are found inside the craters right the large pool of craters there's another tool that they used did class mentioned that tool in their answer would like to share go ahead student yes small machine the name of that small machine if you look back into paragraph two it actually tells us the name of this machine yes the lunar orbiter and they use this to investigate things on the moon right specifically the ice deposits ,i was acutally kind of confused because i wasn't sure we're all here because maybe our answers are not fully right so i was kind of wondering like why is my answer wrong 
150.1,Luis,,but what we want to do is add more supporting details to give yourself a stronger answer and we can help each other by doing that by listening to our peers and coming together to make a stronger answer student do you have something to add to our discussion ,yeah so what i realized that student and i okay we both were talking earlier like luis's answer about how the scientists use lots of equipment so i was gonna say i'm watching student do you want to say your answer um yeah so here was the thing like scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and suits and masks and that stuff so i was thinking like you know like maybe the the reading was missing important like things like do you know what i mean because how could the scientists be up there like getting water if they don't have a spacesuit 
120.4,Oliver,,the thing is that what we're thinking about is the astronauts who uses oxygen tanks so the top scientists can create these tools but the astronaut that are actually using these tools and i think what you were thinking about was the the fourth paragraph which was talking about how water is used and that's one thing that we talked about in our second question so they could have so the supply of water couldn't be used for oxygen tanks on the moon the hydrogen and oxygen you connect to the fact that the waters were found on the moon is used for oxygen right we know that water is made from hydrogen and oxygen so that oxygen can be taken out from the water and used for oxygen tanks like you said that is a tool that astronauts use on the moon you're right what class else want to share their answer student i know you had a similar answer to what student said is there anything else you'd like to add to the class answer ,um so yeah i thought that student was right and i i found that evidence myself what i noticed was that the microscope okay so student and i talked and we said that you can't find the water if you can't see it like you'll have to be able to see the water so we thought like how could they discover the water unless they use the microscope first 
130.1,Oliver,,exactly there's a possibility that the lunar that there's a microscope on the lunar orbiter that helps us look at the ashes on the moon ,oh that's all 
150.1,Chris,,yeah that is that is interesting right is there class would want to add anything to our conversation yes student ,so i kind of was just well okay so i was thinking about that i went to nasa so i like you were saying i know that scientists use a lot of equipment oxygen tanks and masks and suits things like that so it kind of was making me think like did they not use those to discover the water like they use those like you were saying in the second reading 
210.4,Farrah,,yes here i think we we want to answer question one before we move on to answer question two so the question was asked us to talk about the equipment that scientists which was the lunar orbiter and the microscopes and then question two asked us to give evidence on what is found on the moon and why it can be valuable like the water but there's also tools that the astronauts use on the moon to find that water and then how that water is used so we want to make sure that when we are answering question one that we are sticking to the tools that are used and giving supporting details about those tools like for instance a lunar orbiter is a small machine right that looks for ice deposits in a large craters that's what paragraph told us now can someone give me information on a microscope what does it say that the microscope does can you look into your paragraph and find that and then you class raise your hand and when you class could share with the class go ahead student ,okay basically i'm sorry unfortunately we have to go to our next class but we really wanted to thank you for working with us this was really fun thank you 
120.4,Jazmin,,alright class we're actually going to start with jazmin's question so student coule you repeat your question to your classmates your answer your responses to your classmates ,yeah so basically my response was that water is valuble because astronauts keep drinking water and the water help them stay hydrated you can't survive without water right paragraph four were actually going to hear to have evidence for what you just said 
120.3,Jazmin,,right paragraph four says water on the moon would be a valuable or very important resource it could be useful in lots of ways for example future astronauts could drink the water like you said right water is ,yeah 
130.3,Luis,,takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft who mentioned this in their response could you raise your hand right and you said water was heavy and that is true that is part of our response right student but what what do astronauts then do to avoid this to avoid that the water is too heavy we have we found evidence in paragraph five no in paragraph four that actually tells us what they do do you know what this is look into paragraph for the sentence after it says it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft it tells us why it would be good for us to have water on the moon yes student ,so yeah i kind of know all about this i think i am good 
120.3,Luis,,would you be able to read that last sentence for us then as a class ,yeah i would love to read that sounds great okay i'm in paragraph five is that right 
120.3,Luis,,paragraph four the last sentence ,okay having water available on the moon we need more room on the spacecraft people and things like oxygen tanks 
210.4,Chris,,now they have room for what student all right let's get back to what student was saying about how the water is heavy so this paragraph is that water is valuable because on the moon water becomes valuable because then astronauts don't have to carry the heavy water inside the spacecraft ,well they have room for kind of other stuff so maybe they want to bring different kinds of food or maybe more likely they want to bring like other equipment and stuff like that 
110.1,Luis,,exactly student could you now respond and tell us your answer ,yeah yeah i would love to so okay my answer and i actually this way but i also saw in the reading because i did look at the reading this time teacher um i did look at it and i saw that the water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
210.3,Luis,,yes so evidence from the text shows us tell us that water can be broken down into two parts like you said hydrogen and oxygen and which one of those two do the astronauts use for breathing student ,oxygen 
210.4,Farrah,,yes so not only is water valuable because we can drink it and it can save space and spacecraft but also because we can use it for what you said oxygen student that's very true that is good observation we also talked about the bottom talks about how we can use hydrogen for something else student could you tell us what that something else is it's in paragraph five ,okay it says that you can use hydrogen you can use it to make rocket 
120.4,Oliver,,rocket exactly it says here the moon could serve as a stop for spacecrafts to refill their gas before heading out into the solar system so let's review why water is valuable and i know that student had a response as well what was your response before we go over the reasons why water is valuable ,well so i actually have my opinion is that water um yeah i can see that it's valuable like it's not that it's not valuable but it's not ready yet like they talk in the reading a lot at the end about how hard it would be to figure out like how to even like find the water like they said in the first reading that like it was like there's just like little microscopic particles of it and you have to somehow get out of the dirt and out of the craters and all this stuff like that's really hard like we don't have something that can just do that we'd have to invent it and build it so i kind of am thinking that the evidence is not convincing because just because the waters there doesn't mean that we can use it 
210.3,Oliver,,"But if you are an astronaut, think about yourself if you were an astronaut wouldn't you want to enable it you found it, even if it was a little amount of water. ",yeah i yeah i i do think it's valuable but i think because i was trying to read the question really closely like we did last time and because it's saying like is the evidence convincing i don't think it is i think that the evidence says that the waters like i think it will be valuable in the future but i don't think it's valuable 
210.2,Chris,,i love how you were challenging the question itself the evidence that we put out here is wrong it is valuable but then how do we get that water is also another question we can ask ourselves to see if that evidence of water being valuable is actually convincing student just something else to add to the class ,i was gonna say i think student and i were talking about this that they are going to maybe try to make up base by 2024 so maybe they will figure it out by that 
110.3,Jazmin,,yeah that's our hopes right scientists works really hard to make sure that astronauts are given the materials and that they're meeting the requirements so that astronauts can go into space and have a safe travels there student i saw your hand raised do you have anything else to add let ,reach every reader well i just wanna say that i was a little bit confused because i thought the water was valuable as a defense argument i actually really think it's a good argument but i think you could argue both ways like i think you could say that it's not valuable because yeah because it's really hard to get it out of the way but i think you could also say is valuable because like sometimes right like you know like my dad works for like my dad works for oil companies so like they know that they sometimes look for oil and they don't know where it is yet but it's valuable even if they don't have it yet so maybe 
210.2,Oliver,,"Oliver, has that change your thinking a little bit? how is what student said change your thinking so even though it's hard to get merged she said the oil better product strategy part to get we still see that as valuable so i think that just because we can't it's hard to get does not make it not valuable the water is still valuable not what we're trying to prove in our argument right ",yeah that's a really good point unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us i'd like in particular i really wanted to thank you for helping us clear up like any kind of misconception we had and making sure that we use evidence in our answers and also um you really valued all of our answers so i think that class had time to explain their ideas and i think like right class like class thought value right like class was like we all felt really like heard and then like thank you so much for helping us understand like what we needed to work on because you gave us ideas for how we could improve our answers in both of our classes so that was so awesome thank you so much and bye 
220.1,Luis,,well hello okay so i just heard all of your awesome responses and i just want to know a little bit more what you've got from the text so i'm going to start yes what's up student ,asked me i shouldn't be and that's great i already know all about space 
210.3,Oliver,,do you know what since you know so much about space when you talk to your partners you can tell them a little bit more of what you know but i need someone to explain a little bit more on what they were reading about or what they thought was interesting so deb what is something else that you notice from the text or from the question like what can you expand on your answer a little bit ,yeah okay so when i was reading the text and i was looking at the question let's talk ask for evidence right that scientists use and some tools some equipment and so i was reading and i was looking for equipment equipment equipment equipment equipment equipment equipment oh and then i saw about the microscope fit to the tool and i was like oh that's equipment so i'm probably right and they were talking about looking at water so so yeah so that's how i got there 
130.2,Jazmin,,um can i ask how about student do you have anything else you would want to say about the reading or your answer that you answered before john expand a little bit awesome well i love this response that you have right now that was amazing i don't think so no okay does class else want to say something real quick you can raise your hand ,well i guess i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
110.2,Jazmin,,i would just want some more expanding of your answers like class can expand on their answers but if you don't have anything to say that's totally fine no i'm not saying your answers wrong ,um well i mean i just i i feel like i i put words down from from story and so 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah did you notice i'm a name of the equipment that they were using to look for the water numbers ,to investigate the lunar orbiter good 
210.4,Farrah,,awesome how about student i loved your answer when you talked about the microscope have you ever seen a microscope ,oh yeah yeah we we use it in in and miss smith science class 
210.4,Chris,,yeah awesome isn't it what do you use my microscopes for do you know does class know raise your hand how about student i haven't heard you talk today ,so in this miss class we've been looking at like an amoeba and really small thing so we use a microscope to look at stuff that we can't really see i mean we can see it but like we can see it like like a whole lot more it's really kind of like you know expanded or or or closer up in the microscope 
210.4,Luis,,awesome okay how have you ever used a microscope before wow that's us ,um well not before that class no um i mean i've seen it on tv and stuff but we don't have one at my house 
210.4,Luis,,okay do you think it would be really cool to have a little waters on it and see that there's water in the moon from the story that we read ,oh wow yeah yeah that'd be man i think so cool to see like water up close on a microscope and see like what it looks like that'd be real cool yeah 
110.1,Chris,,awesome ,i went to nasa so i know that's high does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too so lots of different equipment that they use 
140.1,Farrah,,yeah would class ever want to go to space and experience this student what about you would you want to or would you not ,oh yeah definitely i think it'd be like really really cool to go to space and to see the moon and maybe like walk on the moon yeah that would be great 
130.2,Jazmin,,awesome what about student what do you think about that ,i mean i think it might be cool to go to space but i feel like if we make it too easy to go to space and that'll make it too easy for class on earth to just you know like to keep destroying our planet because the planet is dying and class is just kind of giving up on it and figuring they'll just go and like live on mars or something and so maybe we shouldn't make it so easy to go to space 
130.2,Oliver,,that's a good idea no thought student did you wanna chime in on anything i know ,i'm nah i'm just chillin chillin back oh excuse me teacher i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it is time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thanks for for for taking some time with us and for helping us to bring him some of our background knowledge and true book for classroom 
130.2,All,,well thanks oliveron class i hope you have fun during lunch and recess ,thank you class 
230.1,Luis,,okay start simulation hey class so listening to your answers lots of them were very great really proud of you class i just have a couple of questions for a couple of you class so deb could you go more in depth with your answer i know you did circle the same as student but i want to know why you did or if you had something else you wanted to add to yeah ,sure sure okay let me look at what i circled in a story excuse me teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Oliver,,well honestly i think that you could be a great resource for your class members and you could help them maybe like come up with our own answers or maybe tell them what you think to ,okay i found it so it was in the um third paragraph 
110.3,Oliver,,i was yeah ,i was looking for um you know like water on the moon and finding water and a tool and so they talk about the scientific tool which is like equipment 
110.3,Oliver,,mm hmm ,and that paragraph they talk about the water they found is microscopic so we've got equipment and finding water and that's 
230.1,Oliver,,awesome so what do you think the answer was just to make sure that i'm hearing you correctly ,um they used a microscope to find water on the moon 
130.2,Luis,,great awesome good job i'm so student that right that's me okay sorry i couldn't really see your name tag um so i was wondering so i remember you were talking about how nasa send a small machine do you remember what the machines name was let me see does class want to help her out or point to where it was in the article ,i had microscope i said i said oxygen tank so i don't know what the small machine was that she was talking about 
230.1,Jazmin,,okay i'm student do you remember what you were thinking about when you were saying the machine before looking ,i'm looking at the story now so i can see it it says nasa small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay great awesome let me see who else i ,still don't understand why my answers wrong 
110.2,Jazmin,,no i was just wondering like what if you remember the name because that is correct that they did send that to find like if the water was on the moon ,so it is right 
130.1,Jazmin,,yeah part of it ,oh ok 
130.1,Jazmin,,stop simulation ,wait but we still have four minutes 
230.1,Farrah,,okay um student do you want to talk about more about what you were talking about before do you have a house ,yeah cuz i guess i was just trying i was listening to what you said to student no i don't remember what your sentence was student that that teacher helps you to make um i said man i don't remember what i said either let me look up a story 
210.4,Farrah,,you were talking about how in paragraph three it talks about the um yeah ,the water with a microscopic okay but if if student is right that means i'm right but then 
130.3,Farrah,,savannas right yeah so i feel like this question has multiple parts to it um so let's like go over the question so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so what i thought would be the answer i was answering it would be the lunar orbiter and they use the microscope to actually find the water so i thought it would be both ,okay okay so we're both right 
150.1,Chris,,yeah you class you did awesome great okay does class else want to add into it or thought that they saw something interesting in the reading yes ,i worked at nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.3,Chris,,uh huh oh that's cool yeah ,um well you didn't you didn't say anything about my answer is my answer right 
120.4,Chris,,so let me see let me remember what you're saying um i can read it to you yeah sure could you read it to me real quick sure ,i wrote scientist on craters full of water on the moon 
130.1,Chris,,but the question was asking what equipment so that is really good that you realize that that was from the article that did nasa use so do you think you want to like change your answer or maybe add something after what you just said that might make your answer a little bit stronger your answer is a great start okay oh ,will be super microscope and student set the lunar orbiter so i guess i could 
130.1,Chris,,speak ,for water on the moon with a microscope or the lunar orbiter 
420.2,Chris,,yeah you could add those two equipments maybe you could start a new sentence with them just add in that those were two equipments that they used to discover water on the moon ,okay so i'll just add that in and then maybe i'll make another sentence but i think i can just 
420.2,Oliver,,do it once it yeah i agree ,i'm sorry it's time for us to go to lunch 
150.1,Luis,,start simulation okay so great job explaining um that you class think or did not think that water could be valuable on the moon for astronauts but i guess student okay ,i think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good 
230.1,Farrah,,okay well there are a couple of other students that i just want to ask a couple questions and maybe clarify and we can all talk about it too and go over the answers um so student i just was wondering so you said no not for a long time what was your thinking when saying that like did you not find any information from the article that might have helped you well i don't ,know i think i was thinking that because the article says that it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money so that means that you can't use it for a long time 
210.3,Farrah,,that's a good start so um maybe so i do agree with you but maybe we could like talk about that if if we had the resources to make that quicker do you think it would help the astronauts have water on the moon instead of bringing it on their ship or now well i mean if they could do it faster and quicker than ,yeah but the story says that that it it'll take a long time 
230.1,Oliver,,okay what about you def could you like tell me more about what you were thinking about when saying your answer before yeah ,well i said it's not ready yet because the same thing on okay at the end of the story it says scientists need to come up with a plan for tracking so they don't have a plan and that says making less plan will take a lot of time and money no but that sounds like that water it's not ready yet 
130.2,Jazmin,,yeah but do you agree that if it was ready that it would be awesome to have it on the moon or yeah yeah okay great does class else want to add anything maybe student or student ,okay i'm still kind of confused 
130.2,Jazmin,,mm hmm um ,so anyway right what they said no because it's not i didn't even realize and the last paragraph where they talk about how much money and time it'll take i didn't i didn't think about that 
130.2,Jazmin,,so ,maybe mine is not right 
130.2,Jazmin,,so this one's a little tricky i feel so when listening to your answers i thought that honestly like you all of you are right so maybe just for answering that question um can we like think of but then the question is is there any evidence that water can be valuable an answer for that together just one has input good answer do you want to read it to class i'm ago about student can you read yours and then we can maybe like a grief we wanted to add something to it or maybe take something away okay so i ,said yes actually that's can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water 
210.4,Jazmin,,hmm and do you remember if there was anything from the article that i'm told us if the water was used is there anything else that it can be used for ,um i know they said the thing about drinking it because i got that street from this text 
130.2,Jazmin,,drink this water does class else remember from the text what the water can be used for drinking and there was one more thing ,i wrote about curing it but i guess you can't that's not what it's used for 
210.4,Luis,,no it is much better like the water was on the moon because then the ship doesn't have to carry all that water and it will make the ship more heavy yes even ,okay i i did say that it could be split into two parts hydrogen oxygen 
210.4,Luis,,yeah so i remember when i was reading the text that it was talking about how it can be used for fuel to which is very helpful do you class remember reading that part ,i forgot about that part yeah i did read that part 
210.4,Chris,,does class want to like talk about how that could be very useful and valuable maybe yeah yeah i can ,and you know i read that there was there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
210.4,Chris,,know that could help us a lot right ,yeah cuz then the thing about carrying the water wouldn't be an issue okay astronauts could breathe oxygen hydrogen also be used as rocket fuel oh that's what you said 
210.3,Farrah,,yeah so do you class agree that that can be very valuable when you go to space yeah yeah yeah great so student would you want to maybe like how about student and student could you make a sentence or a new answer to the question that we're trying to answer with the information that we just talked about all together ok ,ok 
210.3,Farrah,,i can give you like a minute or two to think about it real quick okay thanks ,okay i think i got one 
210.3,Farrah,,great let's see let's hear it ,water will be valuable for a long time but when it is they can make rocket fuel and they can breathe oxygen 
130.3,Oliver,,do you agree with student do you want to add anything or take anything away from it all and they can drink the water right oh yeah and they can drink the water yeah awesome ,i was pretty good let me see you're sad you're sad the hydrogen oxygen is that rocket fuel you said breathing mm hmm all the last sentence maybe when it's ready mm hmm they could make a gas station out in a solar system 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah that could be really cool imagine if there was a gas station like on the moon ,oh oh okay i just saw the time it's time for us to go to lunch i wanted to say thank you teacher for helping us keep trying to find the evidence and a text to fill out our answers 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah no worries we'll have fun during lunch and go play outside it's great weather ,okay it is by teacher 
210.4,Farrah,,awesome hi class so i was just going over your responses student you say that they need a microscope to look really closely what are they looking closely at ,oh the water 
210.4,Farrah,,ok perfect the water they found in the craters right ,uh i don't know where the water they found on the moon i guess 
210.4,Farrah,,so let's read number one again it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines so based off of that where do we think the water is being found ,in the craters 
110.1,Luis,,in the craters perfect ok and ,excuse me ms kelsey 
110.1,Luis,,yes ,i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,ok that's great that you know a lot about space but this is a specific part of space that we just want to talk about being in this class doesn't mean you don't know about it it just means that i just wanted to hear a little bit more of what you thought ok ,oh ok 
230.1,Luis,,so let's actually go to you now student so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks what other equipment have they used on the moon with the water ,well they have to wear spacesuits and gravity boots so that they can walk i'm not sure what other equipment they need 
210.4,Luis,,ok so let's look at the actual sentences ok so we've already talked about the microscope but if you look at number two it says nasa sent a small machine can you read that sentence and tell me what the machine is and what it does ,uh huh ok nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater ok so it's a lunar orbiter and it investigates 
210.4,Luis,,great job what does it investigate ,ice deposits 
230.1,Jazmin,,perfect great student i see that you were talking about a small machine is that the machine you were talking about ,yeah so i don't understand why my answer's wrong 
230.1,Jazmin,,it's not wrong at all i would just like to hear a little bit more detail i want to know a lot more of what you know about it so tell me about the machine ,ok ok i don't remember nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ok so it's a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter and it investigates 
210.4,Jazmin,,what does it investigate ,whispering the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits ice deposits 
210.4,Jazmin,,awesome and why do you think it looks for ice deposits what would the ice deposits tell us ,if it's cold there 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah but what would it tell us that involves water ,if the water's frozen 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah so can we have ice without water ,no because it's just frozen water 
210.4,Jazmin,,right so that proves that there was water on the moon because there's little bits of ice everywhere right ,uh huh yeah 
230.2,Chris,,good ok and let's go to student student you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon i like that that is very true can you just tell me a little bit more about that and where in the text it said that ,yeah i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits but the crater part was in the beginning of the story whispering no atmosphere oh here it is ok scientists found evidence that water could be found deep within the moon's polar craters 
110.3,Chris,,well i love you bringing in your background knowledge saying that you've been to nasa before that's really cool ,yeah me and my dad went 
230.1,Chris,,that's really cool i love that did you learn about the lunar orbiter at all when you were at nasa ,no no we saw the mars rover but i don't remember seeing anything about a lunar orbiter 
210.4,Chris,,ok ok that's really interesting so why don't you tell me a little bit more about what they did with the water that they found on mars the moon not mars ,what did they do with the water that they found on the moon i don't know maybe they drank it 
210.4,Chris,,well let's look at this sentence right here it says that the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so what would they have to do with the water to know that it was there if it was too small to see ,well this says that you need a microscope to look at it 
210.3,Chris,,right so let's go back to your response real fast you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon so if there's just a little teeny tiny bit of water that you have to look through a microscope to see are the craters really full of water ,no i guess not but the story did say that it was like deep in the craters 
130.2,Oliver,,yeah student can you help us out a little bit i see you raising your hand ,well i'm sorry to interrupt i was just saying that it's actually time for us to go to lunch i know it was a really short time but i do appreciate how you helped us really look for the evidence in the story to put in our answer 
130.2,Farrah,,perfect ok well have a good time at lunch class ,all right 
130.2,Luis,,so student yes student ,um so yeah i was just gonna say like i shouldn't be in this class because i already corrected my answer so i think i'm right i think i should go go out 
120.4,Luis,,so i agree that you did it correct your answer and i think we're really on the right track but what i want to talk about right now is a kind of the process of what you did to correct your answer okay so why don't we start with student student so can you tell me the difference between your original answer and your second answer ,um yeah ok so my initial answer i was saying that scientists like use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that which i knew because i already knew that and then um well basically then i did the reading and looked at the reading and once i did the reading i saw that the that the scientists actually well the real answer is that scientists found ice using a small machine 
230.1,Luis,,so what i'm hearing from you is you're saying that you used your background knowledge to answer it first right and i love that i love i like that you used your background knowledge because that tells me that you're really thinking about what you already know went back and looked in the readings to find a more specific answer i think that's great do you see the difference between the two answers and what looking back at looking back at the reading told you can you tell me the how this your second answer might be a little bit more detail ,um well i guess cuz it has to do with the reading because the first time i didn't read it i just knew the answer but i guess that wasn't the right answer so i decided to actually read it and then when i read it i got the right answer 
520.1,Luis,,right so next time you get a question on a text are you going to use your background knowledge and not read the text at all or are you going to read the text and then use your background knowledge ,i know a lot about space so i might still use the background knowledge but i mean i should probably read it because maybe i don't know everything 
520.1,Farrah,,Let me turn to Farrah. ,i change my answer to 
120.4,Farrah,,great so why don't you tell me a little bit about your answers ,okay so basically i said that initially you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely and then i said after like we were in class and discussing it and i thought about it i said scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water craters on the moon so i found the right answer 
230.1,Farrah,,right so why do you think that your second answer was the right answer ,because in the first instance i only said that well i said the microscope but that's not the piece of it that actually found the ice the water like you like you could study the ice in a microscope when it was the lunar orbiter that actually found the water 
230.3,Farrah,,place i really like that and i agree so what i'm hearing is that you look back at the question and kind of reread it and saw your mistakes um or what you could improv a little bit right ,yeah and it was what people were saying to cuz i was listening in class for saying like student was saying it was a small machine and you know stuff like that so um you know other people had ideas too so i was kind of listening to that and then i was when i understood like what the question meant then i could understand better 
520.1,Farrah,,right so what are a few things we can do next time when you're not quite sure if your answers are all the way there yet ,right ask the teacher 
130.2,Chris,,you can definitely ask the teacher what do you have any other suggestions or student do you have any suggestions ,on not not about this no i was gonna say that i was gonna say i asked my new answer is ok 
120.4,Chris,,yeah so why don't you tell me a little bit about your two answers ,okay so what i said was initially that scientists found craters full of water on the moon and then i realized that that it wasn't full of water when i read it more closely i said instead that the the water that scientists found on the moon was microscopic there was only a little bit like i said initially there was like lots of it but actually there's just a little bit of water 
230.1,Chris,,good and how did you come to that conclusion ,um well i was because i'm the well because the teacher asked about it and what i was like asking if it was a lot of water or a little water and i was saying well actually it was when i had to go back you i saw that it was just a little bit of water 
520.1,Chris,,right so you went back and read so what do you want to do next time a teacher asks you for a little bit more information ,i guess i just won't go back yet 
520.1,Oliver,,good yes how may i help you ,um unfortunately we have to go to our next class but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun bye 
120.4,Luis,,bye class hi class hi so student can you tell me a little bit about your answer ,oh yeah okay so i can i can tell you that basically i was saying that yeah that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
110.1,Luis,,right why don't we look back at the question is just read it one more time can you read it out loud for me that's really good information ,yeah okay it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable 
410.1,Luis,,right so you told me that we can split up water into hydrogen and oxygen right What. ,"Well, I guess it's answering the question because well it is valuable right like it's really valuable that um that they have like. you know that you can split it into hydrogen and oxygen like that's why i mentioned it because those are really valuable things in space because you can do all kinds of stuff with them "
420.2,Luis,,"whoever's reading your answer isn't going to be able to make the connection, you know, so if you could. a way that i could see you making a response even better is kind of adding the question into the response so you could say one way that the water is valuable is you can split it into hydrogen and oxygen ",yeah that makes that makes sense yeah 
120.4,Farrah,,good i'm glad okay i'm student why don't you tell me a little bit about your answer now ,okay so i said that no i'm like it like would not be valuable not like for a long time 
230.1,Farrah,,right um can you tell me a little bit why you think that ,yeah cuz well basically like um well first off like they only have a little bit of it and it spread over like all sorts of places like it sort of in craters but it's also kind of all over and we don't really have the technology to like go and like kind of find everything and like dig it out like it would take so much energy to do it that it doesn't seem like it would be very possible like it seems like we need to invent new technology to really be able to use the water on the moon 
420.2,Farrah,,"My only concern is when you are answering a question like that you're you're trying to convince your reader of something right, so we always need to give that reason as to why right so that's where the evidence in our text really comes in, so I would go back and. keep the first part of your answer and then go back and try and find a little bit of evidence in the text as to why you think the answer is correct go back and try and find a little bit of evidence in the text as to why you think the answer is correct okay ",gotcha 
120.4,Oliver,,okay and student can we talk about your answer a little bit tell me what you answered ,yeah so i said i'm like student i said no because it's not ready yet 
230.1,Oliver,,right um so kind of wha t kind of the same thing i was sent to student can you tell me why it's not ready ,"yeah cuz well we know that the water is super small it's microscopic and it's really like all mixed in with dirt and everything so like i'm thinking that like you can't really use it you'd have to do something to it but like you it's not like just sitting there ready to be used on like hooked up to a gas tank or something so you'd have to get it ready but it seems like it would be really hard to get it ready um well I guess Okay, so I could try. with evidence so i think that i would just say like no it's not ready yet and it would be hard to make it ready because it's microscopic right because that's evidence from the reading "
120.4,Jazmin,,so i would look back to your answer and add some more evidence from the reading good job um student let's talk about your answer a little bit ,and see what i said was asking i say yes that is valuable because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated and you can't survive without water 
420.2,Farrah,,"yeah I think that's a really good answer, I think you could go a little bit further by just maybe quoting the text, just so that you really getting your information from the text Okay, yes Farrah. ",so unfortunately we have to go to lunch we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for for working with us and like in particular i just really wanted to thank you for 
150.1,,,hi class so i know that we just read the article water on the moon and you class were supposed to answer a question right ,yeah we we all answered it and um we told you our answers and then um you said you'd give us some feedback on our answers 
120.4,Luis,,oh perfect okay so student can you remind me of your answer ,sorry to interrupt i'm sorry but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
220.1,Luis,,well it's really good to have background knowledge on space student but i want to talk about how we answered the questions not so much the facts about the moon does that make sense ,um how we answer the questions okay okay yeah yeah okay 
120.4,Farrah,,okay so we're going to work on that but it's really great that you know a lot about space that's going to be really helpful with how you answer the questions alright so student can you remind me of your answer ,yeah i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
420.2,Farrah,,that is a really good answer so remember our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and so you said you need a microscope to look really closely but one thing that your answer is missing is kind of a connection to that question is there a way that you can add some words to that that would strengthen your response and make it connect to the question a little more ,um well i picked an equipment and it's about water and i got it straight from the text so i know i did all the right things that in the question i'm in and so um and that's what it says in the story 
420.2,Jazmin,,you're right exactly so you had all of the right information it's the one thing like if i were to answer your question i'd use your exact words and say something like to discover water on the moon you need a specific scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely right so if you just add that little sentence that helps give your answer some context so if i look at it without the question i still know what you're talking about you need a specific scientific tool called microsoft to look really closely right so if you just add that little sentence that helps give your answer some context so if i look at it without the question i still know what you're talking about right yes yes ,i don't understand why my answer is wrong because i when i read it it said to discover water on the moon and i know that the small machine nasa sent was looking for the water so that seems like that's the right answer 
420.2,Jazmin,,"Right, so NASA did send a small machine, but can you add some details like what was that machine called. Do you remember So if we add good ",yes i sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is that that that would be 
150.1,Jazmin,,that is a way better answer do you see why it's a better answer ,i'm good because i added more words 
150.1,Jazmin,,Right. ,yeah yeah 
120.4,Chris,,so when we're gonna fix some of our answers we want to add some specific details from the text and we will so that we can show that we have a really deep understanding of the text so student can you tell me what your response was ,yeah i bet the creators but but but something about the creators obey the partner from the printers food yeah 
430.1,Chris,,you're right that is a really good answer so the as that the question asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon right and you've told me where on the moon the water was discovered use more evidence from the text about the equipment to make your response stronger ,where the equipment the equipment well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks on masks and shoots 
420.2,Chris,,exactly but can we try to think back to that text we read in the equipment that excited i can read you the sentence if you'd like it's an nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate this this lunar orbiter looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater the ice deposits are very small so is there information from that sentence that you can add to your response to just make it a little stronger ,nasa sent a small machine ice deposits and polar craters price oh okay they found craters for water when nasa sent a small machine 
120.4,Oliver,,that was a perfect response yes that was a perfect response you used direct language from the text used specific vocab and you provided reasoning it was very specific that was a perfect response good job okay student can you tell me ,same thing 
110.1,Oliver,,oh okay so you said that they needed a specific tool called the microscope ,yeah to look really closely 
230.3,Oliver,,to look really closely good so is there remember how we talked to student earlier and gave her some suggestions ,on you saturate have to add more details to her thing so i'm all i'm more details i guess that's on your name assigned to a pool of water we should add the water you need to look really closely at the water 
110.1,Oliver,,yeah exactly ,okay okay i'm 
110.1,Oliver,,good ,i'm sorry i didn't mean to interrupt you but i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to watch 
110.1,All,,talking ,yeah yeah you i i really appreciate how you helped us all use evidence from the text to add more details to our our answers thanks so much i'm teacher thank you 
120.4,Luis,,okay class so now we're going to work on question number two is there convincing convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable so student can you remind me of your answer yes student ,i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
120.4,Farrah,,well i want us to work on how we answer the questions not necessarily the information we already know about the water on the moon um but just how we answer the question okay student let's start with you ,okay yeah so i said no not for a long time 
230.1,Farrah,,so what makes you think there's no water on the moon won't be valuable for a long time ,because at the end of the story it talks about how it's gonna be really expensive and take a lot of time and a lot of money and they probably won't be able to do it 
210.4,Farrah,,okay and the end of the article says that ,uh huh 
120.4,Jazmin,,"okay that's that's a good point yes and last paragraph i see i see um so but you didn't necessarily write in your answer for me or any of your classmates to see. But you just one concern that I have is that if I was just reading your response and I had no other context, I would say, well, what can't we do for a long time?. right so one suggestion that i have for you is maybe being a little bit more specific with your words and even including the evidence that you had ready to tell me in your response so that right right away i know exactly what you're talking about right yeah okay thank you student why don't we look at your response ",excuse me teacher i'm still confused okay so student needed like more information in hers but i put a lot of information in my answer and it's still needs work 
120.4,Luis,,okay so let's look at your answers student so you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water right and that is that is a very true point um and i think this answer was a really good answer i just know so one concern i have about your response is that i was just reading your response and i wouldn't necessarily know what the question was asking from your answer am are you defending that there should be water on the spaceships or are you defending why we should extract the water on the moon do you see how there could be some confusion there so i think yeah yeah so i think one suggestion i have for you like the suggestion i had for student would just to be to add a few more specific details so that i and your peers can fully know you're talking about when we read your responses right because you won't always be there to explain it right all right student would you like your turn now ,yes i like my turn thank you 
110.1,Luis,,okay so you said water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and what i like about ,i was gonna say i took it from the text 
210.3,Luis,,that is what i like about your responses you took that specifically from the text and that was my favorite part about your response but one thing i was thinking is that how is that valuable so we can do that right we can split water water molecules into two parts hydrogen and oxygen but what does that do for us how is that valuable to the astronauts that are on the moon ,oh well you can drink well um we need oxygen to breathe so that's important 
210.4,Luis,,so let's go back into the text and try to find that specific line that you were referring to ,okay important resource 
210.4,Luis,,oh i think it's in paragraph number five ,oh yeah that's where i found it okay okay astronauts could breathe oxygen okay see i said that and oxygen hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel rocket fuel help spacecrafts to move just like gas helps cards to okay i could say all of that stuff i'd have to write all that down 
420.2,Chris,,you don't so you don't have to take the exact words from the text in your answer but i'm one of the suggestions i haven't even if you just pick one of those things so um if you you could pick just that oxygen oxygen is needed for astronauts to breathe and so if you added that to your response it would help me and any of your friends reading the response understand why the water on the moon is valuable to us ,okay there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
420.2,Oliver,,that would be really cool and maybe we would see some of the stuff that we're reading about actually taking place and we have all this knowledge about it now because we read about it would you yeah yeah exactly right all right let's look at your response now student so you said water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore so like student i really liked this answer because this is right from the text you took this information right from the text and that is a really important part of answering text specific questions and similar to the feedback i was just giving student i just don't get how your answer realtes to the question right like how does your answer show why it's valuable to get water from the moon why it's better to not have it on the ships yes please restate the question in your response one piece of convincing evidence that water could be on i'm extracted from the moon is that it's too heavy to be on the ships yes ,i'm sorry teacher i was looking at five o'clock and i can see that it's time for us to go to lunch i want to say thank you for how you like made class feel valued and you kind of explained when you explain what they needed to work on it give me ideas on how i can improve my answer 
420.2,Oliver,,i'm happy to hear that ,okay bye 
420.2,Luis,,all right class so now that we have all made our our responses for the text of the water on the moon i'm going to go around and yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,yes i see that you know a lot about space but we're also going to further what we're going to know about space and use our knowledge about space to figure out more on the water on the moon ,okay 
210.4,Luis,,okay so let's start with you student so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks on the moon so i in the article i don't recall them saying that they use oxygen tanks however i know that astronauts do use oxygen tanks take a look at the second paragraph of the article what machine did nasa said that they use to discover the water ,nasa sent a small machine called lunar orbiter to investigate this machine it's a lunar orbiter 
210.4,Luis,,yes perfect so then after they use the lunar orbiter what did they use to look at the water look at the third paragraph ,that means that the moon is drier than the driest desert on the earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you can't see it if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look real close the microscope i think maybe 
210.4,Jazmin,,yes perfect good job student student you said that they use a small machine so great job recalling that they sent the small machine to discover the water on the moon do you remember what the name of the machine was called ,i don't remember 
210.4,Jazmin,,you don't remember okay that's totally fine let's look at the passage and see just like with student let's look at the second paragraph ,nasa sent a small machine called lunar orbiter to investigate oh the name of it is the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Jazmin,,perfect great job and then do you remember what the other the other thing they use the other equipment that they used to see the water alright let's look at the third paragraph so they had to look very closely at at it because it was so tiny right ,i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
150.1,Jazmin,,your answer is not wrong so this is a two part question there's two different equipment that they use to see the water on the moon so first they found it with a lunar orbiter right now they're now after they found it what are they going to use to see the water on the moon look at the third paragraph class takes their own pace ,i just read it student if you are listening you need a oh the miscroscope yeah the microscope 
110.1,Chris,,the microscope great job student student let's start with you so you said scientists found craters are full of water on the moon right ,uh huh 
110.2,Chris,,do you remember what equipment do you use to find it great job remembering that they found the water on the moon ,um well student just said the lunar orbiter and the microscope and you told her that was right so i'm figuring that's the right answer 
230.2,Chris,,yes so can you show me where in the text she found those answers ,i feel like you said section two and section three 
230.2,Chris,,can you read me the sentence of one of them ,okay yeah it's the first sentence in section two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
110.1,Oliver,,perfect great job student now student you said that you circled the same thing as student right ,uh huh 
110.1,Oliver,,so student said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely right ,yeah i circled that same thing 
230.1,Oliver,,you wrote the same thing what did you why did you circle those things ,because well um i was looking for where it said water and that was paragraph three was talking about looking at the water and then i was looking for equipment and i saw it said microscope and microscope is equipment 
210.4,Oliver,,that's a great job using the context of the text to find your answer so can you before they found the water what did they use to find it so they found the water and used the microscope to use to see the water because it was so tiny but what did they do to find it do you remember ,well it's the same thing that student said right the lunar orbiter 
230.2,Chris,,the lunar orbiter great can you read me that sentence where you can find that ,um yeah let me see you know ms teacher i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too lots of equipment 
110.1,Oliver,,you're right they do use a lot of different equipment let's have student the chance to answer his question okay ,yeah it's it's in the first sentence where it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Farrah,,perfect great job student and student so you said the scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely do you remember the second machine ,yeah because class said it 
230.2,Farrah,,yes can you read a lunar orbiter great perfect and do you remember where we found that ,yeah um cuz uh student and student read it too it was the first sentence of the second paragraph i was listening 
110.1,Oliver,,great i'm glad you were listening student you did a great job ,ms teacher i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch you know this was really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you helped us look for the evidence in the text to add to our answers 
110.1,Oliver,,you're welcome student ,okay bye 
110.1,Luis,,hi class yes student ,yes so i have like already know like all about space so i don't really think i even need to be in this class 
120.4,Luis,,well why don't we take a look at your answers really quick and see what we see what you wrote alright sounds like a plan ,yeah i can do that 
410.3,Luis,,okay so student you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks i think that that was a really great answer in response to the reading and the question but and i really enjoyed like how you use your background knowledge to help you support this because like you said you know a lot about space this phrase in general what you wrote was not used they didn't talk about that in the in the passage So did you have questions about the passage? ,"yeah i was just more thinking like these are things that i know because i really love space and my dad is an astronaut and so i was thinking like even like if it's not in the reading then i think the readings leaving it out you know So I should make sure that I'm like I'm using something from from the reading, rather than- "
410.3,Luis,,next time ,okay 
150.1,Farrah,,awesome does class else have any questions about their responses yeah student why don't you go ,um so for me basically um i guess my question was i don't really understand like right now why my answer is 
150.1,Farrah,,why your answer is wrong i'm sorry i didn't hear the last part of that ,yeah sorry i guess i just don't understand right now like why my answer is wrong 
110.3,Farrah,,so i think your answers none of your answers are wrong i think sometimes they can use improvement but student i do want to point out that your response so you said that you need a scientific tool called the microscope to look really closely i think it was a really great response and you had you used your academic vocabulary and you used something that was stated directly from the text i don't necessarily you're not all necessarily here because your answers were wrong or bad but i think student by you being here you can use your friends and your classmates can use you as a resource if they have questions in the future about the readings or assignments that we're doing because it seems like you really understand understand this assignment ,that's great thank you 
110.3,Jazmin,,student did you have a question ,well i was just going to kind of say the same thing because like what what i said was nasa sent a small machine and i was just wondering like why my answer was wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,and student that answer was really great you did use an idea that was stated directly from the text so like i said earlier none of your answers are wrong we could develop that a little bit more you can say you know what kind of small machine did they use or different things like that just develop your thought process a little bit more than you already have or different things like that just oliverelop your thought process a little bit more than you already then you already have but there's nothing wrong with your answer ,"i can't tell what would a better answer sound like Ohhh, okay. That makes sense. "
150.1,Chris,,yeah student or student do you have questions ,well i guess the thing that i was thinking was kind of what student was saying before i still have a question about it because i went to nasa with my dad and i know that scientists like lots of equipment like you know like oxygen tanks masks and stuff like that and like it just like you know what i mean like that seems really important 
420.2,Chris,,yeah it's really it is really important and but just because they didn't talk about it in the reading doesn't mean it's not important but i want us but the goal and the question from the assignment was what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon and we want to make sure we're going to we want to make sure that we're using the text to support our answers ,Oh 
410.1,Chris,,because we were asking about equipment not what they found ,okay that that actually makes that makes a lot of sense thank you 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah of course and student do you have a question ,well basically i wrote the same thing as student so i guess i was wondering like so is the answer to the question that like that both the lunar orbiter and the microscope are used or is it like one of that is the right answer 
110.2,Luis,,there's so as long as you're using evidence to support your answer there is really there isn't technically a wrong answer but the lunar orbiter one second student the lunar orbiter and the microscope are both pieces of equipment that are used so that the both of those answers would be correct it's not one is right and one is wrong student ,um yeah so i'm so sorry to interrupt but unfortunately we have to go to lunch 
110.2,Luis,,that's okay ,i just wanted to tell you that i really enjoyed working with you and like in particular there were like some things in the class that were so cool like you really helped us to make sure that we were drawing like from the reading when we were answering questions and like also like it was really important like when you were asking like you know when you are helping student like understand like how to approach the question like that was really clear and it was really easy for us to understand what you are asking but thank you so much 
110.2,Luis,,well thank you for working with me today hi class how are you doing today ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Farrah,,so student i'm really glad you bring up a good point so the point of this class i just wanted i want you class to know is that you class made some really great points some of the points that you well made all together or your in your work separately um some of them could use a little bit of improvement here and there the questions were asking for some direct information from the reading and different things like that and i think some of you might have missed some of it because you're in this class doesn't mean that you did something wrong or that you did something bad we're just here to improve the work that you've already done all right does class excuse me does class else have any other questions alright so um student do you want to share the answer that you got for the first question yeah sure okay ,i said um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
150.1,Farrah,,I will say the there one part of improvement or one area of improvement that I think that you could work on would be looking at all of the tools that they referenced because so i just want to make sure you that you're going back and referencing the reading that we have in the assignment to make sure that you're getting all of the points possible does that makes sense ,oh yeah i guess you're saying that i was wrong 
110.2,Farrah,,so you weren't wrong i just think that you could build upon your answer to add more to it to make it even stronger no you weren't wrong i just think you were not wrong you did make a very clear point and the you stated that the scientists they use microscopes to look closely ,okay 
120.4,Oliver,,okay um how about student what did what was your answer ,i have that same answer us student i still don't understand why my answers wrong 
410.3,Oliver,,"so i don't think that your answer so like i was saying that your answers are necessarily wrong if you're sitting in this class i think your answers in the work that you did could use some improvement so student so what i noticed by saying you know by you saying that i circled the same thing as student Did you maybe not understand certain parts of the reading? and so being able to write your own answer is beneficial as well, instead of the same as Farrah in this case. ",i mean i understood it was just that student went first so she said her answer and mine was the same i found the same answer in the story yeah i understood it 
130.1,Oliver,,oh okay well if that's the case and that's perfect and like i so i would have the same note for student as well and give you the same note that i gave student although the answer is correct i think that you could build a deeper meaning and build build upon your answer to oliverelop it even more and make it even stronger than it already is ,oh ok ok i guess i mean what i like i read the whole thing and i looked for all the keywords and i found i found that sentence with the keywords in it 
130.1,Chris,,mm hmm no you're not student you're not i want i want you to understand that you're not wrong your answer is correct i just when i'm looking at the answers i know that there are more parts that you can add to the answer and to make it a stronger answer doesn't it doesn't mean that it's right or wrong it just can be stronger okay yeah student ,um i was looking at the question again and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.2,Chris,,yeah so i think you're right like because you went to nasa you're able to use your background knowledge and you're able to build off of what you already know and they do mention in the reading and then the story about the different thing that they that they need so they need they have the oxygen tanks because they need to be able to breathe and different things like that i'm lost in my reading i'm so sorry class i'm ,i mean some of it came from a story and some of it came from when me and my dad were looking at you know the pictures and the stuff that the astronauts used when they used to go on their space missions so yeah 
150.1,Chris,,"I think some of it, too, so when we are looking at the reading and we are doing the assignment, we want to make sure that when we're working we're we're referencing the information that's in front of us and that's in the reading. Absolutely, I think it's the perfect time to bring up bubble my dad my went to NASA We saw this that and the next thing right. Does that make sense to you. ",yeah yeah it did okay i bought my answer i did all pull some information from the text 
120.4,Oliver,,yeah you yep do you want to share with you wrote ,i'm sorry teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's time for the next class so we'll have to see you later 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay okay no worries thanks for working with me class ,okay bye 
120.4,Luis,,hi class i think we're just so we're just going to pick up right where we left off last time we met so student why don't you go ahead and share the answer that you had oh hold on one second student student what's up ,okay no i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay well why don't you stick around for a few more minutes just we can hear because i want to talk about your answer after jazmin's done alright sound like a good plan oh okay thank you alright student why don't you go ahead and read your answer ,okay so i said nasa send a small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,so i so one note that i thought of when i read your answer that like i want i want to reinforce and i want you to know that your answer is correct you're you're you're not sitting at the table because your answer is wrong none of you are In the reading it did state clearly what kind of tool um or excuse me what the name of the small machine is Do you remember the name of the small machine. ,remember the name of it no 
130.3,Jazmin,,that's okay so in the reading it referenced i'm the small machine it's called a moon lunar orbiter to investigate ,yeah okay i see that right there it's right in the same sentence 
150.1,Jazmin,,"so we just want to make sure that when we are answering our questions that we're being as clear as possible you know we can be concise and still state the machine that they sent up to the moon was the lunar orbiter Does that make sense, do you have any questions. ",still kind of confused 
230.1,Jazmin,,what do you know so why don't you what are you confused about why don't you share so we can try to figure it out and work through it ,okay so when you said i have to just save the name of the machine so that part i understood but then you were saying that i should add add more to my sentence so that has more power 
150.1,Jazmin,,yeah so what i so what i meant by that basically is just you want to make sure that you're stating the information that's written in the text nasa sent a small machine next time you can write nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to the moon instead okay does that make more sense ,i have to write more words 
120.4,Luis,,it's not always about having more words you just want to make sure that you're using the text and you're able to reference the text in your reading awesome um student what about you do you want to share your answer ,yeah okay so i said i'm scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
420.2,Chris,,"so i think that you so i want to do want to point out That scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks it's a clear point. While they're up there, so I think in the future when you're doing your assignment and when you're reading or in your reading and you're filling up the questions and answering. your answers aren't necessarily wrong, but I feel as though that when we go back and that when we do the assignment again you'll have you will know, know for next time that you can sit there, and you can add more. ",I read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024. 
110.3,Farrah,,student that's a really really cool that's really interesting i wonder if it will happen maybe it won't ,yeah okay i only do what you were saying about jazmin's answer because she didn't say the name of the machine but i wrote a complete sentence and i pulled mine from the text 
150.1,Farrah,,yeah and you you're correct student you did do that um i part of what i think with your answer is that although you stated they used a microscope i think what the question was asking was for you to talk about what kind of tools help them discover more water on earth excuse me not on earth on the moon they use a microscope but what but what really helped them discover like what was the tool that really helped them find the water okay does that make sense ,yeah yeah yeah that does make sense okay 
150.1,Chris,,does class else have any other questions ,okay this one isn't a question but now i'm just all thinking about my answer cuz mine came from the story too is it the same as savannas 
230.3,Oliver,,so student your answer although it did come straight from the article and the reading that we had your answer wasn't necessarily answering what the question was asking so with your answer it's as if you just needed to continue writing a little bit more you kind of phrase it as like your sentence starter but didn't add more to it was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon so you have written that scientists found craters full of water on the moon yeah. ,yeah it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for explaining what each of us needed to work on because it gave me some ideas i think on how to improve my answer to 
230.3,Jazmin,,that's awesome i'm so glad i was able to help you class today ,thanks bye 
150.1,Luis,,hello class so we just finished reading our texts water on the moon oh yeah student do you have a question ,um it's more of a comment i have already kind of know all there is to know about space i don't know like i think i really have to be in this class 
110.3,Luis,,well i'm glad you know a lot about space already because we know background knowledge is very important so maybe there's a few things that you could share with us that you know that may be myself or the other students might not know and you could help us to understand better ,yeah 
210.4,Farrah,,alright so student you mentioned in the text that scientists use a tool called a microscope so if scientists are using a tool called a microscope what does that tell us about this stuff on the moon that they're looking at ,it tells us that it tells us that it's really small like whatever it is because it says it's microscopic 
210.4,Farrah,,exactly and so we know the word microscopic means what ,really small 
130.2,Oliver,,really smaller exactly did class else think that while they're reading or see that in the text student ,yeah i am i thought that i thought the same thing i student so i i was thinking the same thing that that the microscope was the tool because you had to use it to see the the water 
210.4,Luis,,student have you used a microscope before yeah so the small water what else do you think scientists use microscopes to look at it doesn't have to be on the moon you can think about things maybe you've used a microscope ,oh yeah no i totally we've done that before and science like we've looked at like the plant like cells and stuff like that so yeah i've seen lots of stuff with microscopes 
210.4,Chris,,exactly because plant cells are also really small like the water on the moon that student mentioned student do you have a question or comment ,up i was just i was gonna say i used microscopes like you know what i mean like i used to science and up my mom is doctor and she like she uses microscopes at work 
210.4,Farrah,,wow that's a great connection student because we are talking about scientists but there's also many other occupations and jobs that people do were like doctors who use microscopes student ,it's because we weren't going to work with you because our answers weren't right like i was wondering like why my answer was wrong 
230.2,Farrah,,yeah so you mentioned that the scientists looked use your tool called microscopes i was wondering if you could use some text evidence that proves to where you saw that in the text is there a quote that you remember ,totally there's a paragraph that's what i was saying the water is microscopic he wouldn't be able to see it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close to you have to like they couldn't find it unless you saw it right or did they find it another way 
230.2,Jazmin,,"yeah exactly so they had to use the microscope to find it and i'm glad that you went back into the text because we know for our answers we want to focus on using evidence so to find evidence we need to use those quotes from the text and i like that student quoted and she said paragraph three so we could all look at our texts and find where she was reading So, Jazmin. Do you have text evidence from your response. You said NASA send a small machine. Do you read about that. ",in the in the second paragraph it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
210.4,Chris,,nice yeah and then after that it also talks about small ice deposits which then yes student ,i guess i was just thinking i've been to nasa with my dad and we looked around and i noticed that scientists use oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that so i was wondering like where does that fit in 
110.2,Chris,,yeah great i'm glad you brought that up your background knowledge so the question we're answering is what equipment do scientists use to discover water on the moon so you can think of a way that they use oxygen tanks to find water they might need oxygen tanks to be on the moon ,yeah well they had to like you had to use the suits to get off the spaceship and go walk around and look for water 
110.2,Chris,,exactly exactly student ,and unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just really wanted to work with us today and like a particular i wanted to thank you for reminding us to use evidence from there because you don't always remember that and you really helped us tremendously and also like it was really cool like seeing student was an upcoming show because you were like asking him for his background knowledge and also like he was able to talk about like stuff which i think is really like i think that really works for him yeah today was fun 
110.2,Jazmin,,i'm glad you had fun thank you ,thank you so much 
110.2,Luis,,right yes student ,um yeah so i just was gonna say like i already know like all kinds of stuff about space and like basically i like i don't really think i even need to be in this class like i don't need any help 
150.1,Luis,,well there's always more that you can learn and if you feel that you are an expert on the topic you can always share with your classmates so they know more or just as much as you do does that make sense student ,okay i can do that yeah 
230.2,Farrah,,alright so i was hearing some really great discussions on being said and i just want to focus on your responses individually so student you said that you'd need a scientific tool called the microscope and you also said that you circle the same thing now where in the text can you point that out just so that everyone's on the same page ,okay so let's basically i think let's see so you to paragraph three and we were saying okay the water they found is microscopic we wouldn't be able to see he were looking straight at it you need a microscope to look really close so like i guess that's that seems like really important to me you know like that that you can't i think you can't find the water unless you can see it well i'm not sure why my answer is wrong 
110.2,Farrah,,i just wanted to see where you found it i wanted to have like specific textual evidence in your answer i know you found it in the text but i wanted you to point it out in your answer so the rest of the class knows where to look no your answer isn't wrong ,okay 
110.2,Farrah,,there was nothing wrong with your answer i like there i like both of your answers i just wanted class to be on the same page ,sounds good 
410.2,Chris,,and then student your response says that they found craters full of water but you didn't really answer the question of what equipment they use to find the craters ,oh like oh i see so okay that's actually that's really helpful so like i didn't say like what equipment i just was talking about craters so i'm not sure what i mean here's the thing when i know that because my dad took me to nasa but there's like you know what i mean like i saw that scientists use oxygen tanks and masks and spacesuits kind of like what we're saying and so i guess i'm wondering like that's not in the reading 
230.1,Chris,,well there is always textual evidence but it's good to bring back our knowledge as well that could help you bring the text to life so you and student kind of have similar responses so can you elaborate more on like background knowledge that you have also oxygen tanks and spacesuits things like that ,like you have to use equipment if you're going into space and i guess i guess the yeah yeah i mean i know a lot about like use like rocket fuel and you have use stuff like that you know what i mean 
210.4,Chris,,you have to actually get to the moon before you actually discover the water on the moon ,yeah yeah exactly 
210.4,Jazmin,,"okay great response student Can you be a little more specific. What, what was the machine called, what they do. oh yeah the machine is called the machine is lunar orbiter and what did the machine do what is used for ",you mean the lunar orbiter it's how they discovered the water 
110.1,Farrah,,you happen to know what the lunar orbiter is i feel like you have a little bit of surface up yes student ,um so unfortunately we have to go to lunch like i wanted to make sure to thank you and in particular i wanted to thank you for helping us to try to clarify answers and you know asking us to make sure to use the text when we were responding to your questions to that we had added to thank you so much for working with us was really fun thank you bye bye 
230.2,Luis,,class so after reading all your answers it seems that there's a little bit of confusion you all feel very strongly towards the question of whether they would be or there wouldn't be and it seems that there is a divide between the yes and the no so i'd like to focus first on those that said that they do that there is sufficient evidence so that would be student student student now what part of the text makes you think that the water would be a valuable resource yes okay ,yeah actually i think i got this all figured out i'm all good 
230.1,Luis,,you do what makes you think you got all figured out ,okay because you know i mean i already know that they found water on the moon i already know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff so i'm good 
230.1,Luis,,so is this from prior knowledge that you like read or seen the show or is it that you you like you have a really good understanding of the text ,well i mean i i read a lot of stuff about space and i watch nova on pbs so yeah like i have a lot of prior knowledge about this already 
230.1,Luis,,okay oh that's very good that you have all this like information in your head so i feel like well i don't know about the rest of the class but maybe you would have a better and a better answer to go so but based on the text what makes you believe that water could be a valuable resource you said that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen what made you say that ,okay okay that part i did see somewhere in this store in paragraph five it's like the second sentence can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
120.2,Jazmin,,that's great i really like that you could find that specifically in the text that tells me that you were reading very carefully So. i just wanted to clarify what the question was so it says that is there convincing evidence that water in the on the moon could be valuable now your answer yes student ,i'm still confused 
230.1,Jazmin,,what are you confused about ,well because what student got his answer in the text is different from where i got my answer in the text 
150.1,Luis,,really so i'm trying to clarify luis's answer but i will move right on to you after okay okay so student your answer didn't really say whether or not you agreed that there is enough evidence you just stated evidence does that make sense ,oh yeah yeah yeah okay yeah 
150.1,Luis,,okay now does my suggestion makes sense would that have helped you give a different answer ,i gotta say if if i think it's a valuable or not i think 
410.2,Luis,,Because your answer could have gone either way. you could have said no because hydrogen and oxygen split into water splits into this and it wouldn't be a good resource or yes because it does split this and that and if you do read on it's leaning more towards the positive so i assumed that you were agreeing but i don't want to have to assume ,okay i guess i'm not sure if i agree or not okay 
120.1,Chris,,okay how about you read the text and then i'll come back to you later to see if your answer has changed ,okay okay well i was just reading i read that there could be a piece by by 2024 
110.1,Chris,,by 2024 wow that is very interesting we never had a base on the moon ever ,yeah that could be pretty cool 
230.2,Jazmin,,so you and student both had very good answers i like how you both Chris just one thing. just like student he didn't really state if it would be a good thing so i had to assume that the answer was a positive that you did agree okay okay and student you were saying that you found your evidence somewhere else in the text where did you find your evidence ,okay well i mean it's not like exactly somewhere else in the text i guess it's still from that same paragraph now let me try to remember where i found it oh no yeah it was okay it was it was in the one above that because i i pulled it from paragraph four where it says tfor example future astronauts could drink this water so i guess i don't know if student was right or if i was right as we get to different as we got it to different parts of the text 
150.1,Jazmin,,well i like that you stated your agreement or disagreement in this case you did agree and then you did say why it would be a valuable resource because there's water on the moon and they could drink it you had a very good answer and i like that it was very clarifying um so the text where you find your evidence isn't necessarily important so long as you can back it up does that make sense ,yeah yeah it does so so then i my answer is right i just wait actually what was wrong with my answer because you you said that i did good because i answered the question and i said yes 
420.2,Oliver,,student okay um so the only part that i would the only suggestion i have for you and this suggestion is for class not just student is that in your answers i would like you to state where you found your evidence next time is that in your answers i would like you to state where you found your evidence next time okay so if i were to use jazmin's as an example you said yes astronauts can drink the water to stay hydrated a suggestion i would say is adding i know this because in paragraph four it states ,okay okay yeah that's actually helpful for me to teacher i love looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i really appreciate how you took the time to explain all of their ideas and and and and then kind of make i feel like class thought to feel valued and their ideas and and i also have some ideas from you explaining what what we need to work on to get answers 
420.2,Oliver,,i'm sorry i didn't get or maybe after lunch we can talk about the answers ,okay okay thanks teacher bye 
420.2,Luis,,hi class ,excuse me teacher 
420.2,Luis,,yeah ,i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,well we're just going to go through your class answers today just to make sure that we can have a full understanding in the broad spectrum of it i think you all have a pretty good understanding but i want to make sure you know fully what's going on ,ok oh ok 
150.1,Luis,,ok so can you so can oh gosh ,you want to hear you want me to tell you what i said again 
150.1,Luis,,yes please laughs ,ok no problem so i said let me see what i wrote down oh scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
210.2,Luis,,so they do use oxygen tanks but for this we're wondering what they're using for the water you know so we're wondering instead of just in a general sense what they use we're thinking what are they using for the water ,ok instead of a general sense what are they using for the water ok ok i mean they need the oxygen tank to breathe on the moon 
210.4,Luis,,they do but what are we using to get the water and to see what's going on ,oh i don't know yeah i don't know 
230.3,Farrah,,so does class want to actually ok oh jesus sorry one second class ok so student for example you said that they used a microscope to look really closely right ,uh-huh yeah 
210.4,Farrah,,so that's an example of what they used in specifically to find the water and to see what's going on because the goal of this question is how we're identifying the water on the moon because remember they didn't know if we had any and then they found it so ,yeah 
230.2,Farrah,,student where did you find this how did you know did you find it in the text ,yeah in paragraph 3 it was the last sentence of the text that i found it 
120.4,Oliver,,perfect perfect that's great and then so student you said you circled the same as student but i think we want to go deeper into that and i want you to have your own answer so can you give me something different ,well i mean it was this i think that's the right answer though because it talked about the equipment and what it does and it's looking at the water so i don't think there is another answer 
130.1,Jazmin,,well there is a couple of answers ,yeah i think my answer is right so i don't know why my answer is wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,but can you tell me what the machine is can you be a little bit more specific about that ,oh yeah nasa sent a small machine called lunar orbiter lunar orbiter 
420.2,Jazmin,,yeah that's perfect so when we're saying our answers we want to be as specific as possible to the text because that's really important to give evidence to what we have instead of just the general so if you have a specific thing from the text definitely include that always in your response because that gives me an idea of how much you can understand what's going on ,ok 
110.1,,,so your answer was really really really great and i really enjoyed it ,oh thank you laughter 
210.2,Chris,,so could you tell me a piece of equipment that they used and then student we're going to look at your answer and it was really great and i think that you really understood the text but i'm not sure you quite understood the question that we were asking but something that they used in order to find it is the question that we're asking. ,well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks and tanks and suits 
110.3,Chris,,yeah i mean that's great that's great that you have that background knowledge i really appreciate you adding that to the conversation i think that's really really important ,ok yeah 
210.4,Chris,,but do you know like student said the microscope do you know why they use a microscope from the text ,well when she read it it said to look at it really closely 
210.4,Chris,,yeah do you know why they have to look at it so close ,no no i don't know 
210.4,Chris,,does that make sense so when we're looking at our answers i want you to be able to maybe explain just why they needed this equipment as well so it's because there's so little water that they need to look at it so close ,yeah i got to explain more i got to see more 
150.1,Chris,,it's not always more but i want you to be able to see where the evidence is coming from because then i know that you know where the evidence is coming from ,ok ok yeah 
150.1,Chris,,reading the text is very important ,ok i think i got it 
110.1,Oliver,,that's perfect ,ok excuse me ms mccarthy 
110.1,Oliver,,yeah ,i was looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you helped me think of how i can use evidence from the text in making my own answer even if it's the same as somebody else's but to put it in my own words 
110.1,Oliver,,of course have fun at lunch class ,thank you bye 
110.1,Luis,,hi yeah student ,yes yeah so i just was gonna say that like i already own like all that there is about space so i don't think i even need to be in this class 
220.1,Luis,,so we're going to be focusing on just this text so that we can digest this and answer the question so even if you do know a little bit you can bring in that background information but we're gonna be focusing on the text that we read ,okay i can i can do that 
120.2,Farrah,,okay all right so student do you want to share first what equipment did scientists use to discover ,i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.2,Farrah,,yeah they do use that that is a really good point and do you know when we answer these i want you class to try and think of where you found them and let me know where you found them because we want to bring in that information from the text so where do you think you found that one ,in the reading 
230.2,Farrah,,yes you can say the number of the point it was on so like the microscope part where was that ,oh it was paragraph three he said that the water they found was microscopic and that you'd need a scientific tool to look really close 
310.1,Oliver,,perfect that is a very good answer student how about you student and i like that you really pulled that from the text ,um well i said pretty much the same thing as student um you know like i thought it was the microscope as well um so i guess i have the same answer 
230.2,Oliver,,is there anything more specific that you want to pull from her answer in the text ,i'm not sure what what to pull 
120.1,Oliver,,so in the third one it's talks about the water they found is microscopic is there anything else that you want to add to that or is it just that ,um well i would say like scientists use the microscope to discover water 
120.4,Chris,,perfect and you know that was a very good answer thank you for sharing how about you student all right ,um yeah so i said that scientists found craters that were just full of water 
120.1,Chris,,and that's a really do you want to be a little bit more specific with your answer for me ,well i guess that they found lots of water like they found a whole bunch of water in these craters that was kind of you know what i mean 
230.2,Chris,,so they did find them in the craters and but what part of the text did you get that one from did you find that anywhere specifically in the text you're not sure let's oh ,well they said they said oh okay they said this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
120.4,Jazmin,,yeah so they use the lunar orbiter correct good job how about you student ,so my answer with this it was nasa send a small machine but i was like why why is my answer wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,so when we answer we want to be very specific so like in the text what small machine are they talking about did they say what kind of small machine ,yeah they they said in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
420.2,Farrah,,yep so that's what you want to specify that the equipment that use was the lunar orbiter which is a small machine so you are correct but we just want to make sure we're super specific about it what's up student ,did they use the orbiter or did they use the microscope i mean i guess i'm not sure why my answers wrong 
210.4,Farrah,,so they use both so they use the lunar orbiter to look for the ice deposits in the craters and that's where they could find the water so they had to use the microscope to look really really closely out that so they use them both ,interesting okay 
210.4,Chris,,yep student ,oh i just was saying that that scientists like well i've been to nasa so i know that scientists like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff so i was wondering 
210.4,Chris,,what was that i just didn't understand you too well ,oh sorry i was so if i know that's part of it but it wasn't in the reading how what what you know what i mean 
110.2,Chris,,so did you bring in that background knowledge that you already knew yeah so you are correct ,"Cool. And that's, that's like different from like if i talk about something that you know this was what i thought but this is my like i said like this is where i got the information "
110.2,Chris,,mm hmm and that's a very good way to do it that's cool mm hmm ,we actually have to go to lunch 
110.2,Chris,,perfect ,and i really want to thank you for making sure that check the reading mostly and then for me like i was really interested in like being able to think about how i was how i was like raising what i was saying is it got me thinking like how do i think about what i'm saying so that was really cool i felt like this interesting connection to my thoughts thank you so much 
220.1,Luis,,you're welcome you class did a great job start simulation hi class so i'm very impressed with all of your answers to the questions that we just went over and so what i want to do now is to go over these responses and help you adjust them just to make sure that we get our complete understanding of what we're saying yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Farrah,,so we're all in this class together just because i wanted to pull you class and make sure that we all understand together and work through our answers together in a class so even if we believe that we're understanding everything i just want to make sure that is clarified among class okay okay all right so student i'm gonna start with you so in remind me of what your answer was ,yeah sure i said i'm that you'd need let me look i think i say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.2,Farrah,,so good so in the text where did you find that in the text what made you choose as your response because in paragraph ,three well i was looking for equipment and then in paragraph three they they use the word scientific tool and i know that's the same thing as equipment and then i was looking for the other keywords about finding water on the moon and i saw that in paragraph three 
120.4,Oliver,,i love how you recognized tool and equipment were synonyms and found the answer that way we can go deeper into the text and get more evidence and details for the response and that would be great okay all right more just make sure that we're going deeper into the text and reading it one more time so we can find even more information but if we want to look deeper and find more evidence that would be amazing okay okay all right and how about you remind me of your answer now ,okay well i i had a circle the same thing i student because mine came from the third paragraph to it says um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely if the last sentence in that paragraph 
230.3,Oliver,,nice so are you also having the same ideas student where equipment and scientific tools can be used interchangeably as a synonym ,yeah because i i know that a tool is something that you used to do with thing and i know equipment is something that you used to do a thing to 
130.2,Jazmin,,good so when you go and you look through the text i want you to just let me know what your answers are directly okay so i would look definitely more closely and find some more tools or more evidence from the text that we can use to support your answer to the question okay all right so student and deb why don't you class work together while i finish up with class else and you class can turn and talk quietly and find some more things that we can find for evidence yes student ,i don't understand i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,so remind me of your answer one more time ,i said nasa sent a small machine 
230.1,Jazmin,,so in your answer why did you choose that ,i guess similarly to what it is that i was looking for something that was like equipment and and i was also looking for where they would like discover the water and so that was a piece of equipment 
420.2,Jazmin,,mm hmm yeah so you are completely correct nasa did send a small machine and that was used to discover water on the moon so if you want to incorporate that into your answer and make sure that you get those details in. and on paragraph two you can look closely and see it was like a lunar orbiter that was used to investigate and find the water so when you're answering you could say in paragraph two i saw that i found a lunar lunar orbiter make sure you use evidence from the text to support that scientist sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is what it states so you want to word that and make sure that the understanding of where it came from and what it is is incorporated into your answer ,okay i have to write that from the beginning because i was just adding on to my old answer to i found a lunar orbiter 
420.2,Jazmin,,scientist sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is what it states so you want to word that and make sure that the understanding of where it came from and what it is is incorporated into your answer ,okay okay where it came from it came from nasa right 
110.1,Jazmin,,yep ,and what it is is a small machine called an orbiter 
110.1,Chris,,great okay good job i guess i can write that down okay ,you know what i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks 
120.4,Chris,,they do do that so student was that your answer for the question ,no my answer was about the polar craters 
230.2,Chris,,alright so we're in the text did you find that answer what made you choose that as the answer to the question ,okay i remember it was in the beginning um yeah and paragraph one and why i chose it was because i was looking for some of the keywords in the question discover water on the moon and in that in the third sentence or four sentence it has almost all those words in their scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the most polar crater so it had all the keywords 
120.3,Chris,,it did so i want you to read read me the question out loud and okay oh ,what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.2,Chris,,all right and what's the keyword that they're asking for ,what equipment well i guess i didn't i didn't use equipment but i do use discover water on the moon 
210.2,Chris,,but in the question we want to focus on the equipment they use to discover that water yep so the discover water on the moon is definitely important and it definitely was found in that first paragraph and i understand where you would get that answer so we could reward that you find in the text what equipment they used yep ,okay um they use the lunar orbiter to find water in the in the poor craters do i keep my craters or do i change the whole 
210.2,Oliver,,anything keep the craters we just need to you know the equipment that they use to find the water in the craters okay ,excuse me 
210.2,Oliver,,yeah it's ,it's time for us to gold so we'll have to see you later 
150.1,Luis,,all right thank you class alright alright class so we were working on our responses and who didn't get to answer yet ,i didn't ask me 
120.4,Luis,,alright student so i don't you remind me of what your answer was for the first question ,okay but i also just want to say i think i got all this figured out now i'm all good 
120.4,Luis,,all right can you just remind me of your answer ,yeah okay so i said i'm scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
230.2,Luis,,all right that is very true i want you to walk me through where you found that answer or how you found okay ,okay maybe i didn't find it in here but i know that i know that they can't go to the moon without oxygen tanks 
230.2,Luis,,in paragraph five did you find it oh let me see useful ,oh yeah look in paragraph five refill the gas tanks before heading out into it oh no that's gas tanks i was thinking about the breathing part 
230.2,Luis,,mm hmm ,astronauts could breathe oxygen okay that's something 
210.3,Luis,,yeah so in the question the question says what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon do you think oxygen tanks to help them to discover the water ,well i mean it helps them breathe 
210.3,Luis,,it dies you can't ,look for water if you can't breathe 
120.4,Farrah,,yep so you do need oxygen to help them breathe to find the water but what equipment was used directly to find the water is what we want to know oh what did you say student ,the lunar orbiter but i said the microscope and the teacher said that was right 
230.1,Luis,,mm hmm okay so okay so i'm gonna save a lunar orbiter and the microscope it's the microscope and the lunar orbiter so i want you to tell me why you chose those ones now what made you change your thinking ,because because that's what i'm student had and what student had and you you told them that was correct 
150.1,Luis,,"Okay, so that we can make sure we are understanding. ",okay all right paragraph two it says lunar orbit our land at the south pole and okay so that's looking well i mean that's not actually water nice but ok so that's one thing for microscope they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close well actually that's looking at the water that's not looking for the water so i actually think student is wrong and i think jazmin's answers right 
210.4,Luis,,so student was both they're both correct because it used to discover the water it doesn't have to do with finding the water it's how they found it so they needed the microscope to find the water because they had to look very closely at it and they needed the lunar orbiter to find the water because that's where they used to find the ice deposits in the craters which on the water so that makes sense ,oh yeah yeah yeah okay i get that 
150.1,Jazmin,,all right does class have any questions about their responses and how they can help to make them better ,i'm still kind of confused okay so i was trying to look at the sentence that you helped me to write 
150.1,Jazmin,,but i guess ,i'm not sure like how to i mean i know i so i read nasa's into small machine and then you're like that's so vague right that the name so i then i wrote now this is meant to solve machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and then there was more more that you you you suggested that i write but i don't i don't remember how to make what to add to my answer 
420.2,Jazmin,,so one thing you can do to add to your answer is in the text where did you find that answer so you can say in paragraph two i saw that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to find ice deposits in a large polar crater which led them to discover the water so we can work those into that that you make sure that you have your details and your explanation as to why you chose that answer ,ok ok ok ok i got it 
150.1,Chris,,that makes sense yeah it does and does class else student ,yeah mine's more a comment than a question because what i let me think oh yeah oh cuz we were talking about the water on the moon and i was thinking about how i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
230.1,Chris,,really so do you think they could use the lunar orbiter or the microscopes to bother there and find it the water yeah yeah ,i'm wondering if maybe they would just leave some stuff there so that they can keep building up a whole piece there and then they can leave their their tools and equipment on the moon 
150.1,Oliver,,that's a very interesting question does class else have any questions or comments related to the question about what we were reading ,a small question on course as sure my answer sound the same as jazmin's answer 
420.2,Oliver,,so you both have very different responses but they're both correct so they didn't use a microscope and that was your answer so that would make yours correct so all of you in your responses can add where you found your answers in the text into your response so we can all say like in this paragraph i found my answer ,ok ok i understand i got that well thanks so much teacher it's time for us to go to lunch i didn't want to say yeah thank you for helping us to realize what was missing from our answers because now i do know that i should write on like where i found the information and maybe one more sentence from a text 
150.1,Farrah,,yeah great job class thank you hello class i know when we are working on our tasks in discussions with water on the moon and i know we are gonna dive into what we read oh yes questions student ,i think student has the first question 
110.3,Luis,,think it's good so you can share your answers with the rest of the class because maybe someone might not know as well as you do ,cool yeah yeah i can do that 
110.3,Oliver,,student you have a question ,um yeah but i think some and i was going to share her answer 
110.3,Farrah,,yes student go ahead ,that's okay we can share answers it would you like us to each share answers one by one 
110.3,Oliver,,yes that would be a great idea but let's see what oliveron has to say first ,i'm pretty much the same hey 
120.4,Oliver,,no problem so let's all share what we had for our responses who would like to start ,i'll start so i said that in terms of what it meant it scientists us to discover water i said you need a scientific tool microscope to look really close yeah and i have the same answer as um i had the same answer as seven basically i circled the same thing 
120.4,Luis,,yeah student ,for me i said scientists found craters of water i was thinking that there's like lots of fun for me i was saying that basically nasa send a small machine yeah and what i was saying is basically that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that you know 
210.4,Oliver,,perfect student you have a very very good response with a lot of detail in it and maybe you can help me help the students to figure out how we can get them to really dive into the text so if we read question number in the first response so scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's cooler craters these creators are dark places where the sun never shines so can someone tell me what is what sticks out within that sentence yes student ,i'm like it sticks out that it says the sun never shines there it's always in dark 
110.1,Farrah,,it's a dark dark place student do you want to share too ,basically i had to think 
110.1,Jazmin,,okay student i know your hand went up to do the same thing ,yeah i will be in any in any case but i was also wondering like i know we're looking at the and i hate to interrupt but i was just thinking like i don't really know why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,there's nothing wrong with any of your responses at all it's not wrong we're gonna we're going to really dig deep into more detail and get you will get a good understanding of the text so i just want to make sure that class knows what they're reading and how we can really bring out the best in all of you class so now reading number two so nasa send a small machine called lunar over order to investigate this order looks for ice deposits in large polar craters these ice deposits are very small can someone tell me what sticks out to them in that sentence go student ,so i think like one thing it says is that the lunar orbiter is what lands and looks like i think that's really important like is the thing that looks for the ice deposit and then also well that was the big thing i saw 
110.1,Chris,,very good response ,i kind of was thinking about what student and student were saying and i was thinking that the deposits are small so maybe like it's you know what i mean like maybe you need a microscope to see 
110.1,Oliver,,good you need tools to see them student go ahead ,um yeah pretty much like student i think said for me and student 
210.4,Chris,,let's move on to the last one that means that the moon is still drier than a dry desert on earth the water they found is microscopic mean you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i know that a lot of you class did mention being able to use a microscope so now what's something where something that stands out in that sentence go ahead student ,um yeah so i think like for me that's interesting is it says like to see the water you have to use a microphone 
110.1,Chris,,yes absolutely ,it makes me think i guess my question is like i've been to nasa with my dad and we saw that like there was like masks and suits and stuff that astronauts or i was wondering like why that's not in the reading 
110.1,Chris,,ok i can't hear your last part can you say it again ,yeah sorry i i was just wondering why like the suits and oxygen and stuff like that like wasn't like that seemed like that would be in court you know what i mean but it's not mentioned anywhere 
110.3,Farrah,,i mean obviously you need oxygen to survive so that's a very good observation student i saw your hand go up ,yeah so i was thinking that it's super dry and if it's super dry like it says that it's like spread over a water area like that the water doesn't just like you know what i mean it's not just in a pool and it would be really hard to see and unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a second and really thank you for working with us in particular you really like i think made class feel like they were their opinions and like yeah i think class i think also like what was so important is like you really helped us to make sure that we looked at the end to like figure out like what we were supposed to be me and you also you know you really had us listen to each other and that was really cool because sometimes we don't like listen to each other's ideas and conversations and today i was listening so close so thank you so much for for helping us 
110.3,Luis,,bye hi class how are you class doing today i really liked you class responses to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon but i just kind of want to talk about what you class thought oh student do you have a question ,excuse me but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,oh student you know plenty about space but i just want to talk about what we learned in the text and what kind of interested us ,oh oh ok 
150.1,Chris,,but i would say that we want to look to maybe think about things that were not specifically mentioned in the text like for example we know that nasa used the rover to find water on the moon instead your response included a bit more of just like what exactly was in the reading so we just want to work to kind of dive deeper in the text all right student first off i really loved your response because you showed that you really like you read the reading and you kind of took that in do you understand what i mean ,yeah yeah because i went to nasa with my dad so i do know about the mars rover and other things too 
110.3,Chris,,that's awesome space is so cool and i'm so glad that it's a passion of yours ,yeah 
310.1,Jazmin,,but what i want you to work on is just being a little bit more specific with your response you know what i mean just try to pick out details from the text you know earlier we did our lesson on comparing and contrasting using context and background information so make sure with that we look for specific details in the text student your response was really awesome i love that you had a really specific reference to the text talking about nasa and that they sent a small machine ,"but i don't understand why my answer is wrong OK, OK, so I guess I don't know how to do that. "
110.1,Jazmin,,all right so you said that nasa sent a small machine to the moon ,uh-huh So NASA sent a lunar orbiter? 
110.4,Jazmin,,yeah nasa sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon ,ok so that's what i should say nasa sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon 
420.3,Oliver,,you want to make sure that when you're reading a text you're trying to take in as many details that are specific to the question as possible ,"I do. I do. And I do want to say I only said that I circled the same as Farrah so I wasn't going to say the exact same thing, but I didn't like, circle it because she circled it. I just happened to have the same answer as her. "
420.2,Oliver,,were there any other things in the text that you noticed that were different than farrah's idea well i think the microscope is the right answer because it's such a scientific tool and the question asks about equipment so i didn't see any other scientific tool in the story all right well if you look at the story you see in the second paragraph it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate that would be considered another piece of equipment that nasa used i want you to try to when you're answering questions about text i want you to try to look for specific things and even if you share the same ideas as your classmate try to articulate it in a new way and try to explain your thinking ,ok ok explain my thinking ok 
150.1,Oliver,,you understand ,so you're saying if student has the same answer as me then i should try to find a different answer 
420.2,Oliver,,not necessarily for example if student has the answer then you can say the same answer but just work to kind of say it in your own words and describe what you thought about it ,ok ok yeah my english teacher says that to say it in your own words i could do that 
230.2,Farrah,,all right perfect student your answer was really awesome i love how you talked about microscopes and that was really specific and you even described what a microscope does which it allows you to see something super up close which is what they talk about in the article but we just want to work to kind of find an example in the text so that you know where you saw that in the text ,yeah it was in paragraph three 
110.2,Chris,,you class have any questions all right awesome i really liked how you said the specifics about the microscope and you said like you explained that they used the microscope to see water on earth that was really wonderful ,it's not so much a question but remember how i was telling you about how i went to nasa with my dad so yeah i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too 
110.3,Luis,,they do they use all of that that's really great so that's what we would call background knowledge that's stuff that you know before even reading the article and that's really awesome ,ok ok ok well it looks like it is time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say mr dallas thank you so much for explaining what each of us needs to specifically work on so now i know that i should explain my ideas or say them in my own words even if they're the same as what somebody else said and then i also heard you tell student what she should work on too so thank you very much 
110.3,All,,all righty bye ,bye 
110.3,Luis,,hi class oh student you have a question ,um yeah so here's kind of my question so i was gonna say like um i kind of already know about space so i don't think i actually have to be in this class because i don't really need any help 
150.1,Luis,,um student i saw you class seen this class because i think that all your answers showed really good understanding of space but i think that we could just get a little bit closer a little bit more specific have an answer to the questions ,okay i guess i can stick our out 
120.4,Farrah,,"so first we're going to practice together how to model a question or not how to model a question we're going to practice how to break down a question so i'm going to give you class an example first you class can see kind of what you want to be looking for so for example the question i'll use is what color is my sweatshirt so when i look at that question there are a couple of very important words that question color and sweatshirt the other words and the question don't really have much meaning what makes it a question but it's it doesn't connect to anything you can't see what but you can see color and you can see the sweatshirt so, can you guys raise your hand to someone to answer my question. what color is my sweater? i'm student why don't you go first ",okay so your sweatshirt is 
210.2,Oliver,,great job you were able to find the important words in the question so let's use the first question on the reading what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so we want to look at this question and we want to find and choose one really important word so i want you to work with your partner and i want the person on the left to be the one that starts talking first and then i want the person on the right to go after so i want you to work for two minutes and i want you to look and choose one really important word in the question and i want the person on the left to be the one that starts talking first and then i want the person on the right to go after so i want you to work for two minutes and i want you to look and choose one really important words the question the important words in the question are the ones that helped create the question and then they connect to what you read so you want to look in the question and see ,"Okay, so. so i think i'm gonna go first okay yeah that's fine cuz you're on the left so that's cool okay so we're trying to break apart the question if i understand correctly and we're trying to figure out right like what are the important words in the question is that right i think so although actually i think we're supposed to answer the question and figure out what what the important words in the reading like you know what i mean like which were the important words we're supposed to look at so i think that's what i'm going to figure out because that's what i thought our answer was supposed to be i don't think that's quite right student but you know if you're going to do that i guess you're going to do that like what i think what i think is basically like okay so the important words in the question to be are effectively like equipment because it seems like that they want to find it and they want to like um i guess maybe scientists because we know that there and then water those are the most important parts of the question because they're saying that they're asking you what equipment do they use and then the the thing that they're finding is water and that's the most important thing of all so that's what i think i'm okay so are you done student yeah you can look at it okay so what i noticed in the actual paragraph was i thought that the words that were important were um let's see if i look at it like i think the main thing that was important was um lunar orbiter water craters ice and microscope those are the most important words in the read eight that i saw okay "
120.4,Oliver,,alright class let's come back together now and let's share let's share the words that we chose in our groups you can raise your hand and i'll pick you so you can share the word you chose i'm student what where did your class choose as the most important word in the question ,so we had a disagreement and we kind of were thinking differently so i thought that you were asking what were the important words like in the question itself so when i was looking for important words what i said was like equipment scientists and water because that's what we're talking about right we're talking about finding water and we're talking about the equipment that the scientists use and how they were able to find water so that's important words student had something fferent um yeah so for me basically what i said was that i thought the most important words because i thought you were saying the most important words in the paragraph so i thought okay the most important words are water like lunar orbiter microscope oh like glass like the glass of water that they use and i and and like words like that because those are all words that that have to like that they're asking about you know what i mean 
120.4,Chris,,on savannas answer was the one that i was more posing the question for but i understand how yeah i understand i understand your confusion Chris Jazmin or Luis do you guys have an answer to share Chris. ,um so unfortunately we have to go to class but before we go i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with you thank you so much bye 
210.2,Luis,,bye alright start simulation alright student student student and why do you like to share the word that you class chose for um that was super important and the question or even why you share ,so i was just thinking like i think i got this all figured out so i think good to go 
150.1,Luis,,so was there a word that you class picked in your class that you got that you thought was important to a question i'm student i think that you class all have it figured out but i think that if we just look at it a little more in depth we could just get our answers to that much better ,yeah we thought so student and i both thought that equipment was a really important word and that we thought that equipment was the most important for um and we thought that scientists was pretty important too because both of us were thinking about how much equipment like has to be you know what i mean so basically um student and i thought about a lot about it student didn't totally agree with us 
210.3,Jazmin,,i think that's a really great response you class i think equipment is one of the most important words in the question and i also think that equipment is mentioned in the passage so when i want you class all to do individually i want you class to look at the passage the moon is a desert i want you to look and i want you to circle any equipment that is mentioned in the passage i'll give you class a minute to do that all right now that you class circled all the acquit equipment mentioned why don't we look again at all the words you circled and i want you to circle double circle all the words that involve equipment and finding water mentioned so what words are what equipment has mentioned that is also used to find water on the moon would class like to raise their hand and share the word words that they circled um student why don't you share ,um i'm still a little bit confused about part of it but i think that it started to make a little more sense as we went through this sort of exercise so here's what i am circle so i circled lunar orbiter and then yeah and i kind of circled microscope but i really thought you know orbiter was the only equipment that was used to find water like i guess you could say the microscope was used to study the water but um so i circled that one to like apple circle but you know what i mean like that's that's what i ended up with 
310.1,Oliver,,student that's a really great job because you look through the text and you found the equipment that's mentioned which is a lunar orbiter but you also notice that a microscope is mentioned but you realize that the microscope does not help them find water on the moon teacher student why don't you share the words that you circle ,i'm so student and i kind of work together again as we we usually work kind of together and do the same stuff as we think fairly similar and so actually one thing that i was thinking is that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and what it made me think is like it made it seem like all the equipment's even more important so like what i ended up circling i circled microscope i circled glass i circled lunar orbiter 
410.3,Oliver,,"Make sure that we're really looking at the text Okay, we want to focus on what the text says. lunar orbiter is a really great piece of equipment that you mentioned however i also want to make sure that we know that glass is not so much equipment as it is just something that's mentioned as an object ",oh so they didn't use a glass to measure it 
110.1,Chris,,no does class else want to share their answer student alright student and great job and are you class worked as a partner student what did you circle ,okay so i circled the same stuff like actually i circled microscope and lunar orbiter i didn't circle glass because what i thought when i read it was that glass was just like how much water like 32 ounces not that they actually you know use the glass but i added because i thought it was showing or i added a few words at the bottom like spacesuit and oxygen tanks just because i was still thinking that you'd have to use them to find the water so i just didn't want to forget that because it seems like that would be important 
210.4,Farrah,,"And I also thought was really interesting how you also mentioned microscope are concerned that I have with you guys, is that we want to make sure that we're really focusing on the equipment that is used by scientists to find water on the moon. a microscope have some study the water and helps them look at it but the microscope itself did not get it all the way up to the moon okay ",oh so they like okay so i think they're beginning to understand so like they used the lunar orbiter to find the water but like student and i were confused right student you know we were confused because we were thinking that you couldn't find it if you couldn't see it so we thought like maybe somebody had the microscope and walked around and they put it on the microscope kind of the dirt and they were like oh look it's a script but that's not that's not right they they studied it after they found it 
310.1,Oliver,,"class it's a really great job i really love you class are starting to use the text that you read previously Yes Oliver, do you have another question? ",um unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you again for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for doing a couple things like one thing is that you really helped us to understand like what the words we were looking for in the question and you were really patient with us as we try to understand your instructions and you really encouraged us to clarify the thinking that we were using and you were like offering really really thoughtful concerns like when you told me what you are a little concerned about how how i was approaching this stuff and when you are concerned that we were all mentioning the microscope well not all of us i guess student was mentioned on student you really need but um basically like what really jumped out to me is like that um we had a really strong suggestions for like how to go forward and you really kind of like we're able to figure out how we were thinking about each problem and it really helped us to understand how to how to solve the so that was pretty cool thank you so much it was really fun to work with bye 
150.1,Luis,,bye hi class so today we are here and we are going to look at our answers to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon who can raise their hand if they think they had a great go ahead student ,yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,you know all about space student that's awesome so maybe we can help our friends when they're having some questions about space does that sound good ,okay 
230.1,Farrah,,all right so let's start with student student you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely who agrees with student that you do need a microscope to look really closely at things student you agree student you agree student you agree i also agree as well that you do need a microscope to us to look really closely so let's student why do you think you need a microscope to look at the water on the moon ,um okay a couple of reasons one we've been using microscopes in science class and our teacher had us look at little water molecules water drops under the microscope so i know that they do that and then when i was reading the story in paragraph three is the last sentence it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.1,Oliver,,awesome that's a great answer okay and student you said that i you said i circled the same as student why did you circle the same as student ,well i was looking in the story for equipment and looking for water and in paragraph three they say the water they found is microscopic so that's the place where they found the water and then the name of the equipment and that one is the microscope 
110.1,Chris,,awesome and student what did you say ,i said that the scientist on crators full of water 
210.2,Jazmin,,awesome and then davy said nasa sent a small machine and student said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks so let's go back to our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what is one important word and that question student ,i think equipment 
110.1,Jazmin,,equipment awesome you're right you're right ,i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.2,Luis,,because we are looking for the specific word of the equipment that they use so let's go back and our text so let's go back to the second paragraph and let's look at moon water found could be useful in other ways water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen which is where i think where i think luis's answer came from because he saw that student is that why you said that um you think equipment like oxygen like an oxygen oxygen tank ,so actually i didn't even really read it because i already know a lot about space and i already know that scientists use oxygen tank so that's how i got that piece 
150.1,Jazmin,,awesome so let's look deeper into that student ,i got my part in paragraph two i just didn't say the name of the machine but i had it 
210.4,Jazmin,,so um student can you tell us the name of the machine from paragraph two ,i read it it's the lunar orbiter 
210.3,Jazmin,,the lunar orbiter so how can we incorporate that word lunar orbiter into our answers ,i could just say nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
210.3,Chris,,a lunar orbiter awesome student how could you incorporate the word lunar orbiter into your answer ,um i could say scientists found craters full of water on the moon with the lunar orbiter 
110.1,Oliver,,awesome student how about you ,um i guess i could say um well i don't see how i can use it because i thought that the equipment was the microscope 
110.2,Oliver,,okay so let's look um but we are going to look a little bit deeper it says your the microscope is right it is very much right ,well if the lunar orbiter is right how can the microscope be right too which one is right 
130.2,Luis,,well let's look who knows what a lunar student do you know what a lunar orbiter is ,um no actually okay i don't know that one i don't know what that one is 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay who can tell me what a lunar orbiter is ,um well when i was reading the story it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so the lunar orbiter it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
210.4,Chris,,right so what we know that the ice deposits are very very tiny so i lunar orbiter is just another word for a microscope but it's more it's a more specific word for a microscope right ,i didn't even realize that was that was the same thing like a micro a lunar orbiter is a microscope 
210.3,Chris,,right so let's think about it where do we use a lunar orbiter ,on the moon 
210.3,Chris,,on the moon and where can we use a microscope ,anywhere 
210.3,Chris,,we can use a microscope anywhere right so how would we make our answers a little bit more specific ,you know now i'm going to add that to my list of equipment because i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
130.3,Oliver,,right so now that we know a lunar orbiter is what we use to discover water on the moon how can we re re answer this question ,can i just say it like how you said a lunar orbiter was used to discover water on the moon 
130.2,Farrah,,right student do you agree with that ,um yeah well now that i understand um yeah uh yeah i do 
110.1,Chris,,awesome so let's say ,i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later okay 
110.1,Oliver,,perfect thank you so much ,bye 
220.1,Chris,,bye okay hi class so in our last lesson we learned that a lunar orbiter is what we can use to find water on the moon does class remember ,yeah 
220.1,Luis,,right so we kind of changed our answers a little bit to include the word lunar orbiter into our answer so let's talk a little bit more about what we can go ahead student ,yeah i'm sorry to interrupt but i got this all figured out now so i think i'm all good 
120.4,Chris,,all right well let's try to listen and maybe help our friends along the way okay okay so we changed our answers a little bit to include the word lunar orbiter into our answer what else can we add into our answer to make make it a little bit more credible the word starts with an e ,um equipment 
120.4,Farrah,,no evidence we can add some evidence into our answer does class agree ,yeah 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay so let's go back back into the text and find some evidence to include in our answer so can somebody look and try to see where a good evidence would be to add into our answer ,okay we already have the lunar already 
110.4,Farrah,,we already had the lunar orbiter part ,i think i already put evidence in my answer too 
120.4,Farrah,,what evidence do you think you put in your answer student ,okay well i put the lunar orbiter and then i added that to what i said about the microscope so then i have two names of equipment and i have looking really closely which is from the story and evidence is just from the story right 
120.4,Chris,,right you're right student so let's look and we where does the water hide on the moon ,in the craters that one was in my answer 
120.4,Chris,,in the craters right so what can we what answer can we come up with to use the evidence to support what we are trying to say ,okay well i okay so what about mine because i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon with the lunar orbiter 
120.4,Jazmin,,right so let's try to think about why we have to use a lunar orbiter student kind of touched on that in her answer ,i'm still kind of confused 
120.4,Jazmin,,when you confused on student ,i guess i don't know which evidence i'm supposed to be looking for 
120.2,Jazmin,,so let's look all together we are trying to find why we use a lunar orbiter ,to find water on the moon 
110.4,Farrah,,to find water on the moon and because again student kind of touched on it and her answer ,to look at the water on the moon 
210.3,Chris,,to look at the water but also because the water is so small on the moon right ,yeah yeah it's microscopic 
210.3,Oliver,,so how can we add those into our answer ,okay um i'm gonna say okay so let me look at my my answer before okay um you'd need all scientific tool called a microscope and a lunar orbiter to look really closely because it's microscopic 
210.3,Chris,,because it's microscopic awesome student student how can you change your answer ,okay scientists found craters full of water on the moon with the lunar orbiter because the water well if the water was microscopic then how did they find the craters full of water 
140.1,Chris,,the water is hiding in the craters ,so they're full of water at the bottom no oh man now i'm confused scientists have known for a long time okay well scientists found craters full of water on the moon with the lunar orbiter 
140.1,Chris,,because ,because the water was microscopic 
210.3,Chris,,right all right let's go to student student how can you change your answer ,oh excuse me teacher i was just thinking about the water on the moon i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
210.3,Chris,,there could be what ,a base like they might build a moon base 
110.3,Chris,,oh that's very cool student ,yeah yeah 
140.1,Chris,,maybe maybe we'll have to read about that next time ,oh yeah that'd be cool 
210.3,Jazmin,,yeah all right student how can you include those into your answer ,okay um okay teacher how did you know that we should include microscopic in the answer 
120.1,Jazmin,,what student ,how did you know that we should put the microscopic part in the answer remember when i was saying like i'm trying to figure out like how do i know what part of the story the evidence i should put in my answer 
210.3,Jazmin,,so student remember we said that we use a lunar orbiter on the moon but a microscope could be used for anything so in this answer we're talking specifically about the moon so which one of those things do you would you think would be more specific ,definitely the lunar orbiter 
110.4,Jazmin,,definitely the lunar orbit are so that's why we're including the lunar orbiter in our answer ,okay and then the microscopic word 
130.3,Jazmin,,we're using the microscopic part to prove that we need a lunar orbiter ,oh ok ok i understand okay 
210.3,Jazmin,,awesome so how can we change your answer a little bit student to include that evidence and then also include the little the lunar orbiter ,okay um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter because the water is microscopic 
110.1,Luis,,student how can you change your answer perfect ,oh i gotta do this too 
110.1,Luis,,yes ,oh okay nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter because the water was microscopic 
110.1,Oliver,,awesome student ,um. well teacher i'm looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i am thinking about my answer and i think i learned that we have to be specific and put in evidence that tells why 
110.1,Oliver,,right student thank you so much ,oh wow that was right oh cool okay yeah well thanks teacher for telling us um what what evidence from the text we should put in our answer and and that we how to do that okay 
110.1,Jazmin,,thank you so much for being so awesome ,oh thanks teacher 
230.1,Farrah,,okay student we're going to start with you so you answered the question of what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon and your answer was that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely how did you get to that answer ,reach every reader well i was looking at the at the text and i thought about the fact that the question asked about equipment and so i was looking for some things that was equipment and then the question also asked about water and so i saw in paragraph three that they were talking about finding the water and they were talking about the microscope which is equipment 
150.1,Farrah,,okay that makes a lot of sense that you put those two together but what paragraph three says is that the water that they found is microscopic and that you would need a microscope to look really closely to see that so if you can look at paragraph two it says that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate to discover the water on the moon does that make sense do you see that ,oh yeah i see it 
150.1,Luis,,what about making is that making more sense to you ,oh i don't think i know i don't understand why i'm why it's not the microscope excuse me i'm sorry to interrupt but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
220.1,Luis,,well student that's great that's you feel like you know everything that there is to know about space but there is always more that we can learn and maybe by listening to our friends answer is we can learn even more ,oh okay 
220.1,Luis,,can you hang with us for just a few more minutes ,yeah 
230.1,Oliver,,okay so student i see that you just answered the same as student did you read the article ,yeah yeah i had the same answer that student did that they were asking about finding water and i'm paragraph three talks about finding water 
210.4,Oliver,,well you're right it does it does the lunar orbiter was used to investigate to look for ice deposits and the big craters that are on the moon but the ice deposits are very small so they use a bigger they use the machine to find the ice and then the microscope would be used to actually see it to see the water they didn't use it to discover the water ,okay they use a microscope to see the water but not to discover the water 
210.4,Jazmin,,mm hmm yes student ,i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.3,Jazmin,,well your answer is not completely wrong you did say that nasa send a small machine but can you tell me what that small machine is ,oh okay oh she called a lunar orbiter 
130.1,Chris,,there you go so that was a small machine that they use to investigate the moon to look into the large polar craters okay so student your answer of scientists found craters full of water on the moon i had a they did find craters full of water but the question was asking what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon can you tell me what equipment they use so student and student you're not completely wrong a microscope is a piece of equipment but that's not the full answer ,ok ok so 
120.1,Chris,,student can you tell me what kind of equipment that they used to discover water on the moon ,you told student that she was close because she said on the small machine and then you asked her what it was called and she said the lunar orbiter so i think you told her that that was the answer right 
130.1,Chris,,right and then student and deb also let us know that they use a microscope as well once they discovered the water do you remember reading that ,yeah yeah i remember reading paragraph three but i didn't think that um that that was it because because they said that they were talking about finding the water and i had seen that there was like a lot of water in the craters 
120.1,Chris,,right it can be a little confusing if you don't read over it carefully huh ,yeah i guess so um but i do know like a lot i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.1,Luis,,right and that's student that was your point right ,yeah yeah like i know a lot of a lot of equipment stuff 
120.2,Luis,,okay so student what can you tell us about the equipment that the scientists used to discover water on the moon ,um well well i had said that um i think they need to use like oxygen tanks in order to go to the moon you know when they have to wear their space shoot so and that's equipment tools because they can't breathe on the moon 
110.3,Luis,,right so you really are thinking outside of the box you're not just reading the article and just using what the article has given us you're thinking outside of the box and thinking about the other equipment that they might use yeah ,yeah cuz i mean i read a lot about space 
140.1,Luis,,so you like to read ,yeah 
120.1,Luis,,well that's well that's great so student what do you think about the equipment that the article has told us about ,um ah you mean nothing like that what you told student about 
120.3,Luis,,can you find it and that's in paragraph 2 ,not i sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large bore crater these ice deposits are very small okay yeah i yeah 
210.4,Chris,,so they so let's talk as a class so they use a small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate and they're investigating these these craters on the moon right and they're looking for ice deposits but the ice deposits are very small so the amount of water that they find is going to be very small right so then in paragraph three what does it tell us that they use it that they needed to us to look at to see these very small deposits of water ,um the microscope 
210.4,Chris,,right the microscope so the first piece of equipment that they're using what's called what i'm sorry ,lunar orbiter 
210.4,Farrah,,lunar orbiter and the second piece of equipment was called what ,the microscope 
150.1,Farrah,,the microscope good job student so does class understand ,i think so um you know what i just realized it's it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thanks for for for taking like and having us keep looking back at the text and and and keep asking us the questions so that we can kind of keep thinking about it and thinking about it 
150.1,Farrah,,absolutely thank you class for working with me you're welcome ,okay bye 
150.1,Luis,,bye hey class how are you doing ,i'm good yeah i'm good too me too i'm good i had one question i shouldn't be in this class because i already know everything i know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,student you are very smart but there you've got to remember there is always room for us to grow and improve and learn more ok ,ok 
120.4,Chris,,so let's look over our initial questions so the first question as a class is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon does class want to volunteer their answer ,i'll say mine 
120.4,Chris,,ok student what you got ,i said that they found craters full of water 
410.1,Chris,,they did find craters full of water and that's great that you were able to gather that information out of the article but the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover that so are craters full of water is that a type of equipment ,no craters aren't equipment so i guess no 
410.1,Chris,,i'm sorry student i couldn't hear you what did you say ,i said since craters aren't equipment then i guess no no it's not 
130.1,Farrah,,does class else want to volunteer their answer so that's good you thought through that it wasn't a bad answer it just wasn't correct for that question ,i could 
130.1,Farrah,,ok student ,i said the part in the story where it says that they found that they need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
310.1,Jazmin,,so a microscope is a piece of equipment but it's just not the type of equipment that they used to find the water in the article if you could go back and look when they used the microscope they get and use the microscope to find the water the microscope would be used to see the water because the amount is so small so a microscope is a type of equipment it's a piece of equipment that was mentioned in the article so that's great that you were able to point that out ,excuse me miss brown 
310.1,Jazmin,,yes student ,i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,what was your answer student ,that nasa sent a small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,they did nasa did use a small machine can you tell me what that small machine was ,nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate a lunar orbiter 
210.3,Jazmin,,a lunar orbiter so the question of what type of equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what would be a good full answer student ,what type of equipment did scientists use to inaudible 
110.4,Jazmin,,now when they discovered the water on the moon did they discover large amounts of water or just little teeny tiny amounts of water they did so scientists used a lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon ,i don't know 
130.2,Chris,,does class remember ,i answered craters full of water but you said craters wasn't equipment i know that they said there's a lot of water deep in the moon's craters so i would think a lot of water 
210.4,Farrah,,if you look at paragraph 3 it says the water they found is microscopic and that means that you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking right at it but student told us that the article says that in order to see the water we would need what student ,a microscope 
210.4,Jazmin,,a microscope so student they use the lunar orbiter to discover the water and in order to see the water they would need to use a microscope so how many types of equipment were mentioned in our article ,the microscope and the lunar orbiter 
130.3,Chris,,right there were two so a good full answer to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon would be scientists used the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon and a microscope to be able to see the microscopic amounts of water yes student ,i just wanted to say that i went to nasa so i also know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too 
130.3,Chris,,"Our question said, what did they use to discover water? So oxygen tanks and their suits, that wouldn't be part of that answer. But they are pieces of equipment that astronauts absolutely would have to use. ",yeah ok 
120.2,Oliver,,so the second part of our discussion question is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ,excuse me miss brown i'm sorry to interrupt 
120.2,Oliver,,it's ok ,i just realized that it's time for us to go to lunch so i know this time was short but of i'll see you later ok 
120.2,All,,ok thank you ,bye 
120.2,Luis,,ok so we're going to discuss the next question and that is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable does class have any thoughts on that ,i just wanted to remind you my dad's actually an astronaut 
120.4,Luis,,ok that's awesome student do you have any thoughts about the water on the moon do you think that it's a valuable is there convincing evidence that water on the moon is valuable based off of our article ,water is valuable we've got to drink it all the time so yeah based on the article i would say yeah water on the moon is valuable 
210.4,Luis,,does class want to student do you want some help from a friend and what does the article tell us about why water on the moon would be valuable ,yeah i do 
130.2,,,does class want to help student out why does the article tell us that water on the moon could be so valuable ,i had an idea but i don't remember 
120.4,Chris,,what's your idea student ,it was something about how it was talking about water can be broken down into two parts do you remember what that is hydrogen and oxygen 
210.4,Chris,,awesome yep so smart so why would it be helpful if it can be broken down into two parts what could those things what could oxygen and hydrogen be used for what do we use oxygen for ,to breathe 
210.4,Chris,,so breathing would be a good use for the oxygen what about the hydrogen ,i don't know what we use hydrogen for 
120.1,Jazmin,,does class want to go back and read over in paragraph 5 i have to read too because i don't know what we use it for so we could do it together so paragraph 5 says that water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts could breathe the oxygen and oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel do you class see that uh-huh oh you know what else ,what you can use water to grow things so that we can have a moon garden on the moon that would be really nice 
110.1,Jazmin,,and what did they say was the problem with water and carrying water on the spacecraft that might be a good idea ,i have to look again water could be useful in lots of ways they could drink the water so is water so that's something they could drink the water 
210.4,Jazmin,,does the article tell us that water is light or is water heavy ,is says water is heavy 
130.3,Oliver,,water is heavy so taking a lot of water in the spacecraft to the moon it would be a lot of weight and it would take up a lot of space right mm-hmm the article tells us that there might be some problems with doing research for finding out why the water a convincing argument for why this would be useful what does it tell us that the problems could be what's the issue with the research it's at the very end of the article so astronauts would be able to use the water if it was broken down for oxygen and hydrogen to fuel the rockets oxygen to breathe obviously the water to drink ,mumbling i just see them asking a question if we think it'd be a good thing 
210.2,Oliver,,so in paragraph 6 it tells us that scientists would need to come up with a plan for getting the water out of those big craters and that making the plan it would take a lot of time and it would take a lot of money they would have to do a lot of studying on the moon's surface and they would have to build new equipment so if nasa didn't have the money or the manpower or the equipment those things could be a problem but spending the money building the equipment and doing the research do you think that it would be worth it is the amount of water on the moon and the uses for the water on the moon valuable enough for nasa to spend the money and do the research ,we need to drink water and i feel like if the astronauts were on the moon and they get thirsty then they do want to be able to have some water to drink right 
230.3,Oliver,,right they would need water to drink so student you think that it would be worth it to spend the money and do the research ,yeah 
130.2,Farrah,,ok student what do you think ,i guess i don't know i don't know if i think nasa has a lot of money so i guess i figured they can spend a lot of money because they have a lot of money but i don't know if it's worth it 
210.3,Farrah,,you are probably right nasa does have a lot of money but if they do the research and they spend the money and then they don't get a lot of water then what do you think they would be upset ,oh yeah my mom gets really upset if she spends a lot of money on food and then my brother doesn't eat it she gets really mad 
210.1,Farrah,,right so they would feel like maybe they were wasting it so they have to have enough evidence to show that the amount of water that they could extract from the moon that the uses that they could use the water for on the moon that those uses and the amount of water that it would be worth it to them to spend the money and to build the equipment ,yeah i see what you're saying 
150.1,Oliver,,class else have a question ,it's not a question but i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch 
150.1,Oliver,,ok ,but i did want to say even though we only had a short time together i appreciate how you asked each of us about what we were thinking and you took some time to explain like for student and ask her some questions that made her feel valuable and i feel like for student and student too so thank you so much for helping us think about what we were reading 
150.1,All,,absolutely thanks for having me class ,bye 
150.1,Farrah,,bye okay hello class ,hi good to see you 
150.1,Farrah,,good to see you too i'm your teacher so we just read a little excerpt about the moon correct yeah did you class enjoy water on the moon yes water on the moon did you class enjoy the reading ,mm hmm 
150.1,Luis,,oh good so i just asked you the question and got your response to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and then we had a circle the evidence in the text so that we can answer the question and i want to just go over a couple of your answers and that's why i pulled you ,class excuse me yes me 
150.1,Luis,,yes student ,i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,well that's great that you know so you can help us learn even more things about the space and then maybe you might even learn something new you never know thank you for sharing that though ,yeah okay perfect spot 
110.1,Farrah,,okay class else have any questions before we dive into our answers you get alright so let's look at some of your answers and we have that student and deb you had similar answers right you both said you need something like a microscope to look really closely ,"Yeah, exactly. It's because our microscope is equipment. It's like a tool that you use to look at things that are really small. Yeah, in a science lab. "
230.2,Farrah,,right so you're kind of using your prior knowledge and experience to come up with that answer which is great i love that i want you to look back into the reading to circle the evidence where it talks about what you want to answer you need to have specific evidence from the reading so can we look back into the reading and you see anything about a microscope in any of the sections you can tell me which section if you see it in like how they're numbered let me know why don't you look back now and if you don't see it that's okay too ,it's in it's in part three it's in part three paragraph three they say you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope 
210.2,Chris,,Were talking about with our question that we were talking about referring to before it was what equipment just did scientists used to discover water on the moon. So who can tell me what is discover mean? we're talking about discovering the water yes student ,it's like to to find something 
210.4,Jazmin,,exactly it's divine something so did they use the microscope to find the water in the first place do you think or maybe they use something else yes student ,yes yeah how can you find it if you can't see it 
110.2,Jazmin,,you're right but maybe you don't need the microscope to see it because water maybe there's enough of it that they could see it without student you have something to add ,i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.1,Jazmin,,what we never said you class answers were wrong we're just going to look deeper into them and kind of you can explain your thinking to me so then i can understand better and we can help each other understand better so that sound good okay good so student you made the point that maybe they needed it to see it in the first place to discover it but let's kind of read can class go back and read the number paragraph to where it starts with nasa sent a small can you read that those first couple sentences of that paragraph please and then i want class to know if they want to change their answer one hand two hands will give class else minute read it over and think about it all right i see student you want to share just go for it ,um well i still think that's the small machine i don't want to change my answer you don't want it's a small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,good and do you know what that small machine is called ,nasa sent a small machine called lunar orbiter 
420.2,Chris,,"Awesome. So you have the lunar. You're right. so student your answer was correct A small machine. That's awesome. But we want to expand on that you add in right from the texts like they said, called a lunar orbiter. So would you want to add that to your answer. yes student you have something to add ",well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.3,Chris,,right so they might have used a lot of different equipment to get to the moon to survive on the moon field a walk around and breathe you're right they have to get us use the spaceship to get there but we're talking specifically about to discover the water just like it says from the reading it says nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate and that is the specific machine they use to discover the water so i like how in your answer student you were specific and you said that they found the water in the craters of the moon That they use to find that water. So what would you add Chris to your response about finding the water in that specific equipment. ,oh well i guess what you said to student is it that is the lunar orbiter so i guess i would say they use the orbiter to find the craters full of water 
420.2,Chris,,that's perfect beautiful i love that does it make more sense that you have to make sure you're answering the full question when they say equipment you have to remember their equipment and then you can add in those details you have those are awesome as well ,okay 
420.2,Oliver,,what makes sense awesome does class have anything else they would like to add or have any more questions ,actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but wanted to say thank you so much for coming today thank you for reminding us oh sorry 
420.2,Oliver,,no thank you class ,well yeah i wasn't it was really nice to meet you and we really appreciate how you helped us add more details to our answers in order to make them better 
420.2,Farrah,,awesome i'm glad you appreciate it was nice to meet you class hello class ,oh hi it's good to see you 
420.2,Luis,,nice to see you too i missed a few class forgot it's nice to see class yes student ,um yeah excuse me i'm shutting me and that's class i already know all about space 
120.4,Farrah,,that's awesome that you know all about space so you can definitely help add in different things that we may have not even known or not discussed in the article so that's great well we're all going to just go over answers and see if there's anything to make them even better than they are now because you never know you might even learn something new too class okay okay class else have any questions before we dive into our answers no we're good okay so let's see the question that was first asked is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so i want you to reread your answer that you gave and then raise your hand if you have any questions or if you think your answer is good or if you want to say something while your answer or ask why we're going to be really looking at your answer so make sure it answers that question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon who would like to discuss their answer first so we can all learn from each other yes student ,yeah so i feel really good about my answer and i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so i know that a microscope is a tool and it sounds like they use it to look at the water 
210.4,Chris,,mm hmm you're definitely right as a microscope is a scientific tool and that's what the question was asking was asking which tools specifically did they use to find this water and i believe it did talk about a microscope in our reading right class read the reading i want to take a look even closer student there's another scientific equipment that was used to specifically find the water because the microscopes going to help them maybe look at the water closer or look at other things maybe just magnified but they didn't use that to specifically find the water teacher does class remember where they found the water ,yeah that was part of my answer they found the craters of water and the craters were full of water 
130.1,Jazmin,,yeah exactly thank you for sharing student so the water was found in this craters so the equipment that we're looking for is the equipment that they use to get into these creators so wouldn't exactly be a microscope that they use to get into the craters to find it student just something you'd like to add ,um yes so um well i have a different answer from student and i said that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
110.2,Jazmin,,can you read the sentence that you found that in i believe it's the first sentence and paragraph two can you read that whole sentence okay it's not necessarily wrong at all that's a great answer because you're right they did nasa did send a small machine ,yes out loud 
110.2,Jazmin,,yes please ,okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
420.2,Jazmin,,good so what do you think you could add to your sentence to your answer to make it even more detailed and more specific to the question ,It's called a Lunar Orbiter. 
150.1,Oliver,,"They would know exactly what small machine, you were talking about, because we all knew because we read the article, but other people who didn't read the article that would definitely help them out to have the specific name of it. so let's go back to student and i think student you also had a similar answer to student so you class said microscope and you weren't wrong that was a machine that a piece of equipment that nasa uses that the astronaut uses but do you see how rereading back to the first sentence and paragraph to how the lunar lunar orbiter was something that they use to actually discover the water do you see the difference between that in the microscope ",honestly not totally like i got back maybe they used both but i don't really see why it's not the microscope 
210.3,Oliver,,ok so the if you read on in the second paragraph it talks about how the craters were in deposits of ice and ice is really hard to get through right so the water wasn't just clear and streaming and flowing so the ice is something they needed to get through to get to the water get through the crater to get to the water in the ice so do you think they would use a microscope to get through these tough exteriors do you think that would be the best equipment that they used to specifically find the water ,um no i guess before you use a microscope you probably need something else 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah so what do you remember what it's called with right back into paragraph two ,oh yeah um i will i will answer yeah a lunar orbiter 
150.1,Farrah,,is that making sense to you student as well ,yeah yeah i understand it better now 
150.1,Chris,,awesome student you have a hand up ,yeah well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.4,Luis,,mm hmm exactly they use all that equipment to to just be able to be on the moon in general so that was helpful for them to be able to be there and then the lunar orbiter was something that they specifically used to discover that water the lunar orbiter is what they use to get through that hard exterior to find the water the keywords in the question where to discover the water what did they use in that one that one tool student how are you doing because i know you mentioned the oxygen tanks as well ,i yeah that is what i had also said yes 
210.2,Luis,,do you understand now how it's more of the lunar order that they use to discover the water that were discovered was the keyword we were looking at ,i mean that sounds like a pretty good answer i mean i think also chris's answer i mean with all the oxygen tanks and stuff that was pretty good because like on youtube they show how the astronauts like train with their oxygen tanks and in the old the zero gravity chambers and oh yeah 
110.3,Luis,,you do know a lot about space ,yeah i i'm kind of space expert on which is why i picked oxygen tanks that's my answer 
420.2,Oliver,,yeah just that was kind of from your prior knowledge yep so now we know to look you can use your prior knowledge and use what's in the article to answer those specific questions yes deb you have a hand up ,yeah well it's it's time for us to go but i wanted to say thank you for really helping us understand what it meant to discover the water and not just like find it or i mean look for it yeah that was a really helpful explanation 
420.2,Farrah,,glad that i could help you class will have a great lunch hello ,hi 
420.2,Farrah,,class can see me and everything ,yeah yeah we can see you just fine 
420.2,Luis,,awesome so we're going to look at the second question and the question just to reiterate was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable so they they said right in the question convincing evidence that means we're going to use right we're going to use writing right from the text to make sure we support our answers so if we say no there's something in the text that will support a no answer and if we say yes there will be something in the texts for a yes answer does class want to talk about their response first yes student i do i do i do go for it ,yeah well actually i just wanted to remind you that my dad as actually an astronaut 
120.4,Luis,,so cool you know lots of books space right yes you're going to help us out maybe the article can teach you a couple things to that'd be pretty cool expand your knowledge do you want to talk about your answer student ,um yeah yeah i can talk about my answer um so my answer is i'm water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
230.2,Luis,,awesome and i see you got that from the second sentence and paragraph five is that correct ,i am i sure did 
210.4,Luis,,good so can let's see it can be water can be broken down into two parts the hydrogen in the oxygen can you read the next sentence and tell us why is that important that it can be broken down into two parts because now we have this hydrogen and oxygen why does that matter though to keep reading and see if you can find anything else ,okay the next sentence says astronauts could breathe the oxygen 
210.4,Luis,,there you go and is breathing important ,yeah not being asleep 
120.4,Jazmin,,you see right especially when you're in space when there is an oxygen it's great you could get the water right there split it up and have oxygen to breathe so there you go student so we'll just add that little part to your response to make sure it's nice and clear on why it's important that the water can be broken down into those two parts thank you for sharing class else want to talk discuss their answer yes student ,um so i was thinking you could use water to grow things and we can have a moon garden a garden on the moon 
140.1,Jazmin,,that's i love that answer do you like to garden yourself student ,yes i love to garden and i love to be in nature 
230.2,Jazmin,,well that's awesome so i'm sure that'd be something you'd be really interested in learning about i do have a question for you is there anything about using the water for growing things on the moon in the article do you remember or are you kind of just thinking of things that we do with water on earth ,when we look back at it well no i guess they don't talk about a garden but because there's water that's something you can use water for 
210.4,Jazmin,,what else do we use water for that talks about in paragraph four ,drinking 
210.4,Jazmin,,drinking water is important right do we need that to survive ,yeah 
210.4,Chris,,we do right so if the water is already there the astronauts don't even need to worry about bringing as much or storing as much on their spacecraft they'll happen they'll know it's there do you see how we could use that information so then they maybe they can stay longer and do other things such as grow gardens there are just explore and see what else they can find so that's awesome oh student and you have your hand ,oh yeah because what you just said was a lot like my answer my answer is well water is so heavy so it's good that they wouldn't have to carry it on the ships anymore they could just get on the moon 
230.3,Chris,,right and that's a great answer because i see you got your information right from the article that water is heavy and it takes up a lot of space what i just the only thing your answer is great because it's right from the text and it's saying why having water up there is important What that water is used for for the astronauts. so we know you told us it's good that they can have it with them and they don't have to bring as much so the astronauts can what with it ,they can drink it 
530.1,Oliver,,right mm hmm so that's all you would have to add to your answers just that you can have more of its supply to you so they can drink it awesome student and student i see that you had originally thought maybe the water isn't going to be that useful do you see any ways that your mind is kind of changing are you thinking differently now that you're hearing from your other friends and your class ,no no i'm not thinking differently because here you got look at this and in the text and part six that's where i got my answer because part six says if they're gonna use a moon water they need a plan to like got the moon water and that's going to take time and money so it's not like tomorrow they can just call up a moan and bring a water it's like they have to spend all this money to do that and that's going to take for ever 
210.3,Oliver,,you're not wrong and i didn't even think of it that way so i'm glad you brought this point up because it does say that it's going to take a lot of time and money to see if they could do these things but our question was kind of asking more broadly in general is there possibility our question is asking if the water on the moon could be valuable so thinking about it that way if there's not think taking the logistics out of it and all the specifics that they've stated in the last paragraph taking all that out of it do you think there are valuable ways we could use the moon water for astronauts and whatnot ,i will show like the whole drinking water thing on the whole like breathing yeah um so that's really important but i guess i thought the question was just asking like if i thought it was a good idea like i convinced that we should i'm like all spend time on the water on the moon and so i wasn't convinced 
210.4,Oliver,,right so you weren't convinced but the question listen to the word and is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable so thinking about such as using the water for oxygen is there evidence that we can break down water into oxygen and hydrogen into two parts ,yeah that's science so yeah 
210.4,Oliver,,right so that there's some evidence behind that and we breathe in oxygen there's evidence of that correct ,definitely 
120.4,Farrah,,so those are things we all have our own opinions but those are things that you can prove to be true that the water could be used for student do you have anything else to add ,well so this is so fun and interesting but we have to go to lunch i'm really sorry but thank you so much for letting all of us express our ideas on this question because i had the same as student but i think my classmates convinced me that there's some some cool things you could use the water for and it was just really cool to listen to class so letting us do that 
120.4,Farrah,,of course i'm glad you could learn from your classmates and class can have a nice lunch now it's nice to be with you class ,yeah bye 
120.4,Farrah,,bye hello class i'm your teacher oh ,hi miss carpenter it's good to see you today 
150.1,Farrah,,wonderful i'm glad you're all here did you all read the assignment that i send out to you about finding water on the moon ,yes we did 
220.1,Luis,,very good so we are going to talk about the tool that scientists use to discover water on the moon yes student ,excuse me x shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
140.1,Luis,,you know all about space really where did you learn about space was it from a book or do you get to go to a museum ,oh well i like to watch a lot of videos like on youtube so i look at a lot of stuff on the internet like videos and learning about astronauts and watching launches of rocket oh it's so cool 
110.3,Luis,,i'm sure it is i hope that you'll be able to use some of that knowledge that know to talk about this exciting discovery of finding water on the moon ,yeah yeah okay 
150.1,Luis,,alright so i would like all five of you to take your papers out and have it in front of you because we're going to be using highlighters and the pages to find information within the text can you all do that ,um well actually our story it's on our tablet right in front of us so we can see it there 
150.1,Luis,,wonderful i'm glad that you have it in front of you and if you have a highlighting tool or an underlying tool that would be very useful to you as we go through ,yeah we have those too 
120.4,Chris,,wonderful alright so we have three different many paragraphs at the top can i please have someone be volunteer to tell me what they think the main idea is for the main point of the first paragraph is s student thank you so much you're very brave to go first it's always a bit of a challenge so well done ,well i think the main point of part one is that it tells us that scientists actually found craters full of water on the moon 
120.4,Farrah,,very good very good um so can you go or can you turn and asked help from a friend the textual evidence that says the scientists found water on the moon and when you found that and underlined it whoever finds it first can raise their hand and read back to me the exact words in that first point the talks about scientists mining water on the moon and we'll see if we agree with student right right who's ready to share thank you ,well i don't i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
430.2,Farrah,,this isn't necessarily every single person who ever had to sit down with the teacher again sometime's your answers not wrong absolutely completely right but we want to explore a little bit further maybe there's more to the story than just what you gave in your answer and we want to go a little bit further we want to dig a little bit deeper ,yeah that sounds cool wd can do that yeah 
230.2,Farrah,,right what's what's the textual evidence to support chris's claim with the main idea of the first paragraph is that scientists found lots of water on the moon ,it says that like in the first sentence they found evidence that there's water deep in the polar craters but student i don't know if it's like full of water but um it's in the craters 
210.4,Jazmin,,very good so we do we all agree that the main point of the first paragraph is that there's water in craters on the moon i'm seeing some nods well done all right let's move on to the second paragraph class can review it in front of them and then when you're ready raise your hand and tell me what you think the main idea is in the second paragraph yes student ,i think the main point of part two paragraph two is like that nasa sent a small machine 
230.1,Jazmin,,mm hmm very good can you elaborate on that does it say what the name of the small machine is ,nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter lunar orbiter 
130.2,Chris,,thank you so much all right who agrees with student or student do you have something to say ,yeah so i went to nasa and i saw that the scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all sorts of stuff like that 
210.3,Chris,,that's really really cool do you think that nasa used astronauts suits in oxygen when they sent a machine to the moon ,oh well if there were astronauts there soon yeah but maybe like you said doesn't let's say there were astronauts i 
120.4,Oliver,,yeah i think i agree with you if there were astronauts they would they would have to be astronaut suits and oxygen tanks so i think that you're right student nasa does use a lot of different tools when it's exploring space can you find the sentence that student just talked about when it talks specifically about the lunar orbiter and please underline it or highlight it in your tablet that goes for all of you right give me a raised hand to show me that you are done highlighting the main point in the second paragraph thank you all right who's ready to move on to the third paragraph student go ahead ,oh i'm so sorry but i just looked at the clock and actually it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us go through a loop story and look for the main points because that's really helpful for us we're looking for the answers for the questions so thank you so much for introducing that to us because i know we'll use it next time 
120.4,Oliver,,thank you and ,thank you 
120.4,Farrah,,good job taking a keeping an eye on the clock sometimes teachers forget about that start simulation whoa good morning class ,hi how are you today 
150.1,Luis,,doing good thank you for asking so you all read a passage about discovering water on the moon is that correct ,yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
420.2,Chris,,but you can certainly help even with your background knowledge i can tell you have a lot of background information on space based on your answer but we're all here together to try to dive deeper into this text to find more specific answers to our question all together we're going to go back to the question and almost all of you i'm going to ask you to really re examine the questions that you're asked about what equipment to the scientists use to discover water on the moon and together we're going to come up with a really good answer that uses all of your really great answers we're going to come together we're going to make a much better one student and student i see that you have identified a tool used by the scientists to see things that are very small so i see student and student had the same answer and i'm going to give all of you some targeted feedback to help you work on re answering this question when you go back i want you both to reread the question to ask yourselves what kind of equipment is the question asking about what was the equipment used for where could you find that information in the text student you identified the main idea of this passage very good go back to the question and reread it please pay attention to the first half of the question and make a note of what kind of answer it's looking for think about restating the question in your answer if you get stuck and you can't come up with something or always feel free to raise your hand if you're stuck need a little bit more help student ,okay 
420.2,Jazmin,,"Yes, Jazmin. Yeah. ",i was gonna say i don't understand why my answers wrong 
420.1,Luis,,your answer isn't wrong student i want you to expand your answer i want you to make it more detailed please be more specific than just a small machine ask yourself if someone hadn't read the passage that you read could they learn that information from your answer you have a lot of background knowledge on this subject so i want you to go back to the question and identify what kind of equipment the question is asking about what did the scientists use the equipment to do and look for an action word in the question ,okay action word and question here we go 
210.2,Farrah,,it'll be a verb yes ,okay i'm feeling a little confused so you said to go back and look at the question and think about what the question was asking right 
210.2,Farrah,,indeed specifically what kind of equipment is the question asking ,okay so well it's asking for equipment that they use to find the water on the moon and so on well i said it was the microscope because if the water is so tiny that on in order to find it you need a microscope to see it 
230.3,Chris,,"From using a microscope to seem small microscopic bits of water. Yes, Chris. ",okay can do yeah so you told me to think about what or something about the question what did you say 
230.3,Chris,,please try to ,Yeah I did that. mm hmm and the the answer needs to be equipment and so well i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.3,Chris,,very good does any of that equipment that you listed do you think that that equipment would be useful for finding water on the moon ,well i mean if there's astronauts there they definitely need those things 
150.1,Chris,,they need things to even be in space i understand try to expand your knowledge about equipments that's astronauts might use they use things beyond suits and oxygen tanks as well there is some equipment in this passage that maybe you've never encountered before and you might discover yet another thing that's that astronauts us ,okay yeah i'll look for all look for some new stuff 
150.1,Jazmin,,yes student ,okay so you asked me to expand my answer and so while my answer was nasa send a small machine and so i found some more info it says nasa scientists machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and the lunar orbiter when land at the moon south pole and look for the ice to process 
310.1,Farrah,,that is very very very good student and i what i like about that is if i didn't know anything about this topic of finding water on the moon and i had never read this passage i could learn how the astronauts discovered water on the moon from your answer yes student ,so it's time for us to go but i wanted to say thank you for giving each one of us a different thing that we needed to do to help improve our answer instead of just like telling us all to do the same thing because that helped us know that you really read our answers and knew how to help each one of us individually 
310.1,Farrah,,thank you very much student thank you hello class nice to see you again ,all right yeah good to see you i can tell 
150.1,Luis,,very good so we are going to do some discussion of your answers to the second question that was posed to all of you and one thing that i want to tell all of you class about this question yes student ,um i just want to remind do my dad as actually an astronaut 
120.4,Chris,,that's really awesome student i hope that after today's discussion you can go home and you can talk to him about some of the ideas that we come up with in our discussion about water on the moon so one of the things that i'm going to i'm going to mention about this kind of question about whether or not you think that there if there is convincing evidence that water on the moon might be valuable this is a a question that asked for your opinion so people might have different opinions but all opinions need to be based all these opinions and to be based on evidence in the text so we might disagree with each other some of us for all going to rely on the actual text that we have in front of us to inform our answers and inform our opinions that's okay if you disagree with each other i'm going to start with student right there in the middle can you tell me what your answer to the question was remind me please ,yeah okay so i said water is heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore 
230.2,Chris,,and can you point out some evidence for the texts that tells you that astronauts will be able to not go into space with water on spaceships anymore ,yeah i think i found it oh oh yeah okay it's here on portal where it says water is heavy it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft 
230.2,Chris,,very good could you saying is there anything more that the text says about water and how heavy it is ,having water vailable on the moon would leave more room on the spacecraft for people and things 
230.2,Chris,,very good so do you find this to be compelling evidence that the water would be valuable ,oh yeah yeah i think that's important that they it's really heavy and so they could make the spacecraft's lighter or maybe bring other other equipment that's um that's important to 
310.1,Jazmin,,student what i really like what you just did there was that you started with an idea and then you came up with some of your own thoughts your own thought of maybe if they didn't have to carry heavy water they could carry other things as well i like that you expanded your thinking yes student ,so you can use water to grow things so we could have an moon garden on the moon 
230.1,Jazmin,,could you tell me more about where you think we could have a moon garden or expand on that idea a little bit more i want to i want to see what you've imagined in your head ,yeah well if there's water you need water to have plants like you they could grow food and they could make them really beautiful and so if there was water i think that's an opportunity that they would have to use the water 
120.4,Luis,,was very nice answer student thank you all right student can you tell me what your answer was to the question ,yep sure can okay water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
230.1,Luis,,excellent and how does that make the water on the moon valuable to astronauts ,i can't remember it sounds pretty cool 
230.2,Luis,,does i'm pretty cool if you go back to the text and you reread the part of the tax the toxin that talks about that gives you that information about hydrogen oxygen being used for fuel is there anything around it that lets you know why that would be useful to astronauts ,oh yeah okay oh this is why this is why i picked this okay um it says oxygen and hydrogen could be used for rocket fuel 
420.2,Oliver,,and i see how we've made the link between using the water to make hydrogen fuel and oxygen into something that the astronauts use very good The reason I asked Chris Jazmin and Luis for their opinions first was because I wanted you to see what it looks like to give supporting evidence from the text. What I want both of you to work on is you absolutely your answer is your opinion. ,Okay. well um so i said um it's not ready yet and it did say that it did say that on the story 
230.2,Oliver,,did can you tell me where it is in story i believe you i just i just need the actual text please ,oh okay so um and the last part it says i'm making a plan will take a lot of time and money like you can just go to the moon today and drink this water or anything because it's not ready yet and so i don't think it's that valuable because they need to spend all this time and money to make it to make it valuable 
230.3,Oliver,,hmm and are you are you thinking that because it's going to take a lot of money that the amount of money that we put into invest in this we won't get returns ,on yeah well cuz that's another meaning of the word value like money um so i don't think i don't think they should spend all their money on that because remember there's not even that much water there's like four cups you can't drink at that there's not there's not a lot 
420.2,Oliver,,student i love how you have said things that you've learned from the text to support your answer and that it would take a lot of money and investment to even use what water there is on the moon so i when i tell you to go back and finish up your work please use that evidence to support your answer ,before you before you talk to them and i'm so sorry it's time for us to go to lunch actually but i just wanted to say this was a really cool discussion because we got to hear so many different ideas and class had ideas that that had evidence to go with it and so that was really cool to see and hear their answers and their evidence so thank you so much 
420.2,Farrah,,thank you okay ,hi how are you 
420.2,Farrah,,i'm doing well how are you ,we're good we're so excited for your class 
120.2,Luis,,great i'm excited to be here so you all have some really great answers but i want to dig into them a little further so let's go ahead and start digging into what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon yes student ,yeah okay excuse me i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,well i'm glad you have an interest in space and i'm glad that you know what but maybe you can contribute a little bit of your knowledge to the rest of the class so you might find some use there ,okay yeah that sounds great i'd love to do that 
120.4,Farrah,,great are there any other questions okay so we've all had some responses and i want to talk about them a little bit more does class want to volunteer to go ahead and go first ,yeah okay i can go 
120.4,Farrah,,okay go ahead ,okay so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.3,Oliver,,yes okay microscopes are really helpful for letting us see things up close and i think someone else circled the same answer as you ,that was yeah that was me yeah i saw the same thing as student 
230.1,Oliver,,either you can explain why did you circle that ,yeah i can say that so well it's right there in the text and i know we have to find something in the text and well that is a scientific tool it's equipment and we know we need equipment for the answer to the question 
130.2,Jazmin,,that's a really good reason we do need to talk about the equipment in the text did class else have any other ideas yes go ahead ,i had a different answer and i said nasa send a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.1,Jazmin,,so could you walk me through your answer a little bit explain your reasoning behind it ,oh yes okay well it's it's right there in part two and it says that nasa send a small machine and it its job was to look in that in the craters at the ice deposits and i think that means that that's how they found the water 
130.2,Luis,,so yes they did use some equipment to go to the moon but let's focus in on the other bit of what did they use to discover water on the moon student i know you had eaten and sorry i know you had some expertise would you like to share does class want to jump in ,oh yeah definitely well the thing is scientists can use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks too 
120.4,Chris,,right they do so i think we have one more person we haven't heard from yet would you like to go ahead ,okay yeah well my answer is scientists found careers full of water on the moon 
210.4,Chris,,right okay good so i like all of your answers you all really clearly worked with the text to get to where you are let's talk about specifically what equipment they use to discover water especially can we go back to the text and look at a place where it mentions discovering water ,okay yeah do you want us to reread it 
120.4,Jazmin,,yes just take a second and reread it and see maybe if there's another clue in the text that can help us discover this okay class find any interesting clues yes go ahead ,yes okay well i i still think i still think that it's a small machine because in that part it says that they used it to investigate and that that word reminds me of discover so i still think that's the small machine 
130.2,Chris,,okay so you still think that that class else that has class else's opinion stayed the same or have they changed yes go ahead ,well okay so here's the thing um i went to nasa and so when i was reading this it made me think i know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.2,Chris,,yes good i'm glad you were able to connect to prior experience to that so how does that relate to what we're talking about in the text did you see anything in the text about things that they use ,oh oh well no i guess it's just when i read it it reminded me of going to nasa and i know that we have to say it whitman and so it made me think of that appointment 
130.2,Farrah,,good i will i am glad that you're able to think about another experience that helps you relate to the text does class else have any difference of opinions were anything else that they discovered what rereading the text yes go ahead ,okay well i'm i'm getting a little confused because i said the microscope and when i looked back at the text it says the water is microscopic and so and so i'm thinking how can you discover something if you can't see it don't you need to see it through the microscope if you're going to discover it 
310.1,Oliver,,and you've all had some really good answers and i can see you're working really hard that is also a really good point so let's go back to our prompt and want class to look at and see what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon but let's go and see if we can find anything specifically related i think you're all on a really good path but we're not quite there yet let's look at paragraph two where nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter books for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small so i can see where you would say microscope ,oh yeah i'm so sorry i just looked at the clock and and we have to go to lunch and i'm really bummed because i feel like we're just getting to the park but i just wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to all of her answers and and letting us know that you you could see why we got those answers on that really that really helped us feel good about our answers thank you so much 
150.1,Luis,,thank you okay thank you hi my friends all of you have done an excellent job and i know that you all are great thinkers i think that we can work a little bit harder to make your answers the absolute best you can do you have a question ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,you do student you absolutely do and your answer was so good that i think we can make it even better are you willing to be flexible and think with me ,um yeah okay 
150.1,Farrah,,awesome i'm very excited so i've read all your responses ,"Some, some time in English class. Yes, please do. "
110.2,Farrah,,okay so it says we're entering question one question one is about the equipment okay so this sentence starter says the scientists used and then there's a line blank so this is where you would put the equipment that they used to discover that water is on the moon i found my answer in paragraph blank and this is where you're going to put the number there's a number at the side of the paragraphs and i want to know exactly where you found your answer okay does that make sense yes okay so well i start with student i want my friends i want you to start thinking about changing the wording of your answer okay just try your best that's all that matters okay so student after i read your answer and your answer is wonderful you answered part of the question you found the equipment that they used right that ,yeah 
210.4,Farrah,,So I was hoping that maybe in your brain and your head quietly right now. Is there any way that you could reread paragraphs one and two. Actually let's start with just paragraph two. can you reread paragraph two for me and see if you can find any other answers ,like out loud or just on my own 
420.2,Farrah,,um you can do it on your own okay and i want you to start working on the sentence starter okay do you need me to read that to you ,know i just little confused because i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
110.2,Farrah,,so severe that your answer isn't exactly wrong sometimes we just need help explaining but i just need you to write down where you found your answer so your answer is correct and you did a great job with your thinking Exactly. ,that makes a lot of sense 
420.2,Farrah,,your answer at the top is correct you did find the equipment but then i want you to tell me where you find the evidence okay great i'm glad i'm so glad so if you could fill out this sentence starter for me ,okay i'll work on that 
110.1,Oliver,,i love it great job student okay student how are you doing ,good i'm doing well i can try that sentence starter if you want 
120.4,Oliver,,do you have something for me yeah ,okay it's on scientists to use a microscope to discover water on the moon and i found my answer in paragraph three 
110.2,Oliver,,student you did an amazing job with that sentence starter ,thanks 
310.1,Oliver,,great job student i loved the way that you are flexible and change your thinking that made your answers so much better and i wanted to say student i loved in your first answer that you agreed with student because that means that you're listening to your friends thinking ,yeah well i just said what i said before because like something i don't want first like if i had gone first i would have said microscope but she had already saw that so i just said what i saw 
110.1,Chris,,totally great job thank you that was awesome um student can i check in with you ,yeah okay 
150.1,Chris,,how's it going ,well i'm sure because because i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
140.1,Chris,,person you are so passionate about space do you want to be an astronaut when you're older ,that would be pretty cool yeah 
220.1,Chris,,that would be really cool so student we're working on reading informational texts and the reason that we're doing this is so that you can start to learn how to write about informational texts i know that you know about space ,"Oh, so like the equipment has to be like in the story. "
120.1,Chris,,yes great great i'm sorry if that was a little confusing for you but yes does that make a little more sense so well i check in with student do you think that you could work on that a little bit ,yeah oh look oh look in the story again 
120.3,Jazmin,,but i am so glad that you are passionate about this subject that's going to help us yeah maybe reread it once or twice just to see okay okay student how are you doing good ,i i'm ready with my answer 
120.4,Jazmin,,you ready okay let me hear it ,scientists used a small machine to discover the water and i found the answer in paragraph two 
210.3,Jazmin,,i love it student that is a great answer and thank you so much for using that sentence starter um so your answer to your answer is correct right but someone who didn't read this text might not know what a small machine is because a small machine could be anything it could be it could be a computer later right ,yeah right 
420.2,Jazmin,,so your answer is right but i think that we should add a little bit more detail and describe is there maybe an adjective or a name of that small machine that we could use ,oh oh it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
420.2,Oliver,,love it so student if you could rewrite your answer and maybe use that name that would be super helpful hey oliveron do you have a question ,yeah actually are just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to say thank you so much that sentence starter was so helpful and you really took you took the time to listen to every single one of us our answers and you just made us feel like like we've done a really good job and you helped us make our answers better to 
420.2,Farrah,,i'm so glad it was great to meet you hi friends oh ,hi it's nice to see you 
150.1,Luis,,nice to see you too so today we can do something really fun in this small class we're going to be reading detectives okay so i need us all cool detective hats and we're going to be looking in the text for answers okay student do you have a question ,yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,student you're totally right you know so much in your brain about space so today we're going to be reading detectives And look for those answers in the text connecting the information in your brain is also going to help you a lot but i just want to make sure that you're getting the best answer you can is that okay ,yeah i mean that sounds kind of fun 
210.2,Oliver,,yeah this is going to be a lot of fun so i first want to go over the question the question that was asked was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon can somebody tell me what this question is looking for ,yeah so the question is looking for a piece of equipment that's what the answer needs to be 
210.2,Oliver,,yeah now student can i challenge your thinking what is what is equipment mean do you do you know ,equipment is like something you use so could be like a tool or something 
210.2,Jazmin,,yeah okay great great job okay so again where are we going to look for the answer are we going to look around the classroom are we going to look to our friend where do you think we can find our answer student ,we have to look in this story 
130.2,Luis,,yeah for sure okay so i'm going to go around one in one and talk to each individually and while i'm doing that i would like you to maybe reread the question and then reread the text see if or review your answer and see if your answer actually answers the question okay okay so i'm going to start with student actually student and student i think we're going to work together student are you are you with me ,yeah 
310.1,Farrah,,okay so both of you found your answers somewhere in the text you were it was clear that you read the text and i really love that you were looking at the text you definitely read it or at least looked at it which is great ,Yeah I said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. I don't understand why that answers wrong. 
210.4,Farrah,,i'm concerned about the way that you worded your answer student so the way that you worded your answer didn't really restate the question who was doing the discovery in the question ,um the scientists Yeah. so the scientists need a tool called on microscope 
210.2,Farrah,,well they used right so the question was what equipment did scientists use ,"Um, so the scientists used a scientific tool called a microscope "
130.1,Farrah,,Yes. So that is one part of the one part of the answer. ,okay you want to have reread it Okay. 
110.3,Luis,,awesome job student thank you so student you definitely have knowledge on this subject ,oh yeah i know everything about space i watch all the videos on youtube all about space i pretty much know everything there is to know 
210.4,Luis,,"i mean that is going to really be helpful were you listening when i was talking to student early earlier right we have this knowledge in our brain and then we have this stuff on the text And the answer, you'll find is in the text. do you think you could try to read the question and maybe look at the text ",yeah so the question is what equipment that scientists do stuff discover water on the moon 
210.4,Luis,,yes in this story that we read ,in the story on oh okay i should probably really read it 
210.4,Chris,,totally because if if you ever get a question which might happen again and other classes or places you a question and there's a text there the text is probably very important okay ,okay yeah so this is kind of like what student said but i went to nasa actually so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
430.2,Chris,,totally and and that's very helpful but i do want us to practice being that reading detective right so i want you to find your answer in the text because i want us to practice that skill is that ok with you ,yeah i guess i can do that 
430.2,Oliver,,great okay you work and then i'll come back to you okay hey student can i talk to you for a minute ,yep 
410.2,Oliver,,Sometimes we're then talking and I think it's incredible that you listened to her answer and you agreed with her. That's a really great skill. i am concerned because you didn't really rephrase anything you just said i circled the same as savanna's that doesn't help me know if you understand the question or the answer ,"Oh yeah. Well, I mean, I only said that because Farrah one but for me and like if I had gone. First I want to set it, but she went first. So if I had been first I would have said that the tool is a microscope. "
130.1,Oliver,,okay so there is another tool in there ,"Um, I would really like to. But actually, we have to go. All right, so, um, thank you so much for making us detectives that was really kind of made looking at the text and searching for answers, I'm seem really cool. "
130.1,Farrah,,i'm so glad i'm glad you had fun hi class ,hi 
220.1,Luis,,hey so today we're going to do something super cool we are going to be reading detectives okay so that means when we get a question about the text we are going to answer it by looking in the text okay student do question ,yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
220.1,Luis,,you know what you think i have learned that about you and it's something i value about you but i want us to work on the skill of answering questions by finding the answers and attacks but i think that background knowledge that you have inside your brain is going to be a huge help because when we read informational texts this year you're going to need that skills okay okay ,well yeah 
150.1,Luis,,but while i do that i was hoping that maybe you could reread your answer think in your brain what made you answer that why why did you answer it like that and see if your answer is in the text okay okay so my friends i'm going to go around one in one and talk to each one of you are you ready to be a reading detective ,and protective caps on here we go 
150.1,Luis,,awesome student i love it you know what student i'm going to start with you is that okay ,oh yeah of course 
230.1,Luis,,well first student before i became um what made you think that was the correct answer when you read the question what relied talk me through it ,okay so it said what equipment to the scientists use to the spot or the water on the moon and so if there are scientists and they're all my own that gonna need i need a lot of things but they're definitely gonna need oxygen tanks yeah they need to breathe when they're out there looking for the water 
430.3,Luis,,yeah absolutely and even i value all that information inside your brain and never lose that passion for space because it's amazing but i am a little bit concerned that you didn't find that answer in the text i want to suggest maybe you could go back and read the text again looking for the specific answer that you need do you want to try that ,um yeah i guess i probably be good if i read it 
150.1,Luis,,and you know what that might add to that information that's in your brain you might learn something new ,okay yeah good for him 
150.1,Luis,,okay awesome get started student actually can i ask you a question ,he yeah 
150.1,Luis,,what has what i'm actually go ahead you're fine did you start okay ,okay 
150.1,Jazmin,,student can i talk to you for a minute ,um yes i'm ready 
230.1,Jazmin,,awesome okay it's student so i was wondering what can you talk me through your answer ,yeah so i said nasa sent a small machine and i i don't understand why that's wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,totally totally and i completely understand that so i love that you answered the question because your question is if i had to say your question was wrong your question was right or your question was spectacular a plus i'm going to say your question was right so i'm a little bit concerned that you didn't use a lot of detail so that's like okay you know but i want your question your answer to be spectacular i was wondering can you describe the machine at all are there any adjectives in the texts that describe the machine ,oh well it says that the machine is small 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay small that works does the machine have a name ,yet it's called the lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposit in the polar craters 
420.2,Jazmin,,because if i was somebody that didn't read the text i could think of small machine was anything right oh my goodness student you just answered my next question my next question was going to be what does the machine do could you add a little bit more detail into your answer ,"yeah oh okay so i should say i should say that in my answer should i should say lunar orbiter And what that week, my answer. That's spectacular. "
210.3,Oliver,,that would make your answer spectacular yeah awesome great job student okay um student can i talk to you for a minute ,oh yeah uh huh 
430.3,Oliver,,"I am a little concerned that you didn't put it in your own words, because I don't know if you understood it, right. So I was wondering, is there any way that you could put the answer in your own words. ",no of course of course yeah i read it i hope you wrote that i love the text on my answer is that the tool is a microscope 
210.3,Oliver,,yes but i'm going to challenge you for a minute can i challenge you as a detective ,yeah 
210.4,Oliver,,okay there's actually another piece of equipment in there could you maybe look at that piece of equipment too just so i know that you can find an answer in a text ,and another one the microscope that's not it 
130.1,Oliver,,the microscope is a tool that they use but i think there's a more more important piece of equipment that they use ,oh okay i need to look for that because i thought a microscope and that's pretty important water's so small you need to see it 
210.3,Oliver,,totally know it's it is important but i would like you to look for the other one too okay ,yeah okay 
230.1,Chris,,okay great job student so student can you talk me through your answer really quick ,actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say i know this time you didn't get to hear my answer but i heard class else and i know that you made class feel like their answer was really important and you understood why they said it but also you can help them make their answer spectacular and that that sounds really important 
230.1,Farrah,,thank you student have a great lunch ,oh thank you hi hello 
230.1,Farrah,,hi i'm mr teacher it's nice to meet you all how's class doing ,i'm mr stephen it's nice to meet you were doing good today 
150.1,Luis,,so can class tell me what you class were just reading about student ,yeah so i'm sorry sorry um we were just reading about the water the water on the moon and i shouldn't be in this class because i already know all about space 
150.1,Chris,,okay so can class add on to what you just said can class tell me what this article was about ,yeah i can 
150.1,Chris,,tell me what was this article about ,well it was about how they found water the phone craters are full of water on the moon 
110.1,Jazmin,,can class explain how they did that thank you for that information student ,yeah i can add this is student 
130.2,Jazmin,,student add on ,well to find the water nasa send a small machine 
210.4,Luis,,whoo does class know what that machine is called ,oh yeah i know this i know this event um it's the lunar orbiter it says that reading the story itself lunar orbiter mm hmm yeah student that's the name of it it's all lunar orbiter 
150.1,Oliver,,"Thank you, Luis. Luis That was a really strong answer and I like how you reference the text, you said it's called the lunar orbiter because it says so right inside the text. does class else want to add anything else interesting that they weren't from this article student ",well i learned that the water it's really really small it's so small because you need a microscope to see and yeah that was my answer that you need a microscope 
150.1,Farrah,,interesting thank you for that answer student yes so they used a lunar orbiter to discover the water and then they used a microscope in order to be able to see it closer since it was so small thank you both for adding those strong answers from the text does class else want to add anything else while we have a few minutes left student ,um well i also sent them microscope like student and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
130.2,Farrah,,does class want to help student make answer stronger ,um i can do it i can do it i'm like you should have said i'm lunar orbiter because that's it that's what they said but but the text also talks about student it talks about the microscope to so you just i came not going to just change my answer as it talks about the microscope 
130.2,Jazmin,,what do people think do people think that scientists use the microscope to discover water do people think it was the lunar orbiter do you agree or disagree yeah ,i think that's a microscope it says it says no said also machine how the lunar orbiter to investigate so which one is it 
130.2,Chris,,so student and student think that it was the microscope in student and student both think it was the lunar orbiter student what do you think do you agree with student endeavor do you agree with student and student why ,well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.1,Chris,,well student who do you agree with ,um well 
130.2,Chris,,do you thin they used the microscope do you think that they used the lunar orbiter why or why not ,well maybe maybe both 
230.1,Chris,,why do you think that ,well because i got some little story they say you need the lunar orbiter to investigate like student and student set but i guess also i mean if the water so small like student and student said then you need a microscope because how can you how can you discover it if you can't see it 
130.2,Luis,,interesting so student is saying that you class are both right that they use the microscope and the lunar orbiter what do you class think what do you class think the answer is then ,i have a question 
130.2,Luis,,go for it ,i don't think of microscope is right you class you class i don't think it's right because i think that in the lunar orbiter there weren't even astronauts there weren't even astronauts there right it was just the lunar orbiter like like an unmanned craft and so they wouldn't eat up microscope if there are like you know as a righty 
130.2,Luis,,um what do you class think about what student said do you agree with her thinking do you disagree with her thinking why oh ,i'm sorry that was student i should have raised my hand 
130.2,Chris,,student make sure that we're raising her hand what do we think ,i think oh sorry it's student i think i think student might be right because well at nasa some of the spaceships they can go without astronauts but if it went with astronauts they probably knew the microscope but maybe they use the microscope like after 
130.2,Oliver,,does class want to add some more detail student thank you for raising your hand ,yeah well actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to say thank you for encouraging us to add more detail and to really listen to and build on each other's answers and talk about which one we thought was right because that really helped us think about what the article said so thank you so much 
130.2,Farrah,,thank you oliverin thank you student student student and student for your participation today have a great lunch ,hi good afternoon 
140.1,Oliver,,good afternoon class how is class doing please raise your hand so the reason student ,oh you just said raised her hand um so i just wanted to say i'm having a really good day 
140.1,Luis,,oh thank you student would class else like to tell us about their day before we move forward student ,yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Chris,,student i'm sure you do and there's always more room for us to learn more about space which is exactly why we're here today i've been reading over your answers and i wanted us to take a second look at this text to see if there's any to see if we can make our responses even better right now i want you class to take one second just give her the text and fake i want you class to take a minute to skim through the text and to think about what you think the main idea of this text was when i say go begin go i can see savannas reading i see olivers reading i see student student and student skimming excellent focus all right who can raise their hand to tell us what the main ideas student what's the main idea of this text ,okay so i think the main idea is that they have found water on the moon and they used to think there wasn't any but now they know because they found it 
120.4,Jazmin,,do we agree or disagree with student why raise your hand and i will go it's student ,okay so um student i agree partly like yes it's definitely about water on the moon but i think it's also about how there's not a lot of water on the moon like it's only on these really small little bits 
130.2,Farrah,,thank you for your connection student and for adding more detail and student thank you for sharing your thinking and for telling us what the text is mostly about would class like to add anything else to what they think the main idea of this text is student ,okay well so this on this connects to a student said student said the waters really small and this also connects to my answer so the scientists they had to use a microscope to find the water you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at it so um i guess i just i don't really understand why my answer is wrong 
150.1,Chris,,student thank you for sharing your answer and connecting with what others have said it seems like you're asking how come you didn't get full credit for your answer is it possible that there's more tools that scientists use to discover water i think that we should all go back in our text to skim for more detail to see if there's more than just the microscope that scientists use when i say go i want you to all reread the text and see if you can find more detail that answers the question what equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon raise your hand if you have questions about what you're supposed to do right now i don't see class raising their hand this means that we understand what we need to do begin reading ,okay so um well i went to nasa so i know that scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.2,Chris,,so student it sounds like you know a lot about equipment that nasa uses i like that you're connecting your background knowledge to help you it's great that you're using your notes to help you further understand this text that's an excellent strategy that good readers use What details in the text or what specific equipment are mentioned in the text that scientists used to discover water Chris. ,so the equipment from the story 
230.2,Chris,,yes equipment from the text ,reach every reader let me look don't remember 
230.2,Jazmin,,student ,i found another piece of equipment in the story additional additional to the microscope and that was actually my answer and it's nasa sent a small machine 
420.3,Jazmin,,whoa okay student it sounds like you're talking about the machine that they used to travel to the moon i like how you took your answer directly from the text it's great to read our answers directly in the text do you know what this machine is called if you're not sure what to do you can always go back in the text to where you found that piece of information and see if maybe they use a specific name ,for that piece of equipment okay yeah so it says on that nasa centers small machine called a lunar orbiter 
210.4,Luis,,can class tell us what this orbiter did someone we haven't heard from yet or someone we haven't heard that much from student ,um yeah it says it student right next on what you said it says that the lunar orbiter investigates and looks for ice and the polar craters 
310.1,Oliver,,student so you're saying that the lunar orbiter investigates polar craters for ice that's a very strong answer because you look in the text and you quoted the text directly ,um excuse me yes student um we we have to go it's time for us to go but i just wanted to say thank you for really directing us to look back in the text and to find our answers in the text that was really helpful 
310.1,Farrah,,thank you student i hope that you class have a great lunch thank you for the questions that you asked i hope that you class think about what it felt like to do this learning experience and i look forward to working with you class again ,hi we're excited to get started 
230.1,Luis,,so i was looking over your responses how did you class arrive that you're thinking student ,um well i just wanted to remind you my dad is actually an astronaut 
430.2,Luis,,student i'm hearing that your dad's an astronaut i'm wondering if that was what helped you come at your answer i like it's good that you are connecting outside information to your answer i'm concerned that you didn't answer the question directly but you provided evidence why don't you go back decide if you think water is valuable or not and whether or not your evidence supports your answer ,okay you want me want me to read it again 
120.2,Chris,,yes student what else do people think is water valuable why or why not student ,okay well um water is heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore 
420.2,Chris,,so student i'm hearing that you think that water is heavy and that they don't have to carry it on the ships which is good because that provides more space that's a strong answer because it's rooted in the text i'm wondering if you can push your thinking further and ask why having more space on a spaceship is good ,"Okay, yeah. Oh, I'll take a look "
520.1,Jazmin,,student i was reading your answer student your answer seemed to be very strong you you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated and that you need then you provided reasoning which is you can't survive without water it's very important to backup your answers with reasoning i'm wondering what you'll do next time you get a question like this to arrive at an answer like this what's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this ,well i i got my answer just from from reading the text and i looked for evidence and another thing i did was i kind of thought about what made water useful so i'm drinking was one thing and another thing that i was thinking is that you could maybe use water to grow things so we could have a garden on the moon 
130.2,Oliver,,i'm hearing that you read the text for details and evidence to help support your thinking And I'm hearing that you have an idea of how you can repeat this answer in the future. I think it might be great if you write down this process in a notebook. did class else use a strategy similar to student or differently to student and how did it help them or how did it yeah how did that help them to do this work student ,um well okay i'm student she said about how she read it and she she thought about it and look for evidence and i think i did something similar but i actually came up with a different opinion so i think part of part of the question was having an opinion 
230.2,Oliver,,so i'm hearing that you use the similar strategy to student and that you clarified that this question is asking you for an opinion it's really good to be able to read a question and it's helpful to be able to read a question and understand what it's specifically asking you to do i'm wondering how is your answer different from student and what evidence did you use to explain how your you got a different answer from student and what evidence you used ,um yeah definitely okay so i said no there is not convincing evidence because i'm though the water isn't ready yet i mean it's not like you could just go to the moon today and i'm drink the water and plant a garden so i wasn't convinced because it said right there and part six it's gonna take a lot of time and money 
230.1,Oliver,,what do you think you would have needed to see from this text to be convinced that it was valuable ,oh i think maybe i'm that 
110.1,Oliver,,student i see your hand will call on you next ,um i think i would be convinced to maybe if it wasn't so hard to get the water and also from the first part if there was more water because it said there's only like four cups that's really not enough for all the astronauts to drink i don't think it's worth all the money 
110.1,Chris,,student ,oh well i just wanted to see i did i did what you asked and i looked for more reasons and i found out that water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
230.1,Chris,,um can you tell me more about this ,um oh okay i'm oxygen and hydrogen could be used as rocket fuel 
430.2,Chris,,you're connecting the details to another part of the text to explain how it could be valuable i'm concerned about whether this is a good thing or a bad thing and why can you tell me if this is good or bad and why ,oh it sounds pretty good to be like i'm extra rocket fuel that's probably really on like necessary when you're flying in space 
230.1,Farrah,,can class tell me how it feels answering these opinion questions student ,oh well i really want to answer but we have to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you because you heard every single one of our answers and also understood where our answers came from and that just made us really feel that you were listening and that you cared about every single one of our answers so thank you so much 
230.1,Farrah,,thank you student for the feedback i really appreciate it and thank you class else ,hi 
150.1,Farrah,,hi yeah it's nice to meet you welcome to reading task water on the moon have you read it ,yeah we've all read it already 
120.2,Luis,,okay so we asked that to answer and test a dependent question the question is what equipment at data centers to use to discover water on the moon oh ,excuse me i should be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,yeah that's great maybe you can help your other classmates in if they have any questions they may ask you it's okay ,yeah that sounds great 
150.1,Luis,,yeah great okay now you can start to read the task now did you have the chance ,we read it we read it already 
120.4,Farrah,,okay so um you can answer the question now ,can i go first 
120.4,Farrah,,yeah please go ahead student please go ahead ,i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
110.1,Farrah,,can you explain to us or is the function of the microscope but let's look at a question again the question is asked what equipment did scientist to use to discover water on the moon um thank you student you are very close ,well the water on the moon the story said it's so small you can't see it 
110.1,Farrah,,yeah and ,so they need to use the microscope so that they can see it so that you could look really closely at it 
150.1,Farrah,,yes great so you know wish and use a microscope to look closely on the water right but we can find the water first and then then we can look at the water closer later do you agree ,oh so before they can use the microscope they have to use something else 
110.4,Farrah,,so maybe you can look at the text closely and find the answer okay yes you are right class else ,can look again yeah 
110.4,Jazmin,,great class else ,yeah 
110.4,Jazmin,,go ahead ,well i said nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,oh you have a problem here can you explain more about the small machine what tell us more about what the machine is i mean what did the scientist call the small machine ,let me see nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
110.4,Jazmin,,great so the small machine is the lunar ,lunar orbiter 
110.4,Jazmin,,yeah your right class else ,so so i just had to say the name and then my answer would be right 
110.4,Chris,,yes you are your right class else yes student go ahead ,my answer was different because i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
210.2,Chris,,yes the scientists found craters full of water on the moon that is the result right now we need to figure out how they find it i mean what equipment or oliverice they are using to discover the water ,oh so i have to say the machine 
210.2,Chris,,right ,what they used so then i guess it's i guess it's the lunar orbiter 
110.4,Chris,,all right the lunor orbiter ,okay so i just have to i have to make sure i i say the equipment okay 
120.4,Oliver,,yes any others student how about you share with us your answer ,yeah well i hope the same answer i'll student about the microscope so i'm still totally sure why that's not right 
210.4,Oliver,,maybe it was through the thing about the questions the scientists used the microscope or to discover water or observing the water left out do you think of which one to ,well i guess it's true observe 
210.2,Oliver,,yeah right but the question is asked her as to find what equipment did the scientists used to discover the water not observing the water ,hey okay okay so they use the lunar orbiter to discover on the microscope to observe 
110.4,Chris,,yes you are right student what's your question ,well i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.2,Luis,,and i think someone else have listen guessing with you student is it you yes i agree with you ,yeah i i also know that because i know a lot about space so i know that they have to use oxygen tanks to yeah i know that 
110.2,Luis,,so can you tell us what to the oxygen tanks used for yeah so i think a lot is a good guessing ,well because there's no oxygen is based on the astronauts would need them or else i couldn't breathe up there they need them to survive 
210.2,Luis,,yes so the oxygen tanks are providing oxygens right um but the question is asking you to find the equipment to discover the water not for the oxygen right ,uh huh uh huh 
120.1,Luis,,yeah so maybe you need to look at a text and more closely and the find the answer ,okay 
150.1,Oliver,,any other questions yes student ,are just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to say thank you so much because you really help those understand that we needed to find not just like any old equipment but the equipment that was used to discover and you helped make that really clear for us so really thank you so much 
150.1,Farrah,,welcome thank you class see you hello boys and girls i'm what i'm going to do today is to introduce you a new strategy together then you are going to practice it and in a small class and i will come to talk to you a little more individually later if you still have some progress okay ,yeah that sounds great 
150.1,Luis,,yeah and now please look at ,excuse me 
150.1,Luis,,go ahead ,um yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,great it look like you're an expert in our class so maybe you can help your classmates to clarify some background knowledge okay ,oh yeah that sounds awesome 
420.1,Oliver,,look at the question again you are going to find keywords or all the most important words in a question before you answer it if you understand what i'm saying please nod your head to let me know pick up a pen or a pencil and i'd like you to circle the words that you think are the most important words in the question ,okay yeah 
420.1,Oliver,,yeah great please remember to circle the most important words that helped you to find a specific place in the passage to answer a question have you done ,yeah i think we're all ready 
210.2,Farrah,,okay so first one off of the keywords that are used to cope class can share ,um yeah i can share 
120.4,Farrah,,yeah go ahead student ,so i thought the keyword the most important word was equipment because that word tells you that you're looking for like a tool for your answer 
420.3,Farrah,,"Now you can use the words you circled ""equipment"" and go back to the middle of the passage and see what specific equipment is listed there. Okay? ",yeah should i tell you my answer 
120.4,Farrah,,yeah you can share ,um so i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Chris,,um yes microscope is a kind of a scientist tool but except for this equipment can you can somebody share what is another word that you found that is also important in the question yes student go ahead ,on so i said water because my answer was scientists found craters full of water on the moon and the whole story is about water 
410.2,Chris,,yeah i really appreciate that you give us a fact from the passage when you answer the question you really gave us the evidence you found in a text the importance of water my concern is you didn't include any equipment in your answer ,yeah i guess no 
210.3,Chris,,yes and because you told me an equipment is the most important words in the answer so what do you think how will you revise your answer to include the equipment ,oh well okay so i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.4,Jazmin,,yes there are a lot of advantages but except for equipment please read the question again do you have other keywords like the action words in a sentence yes student what is your question ,yeah actually maybe i can help student because my word that i picked was discover 
430.2,Jazmin,,discover yes great this the word in the question and this is the action that we are looking for in the passage but my concern is would you look carefully at the passage i think you have targeted the right place in the passage you just need to be a little more specific ,oh okay so well my answer was nasa sent a small machine 
230.3,Chris,,yes and so student do you notice what student just said she said the machine that discovered was a small machine right ,yeah oh yeah that was in part two the small machine 
420.2,Luis,,yes so you class just need to be a little more specific what kind of machine was used to discover water ,oh i remember i remember from the story 
120.4,Luis,,yes student go ahead ,um it said it was a lunar orbiter nasa sent a small machine called lunar orbit are to investigate 
150.1,Farrah,,great so do you notice what student said ,um yeah he he read the whole sentence and so it said the name of the machine 
150.1,Farrah,,yes so the machine is the lunar orbiter do you agree ,yeah yeah that's what it says in the text 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah okay now you can read it yes student ,so it's it's time for us to go now but i just wanted to say thank you for helping us and being so specific which what with them with what each one of us could improve about our response on that really helped each one of us think about what our next steps could be free you can see 
420.1,Luis,,hello boys and girls and what i'm going to do today is to introduce you a new strategy then you are going to practice it in a small class and i will come back to talk a little more individually if you still have some progress okay and if you understand what i'm saying please know that your head to let me know okay now please read the question again you are going to find out the key all important words in a question before you answer it ,um yeah i understand but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,wow great you know a lot about space so you may be an expert in our class so you can help our classmates to clarify their misunderstanding or all the things they want to know okay ,yeah sounds great 
420.1,Farrah,,okay now please read the question again you are going to find out the keywords all the most important words in a sentence to help you best to answer a question pick up a pen or a pencil and circle the words that you think are the most important in a question the words you are going to circle will help you to find out a specific place in the passage to answer a question okay please go and do that alright are you done ,yes yes i think we are finished 
210.3,Farrah,,okay so what was one of the keywords that are you circled student ,oh so the word i picked from the question but i thought was most important was equipment 
210.4,Farrah,,yes great i really appreciate that you are looking carefully at a question perfect that is exactly right and equipment can be some kind of scientific tools and so please go back to the meat of the passage and see what a specific equipment is listed there okay ,okay 
210.3,Oliver,,and class else do want to show you your keywords student how about you ,oh yeah well i picked the same as student because equipment and we also we also have the same answer too we work together a lot and both of us said it was a microscope because that's equipment 
210.3,Oliver,,yes great and i appreciate that you used the evidence from the text but do think microscope is the best answer ,um yeah i do because it's a scientific tool just like it says right there in part three microscope is a scientific tool um yeah so that's aw yeah the keyword 
210.2,Jazmin,,yeah great sometimes we look at the question and if we look at an action the word but the question is talking about that is also an important a word so did class circle the words in a question that was important to establish equipment yes student ,yes i picked an action word i picked the word discover from the question 
210.3,Oliver,,so student and student how about you two work together and talking to each other good job excellent word in the question and it's the action we are going to look for it and i'm going to work with other three students in a few minutes when you add reading a passage and talk about what you will change and why you change that in your answer ,Yep. Sounds great. 
120.4,Chris,,okay all right let's talk in our class about no question student can you read your answer that you gave ,okay yeah so my answer to the question was scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
110.2,Chris,,okay i really appreciate how you use facts and exact evidence from the passage when you answer the question and you said the crater of water that is a fact what made you say that okay i really appreciate that you give us a fact and exactly evidence for all the passage when you answer the question ,well okay well it kind of goes along with my my keyword because i said the keyword was water and the whole story is about water and they found the water like all this water in the crater I hadn't hadn't heard of that just yet. 
410.2,Chris,,yes and so equipment is an important word in the question but you didn't include any equipment in your answer ,yeah i didn't include equipment i just said like where they found the water 
420.2,Chris,,yes so how will you revise your answer to include the equipment ,yeah i'll have to i'll have to put some equipment in my answer to make sure it answers the question 
210.4,Chris,,yes so did you'll find a place in the passage you can do that ,well i went to nasa so i know scientists use a lot of equipment actually like oxygen tanks and masks and suits OK. OK. 
130.2,Jazmin,,and then student how about you you maybe help us later to help out out student and student to answer the question because your answer is nasa sent a small machine right ,yes 
210.3,Jazmin,,so if you are going to revise your answer it may help student and student to understand better how you will make your answer more specific ,oh well what if i use the keyword like i could said i could say nasa sent a small machine to discover the water 
310.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, I like it. You had a target to the right place in the passage you for the answer. yes okay ",i'm so sorry i looked at the clock we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say this was so helpful thank you for for finding something good in each of our answers but also challenging us to look back on and reread for even more detail and even stronger answers that fit with a keywords that was a really helpful strategy 
310.1,Farrah,,thank you sounds good ,hi how are you today 
310.1,Farrah,,teacher i'm good how are you ,we're good thanks for asking 
310.1,Oliver,,teacher can we go around and say our names please ,um yeah so i'm student my name is student oh sorry 
310.1,Chris,,hi ,oh hi it's nice to meet you my name is student 
310.1,Jazmin,,teacher student ,hi my name is student 
310.1,Luis,,teacher student ,yeah so my name is student and i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Farrah,,teacher that's okay student we're gonna talk more about space today my name is miss teacher and i'm going to be working with you teacher so i understand that we read the assignment water on the moon in your discussion question was what equipment and scientists have used to discover water on the moon teacher correct ,that's correct 
120.4,Farrah,,teacher awesome so student what did you say what was your response for the understanding what equipment did scientists use ,i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.2,Farrah,,teacher so a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely okay did you find evidence of that in the text ,in part three it talks about the microscope and how the water is really small 
210.4,Farrah,,so i could see you how you got confused there teacher yeah so it says it's microscopic so although microscope or microscopic start with the same beginning they mean two different things so microscopic means it's really small ,well so that says right it says right after that you need a scientific tool called a microscope so i took that word right from the story 
230.3,Oliver,,right so you need a microscope to look at the microscopic particles because it's so small but that wasn't necessarily the tool that they used to send to the moon teacher and student i saw that you said you circle the same as student ,yeah i also thought it was a microscope because that's a tool and on the question asked for equipment that's equipment 
210.4,Jazmin,,right so i could see where that would get confusing teacher would you like to reread the article ,i have a question 
210.4,Jazmin,,teacher yes student ,well i understand why my answer as well 
230.2,Luis,,teacher okay so you said nasa and the small machine which is absolutely right teacher um but it's a small machine that's called old lunar orbiter to investigate Teacher : You just forgot to use the second part of that term. teacher so you were almost there nice job teacher student you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks where did you see oxygen tanks ,oh well i just know a lot about space because i watch videos on youtube and i watch stuff about rocket launches and i really know a lot about astronauts so um i just know that the astronauts would have needed oxygen tanks 
150.1,Luis,,teacher right so i don't disagree that you can learn a lot from youtube have boats the scientists and astronauts and rockets Teacher : Does that make sense. Luis ,so you're saying like because it's um it's not in the story i need to pick something from the story 
420.2,Luis,,right so i would like to see you use some context from the story to be able to answer that question does that make sense ,yeah i should probably read it 
110.1,Luis,,teacher okay student reread and then i'd like to see if you can get a different answer okay ,yeah yeah okay 
230.3,Chris,,teacher awesome and student i saw you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon ,yeah so cool 
210.3,Chris,,teacher yes it's very very cool but is that equipment were craters equipment ,no no craters not equipment but that's where they've had to find the water 
210.3,Chris,,teacher right so how did they get there though what equipment do they use to find it ,oh well um i actually went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like like oxygen takes like student was saying and masks and suits 
120.4,Oliver,,teacher right so that's really cool that you've been to nasa and you have all this background knowledge but if we look at the article right it doesn't mention oxygen tanks teacher nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small teacher did you hear the name of the equipment that they used this can go to class teacher student student student student did you hear anything ,well um this is student i heard you say lunar orbiter i'm like i know you said that sorry to answer because you can told student but i still don't really understand why it's not the microscope from part three because that's also equipment and they also needed to find the water 
210.4,Oliver,,teacher awesome so let's read number three so that we can kind of make an understanding of this so that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth teacher the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you are looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called or microscope to look really closely so student or student i'm sorry teacher is the water on the moon big or small ,it's definitely small 
210.4,Oliver,,teacher right so it's small so it's saying it's very small and what does a microscope do ,well it lets you look at things that are really small 
210.4,Oliver,,teacher right so let us look at things that are really small so do you think we could look at the water that's really small ,well yeah i think 
210.3,Oliver,,yeah teacher right so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely but that doesn't necessarily say that nasa sent a microscope to look really closely it does it ,i guess it doesn't say that nasa sent it 
210.4,Oliver,,teacher right so where in the article do you see a sentence that starts with nasa sent ,okay and part two i'm oh oh man oh i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for coming here today and helping us find the right sentence and the text and looking for the right words to help us answer the question that's really helpful for us at this article and also for our next time 
210.4,Farrah,,teacher thank you have fun at lunch hi my name is teacher and i'm going to be working with you today on your article that you read and cold water on the moon nice to meet you ,nice to see you 
120.2,Luis,,you as well so our first question from the article that we read that we have to respond to was the question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon yes student do you have a question ,um yeah i should be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,student that's awesome that you know so much about space but we're going to expand our knowledge today as a class okay ,ok ok 
150.1,Chris,,alright so my first task that i would like you to do and i'm going to give you a minute to do this is i want you to reread the question so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and i want you to underline or circle any keyword or any word that you think is important i'll give you a minute to do that alright are we all set or do we need more time ,i think we're ready 
120.4,Chris,,alright so student what were the keywords that you underlined from the sentence ,well i said that the keyword was water because my answer was about the craters full of water on the moon 
120.4,Oliver,,okay so you talked about water and how there was craters on the moon but what was the keyword that help the scientists find the water on the moon student would you like to share ,okay sure yeah i had a different keyword from student and mine was on equipment 
230.1,Farrah,,you had equipment and class else in the class have equipment i see student with their hand up and student with his hand up okay student why did you circle equipment ,well because when it says equipment that means you have to look for like a tool for your answer and so i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope and so i don't understand why my answers wrong 
120.4,Luis,,okay so you circled equipment and you knew that a microscope was in a tool that was used for equipment all right next though there was another piece of equipment that was talked about survey student i would like you to go back in the text and see if you can find a better answer student what did you think ,well i also said equipment 
230.1,Luis,,why did you say equipment ,yeah i think for the same reasons that student and i know because i know so much about space i know there's so much equipment that you need and like you can't do anything without equipment so it just seems like really important you know 
230.3,Jazmin,,student what did you circle right so there is a lot of equipment that we need to utilize especially with space ,oh i thought that the most important word in the question was discover 
230.1,Jazmin,,discover okay why discover ,well because that's sort of like the action like what they did 
420.3,Chris,,alright so what i would like us to do next is student student and student i would like to class with you together and student and student we're gonna work together okay so you can start working in your small groups all right student and student i'll be working with you so if we look back at that question it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon okay so i want you right now to reread the text or the article and i want you to circle any word that you might think is equipment is that clear ,yeah so me and student we're gonna reread it and circle all the equipment that we find is that right 
420.3,Chris,,perfect ,okay yeah because i went to nasa so i know that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
150.1,Chris,,right so you have some background knowledge so let's read and see if we can find any other pieces of equipment okay ,okay yeah 
120.4,Jazmin,,all right well you do that deb student and student do you have a question ,oh no no question i'm going to read too 
120.4,Oliver,,you're gonna reread as well what about you student and student do you feel like you need to reread or what did you talk about in small class ,well we agree that the microscope was a piece of equipment and they probably used it to to look at the water and then the only other piece of equipment we saw was the small machine 
210.4,Luis,,right what was that small machine name do you remember ,oh i know i know i know i know it's the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Luis,,yeah correct student so the lunar orbiter so you talked about the small machine that they used and what did they use that machine to do ,says that they they used it to investigate and it looks for ice deposits and a large polar crater 
120.3,Oliver,,okay and student can you reread that first question ,okay um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.3,Farrah,,okay and so student after hearing the equipment and what it was used for in the question number one do you think that lunar orbiter is the right tool or do you think the microscope is after doing more research ,well i guess i'm still a little confused like it definitely sounds like lunar orbiter is a good answer but i guess i still think microscope is a good answer too 
110.1,Oliver,,okay so you still think that lunar orbiter is a good job student do you have a question ,oh yeah well i just actually i wanted to say that it's time for us to go but i wanted to say thank you for having us look at that question so closely today 
120.4,Chris,,thank you have fun at lunch hi so we were talking about the different equipment and student and student were rereading the article so student and student would you like to share with the class any of the equipment that you circled from the reading ,oh yeah yeah okay definitely so well we found the same to that student and student i guess because there's the small machine on the lunar orbiter and then at the end it talks about the microscope 
230.3,Luis,,right so you found the lunar orbiter and the microscope nice student ,yeah i just wanted to remind you my dad as actually an astronaut 
120.3,Farrah,,that's pretty amazing student i wonder if your dad has ever seen the lunar escape or the lunar orbiter but so student and student so that they found the two tools of equipment right so student can you read the question for me that you're trying to answer ,huh yes it's um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.4,Farrah,,okay so let's look at both pieces of equipment so the was the microscope did it help find the water on the moon can someone raised their hand ,i i thought it did because it's like how can you find something if you can't see it if it's too small for you to see how can you find it without something like a microscope huh 
120.3,Farrah,,right so the microscope helps us see things that is really small but not necessarily found the water on the earth right can you reread the part in the article about the microscope for me please student ,yeah out loud 
120.3,Farrah,,please ,okay the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Chris,,and then student can you reread the part about the lunar orbiter awesome so you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water they found on moon right ,yeah i can do that definitely um it says let's see nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and lock her ice deposits and a large polar crater just right there or do you want me to keep going 
120.3,Chris,,um can you read the next two sentences for me ,mm hmm yeah okay these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water 
210.4,Luis,,thank you for reading that student so student can you summarize what the paragraph said ,i'm the one that student read i mean the one that student read yes yeah okay so it said that they sent the lunar orbiter and it looked at the moon and it found a water but it was actually ice and it was in the craters and there's like not that much of it 
230.3,Luis,,right so you told me the they found the lunar orbiter found the water on the moon but it was ice right ,yeah it was frozen 
230.3,Farrah,,okay so the lunar orbiter found the water on the moon and then student you were saying at the microscope helps us to look at the water right ,right yeah because it's so small like student was saying 
210.3,Jazmin,,right so student which tool do you think found the water the lunar orbiter or do you think the microscope did ,well my answer to begin with was the small machine so i still think that's right and i don't really see what was wrong with my answer nasa sent a small machine 
230.1,Jazmin,,right so you have the answer small machine my concern is is that there's a name for that small machine that you didn't mention do you have a name for the small machine ,oh yeah it's the lunar orbiter we've been talking about it like this whole time 
130.2,Chris,,right so the name of that small machine you just said is a lunar orbiter student do you agree with student ,well yeah i agree with student i think would make sense that the lunar orbiter discovered it because i know from science class or a bit means to like go around so i'm picturing the orbiter like going around and around the moon and i can't really see how a microscope kind of fits into that so yeah i think that it saw the lunar orbiter and i was thinking i first thought it was these craters full of water but it sounds like there wasn't that much 
510.1,Chris,,student you are using your background knowledge of a definition of orbiter to be able to apply your answer right ,yeah exactly yeah because we learned that word orbit 
130.2,Farrah,,you learn the word orbit and student what did student say what does it mean ,it means to go around 
230.3,Farrah,,student what was it looking for to go around right so student shared that the lunar orbiter went around the moon looking for something ,the small pieces of ice 
210.3,Farrah,,the small pieces of ice so did the lunar orbiter find the water or did the microscope find the water ,oh yeah that's making more sense that the lunar orbiter is what like i'm a bit like detected it and then and then they used a microscope to like look at it and study it 
230.3,Farrah,,right exactly so what you just said was that the lunar orbiter went around the moon and spotted the water than you you were able to use the context of your microscope which is another tool to be able to say that the microscope is going to help study the water which is small pieces correct ,yeah yeah that makes sense now 
150.1,Oliver,,okay so student can you summarize what student just said for me ,all yeah i sure can she said that on the oh i wasn't really listening i think it was thought on the lunar orbiter like found it and then the microphone all like looked at it 
130.2,Luis,,student is student right ,yeah i mean it's like close enough he couldn't he has to better words i think but yeah he got the idea 
110.1,Oliver,,okay so student and student than right he got the right idea yes student ,um well actually yeah i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say thank you so much for listening to us and really helping us connect what we already knew like our background knowledge with the text and also helping us understand when we were using it to answer the question instead of actually using what's in the article in front of us that was so helpful thank you very much 
110.1,Farrah,,you're welcome good job hi class ,hi good morning 
150.1,Luis,,reading my name is teacher so we're going to be digging a little bit deeper into our discussion questions on reading about water on the moon so i've gotten after hearing your oh yes student ,yes me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Oliver,,we're also going to be learning about answering a question fully and making sure that we're giving all the information that's in your head so that class knows that you have a full understanding of the topic oh yeah i believe it but there's always more to learn no matter what the subject and even if you know all about space right now so let's reread the question the question asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon can someone read reread paragraph two for me where it begins with nasa send a small machine who can read that for me so i like a lot of these answers but why don't we i think that we need to take a step back with some of these answers ,it says nasa sent a machine called all lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar quarter these are still deposits are very small 
210.4,Chris,,thank you student so after reading that statement what did we learn what did nasa do how about that who can answer that first question how about student ,i was just raising my hand well they found the scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
210.4,Jazmin,,yes very very cool but how did they find that ice is the question so what did the what was the first thing they did in that first sentence go ahead student ,and so sent a small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,right it says they sent a small machine called lunar orbiter to investigate so that was step one so we know that nasa found ice deposits that were very small but the first way that they found or the first step in defining that was sending a small machine there ,that's what i said for my answer nasa sent a small machine and so i don't understand why the answer was wrong 
120.3,Farrah,,"your answer wasn't totally wasn't completely incorrect Remember, how I was saying that the point of these questions is to make sure we know that you know everything possible about this topic. So you gave us that step number one, but let's read the next step. but let's read the next step so can someone read the third paragraph out loud to me what about student ",yeah i can read it i'll do it now this means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you won't to be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Farrah,,wow really cool so the moon is so the water that they found i'm sorry the water is microscopic so it's tiny and they even explain to us it means that you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it so what was the scientific tool needed to see something so small ,well it was a microscope that was my answer 
130.2,Luis,,right i saw that man and you did a nice job of explaining that you actually took words from the text which is great but you were missing step number one so student did a great job of explaining step number one and you did a great job of explaining step number two but now we need to put it all together to someone want to try to put that into one answer what about student or student if you have your hand up ,i could do it i can do it oh you want me to do it put that put the answers together this is student 
130.2,Luis,,student sorry yes ,yeah okay so if you just put those the two the two things together it's like i'm on nasa sent a small machine and it was a lunar orbiter and then by looked at the small water with a microscope 
130.2,Chris,,yes that's exactly right nice work student did class want to add anything to that i can i still see a hand student ,yeah i would have to say i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
410.2,Chris,,"right oh i'm sure that's absolutely right they to go up into space we need tons of equipment that we don't use down here right If you provided that information that you just told me, Chris, which is great background knowledge, the person who's reading this won't know where you got that information from it doesn't apply to this question. Does that make sense to you? ",so it's because it's not in the story 
310.1,Chris,,that's right yeah but again that's excellent background knowledge because background knowledge always helps us understand what we're learning about even better it gives us almost like a little step ahead ,yeah yeah that's that makes sense yeah 
310.1,Luis,,okay well i think that oh yes student ,um yeah so i'm wondering because i don't think about the lunar orbiter i don't think it had astronauts on it so did the astronauts did they need a microscope because if there weren't any astronauts they're not like walking around looking looking through a microscope on them right 
210.4,Luis,,right so the first so i guess if we rewrite the question what we would say is that the equipment that scientists used even though they weren't on the small machine it was still a piece of equipment right that they used so the equipment that the scientists used included a small machine called the lunar orbiter and microscopes to investigate the small tight the smallest or i'm sorry the water that was found this tiny ,oh okay so even though they didn't use it on the moon it was like they still had to use it like later 
110.4,Oliver,,they still had to use it correct ,excuse me must go on i just looked at the clock it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you for helping us understand how to put our answers together and make the most specific answer for the question we really appreciate that you taught us that today thank you very much 
150.1,Luis,,you're welcome i always love getting thank yous all right well enjoy your lunch start simulation hi class my name is teacher and today i'm going to be helping you with our comprehension questions from the text that we read about the moon so we're all here together because there's we all know we all answered the questions individually but we all could use a little bit of work on just fixing those answers just a little bit yes student ,i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.3,Chris,,i know i remember that and based on your answer i can tell you included some really awesome information but we're here to make sure that we're answering the question that was given to us and using the text that was given to us so let's start by looking back at the question again so can someone read the question out loud to me ,yeah i'll read it 
120.3,Chris,,okay great thanks student ,okay the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
120.4,Oliver,,Yeah Oliver give it a try. ,okay well i think the keyword as equipment because you have to know that you're looking to find a tool to answer the question 
120.4,Farrah,,mm hmm that's a good point that's definitely an important piece of the question i was thinking more along the lines of which word tells us the exact question being asked so that word that i was looking at is what goes on with equipment so we're going to be looking for what they used right not how they use something or why they use something just what so but you are right that we are looking for the equipment use so who wants why don't we start with student could you tell me what you actually wrote for your answer ,oh yeah sure okay i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.4,Jazmin,,so how about student could you actually read what you wrote ,"So I said that NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong. "
120.4,Jazmin,,with your answer is not completely wrong it's more than it's just missing a little bit of information so student mentioned that we needed the microscope to look at the water very closely because it's so tiny so that's a very very important piece of information that needs to be included in the answer but we also need jazmin's part of the answer that how did they even get the water down here they needed that a lunar orbiter to see it so we need to there's two parts of this answer so we need to combine what student set and her answer with what student said in her answer there's two parts so sometimes when we're answering a question even if we think that there's only one part we just need to be sure that we're reading through the text fully to make sure we don't miss any bit so why don't we try to combine those two answers what do we think is the first piece of information that should what should go first the microscope or the lunar orbiter yeah student go ahead ,well i think that it's a small machine that has to go first 
230.2,Farrah,,right i mean you know how i also a good way to test to see if that makes sense that's what came first in the text right farrah's nswer i can find that right in paragraph two whereas i'm sorry not student jazmin's answer i can find in paragraph two but student where did you find your answer ,on part three 
120.4,Oliver,,right go ahead student did you have a question ,i do have a question yes so i'm not sure i agree with student because what i'm thinking is if the water is so small that you can't even see it without a microscope then how can you find it if you can't even see it 
210.4,Oliver,,that's a really good question so the way that i would try to find the answer to that is by looking back in the text so let's see paragraph number two where we found out about the lunar orbiter that jazmin's discussing so it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater each ice deposits are very small scientists said that one top 10 of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day hmm so i the text actually doesn't really give us that much information as far as how the lunar orbiter would have been able to find the tiny water however it does say that that's where am i allowed to stop i'm like stumbling on my words ,oh no that's okay that's okay you can keep going 
150.1,Chris,,do you have a question ,yeah so actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists do use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
420.2,Chris,,that's right that's all really interesting information student and i love that you're using your background knowledge to connect to the texts always great it helps us understand text a lot more when we have that however when we're writing answers to comprehension questions about a text that was given to us we need to be sure that we're just providing information from the text when we provide information from our own background knowledge the issue is that we don't really have concrete evidence of where you got that information so even though i might know that you visited nasa if somebody else was reading your response and they didn't know that they might wonder where you got that information from to use evidence from the text in front of us ,so it has to be a piece of equipment from the story 
130.3,Farrah,,that's right that's right so we're going to begin by step one mentioning the lunar orbiter and step two would be mentioning the microscope yes student ,well actually it's it's time for us to go right now but i wanted to say thank you for reminding us that we have to go back and read the whole thing to make sure that we didn't just pick part of the answer but we actually find the whole answer 
150.1,Luis,,of course hi class we're going to be going over so why don't we begin by just reviewing the question one more time could someone read that out loud to me we're going to be going over our responses to our comprehension question regarding the text on the moon yeah student go ahead ,um yeah okay um before i do that i just wanted to say um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.3,Luis,,i know i'm sure you do i know you have a lot of background information on that since you've read so many books i'm sure see movies or tv shows however we're working on a few different things in this class we want to make sure that we're answering the question that was given to the fullest and making sure we're using evidence from the text that was given so why don't we all work on that together so could you go ahead and read that question out loud to me student ,yeah okay um the question as what equipment at scientists to is to discover water on the moon 
120.4,Jazmin,,great so we're looking for the equipment used does class want to give me just let me know what they answered or what they think if they even think that they want to change their answer what equipment was used yeah student what do you think ,so i said that nasa send a small machine 
230.2,Jazmin,,hmm and where did you find that ,it's in part two 
130.2,Farrah,,mm hmm great so you have text evidence from the text that's great does class have a different answer or did they find any other information about any equipment yeah student go ahead ,yeah so i picked a different piece of equipment and student picked and i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.3,Farrah,,mm hmm great i love that answer so it sounds like you both found pieces of equipment that were used so do we think that maybe we just should include both of those responses to make one response together ,that's it that's all we need to do 
120.4,Oliver,,"yeah i love that you mentioned the microscope because that was definitely necessary And Jazmin. I love that you mentioned the Lunar Orbiter, so it's just a matter of combining your two answers so when we're answering comprehension questions like this we really need to dig into the text and make sure we're using all the information does someone want to give it a try and try to combine those two answers maybe student ",oh yeah okay well yeah cuz my my first answer was the same as some animals about the microscope to if you put the two together i guess you just say on that the scientists used a lunar orbiter and a microscope 
120.1,Oliver,,"You can, did you want to give that a try. ",um yeah well before i do that i just wanted to say i'm student and student i think you're wrong i don't think i don't think they use a microscope because i mean i know it talks about it like sorry and stuff but can you can you even picture like if there was an astronaut and they weren't like walking all around that big giant moon what like a microscope like i can't imagine that 
230.1,Oliver,,um i know that does sound funny so what makes you think that the scientists were on the moon with the microscope ,like i mean that's what i mean that's why i mean i don't think they use a microscope because i don't think there were any astronauts there 
150.1,Luis,,um so the text doesn't imply that the astronauts went to the moon right so so i'm looking at paragraph two right now it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so it doesn't necessarily say that any astronauts went there however that small machine was still necessary because that's what found the ice deposits so that's what actually found the small little water so that i can and i found that information from the second sentence this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits and the large polar crater so even though this astronauts went up there look examining the water molecules the lunar orbiter is what found them does that make a little more sense student ,yeah yeah yeah that's what i thought that's kind of what i thought our first place that it was was most like that the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Chris,,right so then with the microscope in paragraph three it's suggesting that the scientists were using the microscope when they were examining it back here on earth ,well surely so i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits so i don't understand why why that's not the right answer 
410.2,Chris,,so those are all pieces of equipment absolutely however when we're answering a question to a text that we've read we need to be just using evidence from the text if we use background information the person who's reading your response won't know where you got that information for example i know that you went to nasa because you've talked about it however maybe student doesn't know that so if he was reading your response he may question where you got that evidence and if it's truly valid ,"Okay, yeah. thanks for explaining got it "
150.1,Oliver,,no problem i like that you use the background information though student it's always great to have that helps us understand the text a little more does class else have any other questions to clarify this response yes ,what i wanted to try the thing you said where we put it all together and i'm use the words from the question 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah ,okay so equipment that the scientists used to discover the water was on the lunar orbiter then later like student said they used a microscope 
520.1,Oliver,,that's right that's excellent so now when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions you can use dev's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use all of the evidence from the text ,thank you and actually it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you for listening to all of our answers and helping us understand how we each had like a part of the answer and how to put them all together and make the best awesome so to answer out there was 
520.1,Farrah,,of course thank you all for all your hard work i was muted hello class are you doing ,hi we're doing good thank you for asking 
150.1,Luis,,thank you great to see class so you all read water on the moon right yes ,well i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,oh that's wonderful to have your background knowledge i just want to make sure that class understands this text this particular text okay by this author ,okay okay 
120.2,Farrah,,"all right it shouldn't take too long if there's just a double double check that you understand what i want you to understand okay alright so our question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon Yes, Farrah. ",well i think that a keyword is equipment because in your answer you need to have like a tool or something 
130.2,Jazmin,,exactly in an equipment like you said student is a tool that they used in order to discover the water on the moon right let's revisit our text and figure out what specific equipment or scientific tool the scientists use in order to complete this mission all right i'll give you a few minutes to do that and let me know so we're in the process to reread it yes i want you to skim the text and let me know which equipment in particular they used to discover to make this discovery all right and once you're done you can share with the partner partner next to you see if you class got the same answers yes student ,so for my answer i said nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong after reading the text again 
430.1,Jazmin,,all right it's not that your answer is wrong particularly it's not what the question is asking right it's asking what equipment specifically so let's try to use the text and see what the name of that tool is ,And so it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter. 
230.2,Jazmin,,that's fantastic exactly the more specific we are in the texts can you help me find out where that is which which pairs ,i found it in paragraph two in the in the first sentence 
210.4,Oliver,,yes student paragraph two nasa sent to be small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate ,well student and we had a different answer when we talked about it we said it was the microscope and they talk about that in the next paragraph how you would need a tool called a microscope to look really closely so that's also equipment 
130.2,Chris,,that's very true that's another tool that they used in order to find water and the moon i love that you used you told me which paragraph you found that evidence right the more evidence that we have the stronger our claim is class else find any other piece of equipment yes student ,will own i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.2,Chris,,wow that's awesome background information is there any evidence in the text that you found that kind of that supports that they use oxygen and hydrogen tanks and etc ,um oh oh well no not in this story but i just know that if there were astronauts they would need all of those things 
110.1,Luis,,that's a very good point all right let's see yes student ,yeah okay so i'm thinking what student said it just made me think um i just reread the textbook as you told us to you know it doesn't say anything about astronauts student they don't even have the word astronaut and that story 
120.1,Chris,,yeah we're talking about the scientists right so it's great to make connections with our past experiences but also pay attention to what the question is asking and the context of the text alright student so what would you say in your answer the particular equipment that they the scientists used to discover water on the moon can you try ,i guess your i can try again because if i have to pick one from the story i would say i go so i would probably say what student said about the lunar orbiter because that sounds that sounds more like like a like a spaceship or something that they would send 
420.2,Chris,, ,it says to investigate and to look for ice deposits 
110.4,Oliver,,yeah look for ice deposits in a large polar crater yes student ,i'm so sorry i just locked up a lot and we actually have to go to lunch now what i just wanted to say thank you so much for reminding us that our answers needed to have evidence from the text and the more evidence you have a stronger your answer is that's going to help us a lot with us close on also our classes too so thank you so much 
110.4,Farrah,,exactly thank you bye have a good lunch class ,hi it's good to see you today 
110.4,Luis,,hello and student student student and student hello great to see you too so i see that you have revised your answers we're going to do a small one second yes student ,um yeah well i was gonna say i shouldn't be in this class because i already corrected my answer 
120.4,Farrah,,"oh that's awesome so yes we all revise and corrected our answers i just wanted to take some time today to reflect and make sure that it's really our learning is really set in stone okay so um let's see i am going to give you some sentence starters and this is going to help us really solidify our learning and reading strategies this is going to help us really solidify our learning and reading strategies Alright. So for example, I can start out saying I started out thinking And you would say your prior response. And now I think this way because And then you can tell me. So next time you see a question asking about a text I will do what. so you think about the thinking and thinking strategy that you use when you are reading a text and answering a question You can take a minute to talk with the person next to you and revisit what that process was like, and then we can share out loud. alright looks like we're ready student can your class tell me what you what your reflection was ",yeah yeah we'd love to go first okay so um well we had the same answer originally so our our our answer for this has kind of the same show on we said 
120.4,Farrah,,okay ,"well what was the first part again i used to i used to think Okay, so we started out thinking that the answer was the microscope but now we think that the answer is the lunar orbiter be because oh well because well it kind of we talked about it and we heard that jazmin's answer was right "
230.1,Farrah,,yeah student jazmin's answer was right but do you know why that is ,well it's because that they use the lunar lunar orbiter first and that's what they used to discover and then they use the microscope to study 
230.1,Jazmin,,yep so you you didn't find out and learn that the microscope was used for a different purpose of studying the water right it wasn't used to discover the actual water let me ask student can you clarify to us why you chose the lunar orbiter in your revised answer ,yeah so well my first answer was nasa send a small machine but my new answer is nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and i changed it because there wasn't enough detail so if i just say small machine it could be like anything like a like a toaster or a computer so next time i have a question like this i will look for all the details 
510.1,Farrah,,amazing yes so i noticed that student told me she was able to point out that the small machine could mean anything it's not specific to the text right so why did you change your answer to what student also wrote what were you thinking okay so next time that you see a question like this that's asking about a text what are you going to do she's going back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used to discover water on the moon ,i'm okay i would say next time i see a question like this i will look for or i'm look for evidence and the text 
120.4,Chris,,yes do you all agree nod your head yes if you agree to that strategy okay see nods from class that's great how about a student or student and i haven't heard from you yet what were your takeaways ,can i go 
120.4,Chris,,yeah ,i want to know is my new answer okay my new answer is the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic is that okay 
210.3,Chris,,what do we think folks so is that referring to any equipment that the scientists found or used ,nope nope nope nope nope nope student you didn't even say the equipment and that's like the whole point but that's the whole question oh yeah 
230.2,Oliver,,i love that you went and use a specific example from the text let me pull up my text which paragraph was that in ,oh this is student i'm really sorry but actually we have to go and i wanted to say thank you so much for really helping us think about how we got our answers and why we changed our answers because student and me we had just going to change that because we heard the right answer but now we heard more ideas for for how to find the right answer and the first place so thank you for that 
150.1,Luis,,thank you hello class thank you for meeting with me today we are going to take a few minutes to reflect on our takeaways from our revised answers yes even ,um excuse me i shouldn't be in that scrub i already corrected my answer 
150.1,Luis,,that's wonderful we all corrected our answers and be revised it and i just want to make sure that i just want to hear your takeaways and reflections okay great ,yeah okay 
120.4,Farrah,,so we're gonna take a minute to turn around to your partner next to you and you're going to talk about what are your takeaway from the revision process And so the next time I see a question like this where I have to look at the text again I'm going to talk about a strategy. alright sounds good you may begin all right look like we're ready who would like to share your takeaways ,oh we can go first 
120.4,Farrah,,all right student ,okay so well we had the same answer at the start so we we started out thinking that the scientists used a microscope to look really closely at the water and now now we think that the scientists used the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of on frozen water in the craters and we think that because well um so it was like we were told that the microscope wasn't right because they didn't use that first they used the lunar orbiter first but i don't really know how i would have thought of that on my own 
120.3,Farrah,,okay i appreciate your honesty i also really like that you are referencing specific parts of the text so i see that you said they were looking for ice deposits right in the large polar crater that's great I am a little concerned because you were talking about which equipment they were using first and let's if i would suggest you revisit the question one more time can you read what that question is ,yes so so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.2,Oliver,,okay so you have the equipment part you know that part is important what action which which equipment what equipment and scientists used to do what what is the purpose of this equipment student or student can you go ,oh yeah i got it it's discover 
120.3,Oliver,,yeah discover and so you're going to go back to your answer for microscope it it's not asking which equipment they used first what are they asking student can you read ,all okay um it's it's what equipment to discover 
150.1,Farrah,,right does that make sense student ,yeah can i try again 
120.1,Farrah,,try again ,okay so we used to think it was the microscope and now we think it's the lunar orbiter because that's the equipment they used to discover so i guess if i was doing this again maybe i would do what you had to have just do and look back in the question for an action word 
120.4,Chris,,exactly wonderful what about student ,oh okay well i want to know if my new answers okay so my new answer is the water the scientists found on the moon was microscopic 
150.1,Chris,,alright let's just let's use the same approach we used for student and then answer ,They on they read the question and they found the action work discover 
210.3,Chris,,discover and let's analyze your answer and see if that really answers the discover part ,so i said the water the scientists found was microscopic so i said like what it looked like when they discovered 
120.1,Chris,,okay nod your head yes if you feel like that is the equipment that they used does that make sense yes or no i see some few shaking their head no huh alright so next strategy you can do is revisit the text ,so so and what should i look for 
130.2,Jazmin,,why should we look for you worked with student and student right okay can you help them out you class what part in ,yes student you want to look for equipment your answer nice to say equipment so it needs to have like a thing like an object in it 
120.1,Oliver,,And see if you can find something different. all right yes ,um excuse me um we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say that the way that you had us talk about why our answer changed on really helped us think about not just how to look at the text but also like how to look at the question and i think that's a really important first step so thank you so much for teaching us that today 
120.1,Farrah,,you're most welcome ,hi good morning 
120.1,Farrah,,good morning class how is class today ,oh we're good thanks for asking 
120.2,Luis,,awesome so today in our small class we are going to be discussing our reading that we did have about water on the moon so you class answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon does someone want to oh student you have your hand raised you have a question ,excuse me i don't think i should be in this class i already know all about space 
120.2,Luis,,oh awesome well then you can help us in talking about space since you are ready and ready to go what what did you say for your answer do you want to go first then student about answering the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,well said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
230.2,Luis,,cool and did you get that information from the reading that we did ,no i just i just knew that because i watch all sorts of stuff about astronauts on like youtube and you know on the internet and stuff 
110.3,Luis,,but what i want you to do is i want you to look back at the reading that we did and try and find something from the reading that answers the question about what equipment the scientists use to discover water on the moon right so that's so cool that you have that extra information does class ,looking at now 
120.4,Farrah,,yeah that will be great let's see does class else want to raise their hand and talk about what they said for when they answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover the moon student what did you say ,i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.3,Farrah,,um that's really interesting student because you're right to look at something really closely you would need a microscope but let's think if we had a microscope in our classroom do you think we would be able to see all of the water on the moon or do you need more than that ,well they said it's really small so if you don't have the microscope you can't see it 
120.4,Jazmin,,but on what i'm going to do now is i'm going to read out loud oh interesting okay so i love everyone's answers to these the three facts that are out on our paper called the water on the moon and i want class to be listening and while you're listening i want you to be thinking about the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon because in these three facts that i'm going to read out there will be some answers in there so i want class to put on their listening ears to listen to the five figure out what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so the first fact is that scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines the second one is nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small and then our third fact is that means the moon is still drier than the driest or desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you are looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely all right let's see student you have your hand up ,here yeah so i listened to the facts and i still don't understand why my answer is wrong i said that nasa scientists small machine 
420.2,Jazmin,,right so your answer isn't wrong they did send a small machine but i want to see more detail i know that you could pull more detail from this what was the small machine called do you remember ,i think you just said it it's the lunar orbiter nasa scientists machine called a lunar orbiter 
120.4,Oliver,,yes good work that's the equipment that they used to discover the water on the moon nice job student does class want to add to that anything that they heard while i was reading student what would you like to add to that ,i get that they sent the lunar orbiter but i cricled the same answer as student and and i still don't i don't see why it's not the miscroscope because it sounds like they used that too right 
210.4,Oliver,,they did so once they actually found the water then they use the microscope to see it so they needed to use a machine first to actually find the water and then they use the microscope to actually look at the water does that make more sense ,it's like first the lunar orbiter goes and that's how they know it's there and then and then use a microscope to like study it 
120.4,Chris,,exactly i'm student do you have anything to add ,yeah i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Chris,,oh wow that's so cool student until then you might be able to help me in telling me what the lunar orbiter does how it looks how what it does to look for the water do you know we just read about it you want me to read it again ,i think we know it's um well it's an orbiter so i guess that means like it goes around the moon 
210.4,Chris,,oh yeah i think that it goes around the moon and it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater ,was my answer my answer was that the scientists they found craters full of water on the moon 
210.3,Chris,,right they did and they did that through what equipment ,lunar orbiter i guess 
150.1,Oliver,,right nice job all right does class else have anything they want to add to this discussion student what do you want to add ,well actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for listening to all of our answers and helping us understand the difference between what the lunar orbiter did and what the microscope did that was so helpful and now i understand what to look for in the text so i really appreciate it thank you so much 
150.1,Farrah,,awesome thank you class have a good lunch hi class ,hi good morning 
150.1,Farrah,,good morning how's everyone's morning so far ,really good thanks for asking 
150.1,Luis,,awesome i'm excited to learn some more about water on the moon with you class today student do you have a question ,yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Farrah,,wow i'm sure you know tons about space but we're always open to learning more and more so with that being said let's talk about all of your answers that you class gave to the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon who wants to volunteer to go first was what they said for their answer student what what did you say for this ,okay i said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.1,Farrah,,okay awesome student and what made you say that ,so they talk about the microscope in in part in part three and they say the water is microscopic and so you wouldn't be able to see it if you didn't have a microscope 
120.4,Jazmin,,oh student i see how you got that answer i see that you read the text and you were looking for different types of machines and tools they use but what i want you to do is go back to the text and look for a different machine that will allow the scientists to discover water on the moon who else would like to share that what they said as their answer ,i'm ready i'm ready to go 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay student how about you go ,okay so i said that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.1,Jazmin,,oh okay so first tell me what made you say that nasa sent a small machine ,well they say that in part two that they sent a small machine 
420.2,Jazmin,,great i can definitely see where you got that because they did send a small machine but what i want you to do is i want you to go back to the text and add more details to your answer what was this small machine called and what was it there to do ,okay so should i reread it 
120.4,Chris,,yes that would be great who else wants to share their answer and what they got ,can i go can i go 
120.4,Chris,,sure student ,okay so i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
230.1,Chris,,okay student so what made you what made you choose this answer ,okay well so the text is it's called water on the moon and so i figured the answer should be about the water on the moon and they found it in the craters like these critters full over water 
420.3,Chris,,what i want you to do now is go back to the text and look for a specific piece of equipment that the scientist used to discover this water on the moon ,"Okay, looking for equipment. Gotcha. "
420.3,Oliver,,great student would you like to go next ,yeah i'm i'm i'm feeling confused i had the same answer as student and i still i don't understand why you told her to look again because i think a microscope it's the correct answer 
230.1,Oliver,,oh okay so why why do you think the microscope is the correct answer ,well how can you discover something if it's too small to see 
420.3,Oliver,,"okay i see i see where you're coming from because you definitely would need a microscope to discover something that's too small to see Discovering water on the moon and the machine that they use to discover it because if you go back and you read that part, you'll actually find that there's a different machine that they use. So I want you to go back and try and find that machine. ",okay i'll do my best 
120.4,Luis,,great and then student what did you say for your answer ,ah i said you need a scientist need oxygen tanks 
230.1,Luis,,okay awesome so you said that the scientists need oxygen tanks and what made you say this ,well i mean since i know so much about space i just know that if if you're gonna have people on the moon they can't do anything if they don't have oxygen tanks and really like lots of equipment and stuff 
420.3,Chris,,right so you were thinking about your own knowledge that you have and what scientists would need if they were on the moon so that's awesome but what i want you to do is i want you to go back to the text reread it and look for equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon okay awesome student your question ,yeah well what student said it reminded me that i i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like even said and masks and suits 
110.1,Chris,,did you get to find what equipment they use to discover water on the moon you're right they do use tons of different equipment ,oh like the stuff they say in the story 
110.1,Chris,,yeah ,okay so every night there's like there's two there's two equipments i see this small machine which student was talking about and i see the microscope too 
210.4,Chris,,oh okay so which one if you read further which one is used to discover water on the moon ,oh it doesn't really say the word discover but if i had to guess i'd say i probably guessed the orbiter it sounds like that's more of a robot kind of thing that might be able to detect the water 
210.4,Oliver,,wow that's a great start student so it does um in that sentence it goes on to describe what this lunar orbiter does can you read through that and then tell me what the lunar orbiter does ,oh i'm really sorry i we have to go but i just wanted to say thank you so much for listening to why we got our answers instead of just like telling us that our answers were wrong that really made us feel like like you really heard every single one of us 
210.4,Farrah,,great thank you was so nice learning with you class hi class good to see you again ,hi 
150.1,Farrah,,alright so what we're going to talk about now did you all get a chance to read through the text again and maybe come up with some new answers about the machine that was used to discover water on the moon ,yeah we all we all took some time and we read it again 
120.4,Jazmin,,great and so what is the answer that you've come up with now would class like to share ,yeah i can share 
120.4,Jazmin,,all right student go ahead ,so you told me to look again and see if i can add more details to my answer and i found more details in part two which is where my answer came from and so i would say nasa scientists machine called a lunar orbiter which will land at the moon south pole and look for is deposits in the craters 
150.1,Jazmin,,wow student good job looking back at the text and adding more detail do you understand why i had you do this ,oh no not really i just added more details 
210.3,Jazmin,,great so do you understand why your answer might have been not complete last time and now it is ,because there was more information that i didn't put in 
120.4,Oliver,,right nice job does class else want to share maybe they're thinking on what they thought that was the right answer but now what they know is the right answer student ,okay um so i thought the microscope it was the right answer and now well now i know about the lunar orbiter is the right answer but i don't really know how i would have known that i'm without without student telling us 
120.3,Oliver,,oh interesting okay so what i want you to do is i want you to right now read me the question that we're trying to figure out ,okay um what equipment did scientists use to find water on the moon okay so we're looking for the equipment that scientist us to discover water on the moon 
120.1,Oliver,,so now what i want you to do is look through the text where it says where it talks about discovering water on the moon okay and when you get to that part please raise your hand and let me know we'll go over together to fit to talk about the equipment that they used okay ,yeah i'll look 
530.1,Chris,,great does class else want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed student ,okay well i was i was thinking about a lot of stuff about nasa and the different types of equipment and the craters and stuff but you reminded me that the answer well it has to be equipment and it has to be in the story so i guess if i were to try again i would pick out a piece of equipment on like the lunar orbiter 
120.4,Oliver,,great so you you you're right you do know so many different pieces of equipment that nasa uses but i like that now you're thinking about how you would look through the story to figure out the question that it was asking student did you find anything ,okay so um i think a part that you're talking about is the part in part two where it says about looking for the ice deposits because i guess the water was not just water it was ice and they found it as ice ice form 
120.3,Oliver,,oh alright can you read that whole sentence to me starting from the beginning ,yeah okay this lunar orbiter will land on the moon south pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar greater 
150.1,Oliver,,oh so it says this lunar orbiter will look for deposits does that make sense ,yeah okay so in the part about where they actually find the water are talking about the small machine 
310.1,Oliver,,yes nice job student good work paying close attention to the details of our story ,yeah okay i think i'm i think if i if i just read it more carefully next time i maybe i could find the right answer 
110.2,Luis,,good work paying close attention to the details of our story i think just paying close attention to those small details is really important good job does class else want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading student you're right you're so right if there are astronauts on the moon there needs to be oxygen tags ,yeah okay um my answer did not really change like i guess i get i get how you say it has to be in the story and yeah okay they use a lunar orbiter maybe they use a microscope who knows but if there were astronauts there have to be oxygen tanks 
210.3,Luis,,but what is our question asking us ,okay why did scientist us to discover why 
210.3,Luis,,right what specific equipment did they use to discover water on the moon did they use their oxygen tanks to just be like okay i'm gonna throw this oxygen tank at the moon's so that it discovered water ,okay well well they were using the oxygen tank star for you 
230.3,Luis,,okay okay so they use the oxygen tanks to breathe but then i guess yeah okay i say what you mean that the oxygen tanks they're kind of for something different aren't they right so they're using the oxygen tanks to breathe breathe but then they're using a different piece of equipment to actually discover the water on the moon ,yeah yeah yeah i see what you mean now 
230.3,Oliver,,okay awesome student do you have a question ,um well it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say that the way you asked us to think about how our answer changed like what we used to think and now what we think that really helped me at least understand how i could go from a wrong answer to to a more a more right answer i think i'm going to use that next time too so thank you so much 
230.3,Farrah,,great ,hello hi it's good to see you i'm unable to see and hear you at this moment i think you might have frozen can you repeat what you said you had frozen 
230.3,Farrah,,oh sorry about that ,that's okay 
230.3,Luis,,just finished reading our water on the moon so i see that some of us have said that scientists use lots of equipment yes student ,i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,okay well we're just going to talk a little bit more ,okay i love talking about space 
210.3,Farrah,,yeah i do too that's our we're gonna all talk a little bit more about this so that we can keep learning so the question that we talked about was what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon student you said that people that scientists use like microscope to look really closely and that's one part of it do you remember any other parts from the reading ,well i read it i read the whole thing but that was the piece of equipment that i thought because a microscope is like a tool 
110.1,Farrah,,yeah microscope is like a tool ,and so that's why i thought it was the answer because in the text oh i remember one thing i remember is isn't the water is really small it's so small it's microscopic and that's why you need the microscope to see it i remember that 
130.2,Jazmin,,exactly so looking at the reading there's another machine that the scientists use did class remember what that other machine that they used student ,well i said that nasa sent a small machine 
210.3,Jazmin,,do you remember what it was called ,it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
130.2,Jazmin,,yeah exactly who remembers what the lunar orbiter looks for ,um well i think it looks for the for the water 
110.1,Chris,,yeah ,was my answer that's what i said that the scientists found craters full of water 
210.4,Luis,,i see but what was what was this water like was it like like a cup of water or like what state was this water found in ,oh i know the answer to this one i know 
120.4,Luis,,what is it student ,if ice it was ice 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah so wasn't just water so here on earth you might find like giant lakes full of water but on the moon it was ice student ,i got that there was the lunar orbiter and stuff but i still don't understand why my answer was wrong 
130.3,Farrah,,so student i would say that your answer wasn't wrong at all you just needed a little bit more so in addition to using a microscope they also use the machine called the lunar orbiter ,oh ok so it's both 
110.1,Farrah,,exactly ,okay 
110.1,Farrah,,so ,did they use them did they use the microscope to on to see the water because i feel like i feel like you have to see it before you can discover it and that was the word and the question discover but i feel like you have to see it first 
210.4,Farrah,,that's a great question so so the reason that we're thinking about the microscope is because the water on the moon was microscopic so when you think of microscopic what do you think ,oh like so tiny you can't even see it 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah so if we're thinking about the water found on the moon are we thinking about like are we thinking about like huge craters filled with water ,i heard what student said but i don't think he was right i think i think it was awesome student said full of water but i think it's so small cause i also said a microscope like student 
230.1,Chris,,i see so student when you've said that you found craters full of water how big do you think the craters were ,they were pretty big because they're on the moon and stuff and and i actually went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
150.1,Chris,,yeah so even though we're on the moon these ice deposits were in a big crater but the ice deposits are little does that make sense ,yeah so i guess i was picturing like all this water but really it was just like like a little little ice deposits exactly okay that's different than what i thought in my mind Yeah. makes a lot of sense 
230.3,Jazmin,,student so you said nasa sent like a small machine ,yes a small machine 
230.1,Jazmin,,yeah so what would you need a small machine for what did they use it for ,what it says then you start to investigate that's the word they use in paragraph two 
230.1,Jazmin,,so they used it to investigate what makes you think that it's small ,just because they use that word in the sentence they say they say nasa sent a small machine so i was just i was using that word because it was in the story 
210.4,Jazmin,,is that makes sense when you find when you think of this like small machine and you're finding the ice what sorry ,it's called it's an orbiter and that makes me think that it like it goes in orbit like like it's kind of goes around the moon because we learned in science that that's what it means 
110.1,Oliver,,exactly ,excuse me yes i'm really sorry but i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch i just wanted to say thank you so much for coming here today and for helping us talk through all of our answers because like you said sometimes we have to talk about it to help us kind of like think about what we were thinking in our head and hear what other people were thinking in their head and so it was really helpful just to talk about our answers with you today 
110.1,Oliver,,thank you ,thank you 
210.1,Farrah,,okay so i put all of us into this class because class here has a partial answer does class know what a partial answer means ,well this is just a guess but it sounds like maybe it's like you have part of it but not all of it 
310.1,Luis,,student what did you want to add yeah i like how you use part of the word partial to break it down into something that you already knew ,um yeah well i should be being in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,well student this class is actually going to work together to try and learn even more from each other because what's cool about partial answers is that class has different partial answers and if we put some of these answers together and we think about each other's way of thinking we can get more complete answers so what i'm going to ask you all to do now is you're going to turn to your partner and what you're going to do is you're going to walk answers so you're going to share each other's answers so let's say student if you are working with student you two would share your answers with each other and then what we're going to do is we're going to read through what we read before but this time we're going to do some close reading and we're going to make some annotations on our work so today what would i want you to is underline where your partner found their answer and something that you think you could add to their answer to make it a more complete answer so as you're working i'm going to go to each class individually and we're going to discuss your answers a little bit does class understand these instructions ,yeah i think so so we're talking and sharing and then rereading to find our partners answers 
210.3,Luis,,yes and in addition to finding your partner's answer you're going to also look for things that you would add to their answer ,oh yeah okay 
120.4,Farrah,,okay so go ahead and get started and then i'm going to go to each of you individually okay student let's start with your answer so what did what was oliver's answer ,okay student said well we actually had the same answer which was that it was the microscope that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope 
210.3,Farrah,,i see and as you're reading is there anything that you think you might want to add to that ,oh well no not really i mean we have the same answer and i guess i still don't understand why that answers wrong 
210.4,Farrah,,okay that's fine let's look a little bit closer at the reading so i'm going to direct you to one part of the paragraph not the paragraph the the exerpt and then we're gonna look at it together and see what we can find okay ,sure 
210.4,Farrah,,okay so the part that i'm going direct us to is the second paragraph where it says nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate in this paragraph what do you think it talks about what's the main thing ,well i guess it talks about how the lunar orbiter was looking for ice and how there's not that much of it like it's really small 
410.3,Oliver,,"I'm what I would like you to see, though, is a little bit more than just how much water there is but also what was looking for the water ","Okay, yeah. You want both of us to look at that again and I will look up part two for more tools. "
110.1,Luis,,yes and then i'm gonna get back to you them while student and student are doing that let's go over to student student you're working with student and student right ,uh huh yeah we were working all together the three of us 
110.1,Luis,,perfect so whose answer are you looking at ,okay i looked at on jazmin's answer and she said that nasa sent a small machine 
210.3,Luis,,okay and as you're reading what are you able to see in the reading that you might want to add ,well i was thinking that like we could add some other equipment like oxygen tanks because that was my answer and i'm student was talking about how he wants to nasa and so he knows that there's like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff 
410.3,Luis,,i'm really glad that you that this class was able to make some real world connections based on your past experiences that's a really good skill to be able to have what i'd like you to do though is look a little bit closer in the reading so as you're reading and you're making those real world connections i want you to also find what exact things what details are in the reading that show what tools they used so even though we know that they use things like oxygen tanks that's not specifically in the reading ,Oh ok ok so cuz it's because it's not in the story. That's why it's not a whole answer. 
110.4,Luis,,exactly ,oh ok i see that make sense 
420.3,Jazmin,,yeah so go ahead and keep reading and see if you can find what details are in the reading that might answer this question so student which one were you looking at ,okay well i looked at chris's answer he said scientists found craters full of water on the moon and i think that's not quite a whole answer because he doesn't actually say anything about equipment 
210.3,Oliver,,i can see how you're starting to put together what we're talking about here about partial answers and why sometimes we need to just add a little bit more to them i'm going to answer does question really quick and then i'll be right back ,yeah actually i wanted to just say it's time for the next class but thank you so much because you really hope to think about what makes a partial answer and the fact that we could keep on going back to the text and look for more to make our answer more complete 
150.1,Jazmin,,i'm glad you're able to see that start simulation okay so let's continue reading through and seeing what else we found that we can add to our answers so continue from where we left off i'm gonna keep talking to student so student you were looking at chris's answer ,student student and he said scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
230.2,Jazmin,,and when you're reading through what makes you where do you think that came from in the reading ,oh well i wasn't quite sure because when i was looking at it it sounded to me like it was just a little bit of water but maybe he was thinking about the craters like in part one it says craters 
120.4,Luis,,yeah student what's up ,yeah i just have something to say and that's i just wanted to remind you and also you do that my dad is actually an astronaut 
110.1,Luis,,wow that's very interesting even but i'd really like you to focus on the article right now and then you can tell me more about that later ,okay 
420.2,Jazmin,,okay so student i see how you saw in the reading that they called them craters but there was only a little bit of water So go ahead and look into the reading and see what you might add to the answer to make it from a partial answer to a complete answer and then I'll come right back to you. ,oh ok 
150.1,Chris,,so student i think the last one so you were looking at luis's answer right ,he looked at luis's answer and he was talking about the oxygen tanks and stuff but it sounds like that's not really the right answer 
230.2,Chris,,so as you're reading where do you think student got the answer of the oxygen tanks ,yeah well so here's the thing so we were talking about it because we both know about space but then when i looked at the at the story again it didn't actually say anything about oxygen tanks or even like astronauts really 
210.2,Chris,,where we found that from is from outside now so that's what's called like texts to real world connections so that's a really good skill to have but when we're looking at our question we will this one is asking for us to see in the text what tools were used so although this answer is right astronauts and to use that what we want to see us in the text what exactly did nasa use ,"right yeah so that was more like jazmin's answer cuz she said the small machine Oh well. Okay. Hello, like it says that the lunar orbiter will land up the South Pole and look for ice deposits. So maybe we could say the lunar orbiter looked for ice deposits. "
150.1,Chris,,yeah i see how you're using the text and rereading and finding more information that's really great so i'm going to suggest that your class keeps looking through and looking at each other's answer and seeing what you could add to each one individually i'm going to go back over to student and savannas class so keep working ,okay okay 
120.4,Oliver,,so student and student what did you find when you were reading ,okay well um before we have said down microscope and i think we still bought kind of think about microscope might be right but there was one other tool and that was the lunar orbiter 
230.2,Oliver,,oh where did you find that in the text ,to paragraph two like the first sentence of it 
230.2,Oliver,,yeah so i see where you're looking nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter so this is a really good thing that you were just able to do so when you were rereading you're able to see where you found your answer and you were able to find another part that you could add to it now that you've been able to add to your answer i'm going to suggest that you look again at where you found your first answer you found your first answer in paragraph three correct ,yeah paragraph 3 is about the microscope 
420.3,Oliver,,Look again and try again and see if you if it's actually talking about a microscope or if it's talking about something a little different. ,okay so reread part three yeah okay got it 
120.4,Farrah,,and student were you getting the same things as student since you're working together ,yeah we found those two pieces of equipment yeah the lunar orbiter and the microscope and it also talked about a cup like measuring the water 
420.3,Farrah,,oh i see you found that in paragaph two as well right for you student what i want you to do is try looking at paragraph two and see what they're talking about when they're talking about the cup and maybe why they mentioned that ,okay i'll look at that 
230.2,Luis,,okay so student student student since we've looked at jazmin's answer and luis's answer let's look a little closer at chris's answer so what did you all find when you were reading again and reading closely to see where student got his answer and what you might student yeah ,okay so um i don't know where student got his answer because if you read the story it's pretty clear that there weren't any craters full of water or anything it just says they were there was water like deep in the craters and so i would fix chris's answer i would say um that the scientists they found only a little bit of water and it was actually ice and they found it in the craters with on the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Oliver,,"so I can definitely see where he found his answer, but other than that. so when we picture craters we just picture like giant things one second go ahead ",oh god i'm so sorry to have to say that i looked at the clock and we really have to go on a launch now but i went on to say this was so helpful because you helped us on think about like how to keep thinking about our answer and keep going back and see why is this the best answer or why is something else the best answer and so by looking at the text again and asking ourselves questions that's going to help us make sure we have a fall and not a partial answer 
210.4,Farrah,,exactly ,hi good afternoon 
150.1,Farrah,,that afternoon how did we enjoy that text the water on the moon ,oh it was so cool 
150.1,Luis,,i'm glad you liked it does class want to share anything important that they read go ahead student ,well excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.2,Jazmin,,well good then you can help maybe our other friends understand some more about the water on the moon like the text that we read so i'm going to ask a quick question for class so feel free to answer and the question will be what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and use the information that you learn from in the text student ,nasa sent a small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,good did they give a name for what the machine was called ,nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
310.1,Chris,,who else would like to share good i like that you went back in the text and dug a little deeper to see if there was more information good job ,i'll share can i share 
310.1,Chris,,is that you student ,yeah well 
310.1,Chris,,go ahead ,scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
210.4,Chris,,wow and do we know what craters are ,they're like big on the kind of hard to describe but it's like it's like a whole but with a bottom and it's above ground instead of underground i don't know they're hard to describe 
210.4,Chris,,that was a great description yeah i'm looking in the text now and i see that it describes craters as dark places where the sun never shines ,oh yeah that's a good description too 
110.1,Farrah,,thank you who else would like to share what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon student ,well i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Oliver,,well so we're looking for what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon so you are right they probably would need a microscope to see anything that's so tiny that you can't see with your naked eye but we're looking to see what equipment they use to discover the water on the moon so if we look back in our text maybe someone can read from the text if you have it handy line that would indicate what equipment was used for science to discover water on the moon student what do you think ,okay well actually i had the same answer i student and so i found out in paragraph three and if you look there and says the water they found as microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you are looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope so i think that's what they use because you have to see something if you are going to find it 
210.2,Oliver,,you're right you wouldn't need the microscope in order to look at the water but in order to find the water what do we think they used they said something about investigating what did they used to investigate ,to investigate let me look for that water in the story well it says investigate in part two 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah and member student had said that they sent a small machine to investigate so do you think maybe they sent this machine to investigate and then once they found the water they were able to use a microscope to see the tiny pieces of water that like it the text says if you look straight at it we wouldn't be able to see it ,so you're saying like they use thought the lunar orbiter first after that on the astronauts to use the microscope just see it 
130.2,Chris,,that's what i think does class agree student you have something to say ,yo well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.2,Luis,,you're right yes scientists that work with nasa need a lot of equipment to be able to be able to safely do their expeditions they need oxygen like student said they need the proper space equipment if they're leaving our earth student you said you know a lot about space you want to share anything else these are all pieces of equipment that scientists might need if they're doing investigations that's a great point student ,yeah i actually i do because i know but the word orbit means like vehicles around something and so i'm thinking maybe that that there weren't asked astronaut spec has it doesn't even say the word astronaut anywhere in the story so like if there weren't even astronauts they wouldn't really need a microscope the astronauts walking around the whole moon holding a little microscope but that's kind of funny to think about 
150.1,Chris,,that is kind of funny so i'm student is right it says nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate do we see anywhere in the text that it says that there was an astronaut present i don't see that either i think that um student you were absolutely right that if an astronaut got sent to look at the moon they would definitely need the appropriate protection to be able to do so but now that i'm reading the text just like student said i din't pick up on this before either it doesn't look like there was an astronaut so we probably didn't need the equipment and and oxygen tanks and masks and things like that but i really liked that we were thinking maybe the next step maybe in the next step would be to bring an astronaut so i like that we were thinking did class else want to add something what do you say student ,maybe they'll send astronauts back after 
150.1,Chris,,maybe yeah i can ,get the water 
110.1,Oliver,,yeah maybe i guess we'll have to wait and see right yes student ,um well i just looked up a clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just want to say thank you so much for helping us understand how they use the different equipment and to look for that word investigate to find the best piece of equipment for the for a question but also knowing how they use like all the other kinds of equipment that we had also said and that really helped us feel like our answers where we're good an important one also know what the right answer was so thank you so much 
110.1,Farrah,,thank you and thank you for saying that student i hope you have a lunch hello friends how are we ,oh hi it's good to see you 
120.4,Luis,,you too okay so today we are talking about our article that we read about water on the moon and i see that you've all answered your questions here student do you have a question ,um yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
210.2,Luis,,wow i'm sure you know a lot of space but let's go over what our discussion question was and that question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and student i see that you wrote scientist use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks so let's just say for this question it says what equipment do we know what equipment means ,yeah yeah equipment like the stuff he used to do something 
210.2,Luis,,so student you answered equipment like oxygen tanks do you think that oxygen tanks were used to discover the water yeah it's kind of like a tool so they're asking what tool scientists used to discover water on the moon ,well it's like um maybe i mean they might not use the oxygen tanks to discover the water but they would need to have oxygen tanks on if there were astronauts there because otherwise they couldn't even get to discovering the water because they wouldn't have any oxygen and they wouldn't be alive and they couldn't discover the water 
130.1,Luis,,absolutely that is correct if there were astronauts there they would need oxygen but the oxygen tanks wouldn't be a tool to discover the water So I don't think it would be oxygen tanks. I do think those would be helpful. But I don't think that that is exactly what the scientists used to discover the water ,"Um, yeah, okay, I'll read it. Yeah. "
110.2,Jazmin,,okay i think that's a great idea now let's see student you also said that nasa sent a small machine great response ,thank you yeah i don't understand why my answers wrong 
420.3,Jazmin,,That article had a lot of detail about what that's all machine was and maybe how it helped to discover the water on the moon. so i think it would also be helpful for you to go back into the text and look and see if you can find any more details about that small machine that they named in our text ,okay 
230.3,Farrah,,now let's see let's see i'm student i really liked how you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ,yeah i knew i was looking for equipment and so that's why i found the microscope 
210.3,Farrah,,yeah and that's a great microscope helped us to look at the water but do you think it helped us to discover that water ,well i mean how could you discover something if it's too small to see you have to be able to see to find it 
210.4,Farrah,,But if we Investigate a little bit more into the text we might see that there was something that they used before they got to a microscope. and so do you think that if we look back in our texts there's something that says a piece of equipment that helped us to find that water before we used a microscope before they even got to look at the water they needed a sense of if there was water and so they sent something into the moon or on to the moon to help them discover that water ,you want me to read it again or well i mean i heard student talk about the small machine and stuff 
210.4,Chris,,yeah so i see i'm looking at the text to and i in our texts that it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so the first thing that the scientists did was investigate they needed to investigate the moon before they could even go in and see anything else so i think maybe our first step would be to think about what scientists did to prepare themselves what scientists knew or didn't know before they got to the moon before they got some use a microscope to look at their water yes student ,yeah okay so i went to nasa so i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks but also masks and suits 
130.2,Chris,,yes that's a very good point as well student and can someone remind me do we see in the text anywhere that there was any astronauts sent to the moon does class remember ,oh i don't think it's the word astronaut like and me were 
410.2,Chris,,so it does say the word astronaut and it says that water could be valuable for astronauts if there were astronauts present because they could drink that water but the text doesn't say that they sent any astronauts to the moon to find the water ,"Oh, okay. So it was like, Oh, it was an unmanned craft. Oh, I learned that word at NASA to "
120.4,Jazmin,,student and student do you have any suggestions on your answer how we could improve upon your answer oh wow i'm so impressed that you know that that's awesome student go ahead student ,okay so you said i have to look for more detail and so i found about this machine a few things so first it said that it was called the lunar orbiter and then also it said it looked for the ice deposits and the craters 
310.1,Oliver,,good i like that you went back into the text and you found specific details to share with us ,on so it's our it's time for us to goal right now but i wanted to say thank you for paying attention to each one of our answers and giving each one of us something specific to think about and talk about that really made us feel like you heard us and could help each and every one of us 
310.1,Farrah,,oh you're welcome oliveron thank you for saying thank you friends how are we ,oh we're good today how are you 
120.2,Luis,,good thank you i see that you class have just answered your question your you just answered the question about the text that we read about water on the moon yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,wow to know all about space you must know a lot ,i do 
120.2,Luis,,so let me ask you a question student and i see that you answered scientist use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks let's take a look in the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon in the text do you see anywhere that it says that the oxygen tanks helped to discover the water why don't you take a quick minute and think about that you can go back in the text and let's see if we see anything that says that oxygen tanks were an equipment used to discover the water the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the moon the water on the moon ,"Okay, yeah, I'll read it. "
210.3,Jazmin,,okay sounds good now let's see some other answers student i really liked that you noticed that nasa had sent a small machine do you notice anything else about the equipment that they mentioned ,like about the machine or about other equipment 
230.1,Jazmin,,so you said that they had sent a small machine did you mean that this small machine helped to discover the water on the moon ,yes yeah so that was my answer yeah 
210.3,Jazmin,,yeah so that's a great answer but i'm wondering if you can give me any more details for that ,Yeah. so yeah so i found it in part two and it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it will land at the mood south pole and look for ice deposits and the polar crate 
210.3,Jazmin,,good so now if we look at your answer to our question our question was what what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon and you said nasa sent a small machine looking at that question now and looking at what you just read we read in the text do you think that there's a way that you could improve upon your answer ,well i guess i could put more more like from the text so i could add like the name and how it works 
210.3,Farrah,,"I think that's a great idea. Jazmin. Okay. Hi, Farrah. ",hi um i don't understand why my answers wrong 
230.1,Farrah,,okay let's take a look at your answer so you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and student can you just clarify for me when you said you'd need a microscope to look really closely what do you mean what are they looking closely at ,so they're looking closely to find the water because it says that it's microscopic the water is so they're looking at the the really small water with the microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,yes but let me ask you a further question could they just send a microscope to space and find water or do you think that they need some sort of machine to discover the water ,is this about like how there's no astronauts so they need a machine 
210.4,Farrah,,well so if we refer back to the text i do see your point about them needing a microscope in order to see the water but before they get a microscope they use some sort of other equipment ,student was talking about that machine that looked in the craters 
210.4,Oliver,,yes good and so just like i mentioned to student is we want to make sure that we're reading our whole question and our question is about the equipment that scientists used to discover the water on the moon so we know that they needed the microscope to analyze it and to better see it but they needed something to help them understand if they're even was water on the moon student do you want to add something ,um yeah okay i think i can help student out because remember how like if there aren't astronauts then who would even be holding the microscope because like i picked that same answer to but now i see that like yeah you said you can't just send a microscope to the moon you have done something first 
210.4,Oliver,,yes and so student did they send astronauts do we see that they said they sent astronauts in the text no no so what did they send ,um so it has to be that lunar orbiter yeah i thought i was the microscope to student but now i changed my mind 
210.4,Oliver,,i think that's a great point though student is when we go back and we look into our texts and we remember our question we might better analyze what the question is actually asking us so if the question that asked us what what equipment did scientists use to better look at water we would absolutely say the microscope so i really liked that you went back in and saw some details student but first we needed to even understand if there was water on the moon and so that machine that lunar orbiter that we talked about helped us to understand if there was water on the moon ,oh it's time for us to go to lunch i'm so sorry this was really fun class but i just wanted to say on before we go thank you so much because you helped us see whether our answers actually connected to the question arm and that's why i changed my answer because i realized it didn't actually answer the question thank you so much for helping i see that 
210.4,Farrah,,thank you student good morning ,good morning 
210.4,Farrah,,my name is teacher ,it's nice to meet you 
150.1,Farrah,,nice to meet you i'm so happy to see five brilliant minds in front of me i want to go over a couple of things so did we just read an article ,about about water on the moon 
230.1,Luis,,great student can you build to your answer what else was that article about water can you add any other details ,well excuse me this is student i should i and i already know all about space 
110.1,Farrah,,what else was the article about student teacher okay student i want to hear what you have to say it's so important but i was still asking student if she could build to her answer because i want to know if there's more to the article than just water on the moon ,well it was also about the fact that the moon is a desert and the different the tool that they had to use when they found the water 
110.1,Farrah,,okay and and ,and my answer was the microscope that they use the microscope 
120.4,Luis,,okay friends usually in my classes when students agree we go like this but if you agree you can raise your hand if you disagree with savannas thoughts and just keep your hand down and we respectfully agree and respectfully disagree right so student agrees student agrees good student can you share what you were gonna share earlier thank you for waiting ,well i was just saying i shouldn't be in this class because i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,okay well maybe i don't know so can you tell me what what do you know about space maybe that you can teach the rest of us about ,oh i know a lot about space because i watch all sorts of youtube videos about rockets and all of the planets and stuff and so for the question i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they have to have the whole of rocket ship and everything that they need to prepare for that oh it's so cool to watch rocket launches and to learn about all the astronauts i just i really love space 
120.2,Jazmin,,great i love space to i want us to put on our science minds and only think about the article that we read so in the article that we read a read it out loud for us it is water on the moon the moon is a desert scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small i'm going to pause in read the discussion question the discussion question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon okay i'm going to continue reading number three that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely the discussion question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and i can read your answers that you submitted the first time ,yes so i saw that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.2,Jazmin,,i wouldn't say that your answer is wrong right but i want you to think about what made your mind think that what made your mind find that answer what did you read ,i read paragraph two where it says nasa nasa nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so i said a small machine 
420.3,Farrah,,"When we read an article, I want to make sure that you read through the whole thing and try to pull out pieces from the article for that discussion question. Do you guys do have the articles, excuse me, boys and girls do have the article in front of you. ",yes it's right here on our tablets 
120.4,Chris,,okay so let's all read read through it i think we have two minutes left and see if we can build on our answers i also want you to think of the thought processes that you had in getting there student you have a question ,or you went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff 
210.3,Oliver,,"i love that and i love how just like student you're using previous knowledge and you're making connections and it's so important So let's take the next two minutes to read through the article, you can have your previous answers. I love just add to them and then we'll talk about it. go ahead you have a question ",i just looked at the clock and we have to lunch now i'm really sorry because this cost was really fun but i just wanted to say thank you so much for reminding us that we really have to use the words that are in front of us and the story in front of us and and not just all the things that we already know like like student and student but we also have to use that story and use what it tells us when we answer the question that was really really helpful thank you so much 
210.3,Farrah,,welcome make sure you use the text have a great lunch and i'll see you a different time good morning friends ,hi good morning 
210.3,Farrah,,my name is teacher how is class today ,oh great how are you 
120.3,Luis,,very good thank you for asking so you just answered a question about i'm not exactly sure what it was with someone like to raise their hand and tell me what you just read and what you just answered student ,okay yeah so um we answered the question about the equipment and the water on the moon but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.3,Farrah,,oh i love to hear what you know about space right now i want to focus on the question that we had to ask what was it exactly do you have the text in front of you maybe someone can read it from their book from their icon ,okay so the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
120.4,Luis,,good class answered that question student what was your answer to that question ,um i said i'm that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
110.1,Jazmin,,student what was your answer to that question awesome thank you for sharing ,okay i said nasa sent a small machine 
120.4,Chris,,thank you for sharing student what was your answer ,and my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
110.1,Oliver,,student how is your answer wow thank you for sharing ,so i circled the same as student and we both thought it was the microscope 
230.1,Oliver,,so thank you for sharing i'm happy that you work with student did you get any answer independently ,oh yeah i mean i mean we both just thought if the same answer i mean so i thought the microscope and she thought our microscope um yeah 
110.1,Farrah,,i'm happy that you were able to learn from each other student ,um well my my full answer is you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
150.1,Oliver,,thank you for sharing and today is so important because no one's answer is wrong and i'm so excited that i got to hear all of your answers because together we can explore more about the moon and more about scientific tools and what scientists have used for their equipments to discover some moon aspects and i hear every student has a different answer that's so important because what does that tell me ,well some of us are right and some of us are wrong 
130.2,Jazmin,,oh ok i can see why you think that but i don't see it that way does class else have an idea why do we all have different answers ,maybe up there's more than one answer 
150.1,Jazmin,,very good student thank you for sharing so here nobody is wrong or nobody is right we're all going to learn together and we're going to explore why there are different tools and different equipment to help scientists to make different discoveries okay ,yeah okay that sounds good 
150.1,Jazmin,,so for the remainder of class we're going to break apart into groups or into part with you we're going to break apart and everyone's going to have an assigned partner to work with in with your partner i want you to share your answer and explain why you had that answer for two minutes and then i want our partners to switch in the person who did not share will then share okay so if you need it to me to write that down right number one what we're going to do get a piece of paper and a pencil oh yeah so number one when you work with your partner you're going to share your answer and explain to your partner why you found that answer in for number two you're going to listen and fully listen to your partner for number one the first task you have two minutes and for number two the second task you have two minutes okay so let me find your partners hold on one second ,we know who our partners i think we're ready to go 
130.2,Jazmin,,do you i actually have assigned partners for you i'm gonna have student and student work together student in student then work together and then i'm going to work with student ,okay okay 
150.1,Farrah,,any questions ,i think we're ready i think we're ready to go 
150.1,Farrah,,you're able to move and work with a partner then go ahead and do so ,on we we can move on but i promise the right people are working together 
150.1,Farrah,,let me know if you have any questions student ,you said it was my turn first 
110.1,Farrah,,yep so student i'm going to work with you so i can see that your answer reads you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ,yeah exactly 
230.2,Farrah,,and where did you get that idea from within the text if you notice the word so you can explain yes exactly where you found it ,yes i found it in in paragraph three on it some where they talk about how the waters microscopic 
120.3,Farrah,,all right give me one second i'm gonna pull it up so i can look at it with you i can see this is that you're talking about the water they found is microscopic can you continue reading that paragraph ,okay um so the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.2,Farrah,,very good and i love that answer because i can see that you noticed that the sentence had a scientific tool in it right was that a big clue for you ,yeah exactly i know that a microscope is a tool 
110.1,Oliver,,awesome thank you for sharing i want you ,teacher 
110.1,Farrah,,"Yes, one second. And I will be so happy to hear. Let me just finish up with Farrah first. ","Okay, read and look for a signal. "
420.3,Oliver,,yes so reread paragraphs one and two and look for other clues that have a hint towards scientific equipment okay and it's okay for you to circle some words that might help ,um yeah i'm really sorry but it's time for us to go actually um but i wanted to say i wish we'd all gotten to work with you and hear your your individual on comments cuz it sounded like you had a really good idea of how to help student 
420.3,Farrah,,yes and i'm hoping that we have more time to do so so i can help all the other students individually including you student ,oh hi miss teacher we're back 
420.3,Farrah,,how are you ,great we're excited to keep going 
150.1,Farrah,,okay so we're going to continue right where we left off student did you go back to your texts and reread paragraphs one and two ,yes i did 
150.1,Farrah,,okay are you ready to share what you got what the new partner ,well i didn't work with a partner yet i just rewrote it and i found that they talked about a machine 
130.2,Luis,,awesome so you're going to share what you found with student and i'm going to work with student independently student you have a question okay ,yeah i just want to remind you my dad is actually an astronaut 
110.3,Luis,,so interesting maybe you can use some of your background knowledge to add to your answer ,yeah i can do that 
150.1,Oliver,,so we're it's 558 right now at six o'clock you class you class have until six o'clock to work with your partner are there any questions ,no i think that sounds good 
120.4,Oliver,,student can you read to me what your answer was to number one ,yeah um so my answer is the microscope 
230.1,Oliver,,why is that your answer ,okay well um it said a piece of equipment and a microscope is equipment and you need it to look at the water 
150.1,Oliver,,excellent well what paragraph did you get that from i love how you identify the microscope as a scientific tool i would love if you could do the same for paragraph one and paragraph two are you able to add to your answer ,not yet i'm i right now i mean i know what the microscope is a tool 
210.3,Oliver,,do you think that there are more or different kinds of tools that scientists use on the moon ,um yeah um there's definitely other things like i was working with student and he has had his answer was the oxygen tanks 
210.3,Oliver,,so did your original answer change in any way after working with student ,no no because um i don't really think the oxygen tanks have anything to do with discovering water 
230.1,Oliver,,okay and why not ,well you don't use them for discovering you just use them for breathing 
120.3,Oliver,,can you reread the question to me ,yeah on what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the mound 
210.4,Oliver,,i want you to think of how what is the processes that scientists go through to get to the moon what ,oh what were you saying 
210.4,Oliver,,once scientists are on the moon they use more equipment even more to make more discoveries so i want you to think of what a scientist does throughout all of the processes and think of what different kinds of tools he uses ,okay you want me to take some time and think about it or just try to tell you right now 
420.3,Chris,,you can brainstorm independently and then go back to text paragraphs one and paragraph two ,Isn't my turn. 
420.3,Chris,,who's asking that ,student oh sorry student i figured i was next 
110.1,Chris,,student i'm going to work with you independently in one minute okay ,okay 
120.4,Chris,,well let me just review do you want to share something ,sure so i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and that connects to what student was just talking about so i wanted to share it 
150.1,Luis,,Thank you for asking. Luis. Then I'm going to work with you. ,sweet 
130.2,Luis,,student you can go with who doesn't have a partner right now ,oh it must be it must be student 
130.2,Luis,,student and student should be working together ,oh so it's student and so i don't know 
120.4,Luis,,okay student i'll work with you independently student what was your answer to the question ,okay it was um scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
230.1,Luis,,excellent and what did you did you work with your partner just now ,um yeah it was student he said he thought my answer was wrong but i definitely don't agree 
230.1,Luis,,why not ,well if there's astronauts on the moon they need oxygen tanks 
120.4,Luis,,i agree student have a different tool that he found ,yeah the microscope 
130.2,Luis,,you agree with that ,um now i mean maybe they used it but it sounded more like it was kind of like after after they found the water than they had to like study it but um i think that that oxygen tanks are probably more important okay 
120.3,Luis,,can you reread the question to me ,yeah what equipment did scientists to us to discover water on the moon 
420.3,Oliver,,excellent so the question asks what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon not which equipment was more important so i work from all the different students that each student found a different tool to use right and no student is wrong we all have different ideas and together we can put our ideas and put our ideas together and have a whole list of tools that help scientists discover the water on the moon even i want you to go back to the text and reread pragraphs one and three and find different tools that scientists use you can circle hints or i guess i can help you yeah ,oh yeah nice teacher i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but um i wanted to say having us and listen to each other's answers was really interesting because like you said it sounds like there's a lot of different tools the astronauts use it was really fun to hear all about them 
420.3,Farrah,,excellent i'm happy that you were able to add to your answer and make some changes thanks hello friends ,hi hi nice to see you 
120.4,Luis,,good to see you too i think that we should talk about our answers and relating to the text that we just read because i'm on getting the idea that you may not have completely understood the equipment that was used to find that water on the moon teacher student can you tell me what you what you thought ,i'm excuse me excuse me this is student 
110.3,Luis,,hi student um yeah i should be in this class i already know all about space but there's a certain tool and i want us to go back in the text and find where it says um that we use a certain that scientists use a certain tool or a piece of equipment um to investigate the water on the moon okay i know it's awesome that you know so much about space and you do you really do know a lot about space so do you have that text in front of you ,um yeah we've all bought it on our tablets 
120.2,Luis,,okay awesome so i'm going to give you a moment to reread the text and then i'd like you to give me a thumbs up or raise your hand when you're ready to share what you think is the piece of technology that we use that the scientists used to find ,oh okay 
120.1,Farrah,,water okay so i'm going to give you one minute to reread or five minutes to read the text ,i think we're all ready 
120.1,Farrah,,all right i see that my friends are ready okay so um student what would you like to share ,well i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay so you're absolutely right and it's not your answer isn't wrong you do need a microscope to find the part the particles of water that they found because it was so microscopic that you needed a microscope to see it but the question that i'm asking is what what piece of equipment was needed in order to find that water they used to different um they used a different source of equipment did class have a different answer than student student what did you think ,oh i'm sorry i was raising my hand 
130.2,Jazmin,,oh okay student ,yeah cuz i have a different answer from student and i said that nasa sent a small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah i'm nasa did send a small machine do you remember what that small machine was called ,oh 
210.4,Jazmin,,can you go back and yeah maybe if you finish that sentence you might be able to bring us to the right answer can you read that out loud for us where ,nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Chris,,yeah that's absolutely correct so the lunar orbiter is what was used so that the scientists could discover that that water that was what was used so that they could discover the water when they wanted to observe the water further that was when like student said they used a microscope but when we go back and read the text it was the lunar orbiter that was used to to discover that water yes student ,when i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah you're absolutely right here and thank you for making that connection and sharing those ideas with us because those are things that we might not know but because you have that experience with nasa you're able to share that with us and i really appreciate it but with this specific question the answer that is correct is is the lunar orbiter that was the specific source of equipment that was used to determine that there was water does class understand that can you give me a thumbs up or raise your hand if you if that is making sense ,i'm still a little confused actually 
230.1,Oliver,,okay what are you ,um i understand what you're saying cause the lunar orbiter sounds like it's still right answer but i had the same answer also student and i guess i'm just not sure like how i would know that my answer is wrong without without you telling us it's the lunar orbiter 
150.1,Oliver,,so if we go back and the text let me go back number three paragraph three the last sentence says you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so that is one scientific tool that would be used if you wanted to look really closely at the water but the question was um what what equipment was used so that they could find the water to begin with so it's a different source of equipment does that make sense when you go back and look at the question that was asked ,oh yeah well i was thinking like how could you find something if you couldn't see it but i i got that maybe you have to find it first and then you can observe it 
150.1,Oliver,,does class else have any more questions yeah that's exactly right student or need more clarification ,i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch actually but i just wanted to say thank you so much for coming today and for helping us understand why i'm the lunar orbiter was the best to answer for the question um so thank you so much 
150.1,Farrah,,of course thank you friends remember to read the questions that are asked really carefully before you answer because it might be easy to jump to the quickest or fastest idea that pops into your brain but sometimes you have to read the specifically what the question is asking you okay so i hope you all have a great lunch hello friends how are you doing today ,oh hi it's good to see you we're we're all doing well 
120.2,Luis,,it's good to see you too i'm teacher and i'm going to go over this question based on the text that we read so i saw that we had the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space. "
120.2,Jazmin,,"student i think it's awesome that you know so much about space and i really appreciate you sharing that with me but we're going to go over this question together because i think that all of us had a little bit of misunderstanding with this question so i'm just here to clarify the answer for us and i want to lead us to the right answer today Okay, so can we look back in the text. I'm at the question that was asked, it was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. raise your hand if you know student ",well i think the action word is discover 
120.4,Farrah,,yeah you're exactly right student so i want us to go back and reread the text and i want you to look for the action word discover because i think that will lead us to the answer as to what equipment was used to discover water on the moon Let's see if we can find a new equipment that maybe we didn't write for our answer. when you know you can raise your hand and i will call on you student what do you think student ,okay so i'm sorry alright so i think that thought well so i couldn't find the word discover in the story but i think that in order to discover the water that you'd need to find you need the microscope because how can you discover something if it's too small to see 
420.3,Farrah,,oh student you're absolutely right the word discover isn't here but i want you to look actually i'm going to give you another minute to look back in the text for a word that is a synonym for discover ,Okay. 
120.3,Jazmin,,okay class looked back and paragraph two Jazmin. ,well so the word that's kind of like discover is investigate and i found my answer in the same sentence as that word i said nasa sent a small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Luis,,student nasa did send a small machine but you if you read on in that sentence there's a name for that small machine that you didn't use in your answer can someone identify the name of that small machine who can tell me the name of the small machine that nasa sent to investigate student ,yep yep i totally got this one it is the lunar orbiter student that's right there and the story i can't believe you didn't get the name that's all right there 
420.1,Chris,,oh student let's be kind to our friends that's really not the way we treat each other in the classroom so um you're right student it is the lunar orbiter but you didn't write that for your answer either we all didn't write it for our answer and that's why i'm working with you today to get you to the correct answer the right answer is the lunar orbiter because it is what nasa sent on to investigate the water on the moon it the lunar orbiter is the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon now some of you wrote that um the microscope was used to discover the water now they didn't use a microscope to discover the water they use it after they discovered the water to look more closely at it but the question is asking what equipment was used to discover the water and that's where it gets tricky but friends if we pay attention to the keywords in our question we can really think more critically about how we're going to answer that question and we can go back in the text and try to find words keywords that stand out to us ,yeah oh hi i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah you're absolutely right student thank you for sharing with us we all seem to know a lot about space and about nasa um but i just wanted to go over that specific question with all of you today so that you can realize that the equipment that they use to discover though that water was the lunar orbiter so that should have been the answer that we wrote down the lunar orbiter is what was used to investigate into find that water and know it gets a little confusing so we have to really read our texts carefully and look at the keywords because we might think it could be the microscope because that's another equipment that's thrown into the text right but that equipment was used only after the water was discovered ,"Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense. And I'm actually, it's, it's time for us to go right now, but I wanted to say thank you for really emphasizing the key word discover and how if we look for a word, kind of like it in the story will find the very best to answer. "
210.4,Farrah,,okay i'm really glad that i could help you all today i hope you have a good lunch hello friends how are you doing today ,we're good thank you for asking 
120.2,Luis,,okay i got us into this class because i wanted to clarify a question that we answered because i want to reread some parts of the text so that we can find the correct answers the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable um so i want yes student ,um i just want to remind you my dad is actually an astronaut 
120.4,Chris,,wow that's so cool i really appreciate you sharing that with me So I'm going to give you a minute to go back and look for that word and see if it changes your answer in any way so i'm going to give you a minute to go back and read ready when you have a new idea you can raise your hand has class is thinking changed since we first answered the question so class have any new ideas student what do you think ,okay so look for the word valuable okay and i only found it in one spot at the very beginning where it says water on the moon would be a valuable resource so it sounds like the answer is yes 
210.2,Oliver,,yes the answer is yes i'm the question however access to think about um is there convincing evidence can someone tell me what evidence means what's the evidence mean hmm let's put on our thinking caps student ,evidence is like something from the story the part of the story that you bought your answer from 
420.3,Jazmin,,"That we're looking for evidence is to go back in the text in look for examples, the texts will be giving us examples of why water is a valuable resource. So if we read on, we can find examples within the text or evidence so that we can answer this question More completely into the best of our ability. student ",well i got a new idea when i read it for the second time and so my new idea is that you can use water to grow things so we could have a garden on the womb 
120.4,Luis,,"wow yeah you're exactly right water we do use water to grow things i'm not sure that that would work on the moon because the moon is is really dry it's like the driest desert on earth we only have very small microscopic amounts of water that was found on the moon so i don't think that we could um i don't think that we could grow plants per se but water has other uses on the moon Why is water, an important resource the texts will say it for us if we read on. So I want us to go back into the text. so let's do that for another minute i want us to look for explicitly stated examples in the text when you're ready you can raise your hand when you have an example raise your hand student what's your example ",my example as water can be broken down into two parts oxygen and hydrogen 
230.1,Luis,,okay why does that make it a valuable resource that's exactly true that it can be broken down into two parts but if we read on and we get the complete idea if we finish the the thought in the text and we keep reading we may learn why that's important why does that make it valuable ,um okay yeah so um it's valuable because i'm so it can be broken down into hydrogen oxygen and then oh um okay so astronauts could breed the oxygen i mean of course and then oh oh this part is so cool okay oxygen hydrogen could be used for rocket for your wall 
130.2,Farrah,,yeah you're exactly right student there's so many different ways that astronauts can use water it's such a valuable resource does class did class else find other examples student ,oh okay so i was thinking something a little different and it's still from the text there's still evidence so it says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money so i think that it wouldn't be valuable for a long time 
130.2,Oliver,,yeah i think you're right i think that it might take scientists a long time to use that water but that doesn't mean that it's any less valuable because i think that there are lots of different ways that it can be valuable if we look back in the text the text will give us so many different examples so i hope that we can modify i hope that we can change our answers after reading the text because now we have sources of evidence student gave an example student do you have an example of why water is valuable for for astronauts ,well i was thinking about another meaning of the word value like i'm like money and it talks about money and it says it would take a lot of money so i was thinking it's not valuable because it takes too much money 
120.2,Oliver,,yeah it's still valuable though you're right value can mean money to that value has a double meaning but in this sense the valuable in the question means is it a good resource that water on the moon is it a good resource and why and if we go back in the text weekend find detailed descriptions and examples of why the water is valuable and can we find one more example because i want us to be prepared to re answer this question and in complete sentences to the best of our ability and finishing our thoughts um i want us to go back in and answer our question again so does class have another example that we could use of of convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ,i wish we had time to hear another answer but actually we have to go to lunch but this is a really fun class i don't want to end what thank you because you really helped us think about using evidence evidence from the text in order to answer the question and also you helped us know how to make a complete answer like if you read a little further sometimes and you add more detail your answer can be better and make a lot more sense 
120.2,Farrah,,yeah exactly i really hope that this was helpful and that we can modify our answers so that we can provide evidence that the text gives us in our answers good morning ,good morning good morning 
120.2,Farrah,,how's class today ,oh well you're good thank you for asking 
220.1,Luis,,so i've seend all responses and i would like for you class to use evidence from the text to support your answer does class know what i mean by using evidence from the text ,what excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,so right if you know things about space but there's always more that we can learn it's not that you don't know things about space as to why you're in this class because we can have a better understanding ,oh ok ok ok that makes sense 
210.3,Luis,,student would you like to answer my question of how we can use everything from the tech to support our answers ,so does that mean like i'm like you have to use a word from the story 
110.4,Luis,,you're off to a good start like how you said he's a word from the story ,"Oh, okay. That makes sense. Yeah. "
120.4,Farrah,,and the question so two questions the two questions that will one of the questions that we had is what equipment did scientists you to discover water on the moon would class like to share out the answer as to what they believe scientists used to discover water on the moon student ,i said scientists used a microscope to look really closely 
230.2,Farrah,,hmm i like the way you're thinking can you explain why or anywhere in the article where you've seen that a microscope was used ,yeah so it's on paragraph paragraph three it says scientists need a scientific tool called a microscope because the water the water is so small 
110.1,Jazmin,,does class agree with student if you agree can raise your hand and if you would like to add on to why you agree or if you have another quote from the text thank you student appreciate that thank you so much student ,i said that that's the scientists nasa center small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.3,Jazmin,,your answer isn't really wrong it's not wrong student Do you understand what I'm saying. so you said a small machine but what some machine would you be talking about ,yeah yeah um so it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
130.2,Oliver,,thank you see that was a much more detailed answer you just added more detail to your first answer so you wasn't wrong you just added more detail to show your understanding thank you for that student would class else like to add on student student or student to the first question ,um yeah it's student and i i have the same answer as student also found out about the microscope and so is it a microscope or or is it one machine called the lunar orbiter which one is it 
130.3,Oliver,,the correct answer is a lunar orbiter yes ,well a microscope is a tool like equipment like it says in the question 
130.3,Oliver,,one moment please you repeat your question please ,oh yeah so i have the same answer student and i thought it was the microscope so oh but you said also lunar orbiter and i'm i don't know why it doesn't microscope because microscope is also equipment 
210.4,Chris,,okay yes i'm sorry it is a microscope is used to view things that are small so being that water i'm the components of water so small you need a microscope to see yes student ,well i'm point to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Chris,,okay thank you for sharing that information but in a connection to the text and the question we have to think about the equipment that is used to discover water on the moon that is true they do use a lot of equipment But to identify the water they use a microscope ,okay so since since story didn't talk about those things then it's not the right answer Home. Okay. Okay. 
210.4,Oliver,,thank you for your question hasson so for the second question is there convincing evidence that water on can be valuable yes ,on what actually are two o'clock and we left a good lunch what i wanted to say thank you for really reminding us that we had to use evidence from the text that was so helpful and i know it's going to help us with all our questions in the future so thank you for reminding us and being so patient with us today 
210.4,Farrah,,thank you class i really appreciate it okay good evening class ,hi it's good to see you 
120.4,Luis,,nice to see you all as well so today i would like to go over some of the questions two questions that you class have answered i know that you all have burning answer an average if i to go over with you are student do you have a question ,yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
420.1,Farrah,,that's good this class wasn't formed because you don't know about space it's just sometimes we can learn more when we work together in small groups are like first of all to work together so we can learn from each other and work on bettering our responses to certain questions so we can strengthen our skills so the first question says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon i would like for you class to think about that question and the question i would like for you to think what is the most important parts of the question that you need to know in order to answer the question specifically with what it's asking so what words should we really pay attention to when trying to answer that question i'll read the question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so what words should we really pay attention to when trying to answer that question student ,okay so i think that you should focus on the word equipment because that tells you that the answer it has to be like a thing or a tool 
130.2,Chris,,thank you for that answer student thank you i agree it is very that is an important word to pay attention to equipment is does class else have an answer that they would like to contribute student ,okay so i picked a different word and i thought that the most important word was water because that is really what the story is about water on the moon 
210.4,Chris,,and what about water on the moon what's going on with this water ,so there are these craters full of water on the moon and the scientists discovered it because they used to think there wasn't water but now they know that there is 
120.4,Jazmin,,yes thank you student thank you student for contributing that and for answering my question i agree i think equipment is an important word to focus on in the fact that water on the moon is being discovered so now that we know these two things we know what we're looking for a while reading the text we know that we're looking specifically for equipment and the equipment is used to discover water on the moon so thank you for that thank you for answering the question so who would like to share what their response was to that question student ,okay my answer is that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,"When they read our answer to the question, they should, they should be able to know what it is we're talking about. They should be able to learn something. So, yes. you were on to the right path of getting to the answer that nasa sent a small machine they did but can you tell me more about the machine can you be more specific while using evidence from the text something to support your answer what type of machine was it ",okay i can try okay so nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it lands at the moon south pole and it looks for the ice deposits in the craters 
120.4,Farrah,,"and I'm sure if someone who has never read this informational texts before if they read your answer. They would be able to learn something, because he was very specific in describing what the machine was and what it did. Thank you. Jazmin. would class else like to raise your hand and share what they answered for that question student ",okay um my answer was different from jazmin's i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.2,Farrah,,and student would you mind talking about how did you get that answer what in the text caused you to answer that ,so there's this part on part three and it says the water is microscopic so how can you discover something microscopic if you can't see it that's why i thought you'd need the microscope 
150.1,Farrah,,yes that is true that the water on the moon is microscopic but as the first with the first step that we did with reviewing the question it's very important to know what is being asked so when you know what's being asked of you you'll have a more clear understanding of how what your answer and how you should answer one moment please going back to the question what equipment the scientists used to discover water on the moon did they say did they ask about how do they see the water know they asked what was you to discover water so yes that is true that the water is so small you need a microscope but that's not what's really being asked of us do you understand ,yeah okay that makes more sense okay 
110.1,Chris,,thank you student for sure student ,so i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.4,Chris,,yes is that what you answer for the question student ,oh no but we were just talking about the equipment and so that made me think of that and i thought probably they would have to use those things too don't you think 
130.1,Oliver,,"So yes, that equipment can be been gone to the moon. And in the process, but that's not the exact equipment that is used to discover the water, Oliver. ",i'm i'm really sorry but we have to go i wanted to say before we go thank you for really helping us understand the question and the question was about the word discover because that helped us well at least that helped me really understand what the best to answer was 
130.1,Farrah,,thank you hello ,hello again 
120.2,Luis,,so i like to go over question number two with you class it we is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ,"Um, I just wanted to remind you, my dad and actually an astronaut. "
420.1,Jazmin,,oh that's pretty nice student right now we're answering the question okay so once we answer the question and finish what we're doing here maybe they'll have extra time to talk about stuff that relates to a question okay so as i was saying What is some important words that we need to pay attention to in the question or important part to this sentence. student ,okay i would say an important part of the question is the word evidence 
230.1,Jazmin,,and why do you think that's an important part of the question ,well i think it means that you can't just like think of something on your own but you have to read what's in the story 
430.2,Oliver,,yes we have to read what's in the story when we answer the question of support and that we use what we read in this story to support our answer we don't just want to say yes water on the moon is valuable you want to use the text for our answers ,"I was thinking, another really important one is convincing because your reasons like your evidence after be really glad, or else the people listening to your answer. They won't be convinced. "
110.1,Farrah,,that's also a good point thank you student yes convincing evidence thank you for that Farrah. ,is it valuable 
230.1,Farrah,,why do you think valuable tell me more please ,i think we need to come up with reasons why the water would be like important that's another meaning for valuable 
120.4,Jazmin,,thank you yes that is another meaningful valuable important or something worth worth well yes so we need to find information from the text that is convincing to support our answer of water on the moon being valuable student but who would like to raise their hand and answer is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ,well i have a few things to say so my first answer was it was let me look at it again okay so my first answer was yes and uh my evidence from the text is that astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated and you can't survive without water and then the more i thought about it like thinking about valuable like convincing reasons it would be valuable i was also thinking that you could use water to grow things and you could have a garden on the moon 
230.2,Jazmin,,but yes your first portion of the answer that astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated that's very important that that's not quite really answering the question like as we go on but going back to the question with the part of the question that says evidence that water on the moon can be valuable what are some things that are listed in the text yes a garden can regrow but does it say that in the text ,no it talks about the drinking drinking water but i guess i was just thinking about why water is valuable because student was just talking about that word and that's what made me think about the garden 
420.2,Chris,,that's very true what you said but as i said earlier we really want to be sure that we're answering what's being asked we don't want to talk about things that are not in the text or what they're not really asking us because that can be a little confusing yes student ,okay i have an idea and it's that that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
230.2,Chris,,yes did you see that in the text ,in part two 
230.1,Chris,,yes so why is that valuable why is that important ,oh okay here it is um so they need oxygen the astronauts need oxygen 
210.4,Chris,,yes and what could the hydrogen ,oh i know there's i know there's i know there's i know this 
130.2,Luis,,student would you like to help student oh ,yeah i'm student you just need to read the next sentence extra right thing or access oxygen and a high to use as a rocket fuel 
130.2,Farrah,,student ,"Well, I would say. that you can look at the most important words in the question Well, I think the most important words in the question they kind of tell you what to look for when you read the story. "
420.1,Oliver,,when answering the question we want to look at important words ,i'm not but i have something else to say 
120.4,Oliver,,one moment student if you have something to say ,no i was done um well i looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just i really appreciate how you taught us how to take a question apart and how you also taught us to really look for evidence that our answers they have to come from the text 
150.1,Luis,,thank you alright welcome back from lunch for our next part of our discussion we're going to talk about why it's such a big deal that water is on the moon ,um yeah i you know i really got this figured out i think i'm all good 
230.1,Luis,,oh go ahead and tell us what you got figured out ,um i meant more like i have it figured out like i can go back to my seat 
120.4,Luis,,oh well let's let's talk about your answer because maybe if your answer so great if we can probably help some of the others who are here so tell us about why water is why what evidence is there that water could be so valuable to have on the moon ,yeah so you can take water and you can split it into two parts you can make oxygen and hydrogen 
230.1,Luis,,hmm that's so what why is that such an important thing ,well because you can have those chemicals 
430.2,Luis,,yeah i agree that you can do a lot with those too so my concern is that you did identify an important piece of evidence but didn't explain why that's so valuable so my suggestion would be to add a reason for why it's so valuable to have those chemicals ,oh like what you can do with them yeah yeah okay i can do that 
230.3,Oliver,,great while student is revising let's go we'll go we'll start on the other side so student and student i noticed that once again you class must have worked together because you have some similar answers ,yeah we always work together 
230.3,Farrah,,you make it it's just a dream class over there on that side of the table so you you wrote ,i just we're kind of friends but kind of not 
230.3,Farrah,,oh okay it's complicated i got you so you both wrote that this isn't that using this water isn't something that's going to happen anytime soon is that right ,yeah we were thinking that like maybe it's valuable like 50 years in the future or i don't know at some point in the future but we were thinking that because this question was like is there convincing evidence that water is valuable and we we thinking like no it's not valuable yet 
420.2,Farrah,,yeah i like how you're thinking very much like what can we do right now with this stuff but let's look at the question i'm concerned because you said when you read the question out loud just now you read it as is water on the moon valuable right now but the question actually says could it be valuable at some point in the future so my suggestion would be to find some reasons why even in that long future that you identified why could it be important to have in the future ,that's a really good point okay i think we can do this 
120.4,Jazmin,,so let's see student and student who would like to share next ,well i can share yes that astronauts can drink the water to be hydrated and you can't survive without water 
230.1,Jazmin,,i agree that that's that's crucial piece of information for us here on earth to you none of us can survive without water for sure is that why you found that piece of information as a key piece ,yeah it's like yeah i think that's why water is valuable 
420.2,Jazmin,,so you identify why water is valuable but one thing that i'm concerned about is that your answer isn't specific to just the moon and we're really thinking about why is it such a big deal that water's on the moon so my suggestion would be to keep what you have but now make a connection to why it's important that water is there on the moon ,like ok so like saying why water's important and then say like okay i think that makes sense so like looking and saying like why is it important up on the moon that it's already there Okay. Let me take a look. 
120.4,Chris,,all right student you're up next ,so i heard i read on facebook by uncle posts a lot of stuff and i read on facebook that there could be a base on the moon that there was maybe one already but there was definitely going to be one by 2024 
230.1,Chris,,so you wrote about water being heavy i would love to go i wonder i hope that they're selling tickets soon to the moon base so that it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore what did you mean by that ,well like it's heavy to carry water and i remember there was like diet asset that show like where they were all this stuff and they were saying that water was one of the heaviest and one of the hardest things to carry into space so if they already have it in space you don't need to bring any with them 
420.2,Chris,,"that's true i agree that's a super that's really helpful for nasa To explain what benefit can the astronauts or can NASA have that they don't have to carry this water anymore, so what what other benefit does that provide see if you can expand your answer a little. ",okay i'll take a look 
120.4,Oliver,,so student and student did you find or did you revise your answers yet ,oh yeah we did ciz we took a look and say we we thought about this question cuz it was asking could it be valuable yeah we were trying to figure out like okay like could it be valuable as opposed to like is it valuable like right now at that was actually really interesting to look at so like basically we want to to revise our answer to say that it would be very valuable um you could use it to make rocket fuel by splitting it into it's like different chemical parts um you could use it to greek arm you could like use it for those things and and maybe you could grow a moon garden which they didn't have in the reading but i thought was an interesting idea 
110.1,Oliver,,i love that then we could have moon flowers ,i would love moon flowers 
110.1,Farrah,,yeah yeah student ,so fortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for being with us and like in particular i just wanted to say like you really explained like what we needed to work on and i thought maybe that would be hard to hear but actually it was really how i class like it's nice to know like when we we weren't quite right and then we were able to be like okay because then you have this figure out what we should work and it was really helpful because then that i knew that i was going to shift and not going a different direction so thank you so much bye 
220.1,Luis,,bye hi class i am your teacher and it's so great to see you all today i'm excited to work with you on trying to oliverelop really complete answers based on a text that we read into sort of think about different strategies we can use as well student i see you have your hand raised would you like to share ,yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
230.1,Luis,,well thank you for sharing that i'm really glad that you have all of this background knowledge already and maybe you can help others in our class today and student did your background knowledge help you with your answer to the question i see that you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks is that did you think about that from your background knowledge ,um yeah because if the astronauts were falling to the moon to find the water they definitely needed oxygen tanks 100 i'm positive 
120.2,Oliver,,"awesome i love how confident you are in your answer and i love that you're thinking about what these astronauts would need to be in space another strategy that we can use when we're answering these questions is to really focus on the keywords in our question circle the keywords in our question our action words the most important words in our texts in our question here and once you have a keyword you can raise your hand reread our question here what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon All right, alright Oliver why don't you start us off. ",okay so in the question a word that i circled was equipment 
110.1,Chris,,student you also had your hand raised equipment great that's an excellent word to circle thank you ,yeah so the word that i circled in the question is water 
110.1,Jazmin,,water great that's another awesome word in our question student did you have another word to share ,and the one that i picked was discover 
110.1,Luis,,so now student going back to your response you did a great job talking about equipment that scientists use but do you think that the oxygen tanks themselves were what was used to disk to discover the water on the moon discover great that's definitely our action word discover ,well what oxygen tanks would do was they would have the astronaut stay alive while they were looking for the water 
120.4,Farrah,,great guess that's definitely true but i would like you student to reread paragraph two and try to circle specific words like equipment that maybe tell ius what astronauts used to discover the water okay and while you do that i'm going to have another student share their response does another student want to share their their answer student yes ,okay so um i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Farrah,,alright and student i see you circled the same as well so we can address both of you together here so can student can you tell me what does a microscope do ,okay well a microscope and helps you see things that are really really small and in the story except the water was really really small microscopic 
210.2,Oliver,,that's an excellent strategy to be looking at the text and pulling out those keywords but student do you remember what our key action word in our question was ,um yeah i think student said it and it was discover 
210.2,Farrah,,discover great and student do you know what another word for discover might be ,find 
210.3,Farrah,,yes exactly so discover means to find in a microscope we're talking about seeing things so do we think that the microscope itself helped to find the water or maybe they they looked at the water with the microscope ,oh okay well it sounds like maybe they just use the microscope to look but i guess what i had been thinking is how can you find it if you can't see it 
210.4,Farrah,,yes that's an excellent point i think here in the text what they did was they first found the water and they could see the water and then to look even close even a little bit closer they they had to use the microscope okay ,okay okay yeah i'm i'm starting to get a picture of this now 
210.4,Chris,,perfect great now student i see your hand is raised ,yeah well i just wanted to say so i actually went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.4,Chris,,wow that's awesome i love that you have that background knowledge and i think that that's an excellent strategy for class to think about when we're reading a text is to think what knowledge do i already have that i can bring to this text to help me understand the text better and so student did that help you answer the question what was your answer ,at the sulfur for my answer i said that the scientists found the creator's full of water on the moon 
120.3,Chris,,because the text does tell us that they found the water in the craters awesome great and i love how you're all looking back at the text but i would like for you to reread for me the first sentence of paragraph three can you read that allowed for us student ,oh yeah okay it says this means the room is still drier than the driest desert on earth 
210.3,Chris,,yes so i see that you had said that the craters were full of water on the moon but does it seem like there's a lot of water in these craters or maybe just a little bit ,well i mean that part definitely just a little bit 
230.3,Oliver,,yeah definitely and i think your answer is really telling us where they found the tech where they found the water but def i see you have something to say ,yeah so um i just actually looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i just wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to carefully explain the different action words for the different tools i'm using that keyword really helped me in student figure out that microscope part so thank you so much 
230.3,Chris,,great you're welcome i'm glad that you had a good time today it was great meeting you all okay i think i'm ready please start simulation welcome to the class ,thanks hi teacher how are you 
230.1,Luis,,good student and i just sorry or sir could you please just explain your answer a little bit to me ,sure excuse me teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.1,Luis,,oh isn't ,yes 
110.1,Chris,,i think can you just let the student finishes answer and i will get back to you later ,yeah yeah okay so here are my answer was a scientist on craters full of water on the moon 
230.1,Chris,,yes can you tell me like how can you come up with this answer ,um yeah so i was looking for the words like equipment and finding or discovering water on the moon and it was in the first paragraph that i saw that they said um let's see okay this indices scientists have found evidence the water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters so they talk about finding water on the moon in that sentence and scientists to 
230.1,Chris,,yeah yeah i see student i really liked that you Concern would be like. in that question like is they are asking what equipment good scientists to use to discover so maybe you can just look for some synthesis related ,Oh yeah I guess I forgot about that part. Okay yeah sure. 
230.1,Jazmin,,okay student ,excuse me teacher 
230.1,Jazmin,,yeah ,i got my answer from the second paragraph so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay so can you tell me again what your answer is ,yeah i said nasa sent a small machine okay that's right out of the second paragraph which you told student to look 
430.2,Jazmin,,okay good i'm really happy that you are That. yeah he i'm worry about like the in the question the scientists asked what equipment did scientists they use so can you tell me like what exactly equipment the scientists to use i saw you just say a small machine can you tell me the name of the machine ,i don't remember the name of it um lunar orbiter okay it's a lunar orbiter 
520.1,Jazmin,,okay great so next time you see this kind of question please be as specific as you can to answer the question okay ,oh okay 
520.1,Chris,,okay ,oh no teacher i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like um oxygen tanks and masks and soups 
150.1,Chris,,about this. was a necessity to yeah but the one of the tips that i can share with you is when you are like reading a passage just try not to bring too much background information into this really activity just try to read closely about the passage just focus on first and to figuring out what the owns author is trying to tell you so like you won't be like distracted by other informations so let's get back to the tax have you found the correct answer student ,okay so in the second paragraph i saw that on them the equipment that student just said the lunar orbiter 
110.1,Chris,,yeah yeah great ,okay so that's the answer 
110.1,Chris,,yes so uh like ,guess i just didn't know how to how to change my answer should i just say i'm scientists use the lunar orbiter and found craters full of water on the moon 
230.2,Chris,,yes can you tell me like what executive answer did you finding the passage ,oh 
230.2,Chris,,yeah which line it's ,the lunar orbiter will learn at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large pool of crater so 
210.3,Chris,,yes i guess i sell out oh yeah so okay did you see the differences between the sentence and your previous answer ,yeah yeah cuz i'm this one the one i just read says they'll look for ice deposit in a large polar crater in my sentence says they found craters full of water so i mean it's it's it the both of them talk about the crater but i guess in the this sentence it says ice and not water i guess that's the difference 
110.1,Chris,,yeah i'm glad you find the differences and when you compare this answer one suggestion that i would like to give you is to bear the question in mind and you will always want to be know what this author is trying to tell us right so can you just go back to the answer and a ,"Okay, better better like about the question or just any keyword to the answer. "
120.2,Oliver,,the question okay you think the most important words in the question ,um excuse me teacher it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later okay 
120.2,Oliver,,okay sure thank you thank you are you later ,you're welcome bye 
150.1,Luis,,bye hi student so have you found your answer ,i think so let me look back at those sentence again um teacher okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
120.4,Luis,,okay so student can you tell me like what your answers ,yeah okay so um i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen 
230.2,Luis,,oh so can you tell me like where you found this answer student ,okay i might not have read the whole thing let me see okay okay so i didn't find it in the story cuz i already know about space so i just pulled that one out of my brain 
230.2,Luis,,okay so uh it's great that you have background about this passage but can you just look back to this question and ,um yeah okay so it's asking me to say what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
210.3,Luis,,okay so what's the purpose of this equipment ,to find water 
210.3,Jazmin,,okay so can you go back to your answer and then now does your answer like address this question ,oh and okay so so no it doesn't address that question because you know accident tanks are used to breathe but i guess they're not used to find water Okay teacher i'm still kind of confused 
230.1,Jazmin,,yeah just me and you tell me oh watch confuse you ,yes okay so you asked me what the name of it was in so i see that the name of the machine is the lunar orbiter and but then i guess i don't know like do i just have to add that to my answer i guess i don't know what when i'm supposed to write for my answer 
230.1,Jazmin,,yeah so okay so go back to this answer to this question and ,"Okay yeah it's the same thing, even said, you know it wants us to tell what the equipment is that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon. so yes i i had that the small machine but then i was going to just add called a lunar orbiter but i guess i don't know if that's if that's enough of the answer or not "
210.3,Jazmin,,yeah yeah i really like that you are already compared these two answers so you see the difference is just the machines name right ,yes 
210.3,Jazmin,,yes ,so i god is the difference is just adding the name 
430.2,Jazmin,,yes and so that is answer like when you answer this type of question and you actually need to provide the specific name of the equipment so that in this way that you are answer the question and in your original answer you just said it's a small machine so it's still an equipment you didn't tell people like what kind of equipment they use so like next time when you see the question again was what just be sure to include the ,Okay. 
430.2,Chris,,great ,iphone on the keywords on the keywords that you asked i think we're equipment discover water on the moon you know i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
230.2,Chris,,oh a lot where do you find this information ,on the internet or cuz i would like to read about what's going on at nasa and so there was an article on the internet talking about some of the work that are that the scientists are doing to try to find life and on the moon and so they may be in three years they could put a base up there me 
230.2,Chris,,oh wow it's a nice i you have already known so much about nasa and that yaba yes really cool but back to the text so the question that i think you circle the right keywords that you just circle that we discover and water i so can you just go back to the article and find ,I think it was the one that says. all the second sentence maybe in paragraph two 
230.2,Chris,,okay this okay mean orbiter ,yeah this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large pool a crater 
230.2,Chris,,yes so on you actually locate the right answer so can you tell me like in your previous answer oh where like where did you find your previous answer in this paragraph ,oh no it was in the first paragraph 
510.1,Oliver,,yeah yeah right so you see the differences is when you're trying to answer this question just to try to locate these keywords in the paragraph ,yeah i understand um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for when you explain to student and student the strategy of trying to look at the keywords and the question and then finding the keyword in that story also to underline that gives me ideas on what i need to work on to 
510.1,Oliver,,oh thank you so much thank you for conclusion ,you're welcome 
510.1,Farrah,,bye bye ,bye hi 
150.1,Luis,,class my name is teacher i'm going to i am going to be your teacher today so i am so excited to meet all of you to be so high so today we're going to be talking about water on the moon and we have a reading that i i understand that you read it already that is called the moon is a desert right ,excuse me i should be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,already so maybe you can teach us you can tell us about it okay ,okay yeah that sounds great 
120.2,Oliver,,okay so let's just start okay so raise your hand if you are ready read the lecture there that is cool the moon is a desert okay so you are ready you have the knowledge of ready okay so tell me about it i want to know after reading these these lecture i want you to to tell me about this reading and tell me what equipment the day scientists used to discover water on the moon what was the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon ,yes can i go 
120.2,Oliver,,yes sir ,well i think that they used on won't student and i we kind of have the same answer and we both thought that the scientists used a microscope because the story said the water was really small like so small you couldn't even see it and so you'd need a microscope so like you could see the water 
120.1,Jazmin,,yeah yeah and you're right in order to see the water you have to see you have to use a microscope okay because they find this water it has too tiny that we can we have to use this micro me with this microscope so that's a good point there however i think that this point doesn't answer directly the main question this is the next step after they discovered water for the moon hey this is part of the equipment that they discovered what are the one can you remember what was that The equipment? yes ,well i said that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
130.1,Jazmin,,yes you're right your answer is not wrong at all but can you remember how that small machine was called we are getting closer to the to the answer they sent a small machine ,and let me look into nasa sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate a lunar orbiter 
110.4,Jazmin,,yeah yeah that's it that's the thing that they send and then in the beginning to discover water that's the answer that i was looking for ,oh so i just had to say the name 
150.1,Farrah,,yeah like whatever you think that was equipment to discover water okay so remember um i want to listen to all of your thoughts um because i really think that all your thoughts are important okay so because of your of your opinions are important in their contribution good information for this class so even they are not the exact answer they help us to view the main answer okay so there is no wrong answer on here so i want to hear all of your ideas ,hi i'm student well i said the microscope too like student said and i still a little confused about how come how come it's the lunar orbiter and not a microscope can you explain that again 
210.4,Farrah,,you say that the microscope is part of the equipment that they used to discovery water right and yes you're right there is there is a part of the equipment but the first the first equipment that they sent discovered is water was the lunar arbiter so that was it the first thing that they send and when they discovered this i let me see the number when these discovered this tiny water then after that they use the microscope carries and being ,oh oh so they had to they had to send the lunar orbiter first to find it and then they had to use the microscope to see it 
210.4,Chris,,yeah just see this tiny water student ,so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like science some like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.3,Chris,,you're right but the you think that for these experiment they send a oxygen tanks do you think it was necessary to send oxygen tanks to discover water ,well if there were astronauts they'd need them but maybe if it was a ship with no astronauts than they wouldn't need that so were there astronauts or no 
210.4,Chris,,in the reading these doesn't mention that they sent astronauts they send that they just sent the lunar orbiter to find this water and the lunar orbiter is a robot a robot doesn't need oxygen to survive ,yeah that's really causing me see wow so it was just a robot and it was able to go around the moon and and find the water for them 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah it was able to explore or the craters around it then the moon and find these little amount of water in there ,well i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand the text on such a such a deep level like i understand now why they use a microscope later and i weren't even astronauts there and you just really helped us read it written really detailed so we could understand it so thank you so much 
210.4,Farrah,,thank you thank you for your answers they were very helpful so i will see you next blessed to discuss this topic again okay hello i am your teacher i'm going to be working with you today so i understand that ,nice to meet you 
150.1,Luis,,nice to meet you too i understood that you read the text already that the text is called water on the moon am i correct you read it already ,we read it already and i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,that's great but i think that all the time we can learn something new so maybe you can learn something here and maybe we can help you to improve your knowledge or maybe you can help us to enter or knowledge or knowledge okay ,okay yeah sounds good to me 
210.4,Chris,,okay so the question that was first of all let's think about these texts okay and let's think about the main ideas of these texts okay so can you tell me where are the main idea of this text ,well so i think the main idea of the story is that that there's actually water on the moon and they used to think there wasn't any but now they know that there is water on the moon 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah you are correct there is there is something new for us we didn't know that we can get water on the moon but you know something that we can do is just like to pay attention to the titles and subtitles these titles and subtitles can give you more information about the main ideas of the text but so the you have another thought about what could be another main idea of this text ,i offer one 
210.4,Oliver,,okay ,so you said the subtitle and the subtitle is a moon is a desert so i think the point as actually that even though they found water on the moon there's not that much of it it's really small oh also it's ice and not water 
210.4,Oliver,,oh yeah you're correct so yeah we're going to discuss more of this later okay so what is the other subtitle that we can discuss about ,i don't know 
210.4,Farrah,,what is the other main idea that we can learn student ,are you talking about the part that says water is a valuable resource 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah i'm talking about so what do you think about that ,well actually i'm still a little confused about the first part 
120.2,Farrah,,okay so we will also talk about it later okay so in the beginning i just wanted to know if you have the main ideas clear and then we can talk more about it okay So the first question that I want to tell you is what equipment if scientists used to this cover water on the moon. ,yeah so i thought the main word was equipment and so my answer was you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why that answer is wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,"is not wrong student So the, you know, another keyword that is under question that they can help us to answer this question? is your answer is enough okay student ",student i know you said equipment and i think that's important but actually i think the more important word is actually discover 
210.2,Farrah,,okay thank you thank you student yeah there is another important we're in this question okay so coming back to you student so can you tell me what is it what is in the microscope for okay so you say that a microscope is the equipment that they used to discover water on the moon we have two main questions too many words in this question is discover and equipment ,it's to look really closely at really small things 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah and also we use microscopes to observe and to analyze right ,oh yeah you're right 
210.4,Chris,,yeah so maybe the microscope we didn't they didn't use a microscope to discover water but maybe they use the microscope to observe to analyze the water after they discovered that water so we have to think about another equipment before that helped them to discover water since the beginning student ,yeah so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.2,Chris,,yeah that's right well what in the text makes you think that within the next what do you see that maybe that can be an equipment for this idea ,from the story 
230.2,Chris,,yeah from this story like for this case for this specific case we're talking about discovering water in the moono so what in the text makes you think about they need oxygen tanks to discover water ,i well i guess those aren't from the story but i just thought because we were talking about equipment that that's equipment that scientists sometimes use 
130.1,Farrah,,yeah well you're right student and i really value that you have knowledge about this topic you're right that oxygen tanks are equipment that sometimes they need to go to go to the moon but that's when they when they need astronauts and they need human beings because human beings human beings needs oxygen over there okay and student ,so it's time for us to go but i just wanted to say thank you for helping us think about where we found our answers and then whether or not being worked with that word discover that was really helpful 
130.1,Farrah,,okay so i hope that class understood that class doesn't have any more questions about hello ,oh hi miss teacher it's good to see you 
120.4,Luis,,hi it's nice to see you again okay so yeah i'm going to be your teacher today ok so the you read the water on the moon text already raise your hand if you read it okay so let's talk about it i'm i have a question for you leave the one to say something about it you want to say something about the text student ,yeah i do i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,yeah i know but maybe you can help us okay ,oh yeah 
420.1,Oliver,,you can give us more information ok so i'm going to start with this question what equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon what are the main words of this question in order to have an answer we have to pay attention to the question and we have to know what is exactly the thing that they are asking for student ,okay so i said a main word in the question was equipment because you know that the answer has to be like a thing a tool 
230.2,Oliver,,yeah you're right so what in the text makes you think that that's a that's a main word what do you think that ,what do i think is the right answer 
230.2,Oliver,,yeah ,okay well so my answer was that the equipment up and used what's the microscope 
210.2,Chris,,okay so what is another what is another main word of this question you say equipment so what is another word this question student ,okay so i said the main point was water 
210.2,Jazmin,,but there is another another word that i want to talk about it yeah there is another important word in this question because we're we're talking about finding water on the moon okay what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon what is the verb of this question student ,and so a verb is an action word and the action word in the question is discover and that's what i thought was the main word 
230.2,Jazmin,,okay so thank you so now we have discover water and equipment okay so let's think about it so now let's think what equipment this science is used to discover water on the moon can someone told me where is your answer according to the text yes student ,and my answer is nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Luis,,I know that you get it. I know you know that they sent a small robot to find water on the moon. can someone remember what is the specific name of this robot ,yeah i know that's one it's the lunar orbiter student come on 
210.4,Chris,,yeah no student got it also it's also good good answer so there was a small machine and it was a robot in the name is lunar orbiter right okay so they found this equipment to discover water on the moon so when they discover water on the moon what happened next what is the next step when they discovered these ice deposits in the craters ,next step like so after they after they find the water in the craters well so on after the part about the lunar orbiter it talks about how there's not very much of it so maybe they measured it because it says there's 32 ounces so maybe after they found it they measured it 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah after that they have to they have to make an observation right and how can you observe this water and someone told me what is another woman on maybe they can they they will need to observe this water yeah student ,um well i think that was my answer the microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah the microscope so can you tell me what is the main um what do you use the microscope for ,well i thought who was the answer to the question about about what they use to discover the water i guess i'm not quite sure why why the microscope isn't just the whole answer 
230.3,Farrah,,so you think that the microscope is the only equipment that they use to discover this water ,so i guess it sounds like maybe they have to use both 
110.1,Oliver,,yeah they have to use like the first step to discover water was it the this mall machine the lunar orbiter so that's the main idea that's the main equipment that we use but class has excellent ideas and now i know that class read this text and class has knowledge about this so i am very impressed with your with your answers student ,so i looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you for helping us think about the main words in the question because that helps us find the very best answer in the text 
110.1,Farrah,,okay thank you have a nice lunch ,hi hi how are you 
110.1,Farrah,,i'm good how are you ,oh good oh good it's nice to meet you so so we just finished reading the water on the moon 
120.2,Luis,,so our discussion question today is going to be what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon ,excuse me excuse me this is student um i shouldn't be and this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Farrah,,yeah um it's definitely good that you have that understanding and that you're confident in your knowledge about space i just pulled you all together so that we could have a discussion about that question i wanted to go through each of your responses and talk a little bit about what evidence you are using to back up what you said so student you said you end up both said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's a very great response and great observation based on the text i wanted to prompt you to think about what happened before they looked through the microscope in order to look through the microscope you need to have a sample you too can work together to figure out how the scientists got the sample is that clear ,okay so should we just talk to each other or what do you want us to do 
150.1,Farrah,,you can turn and talk and you can look at the first two points and think about how they may have gotten the sample to look at through the microscope that clear ,yeah okay thank you yeah 
110.1,Chris,,so student i wanted to speak to you about your response okay you said that scientists found craters full of water in the moon ,yeah i thought that was so cool 
120.3,Chris,,yeah that's interesting um i wanted to point a specific area i wanted us to read together um can you look at bullet number three and read the first sentence out to me ,okay oh part three you said the first sentence okay it says that means the moon is still drier than the dryest desert on earth 
210.4,Chris,,when you think of a desert do you think of what do you think what do you see ,all like like lots of sand as far as the eye could see and the sun beating down really hard and like cactuses and stuff 
210.3,Chris,,yeah i noticed that you didn't you didn't mention any water do you want to rethink your response and see and see if that maybe makes sense to you that if the moon is drier than the driest desert do you think there's water on the moon a lot of water ,well there's definitely water but hackers maybe the craters are full of water like i was kind of picturing that in my head that they were full of water like little pools but i guess if it's like a desert it must be a lot smaller and harder to see 
120.1,Chris,,yeah so how about you take a deep read of the three points and see if you can figure out what equipment they might have used to get that really small bit of water out ,okay i'll read it 
120.4,Jazmin,,thank you hi student you have a question for me ,yes i said that necessity a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.3,Jazmin,,your answer is not wrong that's not that's not why you're in this class i just wanted to talk to you a little bit more about that machine can you maybe think of what that machine did in order to get the water if we look at i'm at point two and we read past that first sentence can you read the second sentence out loud to me ,okay the second sentence on this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit handle large polar crater 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah so what do you think that it's doing once it finds those ice deposits ,don't really know because i know that it looks for them but i don't really know what it does next i don't think it's 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah it doesn't say that but if we read between the lines that i'm the machine is sent to go and look for them and then they're able to look at them underneath the microscope what do you think that might mean ,maybe they're studying it 
110.1,Jazmin,,yeah they're definitely studying it in order to find the water um ,so that's not answer right just the small machine 
110.2,Jazmin,,it's definitely your that's correct that it was a small machine that they sent to find the ice deposits or just trying to look a little bit deeper into what the machine was doing in order to discover the water on the moon ,oh oh okay so just add some more to my answer 
110.2,Chris,,yes thank you student ,yeah well i was thinking about equipment and actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
510.1,Chris,,yeah they use a lot of different equipment in order to go on these missions to find out more about the solar system so did you find any anything in this text to backup that there was oxygen tanks when we read we want to make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text ,oh you mean the story 
510.1,Chris,,yeah ,no it doesn't say oxygen tanks in the story 
520.1,Chris,,so every single time that we're using information from a text in order to answer a discussion question we want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text even though we might know a lot about the subject reading already so just keep that in mind ,so i need to pick up pick up a piece of equipment from the story 
520.1,Chris,,yes ,okay that makes sense yeah 
120.4,Oliver,,student and student were you able to find out more information through working together ,on actually i just looked up clock and we have to build a lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for having us look back at the text and look for really detailed answers on that was really helpful so thank you so much 
120.4,,,thank you ,hello class thank you for sharing your responses to 
230.2,Luis,,to my question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon i'm going to work with you in two different groups student and student i'm going to start with you first i was wondering if you could tell me where you what made you say your response have you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ,i'm excuse me excuse me i have my hand up 
110.1,Farrah,,student i will get back to you in one minute you can reread the passage right now oh okay okay thank you ,okay so you asked us where where we found the microscope 
110.1,Farrah,,yep ,okay so it's in part three and it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Farrah,,"i was wondering if we could look a little bit deeper into the first excuse me the second paragraph and find out if there's a more specific tool that you can use as evidence for this answer okay that's great evidence to support it Okay, can you two reread the second paragraph and see if that changes your answer. ",yeah okay we can look at it 
210.4,Luis,,okay student student and student student you had a question for me earlier can i answer that for you ,yes please um so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
420.1,Farrah,,i know that you know a lot about space and i'm happy that you can bring that knowledge with you i just wanted to work with the three of you to see if we can dig a little bit deeper into this question i wanted to work with you three to look a little bit further into the question you all brought your background knowledge to answer this question and i'm happy that you are able to do that i want you to reread it and think about what the most important part of the question is and circle that okay ,okay okay we looked at part two again 
210.3,Farrah,,okay did you have any different thoughts ,well i guess in part two it talks about a machine but i don't really understand why my answer is wrong 
210.2,Oliver,,your answer isn't wrong because it answers the question but we want to see if there's maybe a better answer sometimes there's two answers and one of them's a little bit more specific so if we are trying to answer the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon the discovering is the aspect that we want to be focusing on so was the tool that they use to discover the microscope or was it maybe the lunar orbiter ,"oh well i mean i guess i kind of thought it was the microscope because if the water so small how can you discover it until you can actually see Yeah, I'm on the same page as Farrah here. I kind of agree because like if you need to discover it i i guess that's why i picked a microscope because it seems like that's the tool you'd need to see it yeah "
210.4,Oliver,,yeah in order to see it you would need to but first they have they have to find the sample to look at so we're focusing on how they found the sample can you find some evidence about how they found that first sample ,oh i i don't see the word sample on in the story but it talks about the ice deposits 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah so how did they find those ice deposits ,okay um they the lunar orbiter will land on the moon south pole and look for ice deposits 
210.3,Oliver,,yeah so does that sound like an answer to the question that we are trying to answer ,um i guess yeah that sounds like they use the lunar orbiter to help find the water but i don't know if i would have picked it the first time 
210.2,Chris,,yeah so that's why i wanted to pull you into this class so that we can have a little bit of a conversation about how to answer the question fully thank you student student and student what part of the question did you pull out as being the most important part student ,okay so i said the word equipment was the most important part and on well i actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
430.3,Chris,,"So can you try and reread and think about what equipment, other than The oxygen tanks and masks they used to find the water on the moon? ",oh so like equipment that's in the story 
430.3,Chris,,yeah ,okay yeah i'll look at 
210.2,Jazmin,,student and student what did you pull out as being the most important part of the question ,i picked discover 
230.1,Jazmin,,discover why did you pick the term discover ,because it sort of tells you what the machine what the equipment does so that sounded that sounded important because it's like the action 
110.4,Oliver,,can you now take a look at the passage and see what that small machine that you brought up when you first then what what was that doing was that maybe discovering something be able to yeah definitely is very important thank you for for responding ,come i'm so sorry but um it's it's actually time for us to go now but before before we go i wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to listen to us and help us understand the importance of the word discover for our answers thank you 
120.4,Luis,,hello class thank you for joining our class today i wanted to start off by reading the question to class and then thinking about what the most important part of the question is the question is there is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable class take a second and think about what the most important part of that question is student i will answer your question in a minute thank you take a second to reread the question and circle the most important part student what did you say was the most important part of the question ,i still have to say i just want to remind you my dad is actually an astronaut 
110.3,Luis,,well thank you student that will definitely help our conversation ,i thought so that's why i had to say it 
120.4,Jazmin,,thank you student what were you gonna say was the most important part of the question ,okay so i think the most important part of the question is evidence 
130.2,Oliver,,evidence thank you does class agree with student about evidence or does somebody have a different idea student ,okay well um i thought that the most important part of the question was the word convincing because it seems like when you're thinking about the question you need to be convinced whether the water on the moon is going to be good 
230.1,Farrah,,so while we're working together i want you to to you all to keep those two points clear in your mind that you need evidence and that you need to be convinced great those are two important aspects to focus on student and student i want to to ask you why you think that the water is not ready yet or isn't going to be for a long time what made you say that ,well i guess i think i got it from the last part of the of the story part six because it says that in order to use the water it will take a lot of time and money so it's not like they could just go to the moon and drink the water today 
230.1,Oliver,,yeah thank you for pointing that out it's it's um student what made you say that it's not ready yet it's an important piece of evidence to point out that they will need time and money to get the water on the moon ,um yeah yeah i'll kind of the same like student sad um i think it was the part yeah at the end because it sounds like it's going to be really expensive and there there wasn't that much water from like the first part of the story so it just seems like a waste of money and it's just not ready 
210.4,Oliver,,um i wanted to ask you to dive deeper into what would be required for their to find water on the moon what exactly makes it be so expensive and take so much time for them to get the water on the moon okay ,"Yeah, we'll do that. "
210.4,Jazmin,,thank you okay um ,i have an idea 
120.4,Jazmin,,yes student ,well i think you can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon 
430.3,Jazmin,,yeah that's that's definitely something that could happen if there was enough water on the moon i wanted to speak with you about i'm thinking about how i'm concerned that you didn't read deep enough to see how how difficult it would be to get the water so i want you to take another look at the reading and see what evidence you could find to support it being worthwhile to get to the water on the moon why it's so important to use all that time and effort and money to get to the water okay ,yeah i'm sorry you want me to read it again 
420.3,Jazmin,,yeah read it again and think about why it would be worthwhile to spend the money and to use the time ,okay 
120.4,Chris,,yes student ,water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
210.4,Luis,,yeah you and student both brought up points about the fact that water was heavy and that water can be broken down into two parts i wanted to clarify with you to what other functions of water are there besides for drinking and to find the evidence that it would make it worthwhile for them to mine for the water on the moon um what other functions water has ,yeah i got one i got one 
120.4,Luis,,yes student ,yeah so i know you could drink it well it doesn't sound like there's a lot of drinking but it also said like what the hydrogen and oxygen you could use it to make a rocket fuel 
230.1,Luis,,yeah so that's one of the purposes that they that they pointed out when you said just then that there wasn't a lot of it does that mean that you think that it would be worthwhile or not to find it ,no i didn't really think of that 
230.1,Luis,,yeah so remember when we first started we talked about the question and how it asked you to be convinced based on evidence that it's worthwhile do you think that that would convince you that it's worthwhile ,you know i think the rocket fuel on the sounds pretty useful but i think i might have to learn a little more about cars if that was more water it might be useful but if it's only one is it felt like a murmur four cups that doesn't sound very useful 
120.4,Oliver,,yeah so how about you look back into the passage and see if you can find any more information in any more research student you have a question ,yeah so um we have to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you because you listened to each one of our answers and you asked every one of us to think about our answer in a new way like if we said it wasn't valuable you asked us to think maybe it could be and if we said it was valuable you asked us to think maybe wouldn't be so we all have to think about the question from both both sides and that was really cool 
120.4,Farrah,,thank you ,hi it's nice to meet you 
150.1,Luis,,nice to meet you as well student so we were we were investigating the water on the moon text first i want to ask you class did you class enjoy this test did you learn anything from it student go ahead ,excuse me i don't i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Chris,,well that's actually awesome that you know about space because maybe you might you might know some things that you you your classmates don't even know so you can help help me teach them about space and you might even learn some new things too so thanks again for work yeah i will be awesome i'm excited so the question let me ask you again actually who did you class enjoy this the short text did you class learn anything how'd you like it see some head nods class want to share ,here this is student i thought it was really cool that scientists they found craters full of water on the moon i never knew that before 
140.1,Oliver,,class else take anything from the text that was the main idea but anything class else notice anything or think anything was cool yeah so really cool thing student go ahead i like that shirt i have the same shirt actually that's a really cool shirt ,thank you well i just thought it was really interesting that the moon was a desert because i never really thought about like what the moon was made off on like what what it felt like and looked like and stuff 
120.4,Farrah,,i agree i think we all see the moon as something far away and we hear certain things about it and we see pictures you know the big round objects with the craters but we never think about how it would be to actually exist there are walk around on the moon so i agree with you i think that's a really cool thing so let's talk about the prompt we were asked you class what equipment and sciences us to discover water on the moon so does class does class want to volunteer in a response to that question i have any ideas about that student go ahead ,i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
110.1,Jazmin,,hmm that's a good answer does class else have any any any ideas about that before we get into talking about it student go ahead thanks for raising your hand ,well nasa sent a small machine didn't understand why my answer is wrong 
130.1,Luis,,hmm okay so your answer was i'm going to look back at at the answers you class bad so i'll go back to submit so that is the answer the question for us but i'll come to yours so she said you need a scientific tool called a microsoft to look really closely that's actually a good answer because it talks about the water they found on the on the on the moon was microscopic but that's a good answer because it does refers to something back in the text so i like that answer so actually like that at this moment that's not exactly what the the object that they use is called but we're looking for this is this specific name of that machine does class remember what that's called and student you said nasa sense a small machine okay and you know it you're actually correct but does class remember what it's called that's a great place to start as and thank you ,yeah i got this it's called a lunar orbiter it's called lunar orbiter 
210.4,Oliver,,or good student i like that it's out prefer if you raise your hand so we can keep that same routine gone but thank you you're correct so good job and can someone remind me exactly what a lunar orbiter does so like you said they said the small machine what did they use it for just can you class just remind me go ahead ,well i guess story it says they use it to investigate but but i circled the same as student about the microscope because you need that because the water is so small like can you find that if you can't even see it 
130.2,Chris,,well that's a great point so the lunar orbiter is in helping investigate so that's actually a great connection you made because since the water so microscopic maybe us humans can't see it so we need to use that piece of technology to find the water does class remember where's the where's the water exactly on the moon what part of the moon can we can someone remind me of that ,yeah i can because yeah go ahead go ahead american yeah that's my answer they found the water in the craters and they found the craters full of water 
210.4,Chris,,so yes that they're in these big craters the large polar craters but the so the ice deposits are in the creators so i like your that's a good answer it's very very very small so we need to use that scientific tool called like you said a microscope to look at the water really closely ,"Go ahead. Well, I went to NASA. And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits. "
120.1,Jazmin,,hmm absolutely they do those are all part of the process of going up to the moon and using the lunar orbiter to find the end the microphone and a microscope to find the small amounts of water in the crater so that's actually i'm glad you said that because that's part of the process we didn't necessarily talk about in this text or in this section of the text but that is exactly something that's a big part of it as well so thank you for adding that i just want to uh before i wrap it up i just want to come together and see if someone can give me a refined answer from what the what everything we just talked about like another answer maybe building on the original answer that you had to the question so i'm going to say the question one more time which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so i wanted someone to elaborate on their first answer let's see who we can we got here student thank you for volunteering go ahead ,i can try so nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and then they had to use a microscope and the astronauts also use all the stuff that student talked about too 
110.1,Oliver,,absolutely great job so they they the scientists they go into the moon and they use the lunar orbiter to find the the water which is in the craters and then there's a microscopic amount of water super super super super small so again great like what student their first answer using the microscope they need to use a microscope to be able to see the water the small amounts of water so again if you if you're thinking about now going forward when you think about the climate of the moon think about a desert the the text itself said that the moon is drier than the dry desert on earth so even if you think as a moon because it's in space as like dark and it might look different than the desert it feels like a desert so when you think of like the feeling of the moon think of that that's something that can help you remember this information so yeah i think you class did a great job with the text student go ahead student i'm sorry ,well yeah i was just gonna say it's time for us to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to see thank you because it was really cool to think about how the moon would feel and i really like that you talked about that and you'll also help us understand how each of our answers connected to the question and it was just really fun to talk to you today 
110.1,Farrah,,thanks that was nice to meet all you class and i hope you class have a good lunch and yeah hey class ,it's good to see you 
110.1,Farrah,,nice to see you as well how's your day going so far ,it's been pretty good yeah 
120.4,Luis,,great great great so we're gonna jump back into the text into what we were doing before does class remember what we were working on before student go ahead ,um yeah so we were reading water on the moon and i just want to remind you i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,well you know that's i'm glad you reiterate that again student because since you're the expert we may be coming back to you to help us with some information that might not even be in the text so you might be able to help us add some additional info but when i got all your answers back to the prompt there was a couple of things i wanted to go back over just to make sure that we're all on the same page and that we all can come to a solid answer for the prompt so you might even find that you might even learn some new stuff today and too so i'm glad that you're the expert i appreciate that thank you oh yeah ,of course anytime thank you 
120.4,Oliver,,so let's jump back into it i does class remember what the prompt was last week student go ahead and love that smile go ahead ,um yeah it's all what equipment did scientists to was to discover water on the moon 
120.4,Farrah,,good great memory word for word exactly what the question was great job so let me i'm gonna have someone volunteer if you want to tell me your answer from before so then we can go forward and make sure that we're all on the same page about what what did they use so that i have some of your answers and i just want to have you class reiterate to me what your original answer was there are many volunteers student yes go ahead ,um i said that she would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.1,Farrah,,great so that's that's a good answer i actually have a follow up question for you um what made you what made you say that as your answer what stuff what really stood out to you why did you say that ,so it's in it's in paragraph three and they talked about a tool called a microscope and they talked about how the ice was really small and so you can all see it if you didn't have a microscope 
230.3,Farrah,,ah ok so you really focus on the word microscope that's something that you really focused on ,yeah because it's a tool 
110.1,Chris,,can i have another volunteer to tell me what they said well said it is a tool you're correct so let's right let's write that down i'll keep that in note and i'm going to move on to someone else and see what they had but thank you for volunteering yes student nice to hear from you ,yeah so i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
110.2,Chris,,so i'm also going to follow the same question for you what made you focus on that specific part in relation to the question that it was asking full of water on the moon good observation yes i remember that from the text as well good job ,oh well okay so in part one they talk about water can be found deep within the moon's polar crater 
120.4,Jazmin,,hmm good remembering yes it does say that so that's a great piece of information that we can actually all use to help answer the question even better even though i did like your answer i think we can do even better job of answering the question so thank you i'm gonna ask one more person for what their answer was so i can gather all this information we can use it to work together to find an even better answer student go ahead ,okay well i said that yes i sent a small machine and don't understand why my answers wrong 
230.2,Jazmin,,"So I'm glad you said that. So I'm going to follow up with you with the same question I had, which event and Chris, what exactly what language or what part of that. Did you see and think, oh, that's the answer to the prompt that has given me. ",well they talked about it in part two that's where i found my answer and i guess i know i was looking for some kind of equipment from the question and a small machine seemed like a piece of equipment and and they described describe how it looks for ice 
120.4,Chris,,so that's great that's a great segue so what i wanted to ask you class next because you just gave specific evidence of what the question said and you analyze that and picked an answer based off that specifically so that's a great process teacher and i think that's something that we could all use so i'm gonna i'm gonna ask you class a question again so student go ahead ,oh yeah so i went to nasa and i know that scientists use all sorts of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks 
120.4,Chris,,you've gotta go ahead ,oh yeah no that's it i just saw all this stuff at nasa and so since we're talking about equipment i was thinking that they probably used all that stuff 
110.1,Oliver,,"What equipment do they use for this specific job so they do have different kinds of equipment that they use for different things. Or is it something else that I actually can see in the text. So the next that thank you for adding that so Chris, you got, we have a. We have a lot of experts in this class. so the next thing i would ask you is when you read the actual question i'm going to read the prompt one more time it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon I love the participation so far from everybody. You guys are doing great. ",excuse me 
110.1,Oliver,,yep just give me a moment student i'm going to have class think about it for 15 more seconds then i'll come to you okay yeah ,well i just i wanted to say actually um it's time it's time for the next class we have to go but um i wanted to say thank you so much because you really helped us feel that our answers and the stuff that we already know what's really valuable and important and you also helped us look in the text and understand where our answers came from 
420.1,Luis,,right that's exactly what i was trying to i'm sorry we didn't have my time i had a couple more things planned but i'm glad that you class got something from hey class so let's get right back into it i don't want to waste any time only have seven more minutes so i was just saying look reading the take i think you might already taken the time i'll give you another 15 seconds to read the question identify one word to focus on that when you go back into the text you can use that word to help you answer the question ,okay yeah i know people are still working but i just wanted to remind you that my dad is actually an astronaut 
210.3,Luis,,that's incredible that's such a cool thing to hear about and i'm so glad that's one of the coolest things i've heard in a long time do you have a question do you have an answer for for the vocab words you would choose from the question ,oh yeah i have an answer equipment 
130.2,Oliver,,equipment good i'm just gonna pull class in the class and see if we're on the same page or if someone else wants to tell me something different student go ahead ,oh yeah i had also picked equipment actually so 
210.3,Farrah,,awesome thank you for letting me i think we're getting to the right place student have you chosen a vocab word yet ,um yeah i guess yeah the equipment seems important 
130.2,Chris,,okay thank you for giving your answer i'm sorry to just call on you out of the blue but um i think it's important to get everyone's input so we can all be on the same page student what you think ,well actually i thought that it was water what equipment to find water on the moon 
130.2,Jazmin,,good i like that too i like that we can have different answers so so we'll consider water as well and student what do you have ,discover 
420.3,Jazmin,,good discover so we have equipment we have water we have discovered we put all those things together i think we have the perfect three words so we can combine the words you class all said equipment to discover water And when you come out of that. I want you to have a revised answer. so maybe your answer is already right but maybe i want a little more maybe your answer is not really right and you can just change it completely so go back into the text take two minutes and read and while you're reading you can highlight underlined some words that might help you but i want a sentence for out of class for a revised answer ready set go ,can i ask something 
420.3,Jazmin,,absolutely go ahead ,i know you want us to reread again but i don't know how to fix my answer cuz i don't i don't know why it's wrong because i picked the equipment to discover so what do i do 
210.3,Jazmin,,so for you i would say read that part and see if you can add another detail on to it maybe think about the equipment's looking for water maybe where's the water or maybe something to that effect we can really make a more detailed answer alright i see people looking up so i think we're gonna i'm gonna ask for some provide answers so maybe maybe some new information that people found to help me answer the prompt any volunteers ,i guess i can try to add more detail for my answer so when i looked at again i found a few details about the machine and it said the center small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so i guess i would say on that the equipment they use to sign the water was a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
310.1,Oliver,,great answer student i love how you went back and you found specific you even found even more evidence than you already had that was very impressive class else have any information that they can share with me student go ahead great answer student i love how you went back and you found specific you even found even more evidence than you already had that was very impressive and you use that to make a complete answer i love your answer he told us what equipment they use and what it was called exactly and what it did was it three great things thank you for that that was awesome ,i yep okay um so using those three words we picked i would say the equipment to discover the water was a microscope 
230.1,Oliver,,what made you say that ,paragraph three remember yeah it's in paragraph three and it says that says on waters microscopic and you need a microscope to see it's so the equipment used to discover water was a microscope oh 
130.3,Oliver,,yes it's that so it said that if we're reading the text it says the water they found is very microscopic microscopic means small right yeah so it says it says it will you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely so we're actually looking for the piece of equipment that they use to find the water so we need to look at that word discover and you wouldn't be able to get to the water unless you had this lunar orbiter so i think if you included a microscope in your and your answer with the lunar orbiter that would be like the best answer i can ever ask for but it's important that we add that we have both things and if you want it bad microscope you can but the thing that we're really looking forward to the lunar orbiter okay ,okay um can i try again can i do another answer 
130.3,Oliver,,i would love for you can do that yes ,okay so i would say if i was putting it all together i would say the equipment to discover the water was first a lunar orbiter and then a microscope 
210.4,Oliver,,great so you could say they discovered the water let's bring this to a consensus i think only have like 30 seconds or a minute left so to wrap this all up it's important that we're on the same page and we use the information we we went back and discovered and what i heard from you class is that they used a lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon to put into one general idea to answer this question so also the question more time what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon that was in that was in lunar craters i think someone mentioned that great piece of information and the water is microscopic it's so small that they might even need a microscope to find that water so even when they got there with the lunar orbiter they might have had to use a microscope because there's such small amounts of water so that's the idea we have for the answers go ahead ,oh yeah it sounds like you're wrapping up and we have to go to lunch to um but you can finish what you were saying 
210.4,Oliver,,thank you yes i just wanted to complete that general idea and i also wanted to say it was a pleasure working with you class and i'm i'm glad that you class are students who are willing to not only put an effort to rethinking your answer but also to formulate it into a new idea because taking a new information as part of the part of being a good student and you class are all doing that so thank you ,thank you for helping us make the best to answer so we could make with all of the details that we need 
210.4,Farrah,,no problem thank you class well good morning friends good to see you together this morning ,good morning 
210.4,Farrah,,good morning it's early and ,first period first period i know i know 
150.1,Luis,,but i'm glad you're here today and we've been reading some exciting news about water being discovered on the moon of all places right and i know some of you are totally see it as so student did you already have something to talk about with our with our article student hang on one second i know some of you were really interested in that and had the same question i did like how did the scientists so far away find water ,um well i don't think i should be in this class i already know all about space 
140.1,Farrah,,well you know i know that because last night we met with our class and we learned all about what you were interested in so we're really glad you're here because you can really help us and so we i know student you know a lot about this think through this this question like how did scientists right so far away on earth find water i was like well i thought about this all night were you surprised student that the scientists found water on the moon ,yeah i never thought there would be water on the moon i thought it was just i don't know dry up there 
140.1,Oliver,,how about you student were you surprised yeah me either i think that's what the scientists thought too ,oh well i don't think i never really thought about that before like maybe there is water on the moon maybe around the moon i wasn't really i never really thought about it i guess 
140.1,Jazmin,,how about you student were you surprised yeah so those are this article made you think about something new that's it that's a really good reason to be reading current news ,yes i would say i would say i was surprised 
140.1,Chris,,how about you student ,oh well i actually went to nasa and well i didn't know there was water on the moon but i thought it was really cool 
140.1,Luis,,yeah me too me too i thought this was great i really liked space and i like seeing the moon way up there at night so the fact that there's water on it is really intriguing for me so you know there's a there was a lot of information in this article wasn't there student or someone who's experienced about space wasn't there a lot of information about in the article ,yeah yeah there was stuff in there 
220.1,Jazmin,,yeah yeah some great stuff so we're we're here today because we're going to think about when we're reading how do we when there's lots of information in an article how do we focus on the information that we need so sometimes when i'm reading there's so much information i have a hard time finding what i'm looking for student what about you what do you what are you going to offer here go ahead student ,i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
110.2,Jazmin,,oh well what makes you think your answers wrong ,since we're all in this small class and doesn't that mean our answers are quite right 
150.1,Jazmin,,oh no it's great we're going to get together and think about how we can read even further to find out more information about our answers so that's why we're here thinking about when we're reading by ourselves there's there's tools we can use to find out even more when we're interested in in an answer so that's what we're here today and it's good that there's a small class is we can help each other and you can help me to kind of dig down into our article that's called close reading have you done close reading before ,like in an english class 
150.1,Jazmin,,yeah yeah so believe it or not we can do close reading in science right and social studies to find out we're looking for so to start i'm so glad you're here today we're all here today to help each other and we need to have some materials ready so i wanted to ask you do you all have your article and some cut something to market mark on it with ,yes we do 
150.1,Oliver,,put your hand up if you have it in front of you just do a check to make sure you have your article and a pencil or pen or something to mark up to put your hand up if you have that ok i see four hands okay student great good this is early in the morning and i'm so impressed all set to go okay you can put your hands down and let's make sure before we continue doing any reading let's make sure we're clear about what we're looking for because sometimes when there's so much information in the text we want to make sure we know what we're looking for with information so our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so one tool to help us is to make sure we look at the question really carefully that's going to give us some clues or some science to what look for student do you remember that question from yesterday ,yeah yeah i do 
150.1,Farrah,,okay i want you all to look at your at your you oh do you have that question in front of you okay so you hit you see it student is it on your paper the question ,yes yes it's here on the top of the paper 
420.1,Chris,,okay so and here i put it put your hands up and just show me that you can all see the question at the top of your paper all right awesome okay you can put your hands down here's my first job for you let's use a tool that helps us focus ourselves to make sure we're finding the information in our reading take a minute take your pencil and circle what you think is the most important word in the question that's going to help us know what to look for so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon So what's one important word take a minute and circle that on your question and I'm going to ask you what you circled chris's all set right when you're all set can you put your pencil down and then i'm going to wait and make sure everybody's ready i see your hand hairs to make sure everybody's has time to think okay good job student are you are you going to offer you have a question are you going to offer your idea ,oh it's just gonna say i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.3,Chris,,so what it what word did you circle then ,um equipment 
210.3,Jazmin,,equipment all right did class circle anything different what did you circle student ,i circled discover 
420.2,Oliver,,discover that might be a very important word too okay so class is a circle of equipment and discover okay well you know i think these words are going to really help us when we're looking we're looking for this information in the test so the first thing is um i wonder sometimes if we could even use those words to help us look even deeper so what if we turn those words into the beginning of a statement and figure out if the rest of the information is in the text ,i'm so sorry this class is so fun but we have to go to lunch now and i just wanted to say thank you so much you were so nice and you really helped us understand the question and what the question was asking us when you helped us find those keywords and i know that's going to be really helpful in other classes just like you said not just language like not just english i'm not just science but like all of our classes so thank you so much for joining us today 
420.3,Luis,,thank you deb alright are we ready to go around and discuss a little bit more about what we read awesome okay so student and student i'm going to start with you class okay i see that you understand a little about what a microscope is and but i'm a little concerned i see that you understand a little about what a microscope is but i'm a little concerned that while the microscope is a tool it didn't really discover the water on the moon so can you go back to the text and think about the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon so i suggest you go back to the text and maybe underline what you find again can you do that for me all right and then student yes student ,i don't understand why i shouldn't i don't feel like i should be on this class you know i already know a lot about space 
410.1,Luis,,so i like that you found some details in the article but i'm a little concerned that you did not connect the question to the text so looking back at the question what's the question that we're looking for can you tell me that are you able to tell me what the question is ,yeah it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
120.1,Luis,,great yes so now i suggest that the two of you go back to the text and circle the answer your new answer after looking for that are you able to do that for me ,a new answer 
420.3,Jazmin,,Another the main equipment. Okay. Chris. Can you go back and look at the text and see what other the main equipment that was used okay great and student ,i don't understand my my answers wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,so you are right on track to finding the right answer So I suggest you go back to the text underline what answer you just gave me and then I want you to circle. Something else that links with that to help further your answer. Can you do that for me. ,okay my answer and then circle start 
420.2,Jazmin,,your new so i want you to underline what you did answer which was nasa sent a small machine so underlined small machine okay and then i want you to just circle more detail with that that would further your answer a little bit more ,okay 
210.3,Farrah,,okay student and student were you able to find a little bit more information about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,we looked at it all in well i mean i still feel like my answer was right 
210.3,Oliver,,mm hmm ,yeah me too 
210.4,Farrah,,was there any other equipment that was used in the text ,um well i mean when i was looking at it i did see they they talked about the machine and in paragraph two 
210.4,Farrah,,okay tell me a little bit more about that machine that you read about ,oh okay it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will end at the south pole and look for ice deposits or large pool of crater these two positives very small 
210.3,Farrah,,okay so do you believe that this could have been part of the equipment that was used to discover water on the moon ,i mean i'm like it could be but but the question asks about water and i'm in my part it also talks about them looking for water with a microscope so and i don't see anything about water in this 
420.3,Chris,,okay so what we're we will take a little bit more time and dig into that in a bit but i think i want you to know that you are on the right track with the lunar orbiter okay so read a little bit more and maybe take some time to underline some keywords in your texts ,i went to nasa which i know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks suits 
110.1,Chris,,yes that's awesome and maybe at another time we can talk about your experience and you can share that with the class i think that they would learn a lot for me all right class so we're going to wrap up here and we will come back to this at another time it was nice seeing you ,okay um yeah so i guess we have to go to lunch anyway but yeah thanks for coming to visit us and on visit our class and kind of ask us some questions about what would read about in the text 
120.3,Luis,,alright class so i heard all your answers and i thought you know i really liked how you put a lot of thought into it but how about we look once again at the text you know what is i yes student ,um yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Farrah,,oh well you know the great thing about being in groups is that you might know a lot about space somebody else might not know as much but then tomorrow when we're covering biology you know somebody might know all about the jungle and you know you might not know as much so we kind of all help each other learn that way but so i'm curious if we can look through the text again and see the exact name like if class can help me find the exact name of the machine that they use to detect the water how you talk over it for about two minutes and whenever somebody thinks they have the answer just raise your hand and i'll call on you yes student ,okay so um the name for the equipment that i found is microscope 
120.1,Farrah,,see um well i do see that the size of the water they found was actually microscopic but if we look in paragraph two can do you see any other name of a machine ,um well okay you said part two on it says a small machine called a lunar orbiter i don't know what that is 
120.3,Chris,,yeah well that's the cool thing about this text so it kind of explains it um student do you mind reading section two out loud ,on yeah i can do that okay it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small 
110.2,Farrah,,awesome thank you so much so that kind of shows you that the machine that they were using is called the lunar orbiter kind of describes what it does and you know what's been i was wrong i'm sorry about that i just realized that said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so the microscope was part of the equipment so you are also right so thank you for that as well ,okay so they're both the right answer yep 
210.4,Jazmin,,they both have the right answer they're both they're both part of the equipment that was used see yeah yeah because you need the microscope to see the water since it was so small yes student ,yeah so i'm wondering that was my answer that nasa such a small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
110.2,Jazmin,,um well your answer actually isn't wrong they're both right because the small machine the lunar orbiter and also the microscope were both correct so that was just all the equipment they used ,oh okay so if i just put nasa sent a small machine then i'm right 
210.3,Jazmin,,well you are right but i also just want you to be able to you know see the bigger picture and kind of say that was one part of the equipment but you know because they probably couldn't have done it just with the lunar orbiter so they needed the microscope as well you know what else did they use ,oh ok so it's kind of like they a tool like work together 
120.4,Chris,,exactly yep exactly yeah what did what would you have said student what was your answer the second time you ,well so well my first answer was scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
120.4,Chris,,sure yep yeah oh did you have a second answer maybe or any thoughts new thoughts that came to mind after reading through it ,yeah well actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Luis,,oh cool and now what about you student did you you know learn anything new from this paragraph i know you love space but you know ,um yeah i mean so my answer was kind of like what student just pass i said scientists he has a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah cool and how are you deaf did you you know have anything that you learned from this paragraph and maybe anything about the equipment that scientists use ,on your so well i said the same thing i said about the microscope and i guess i'm just not quite sure why you need to have both on both the orbiter and the microscope because i mean the question asked her about what equipment they use to discover the water and i still think of some microscope because how can you discover something if you can't even see it 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah well that's you know i think that's kind of like the bigger question here i think the orbiter was part of the first step they had the thought i wonder if there's water on the moon they sent the orbiter to kind of you know just do the initial discovery or initial i guess investigation and then the microscope was really what cinch the deal and what you know they looked really closely once the orbiter got the larger body of evidence that there could be water so i think they you know they both work together does that make sense ,yeah so that's kind of like they use first they use the lunar orbiter and then i use a microscope 
110.1,Oliver,,yep exactly you said it perfectly yeah ,thanks 
140.1,Luis,,so student did you did you like reading over this paragraph or you know did you find it interesting or any thoughts ,yeah i thought it was a really interesting because i didn't actually know that there was water on the moon before i read this and i thought it was so cool how they sent that lunar orbiter and it was like this robot that found the water for them i really want to help make something like that one day cool 
140.1,Oliver,,yeah and student like was this the spark any interest in you or yes ,i'm i'm so sorry i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us see both the big picture and the sort of specifics of the equipment um that was a really helpful way to put it thank you so much 
120.3,Luis,,you class this has been wonderful so i liked your answers class i liked the line of thinking but ok so student let's think about i like that you said microscope that was part of the equipment they use let's look a little bit earlier in the text and see if they use anything else to to find the water can you can you read a little bit earlier in the text for me yes student ,yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Farrah,,and also you can help share share some stuff with other people in the class oh well you know that's the great part about being in a class we all have different strengths we bring to it so you may know a lot about space but you know i think there's always something you can learn so svaannah have you found anything yet about an any other equipment ,yeah yeah in the in the second paragraph it talks about how nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and so a machine is equipment too 
110.1,Chris,,and student looking at the text can you explain what the lunar orbiter did yeah exactly ,let me see it investigated the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater okay it investigated and it looked for ice deposits 
210.4,Jazmin,,cool so that's kind of what do we think class that's kind of the first step so there seems like there's two steps to this right there's first the investigation period with the lunar orbiter and student can you explain what the microscope did like what they use the microscope to do in this process ,for this one i mean i know what we use it for in science class 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah ,let's see for this one these it to look really closely at the water 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah so student can you kind of explain it seems like there's two parts do you kind of see what i'm saying here there's two parts to this with the lunar orbiter and the microscope can you explain to the class you know how those two work together ,okay um so what you said is that um student was right and student what student read and student read was right too because there are two pieces of equipment lunar orbiter and a microscope 
130.3,Farrah,,yeah yeah so there's two so i think it could be seen like the lunar orbiter went first and did the big picture work to see if there was water and then the microscope came in afterward and did the more smaller picture yes student ,i still don't understand why my answer is wrong 
150.1,Farrah,,and the lunar orbiter could be seen as the bigger picture so the lunar orbiter they're both the pieces of equipment that the scientists use to look for water well your answer is actually not wrong it's just half of the piece so yours was more of the smaller picture does that make sense okay cool ,yeah yeah that makes sense 
120.4,Luis,,yeah so student did you learn anything from this from this reading ,well i mean ok so now i know that there's like a microscope in space and a lunar orbiter and space um yeah i mean i guess that's it 
210.4,Luis,,yeah what did you think about the you know the potential uses of water was that exciting or like did you think it would be useful if there was water on the moon ,well mean i think any place that there's water would be good because people always get thirsty and they want to drink stuff yeah 
210.4,Chris,,of course ,you know i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Chris,,yeah so i mean technically those would all be part of the like the equipment that the scientists use for this discovery of water let's think did you think of could you think of any reasons besides just drinking that the water like looking at the text that water on the moon could be helpful ,wait um so teacher i didn't i didn't write the microscope or the lunar orbiter in mine so i guess i don't know what's wrong with my answer or how to fix my answer 
410.3,Chris,,oh okay so um you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon well so your answer was true it wasn't wrong so that's why you know the lunar orbiter and the microscope were kind of the more accurate answer to the question but the question was specifically asking what equipment they used to discover the water but technically your answer was right they did find oh i'm sorry they found craters of water so look back i'm looking back at the text as well so they actually yes look let's look back at the text together the ice deposits are very small so so i guess you did say that the they found craters full of water and there the text says that there was actually very small ice deposits and actually the total quantity of water on the top layer of the moon's surface is only about the equivalent to the amount of water you or i would drink in a day so you know actually i like the spirit you know you tried to answer the question but unfortunately does that kind of make more sense about where you're kind of going and what we're looking for with the question and it says that there's it's drier than the driest desert on earth so yeah you know there's actually very little water really on the moon ,um i guess you're seeing that the it wasn't a lot of water but i guess well i got mine from a paragraph and it saysum they found water water that can be found deep within the moon's polar craters and if i go swimming and in the deep in the deep end of the pool that's not a lot more water 
150.1,Chris,,that's true well that's more of like i know you mean i've been in i've been in like a crater like swimming as well but that's different than on a moon crater you know those are deep craters but they only found a small quantity of water does that make sense ,yeah yeah i guess 
150.1,Oliver,,um yes student ,i'm sorry but it's time for us to go so we'll see you later 
150.1,Oliver,,okay see you later hi class ,hello 
120.2,Luis,,um so i know that we just talked about this question right what equipment and scientists use discover water on the moon and student ,um yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,so even if you know all about space right i think it's still useful to be able to read articles like this and find evidence for questions that we're trying to answer so hopefully you'll still get something out of this class today does that sound okay ,that sounds okay 
230.3,Luis,,great thanks student and so student why don't we actually start with you i noticed that you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks is that right ,yeah yeah that's my answer 
120.3,Luis,,okay i'm wondering if you can read the question out loud for me can you do that ,question asked what he did scientists to us to discover water on the moon 
210.3,Luis,,so student i'm wondering about your answer you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank is not the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon ,um well yeah because if there's astronauts up on the mon discovering water they definitely have oxygen tanks 100 
420.3,Luis,,"and maybe check back in with the text and see if we can. pin down exactly what they used to discover water on the moon, knowing that oxygen tanks might have been there and part of the process, ",um okay um So what should I do next. 
120.3,Luis,,so would you mind reading the text for me and seeing if using something different at the end ,yeah i'll do that 
120.4,Jazmin,,great um well student doing that student can i ask you about your answer ,yes 
420.2,Jazmin,,so you said nasa centers small machine i'm wondering if you also can get a little bit more specific so what were they sending the small machines for ,"to watch a final water i don't understand why my answer is wrong out okay so well, I found it in the story, I found it in paragraph two. "
120.3,Jazmin,,oh awesome do you want to go back to paragraph two with me really quick can you read that first sentence for me ,nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate 
420.2,Jazmin,,oh well i think your answers right there right so you said nasa send a small machine i would include the rest of that sentence in your answer so what was that small machine called ,lunar orbiter 
150.1,Jazmin,,awesome yeah i think that's really important information to include because that's the machine that they use to discover the water does that sound right ,yeah yes that sounds right so i just add the name and then my answer is done 
150.1,Jazmin,,yeah i think so what do you think ,great yeah 
150.1,Jazmin,,that feel like a little bit more of a complete answer to you ,yeah yeah i think it makes my answer more complete yeah just like you said 
310.1,Chris,,student i'm wondering about your answer to you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon is that right awesome thanks for looking back at the text for me ,yeah it's so cool 
210.3,Chris,,yeah right i thought it was super cool to i'm wondering if we can go back to the question right the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon do you think that your answer answers that question ,oh what a scientist use to discover well well so i'm actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Chris,,yeah definitely scientists use a lot of equipment especially especially when they're going into space right so i'm wondering if you can make your answer a little bit more specific so we're looking for the equipment that they use to discover water on the moon and i know they might have used a lot of other equipment to get there right but was there a specific piece of equipment that helped them make that discovery ,well i mean the thing student was talking about sounded pretty good 
210.4,Chris,,yeah can you remind me what that was called you can look back at the text if you need to ,okay yeah i'm 
210.4,Chris,,awesome yeah was that what they used to discover the ice as a water ,um well i guess so 
150.1,Chris,,awesome why don't you talk with student and you class can figure out if that equipment is the answer to the question does that sound good ,yeah yeah that would be good 
230.3,Oliver,,great and while they're talking student and student i noticed you class circle the same thing is that right ,yeah yeah we saw the same thing on the microscope 
410.2,Oliver,,yeah okay so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i'm wondering if you class wouldn't mind going back and rereading the text and seeing if we can find a more specific answer what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon you class found the equipment that they would use to look at what they discovered right but it feels like we skipped the discover step somewhere in there the equipment they use to discover the water wall ,well how come you discover something after you can't see it 
310.1,Oliver,,oh that's a good question right i'm wondering if there might be some equipment that we missed in that text so maybe you class can take a look at that does that sound good that told us how they were able to discover it so i had the same question when i was reading it right i was thinking how did they find it they can't even see it ,okay yeah sure 
310.1,Luis,,awesome student ,um yeah so um i just looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch right now um i just wanted to say um it really matters a lot but you listen to every one of our answers and gave each one of us advice about how to make it more specific i really felt like you really listen to each of us so thank you so much 
310.1,Luis,,thanks student thanks for that reminder about lunch to ,me 
310.1,Oliver,,hi class ,hi 
310.1,Luis,,hi student do you have a question ,um yeah so i just have this this quick kind of question and mostly it's just because um well okay so i kind of already know everything there is to know about space already so i don't think i need to be in this class 
150.1,Luis,,okay student well i think that we are all here to learn from each other we're all here to learn from the article you class read the the article about water on the moon is that correct ,yeah we read that 
120.4,Farrah,,okay um so student um i'm going to well i'm going to ask the question the the question that we're thinking about today that is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and we're circling evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question so student can you tell me what you thought on what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,so my my answer was that i thought that they use they would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i believe that they use the microscope to find the water 
210.4,Farrah,,okay um in the text what did they what were they using the microscope for ,well they were using it to see because the water were these i think the word microscopic type like little ice crystals they couldn't see it with just like the naked eye so they had to see it in the microscope because it was so small 
210.3,Jazmin,,definitely so they said that the water was microscopic so they needed to find they needed to use a microscope to be able to see it um did they discover the water with the microscope or did they find something else to find the sort of source of the water yeah student ,um so i guess i was just confused because actually i feel like i answered this question so i was kind of wondering like why my answer was wrong or like not correct because i i think i had an answer to this question but i guess i'm not sure 
230.3,Jazmin,,oh student okay i'm just looking at your answer right now so student you said that nasa sent a small machine is that correct ,yeah 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay so nasa send a small machine what was that machine called ,it was the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah and what was the purpose of that machine so we had a small machine it was called the lunar orbiter what did it do what was the purpose of it ,i thought the lunar orbiter was what found the water like that's to me like when i read that that that text really closely it looks like they use the lunar orbiter like maybe a sensor or something on it to find the water 
230.3,Chris,,yeah they definitely used the lunar orbiter um to find the source of the water um so i wanted to talk to um student um you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon right ,yeah that's yeah that's what i said 
210.4,Oliver,,okay so when the scientist on the water we talked about that one word that was in the article that we read um that describes the water can someone tell me what that word was again there was one word that described the water how how much water there was yeah student ,um well it said that there was um well first off that the water was microscopic so like you could only see it through a microscope but they also said that there wasn't very much like they were talking about how they were taking the glass and measuring the water and there was only like very little water in the like i think it was like a ton of dirt or something 
210.4,Chris,,um so they found a very small amount of water right like um they found a very like a microscopic amount of water that they needed to use the microscopes then to look at right um yeah so um yeah student ,i guess i guess i was just wondering like i know cuz i went to nasa with my dad that astronauts use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits kind of like what student was saying and i guess i'm confused because i added that to my paper because it seemed like they were missing that in the reading it didn't mention it and it seems like that would be really important 
230.2,Chris,,so you and student were saying that they found or that they used equipment like oxygen tanks um so what in the article um made you think of oxygen tanks? ,well the fact that they were on the moon and the fact that basically like there's no oxygen on the moon for them to breathe so i was like well if they're going around with the microscope and the lunar orbiter and all this stuff like they better have oxygen tanks because otherwise they can't hold the microscope up to the to the ice you know 
110.1,Oliver,,definitely um yeah student ,um so unfortunately i know it was a really short time but we really enjoyed working with you but it's time for us to go to lunch and again i know it's a really short time but i really wanted to thank you for working with us because i think that we all really appreciate the way that you asked us to really look back at the text and to clarify our answers and you were really you like really valued what we had to say so i think right class like i think class felt like um like you are really listening to us so thank you so much because that was really cool was really fun thank you 
110.1,All,,thank you class hello ,hi 
110.1,Luis,,hi class i'm so i am go oh yes student do you have a question ,oh yeah so i don't think i have to be in this class because i already corrected my answer i changed my answer to scientists found ice using a small machine 
520.1,Farrah,,what we're doing today why have you class in a class is because we're trying to go even further we're going to huh yes and a couple of you class did revise your answers and you did a great job with that revision try to elaborate on and expand our answers a little bit i want to know what you class are thinking on both with your original answer and your new answer um so i'm going to be asking each of you what your initial answer was if you have a new answer what that answer is um and we're going to talk about it a little bit so while i'm asking one of your classmates i want all of you to listen to what they have to say and think about their answers and see if it can help you get a little bit of new insight into the text um so student i want to start with you um can you read your initial answer for me or even thinking beyond today what are some tools that we can use for future texts like these ,oh yeah absolutely so what i said in the first one was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close 
230.1,Farrah,,okay um so student can you explain are your what were you thinking on when you came to that answer ,yeah so i was thinking that basically like okay so it says what equipment did the scientists right and i was like okay so i'm gonna find equipment and i found that my personal and i thought this is definitely the right equipment because how could they find the water which they said was tiny microscopic and then like how could they find the water if they couldn't see it so that was kind of my thinking 
230.1,Farrah,,"equipment that they use and they do use microscopes right they use microscopes to study that water now um, can you tell me oh Jazmin do you have a question ",i just wanted to say that it was great the first time but i also added some details of the meeting i said that scientists used me she called the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon okay thank you for that student i'm i'm glad that you were able to revise your answer as well um so i student really quick i just wanted to go back to student for a little bit just to ask um student what was your revised answer so what i said when i revised it was that scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water craters on the moon i ended up with the same answer 
230.3,Jazmin,,um so student i'll ask you first um when you came up with your new answer um what made you come to that knew the answer how great so you class have the same answer in the end that they use the lunar orbiter ,it was actually okay so i knew in the first and today i said that the scientists sentence small machine but i realized that i looked up the name of the machine and then i realized after listening to them and student talk about how small the water was that like microscopic i thought that the best answer would include like what they were like so like they said the lunar orbiter and like what they sent it to you so that seemed like that was the right answer 
530.1,Jazmin,,okay um so when you're thinking about your original answer and your new answer what do you think the difference is between those answers ,well i think the main thing that i i added with detail like first i added the detail of the of the object so i didn't just say like kind of what it was i said like specifically what was it that makes sense 
530.1,Jazmin,,and i ,also like basically i i added detail about like what they were discovering because i just said the sense that the small machine but but there's more to the answer because it's saying like what you know what equipment did they said to discover and i thought like well it's an even better answer says what he said 
520.1,Chris,,yes so when we're thinking about answering questions like these later in the future i think that what you said about details is very important making sure that we pay attention to the details and add those into our answers very important thank you student yes student ,well i was just i actually had a question i just heard what student and student said and it made me think i had a question so the water that the scientists found was it was microscopic like it wasn't like a lot of water it was just tiny water 
210.4,Oliver,,oh that is a good question so i'm text it's said that um the ice deposits in the moon were very small right so we can tell that um it said in the text and didn't it say can someone actually answer this for me in the text when we were reading it um what did it say anything about the amount of water that was on the moon the amount of water yes student ,i remember because i was i was what i was seeing that it said that there were only 32 ounces of water in a ton of the top layer like the dirt on the moon and so they said that was just four glasses of water like in a ton of dirt which is a lot of dirt 
210.4,Farrah,,yes a lot of dirt and not a lot of water right um so harrsion definitely and there's not a lot of water we can see that but can someone describe how the water why did they need a microscope why do they need a microscope what was the the property of the water that made them need to use a microscope yeah student ,oh i would love to answer but we have to go to our next class but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with this this was really fun thank you bye 
210.4,Luis,,thank you hi again class um so i want to pick up where we left off um let's see student do you have a question ,um yeah so i got this all figured out so i think i'm good to go 
230.1,Luis,,can you tell me um what do you have figured out can you explain that to me ,yeah so okay so my initial answer when i didn't know was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that but then after we work together and i actually looked at the reading and all this stuff i said okay scientists found ice using a small machine 
230.3,Luis,,okay student so you said i'm scientist use a small machine right um so ,yeah they found ice using a small machine 
420.2,Luis,,"Okay, so we have that ice detail there, which is good that we are adding details adding in those important details that really fully answer the question right so um let's can we look at the text and try to come up so you said that they have a small that they're using a small machine but student i'm going to have you look at the text for a second and try to come up with an answer that's a little bit more detailed What was that machine ",what was the machine well the machine was on the you know the the rocket ship the thing you call it 
420.2,Luis,,You can definitely tell me or okay. ,i got it okay it's the lunar orbit 
120.4,Luis,,yes it's the lunar orbiter so um can you restate your answer for me now that we have that information can you restate your answer to that initial question ,yeah okay so i would say that my revised answer is a scientist found ice using a lunar orbiter 
530.1,Luis,,yes so that use the lunar orbiter so student what on what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer that you have ,well okay so you said that i needed to use details in the answer and so when i went and looked back in the in the reading i saw that the small machine was actually called the lunar orbiter like it wasn't a rocket ship but i mean it is a rocket ship but it's also like that's the actual name for it so that's what that seemed like the answer to be 
150.1,Luis,,yeah great job student so what i would say um is that it seems like with our first the first answers that we had um what we were definitely coming up with equipment that they were using those answers that are stated in the text for our question when we have a question that tells us to use the text so make sense student to come up with a specific answer we want to make sure that we really look deeply at that text to make sure that we include those important details um and use that to expand our answer ,yeah so like i should make sure that i i guess like look closely at the reading is that is that is that right 
420.3,Luis,,so maybe not literally looking very close at the reading but you definitely want to make sure that you're doing a close reading you're looking at the language that they're using certain words that might be important and using that to answer the question really come up with a complete and detailed answer ,yeah okay that actually makes a lot of sense so okay i think i understand 
120.4,Farrah,,great great job student um student i wanted to touch base with you um again i asked for your initial response um but can you please tell me what your revised response was ,"oh yeah sure so my revised response was that students use the orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water on the moon Well Okay, so the first time I thought Okay, the microscope is the equipment, you have to use. but then i realized after we had class together that actually the lunar orbiter was but discovered the water so i realized that i had to read the question really close and because i was focused on the finding the equipment not on what the equipment was doing because the question wasn't like how did scientists study the water it was how did they discover the water that so that was really different and once i realized that i realized i have to look really closely at the question like what it was asking "
310.1,Oliver,,that's great student and i'm glad that you were able to really think deeply about how you were answering that question and what you can do moving forward that's fantastic and student you have your hand raised before ,well i was just gonna say that i think that they're gonna try to build a base by 2024 which would be really cool 
120.4,Chris,,oh wow that would be really cool student i want to or student you had your hand raised also can can you tell me what you were thinking ,yeah absolutely so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you and i in particular i really wanted to thank you for working with us like you really helped us to understand like what we needed to think about in terms of our strategy so we were able to like think about how we found our answers and i never thought about that but it was really useful so i honestly right class like i found it really useful to like have the time to really think about like okay so how did i even come up with my answer because i come up with some pretty good answer but i never thought about like how did i come up with that so thank you so much 
120.4,Farrah,,hello students my name is teacher how are you doing today ,oh nice to meet you teacher oh we're doing great we're really excited for your class 
120.4,Luis,,thank you so much i appreciate that student so hey first before we get to your specific oh student what can i do for you what's going on ,um yeah well i just i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,i appreciate that and you know i i really look forward to using some of your knowledge to you know help grow our students knowledge but part of why we're here really yeah thanks is is honestly to understand you know one another's perspectives and maybe there's something that say student can share about space that you know that i don't know or that student doesn't know and vice versa so i think we're all here just to support each other's learning and understanding each other's perspective so thanks for raising that student ,okay okay 
140.1,Luis,,awesome thanks student okay so first briefly before we you know tackle your guys's responses i wanted to know just by raise of hands who would love to go to the moon someday any of you ,definitely want to go to the moon i want to be an astronaut so bad 
140.1,Luis,,that's so great student why do you want to go to the moon ,oh man well what just be such a cool experience to feel like zero gravity up there i can't wait i really want to go to space camp because you get to kind of try it out like almost before you get to be an astronaut and i want to discover new planets and galaxies too 
140.1,Jazmin,,absolutely me too so you know some of you didn't raise your hand so why wouldn't you want to go to the moon if class wants to share ,yes i can share 
140.1,Jazmin,,thanks ,well i'm really just more passionate about the earth and saving the earth and and i really think we should focus on this planet the one that we have in the one that we're living on and saving it while we live here 
110.1,Jazmin,,really great and would you mind sharing with me is your name pronounced hosni or student ,student 
110.1,Jazmin,,thanks for thanks student i appreciate that okay so oh no please go ahead student ,see i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.1,Jazmin,,yeah totally so let's let's dig into that now we want to talk about how we know that there's water on the moon and you'd mentioned and your response student that scientists into small machine to discover water on the moon right can you share more about what you mean by that by scientists spent or sent a small machine ,yes okay well i found that in our in our story in reading and in part two it said necessary the small machine called a lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
140.1,Farrah,,very good that's exactly right so let's let's kind of unpack lunar orbiter for a minute for a minute there does class have by chance in this class speak spanish by raise of hands class no one speaks spanish no worries okay so each okay well um you know the word for what is the word for moon in french do you know ,it's something we can like lune 
210.4,Luis,,yeah so in spanish it's luna so when we think about lunar as like an adjective as a descriptive word that's like basically of the moon and then does class know the definition of orbiter or orbit can class share that with me ,oh yeah up i got this one i bought this one we talked about it on orbit means to like on to go around something like the planets orbit the sun because we go around it 
210.4,Farrah,,exactly exactly so when we combine those two things we're talking about something that goes around the moon right so that is the equipment that nasa send or scientist sent to the moon and it circles around the moon and analyzes data collected at the moon now one other item here you know that that could be a little bit confusing is that so if this piece of machinery is not on the moon surface how do you class imagine that it actually was able to analyze dirt on the moon if it's above the ground essentially does class know that student ,well i guess i don't know i guess that's my question because i thought the answer was the microscope but if it's not on the moon how can they get a microscope there and look at the little water particles 
130.1,Chris,,exactly right and you know what you were onto something with your microscope response because by the way that is a really essential part of analyzing the dirt on the moon however the microscope is not how we got the dirt to analyze student what's up ,oh well i just wanted to say i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Farrah,,absolutely you're totally right when astronauts do go outside of their spaceships they do need to utilize that equipment in order to you know be able to breathe effectively in space because there isn't enough oxygen to breathe and so you know going back to how we found out that you are found evidence that there's water on the moon is that you know they actually implemented a really interesting strategy they basically threw a piece of the atlas rocket at the moon yeah they did and this caused a big crash that sent a plume of dust 10 miles into the atmosphere from the moon surface and then as we talked about that lunar orbiter it's in the air you know circling the moon and it was able to collect or analyze the dirt from that plume and this is where your points student comes in which is where they're based basically able to take that dirt and analyze the dirt where they found that there's a 5 water content in that dirt so that's where the microscope comes into play ,that microscopes not on the moon 
210.4,Oliver,,that's correct the microscope is not on the moon you know to chris's point utilize you know the oxygen equipment because it wasn't actually astronauts that were on the surface of the moon collecting that dirt it was the lunar orbiter the equipment and the student what's up ,i'm so sorry i just looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say when you just told us about how the lunar orbiter works that was that was so interesting and i wish the story told us that because i think i think i would have been a lot more excited if i knew about the throwing of the stuff in the and the smoke bloom and all of that stuff so thank you for teaching us that 
210.4,Farrah,,you're so welcome and i think sometimes these informational texts can be a little bit challenging for class and sometimes it just takes us all getting together putting our heads together and talking through it and so i appreciate your guys's discussion and your participation and just value your input so much so thanks class such a pleasure to meet you ,hi hello 
210.4,Farrah,,hi students how are you ,oh we're great we're excited to work with you 
150.1,Luis,,i'm so pleased to work with you today i always learned so much from each of you so i wanted to let you know so why we're here so based on the responses and i i've identified some areas that i think that we can revisit the text together to just really strengthen our understanding yeah student what's what's up ,i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,student you know what i'm excited for you to you know help share with us what you know about space and is i just wanna let you know that i brought you into the space because you and your peers because i'm so interested to hear everything that you have to share so and i hope that you do really ultimately there's always opportunity for each of us to grow our understanding on any topic so as i mentioned i learned from you class every day so we're here to work together to just deepen all of our understandings on the text and based on the responses that each of you provided i do think that there are some areas which i've identified where we can revisit and strengthen your understanding about space about the moon and about water on the moon that sound okay ,um yeah okay 
120.4,Oliver,,okay very good so we all responded to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and i think one area here that we could work on briefly yeah go ahead Oliver. ,um the question is asking what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon 
120.4,Farrah,,what we're looking for is the equipment that's in the text that we read so i want to turn now to some of your responses that's that is precisely it so we're not looking to discover water ourselves right on the moon we're leaving that up to nasa student would you mind sharing with us what your response was ,yeah okay i said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.1,Farrah,,okay yeah that's all right so let's can you maybe clarify your statement for me certainly a microscope is involved in analyzing water crystals on the moon but could you just clarify why you provided that response ,yeah okay so in part three they say the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at so they have to use the microscope to discover it otherwise they can't see it 
210.3,Jazmin,,My concern is is that your answer doesn't specifically answer how NASA got to the moon to discover the ice crystals that needed to be examined by by by microscopes. let's look back at paragraph two to re review and see and you know specifically how scientists got to the moon to have that top soil to to analyze and let's let's consider for a second tow just reflecting on this can class maybe chime in on that student please what might be the effect that where we just read a text one time some of these texts are pretty pretty dense pretty complex if we only read them once what could be the consequence of that how that ,well if you only read it once like you might not remember everything by the time you get to the end you might forget the beginning 
510.1,Chris,,that is precisely it you know what it's extra difficult when something is unfamiliar to us and gosh i know that student you know you you know a lot about space and you've learned a lot about space but for a lot of us and spaces just totally for and i mean let's be honest none of us have been there before right so when we're not drawing on our prior knowledge these things can be complex and reviewing them a couple times is important ,yeah well i didn't go to space but i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Chris,,oh my gosh yes you're absolutely right so when you went to nasa and you looked at those those items and did you by chance learn anything about them discovering water on the moon ,oh no no i didn't know that part till i read the story 
120.4,Chris,,got it got it and student would you mind sharing with us your response to question one ,yeah i said i'm scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
120.4,Oliver,,yeah so you raise such an interesting point there in your response to the question and you know what it's it's very true that they they actually did find craters full of water but my concern though is is that maybe the way the form that the water is in on the moon is a little different than the way that we see perhaps a lake full of water here on earth so can class explain to me how the water that was found on the moon is perhaps different than the water that we have here on earth student go ahead ,um yeah so um they said it's microscopic um they also said it's ice 
230.3,Oliver,,that's so smart okay so um you know that that information is specifically contained in paragraph two and that really goes back to you know the comment that student raised about about microscopes so there is water there but it's tiny right and it's actually in the soil within the craters so you couldn't see it if you were just looking at it you'd need the scientific equipment to analyze it more closely so you know i think that also brings back the point of you know if we you know only read a text or we read it quickly we may not catch all of these really fine details i also wanted to you know switch over to oh go ahead ,oh yeah um before we keep going um i want to let you know actually it's time for us to go 
230.3,Farrah,,okay well thank you so much and i appreciate you keeping an eye on the clock and it was such a pleasure speaking with each of you and i appreciated learning from you and with you so i'll see you in a little bit okay hello students how are you doing today ,good thanks for asking 
150.1,Luis,,thanks excellent so i brought you here because i would love to discuss with you your responses to some of the questions after we read our article about water on the moon yes student ,yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,student you know i certainly welcome your input about space and i'm excited to learn about what you've learned about space i think that we can all certainly learn from one another and so i wanted to let you know that i brought you into the class because there's always opportunity for us to grow our understandings of a topic even if we know a lot about them so let's dive back into this text and i think i do want to bring up that after my review of your responses i did identify some areas that we can revisit and where we can make them and you know i'm excited actually student to learn you know from you and you learn from one another or we can strengthen your responses does class understand that ,um yeah okay yeah 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay great student okay so let's take a look now at the question that's being asked because oftentimes it's difficult to respond accurately you know Does anyone want to volunteer and answer. okay well oh yeah go ahead student ,and it's it's asking us to find an equipment 
120.4,Farrah,,"you're exactly right exactly right so when we are going back through the texts and we are looking for equipment specifically i would like for class to write down in their learning journals equipment okay let's just write down that word real quickly and then i want class to take just a minute here to review let's do the first three paragraphs of our reading and see if you class can just jot down some of the equipment Excellent, Farrah, could you read us what your response was to question number one, please. ",okay i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.1,Farrah,,okay well how about if you just clarify for us to be in it you tell me why you believe that your answers right okay does that sound okay ,well okay they said the waters microscopic on so how can you discover something that's microscopic without a microscope 
430.1,Farrah,,totally so we're going back to the question so what what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon and i would say that you're certainly right that a microscope is essential to see those microscopic water crystals but i'm concerned that your answer doesn't specifically address how nasa got to the moon to discover that the ice crystals were there in the first place we were looking for the machine that they used really to get after to analyze the soil in the first place so can you look back at the text to identify this machine and then answer what that piece of equipment was ,i don't know yet 
120.4,Chris,,that's okay and i think we will get there but um yeah i really appreciate you trying and you know i think from your response student we can really just understand some insights into how we learn right you know it's very natural that you know upon first read of a text that we might miss some details and that's just totally natural i admit science is not or science space the moon water on the moon these things are foreign to me as well so i need to read the text a couple times to really comprehend what's going on there so um i would like for student please if you would mind sharing what your response was that would be great ,okay i've said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
210.3,Chris,,yes and that's such a wonderful insight so let's think about that for that for a second so these craters are full of water as the article indicates but i'm concerned that we might be thinking about water so student we'd love for you to share with us if you if you would um how water exists on the moon differently than it does on earth do you happen to know the answer to that ,Oh okay oh it's in craters its in craters on the moon. 
120.4,Luis,,okay it is in craters we actually do have water and craters here on earth does class can class else help and let us know what different form water might be in on the moon rather than liquid like it like we might expect okay how about student ,yeah okay student so the water on the moon it's not like water like a pool or like an ocean um it's like this tiny tiny little tiny little pieces of water tiny little pieces of ice you can't even see them 
230.3,Chris,,exactly so oh my i love that you brought that up so if you were standing there at that crater which is presumably full of water is what they're claiming right you wouldn't even know that it was there why because it's microscopic and it's actually mixed within this soil and that really goes back to you'll find that water inside the soil so it's actually invisible to the human eye and so okay yeah go ahead student farrahs point about the microscope where you're going to need a microscope to look at the soil ,yeah we'll talk about that like the microscope and stuff um i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
140.1,Chris,,yes that is you're absolutely right and and why student do we need oxygen if we're going to be in space or on the moon for that matter why would you need oxygen ,well yeah for people to breathe for the astronauts to breathe 
210.4,Oliver,,exactly so there is not enough oxygen for us to breathe without oxygen tanks on the moon and that actually brings up a fantastic point about can class share with me what water can be broken down into this was in the article yep go ahead student you know the potential prospects of finding water on the moon ,on i really wish we could keep going but it's time for us to go to lunch now but before we go i just wanted to say thank you so much for reminding us to read the text on more than once so that we can understand all the details i think that's going to be really helpful next time 
210.4,Farrah,,thank you so much i use that tool all the time so thank you class it's a pleasure to hang out with you today i'll talk to you later okay hello class how are you ,hello oh we're great we're really excited to work with you today 
120.2,Luis,,okay um so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon circle circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this questions okay ,um excuse me yeah yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,oh then you can explain to your classmate then before you leave then ,okay that sounds good 
120.2,Farrah,,yeah okay so does class know what equipment they use for discover the water in the moon i assume okay student ,okay so i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.4,Chris,,oh okay oh i see let me hear other other people and student you had the hands on i guess you can tell me why you think ,okay so my answer is um scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay well who else student you had a answer also when ,i said that nasa send a small machine 
120.4,Oliver,,okay um student you had a question you had answer also ,um yeah so i circled the same thing as some fan oh okay 
120.4,Luis,,so so student what are you what's what you have in your mind then for your answer yes ,okay um i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
230.3,Jazmin,,oh unfortunately i don't think they use a oxygen tank in this time and and so oh wait so student so your answer was scientists found the crators full of water in the moon i don't think the text said they found a big amount of just water but they found various little small things that you cannot even see with the human eye so they use a not use a little small machine and as student was saying small small machine to see the particle and then find the water in the moon yes yes yes ,yes so well what about my answer nasa to small machine i don't understand why my answer is wrong cuz i thought if we were in this class our answer was wrong so 
110.4,Jazmin,,oh sorry i was wrong they put the microsope it's not the machine but the microscope they use to find a water so the answer for student was correct one right ,so how did they use that machine though because they talked about that too didn't they use that to investigate 
210.4,Chris,,so you they found the water and moon by but you can only look at in the human eye so we just go look at your day i we weren't able to see it and you need a very scientific tool to oh yes student ,yeah so since we're talking about equipment um i wanted to say i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks like student said but also on masks and suits 
210.4,Chris,,yeah they use a lot of equipment so the research on things to find water particle i think so yeah you yeah so that's quite i mean they use a lot of tools and then my my machine and then microscope or those still thanks to particle to find a water on them ,yeah i i bet they need a lot of different tools to to find the water probably probably more than one right 
130.3,Chris,,yeah yeah i believe so yes and then one of them is a microscope to look at it closely to find a water ,right yeah because you said well that the craters you said they're not full of water like i thought right because the water is so small 
110.1,Oliver,,that's good yes student ,um i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand the text even better today it was really nice to meet you and work with you 
110.1,Chris,,oh thank you so much for your time and i hope you have a nice lunch time then okay we'll see you next time i'm looking forward to meet you again ,hi hi teacher 
120.2,Luis,,hello ok now so hello you the question you you answer the question about what equipment did a scientists use to discover water on the moon right yes student ,yeah okay um excuse me teacher yes i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.1,Luis,,really ,ya 
230.1,Luis,,okay did the scientists found the moon i mean water in the moon ,yes they did 
230.1,Luis,,how much how do they find out water on the moon do you know do you remember did you read the text ,okay i don't know that no i didn't really read it cuz i figured i already knew everything so 
110.3,Luis,,so please go back and read it again and then find out something you may find something new or at the same time or you can help other classmate who they may not have on they you might find something that you classmate may you may find something that you don't know and your classmate may know so you should stay okay ,okay okay 
120.4,Chris,,okay so um student what what was your answer ,um i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
130.3,Chris,,okay um that's good they found the water but how much i don't think we they didn't find it full a lot of water i don't think ,they didn't 
130.2,Farrah,,no does class can answer the how much water they found does class know okay ,my in my section is said it was microscopic um so that means that it was really really small amount of water 
110.4,Chris,,yes i think we today you need to see microscope so it is very small amount they found the water or i think student ,okay well in the part that i've read it said that they found the water deep in the moon's polar craters and when i go swimming in the deep part of the pool there's more water in the deep part of the pool than in the shallow part of the pool 
130.3,Chris,,yes yeah it's true when you go swimming you go you have to go through in the deep water so that you know you have fun but what they don't they they found in deep location in the moon not in the deep water they went to the ,okay. 
110.2,Jazmin,,okay so you can really look deep hi ya student yes you can look your answers are there you are correct they had water ,i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Oliver,,your answer what was your answer ,i said nasa sent a small machine i think your answer is wrong because me and student have the right answer the microscope is the right answer 
120.4,Chris,,what was your right answer was student ,i think the microscope is the right answer but the teacher didn't say that you had the right answer student well i think that we're right and you're wrong well i don't know that's why i asked the teacher oh well it's i got it right out of the story well i mean you didn't actually say the name of the machine student i said the microscope is the name i think that jazmin's one is right because um in in the part where it talks about the microscope it says that they're looking at the water in in in jazmin's section it says that they're investigating and i think investigating is closer to um what's the word in the question oh discover i think investigate this closer to discover than looking at something also i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
130.3,Chris,,oh yeah but i don't think they this time they sended those kinda equipment equipment because on the moon they just um yeah they use those kind of equipment in time to time for different for different researches but not this time i don't think ,well they need them to breathe on the moon 
210.3,Chris,,yeah true yes if they go to the moon yes they do have those tanks and wearing those big thing for the oxygen reasons but do they go to the moon the astronauts or is it the machine was sent to moon what do you think student ,oh i don't know i just thought the astronauts went to the moon but i guess in the story well it says scientists scientists have found evidence 
130.3,Chris,,yeah scientists found the evidence but scientists found the evidence but it doesn't mean that science went there to find it the machine could be sended there and then found the thing right ,oh i didn't think about that 
130.3,Oliver,,it is scientists they did find it but they went sent the machine to put the moon and then they found some water right yes student ,um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch i wanted to say thank you for what you said to student at helping me think about looking more closely at the story to try to understand more of the details of the story 
130.3,Oliver,,okay thank you thank you for your time okay have a good day bye ,hi hello how are you doing 
130.3,Oliver,,i'm good how are you class ,oh we're great we're so excited to work with you 
150.1,Luis,,i'm excited to work with you class too so you class just got done with reading the moon is a desert yes student ,yeah yeah but i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Luis,,yeah you do know a lot about space so you when we went through and circled the evidence from the text about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon what did you say again student ,um well i sat at scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
210.3,Luis,,and student that's totally right the scientists do use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks on the moon when we were thinking about what we were what scientists were using specifically to find water though do you think that there's anything else that maybe they could have used that wasn't oxygen tanks ,um i mean there's probably some other staff what i know that if there are astronauts on the moon they definitely have oxygen tanks 
120.1,Farrah,,yeah you're right if scientists on the moon don't have oxygen tanks that's not any good ism um do you student or any of our other friends do you class know where can you class look at your texts and see if you can find anything else about when scientists were looking for water on the moon yeah student ,well i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely because in the story and said that the water they found was microscopic 
110.2,Farrah,,before they found that water what were they what tools were they using to look in try to get that water out of the ground yeah they that is exactly what the story said and that was a really good observation ,well i don't know because i thought it was the microscope because how can you find something if it's too small to see 
120.3,Jazmin,,you know what student that's a great point can we all look at our text and look at the second paragraph student ,yeah i found my answer and the second paragraph and i said that nasa to small machine and i don't understand why my answer is from 
110.2,Oliver,,could you class look at your text and see if you can find any more specific information in that second paragraph student your answer is completely correct you're totally right when you said that nasa a small machine Oliver. ,okay second paragraph right we're student was talking about at sas nasa simple small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
130.1,Farrah,,yeah that's a great observation good job deb thank you so much that's exactly the kind of answer we were looking for when we are trying to figure out what equipment scientists use to discover the water on the moon but all of our other observations were also really close so you're right student when you said that they need to find they would need to use a microscope because the water was microscopic they probably did have to use a microscope but that's not necessarily what they were using to find to discover that water right ,okay so you're saying they had to use this orbiter to find the water before they could see it 
130.1,Farrah,,exactly ,oh okay well that's really cool but how how could i have figured that out on my own like without jazmin's help 
130.1,Chris,,Through the paragraphs and try to find things that. are that words that are similar to discover or can be associated with the word discover so the second paragraph said this lunar orbiter looks and another way to when you're looking for something and then you find that you're discovering it right You find specific. questions answers to specific questions yeah student ,oh well i i went to nasa so i know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like even said but also on masks and suits 
110.3,Luis,,"but they definitely if there are astronauts on the moon they're definitely going to need things like those big helmets and their space suits and oxygen tanks, those are super important for people if they're going up in space. astronauts on the moon at that time ",okay so there's no astronauts hmm um yeah i just looked at that story student and it doesn't even say anything about astronauts actually 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah it doesn't necessarily say anything about astronauts but it is a lot more fun to kind of imagine that there was astronauts in there up there and i think when we hear the word nasa we our minds automatically are like oh we can think of the scientists and the scientists in spacesuits right that's what i think of at least i think of an astronaut but lately especially nasa has been using a lot of other tools and a lot of the other equipment like some of the other things that we were talking about and the small machines the lunar orbiters student that you helped us find and they have been able to send those things in space instead of just people that as sao paulo i agree i'm a huge fan of space yes ,i'm i'm so sorry i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but before we go i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us think about the words in the story that we're like the word discover because i really thought it was a microscope but when you put it that way it really made a lot more sense why it was the lunar orbiter so thank you so much 
150.1,Luis,,you're welcome thank you class for an awesome class good morning class so we just read the water on the moon passage in class right yes student ,um excuse me teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,yes that is i love that you already know a lot about space student but we are talking about the moon specifically today and i just want to go over a couple of our response questions that we can make sure we all understand the vocabulary that we learned in this lesson and we can all be on the same page does that sound good ,yeah okay 
140.1,Luis,,maybe you can help us with a couple things student do you know anything that's super fun about space what's your favorite space fact ,okay um that there's no gravity in space you know so like if you go there you can kind of almost like fly like a superhero 
140.1,Luis,,yeah student do you know anything else about the moon ,um not really about the moon no 
140.1,Chris,,what about class else does class else in our class know anything specific about the moon that we didn't read in our activity student yeah ,yeah i know that they're doing a lot of work to try to see if the moon could be inhabitable or if they can study some of the geology on the moon to see how we can use it to help us here on earth 
110.3,Chris,,yeah that's very true student i like the vocabulary word geology you used could you tell our friends what the word geology means because you could you help us figure out what that word means ,yeah geology is like the study of rocks 
120.4,Farrah,,yeah awesome thank you so much and we know that the moon is kind of one big rock so it seems like there's a lot of geology that's going to happen going on in the moon huh let's look at our discussion questions so we were supposed to think about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon and i wanted to check in and see what evidence you class circled maybe you class could give me the number that you circled in our readings for where you found that answer ,um i found mine in paragraph one i found mine in paragraph two um me too mine was in paragraph three 
210.2,Luis,,okay so friends let's think we all seem to get really different answers and that's always so interesting there's a couple of words that i really wanted to focus on when we were thinking about our discussion questions when we think of the word discover what does that word mean can we think about what maybe it means to discover something so um for example if i was going to start if i wanted to discover a new element or a new planet student we've been learning you said you really like space and there's been a lot of planets that have been discovered recently right so if i what do you think that means ,um so like when they discover new planet it's like they find out that it's there they they find it or yeah something like that 
210.2,Jazmin,,so when we read our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon yeah so to to discover some things means to find or to locate something i want us to think about what equipment like what things did scientists use to find water on the moon right we want to make sure we are thinking about how they found it specifically student did you have a question ,yeah um so i think that's why i picked the answer from paragraph two so i don't understand why my answers wrong 
120.3,Jazmin,,student or student that was a great point could you read out the part in paragraph to that you thought gave you your answer ,yeah it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter line at the south pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater 
110.2,Jazmin,,can we think of what the specific name of that small machine is i want us to get as specific as possible when we're thinking about this specific equipment awesome student thank you so much so you said that nasa sent a small machine which is very true and that's exactly what we were looking for the lunar orbiter ,yeah it's called the lunar orbiter 
210.3,Farrah,,so um student i saw i know that you thought you were thinking about the microscope and i love that you notice that from what are one of the other paragraphs the third paragraph right it was student and student you class found that in the third paragraph yeah yeah so um i love that you class were thinking about them that equipment because that is an important tool but were they using it the microscope to find it or to look at it ,well i know they were using it to look at it because that's exactly what it says in the answer um oh if they were using it to find it on i don't know 
210.4,Oliver,,ya student you don't know so i'm going to read you class paragraph three and then i would love to hear you class i would love to hear if you class think that the microscope was used to help find it or maybe to discover it ,okay well in paragraph three they do use the word found it says all water they found was microscopic 
210.4,Oliver,,yes that is very true so that the word microscopic is a little bit different than the word microscope right so the water they found is super tiny and if they want to see it they would need to look really close with a microscope right ,oh okay okay 
120.4,Jazmin,,yeah so if i was going to if we were going to completely start over and i was going to ask you class what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon what would you class tell me the lunar orbiter ,um i guess i'd use jazmin's idea uh the lunar orbiter 
120.4,Chris,,student what about you ,um you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use of lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.1,Chris,,yes um what what about the paragraph that or the sentence that student helped us find in paragraph to do you think you could look at that and then maybe think again about what specific equipment that the lunar that the scientists are using ,okay yeah um so it's a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
210.4,Chris,,the lunar orbiter and what did that lunar orbiter do student ,it looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
150.1,Oliver,,yes and that's how they found the water on there right yeah student ,yeah oh cuz ice yeah sorry teacher i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll see you later okay 
150.1,Chris,,okay thank you ,bye teacher 
150.1,Chris,,hi friends how you doing ,hi teacher i'm good 
120.2,Luis,,so i want to focus on the second discussion question um so the can is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable student ,okay i think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good 
120.4,Luis,,can you tell me what your answer is too is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ,yeah so i said water can be split up into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
310.1,Oliver,,i want to focus on the word valuable specifically yes so student i see how you got that from our text and you focused on our fifth paragraph and talked about what what water is made up of can class tell me what they think the word valuable means ,um valuable is like when something costs a lot of money 
230.1,Luis,,that can be one way to think about it so to be valuable is similar to what student said it to have great worth it to be worth a lot and that could be money like um how we think of it often or it can be in other ways so um student you were talking about the parts of water hydrogen and oxygen why are hydrogen and oxygen helpful what makes those things valuable ,um okay cuz you know like accident we gotta breathe man we need oxygen to breathe so that automatically it's like really valuable cuz we'll die 
230.1,Luis,,yeah ,hydrogen i don't know i mean i don't know we learned that it's a gas but i don't know what we use it for 
120.4,Jazmin,,yeah um student i liked how you were thinking about the future and how we were talking about the future in our readings right that right now we can't do some of these things but in the future we might be able to i want us to focus on how it could be valuable right now like if we could just we could transport to the future and we're on the moon and we have all these things and we know that there's water there what can we do what would be valuable about having water there why would having water there be helpful for us i want to draw your guys's attention to the fourth yes so the fourth paragraph and then also i want student student and student will you class look at the fourth paragraph and then student and student will you class look at the bottom the last two sentences in the fifth paragraph and then when you class are done i would love for student i want you to tell us a little bit about what you found in the fourth paragraph that made you think that water having water on the moon can be beneficial or valuable and then student i would love for you to tell us why what you found in the fifth paragraph student ,okay so um in the fifth paragraph it says that like rocket fuel helps spacecrafts to move and the moon can serve as a stop for spacecrafts but i don't i'm still confused 
210.4,Luis,,yes sorry i think i drew your attention to the wrong part of that paragraph will you read the i'm going to read it to you that way i don't have to keep telling you which sentence moon water could be useful in other ways water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen just like you said student right astronauts can breathe oxygen oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel rocket fuel can help spacecrafts to move just like a gas helps cars so friends what about other than just helping astronauts breathe what else can hydrogen and oxygen be used for ,okay i heard this one and so it can like help spacecrafts to move like fuel 
210.4,Chris,,yeah um student and student and student you class read the fourth paragraph right what did you class think could be useful there are what did that tell you about the water ,okay well it says that the astronauts could drink the water um and it says it's the water is heavy i mean i already had that part in my answer 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah so go ahead ,well i didn't have either of those so i guess i could see how they could drink the water and that'd be important maybe they'd have like a water fountain up there or something 
210.4,Farrah,,so i want us to really think about how heavy water can be if water is really heavy and we have to send something all the way out into space using lots of rocket fuel and we spend lots of money on that do you think it makes sense to try to carry up all of that stuff with us if we already have it on the moon no do you class think it would be helpful if we already had if we didn't have to make rocket fuel here and take it up take extra up with us do you think it'd be helpful to have it on the moon already too Farrah? yeah ,yeah okay um i started out thinking well in the future it will be valuable as well it's in the right now it won't be valuable because it's not ready yet um but now i'm thinking that maybe if they can get on of water then they could like have something to drink and they could like make fuel up there too 
210.4,Chris,,"What do we did we learn about water is it super light and easy, can I carry a bunch of water around super easily. ",no so we know that it's heavy you know what teacher i was reading that through could be a base on the moon by 2024 
140.1,Oliver,,no way student that's so cool would you class like to go to the moon ,"yeah yeah man i would love to go to the moon i don't know about class yeah yeah we would yeah Okay um well I started out thinking, but there wasn't gonna be there's no way that we're gonna have any water on the moon so that's not valuable, but now I think I think that they might be able to make it happen um and so part. "
230.1,Oliver,,i would love to hear a little bit more about what do you think what different ways could we use water why is it valuable ,okay um and it's it's it's valuable cuz we could drink it on the moon and we can make fuel on the moon and um it's really heavy to carry so then they won't have to carry it on the spaceship 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah exactly do you class have anything else that you think that hasn't already been shared by student and student that you think that is super exciting that you think now that you didn't understand before ,um actually teacher oh something that is super exciting is that it's time for lunch but i wanted to say thank you for asking some questions about like how my thinking um it's kind of changed because i guess i wasn't really thinking about like what all those other parts of the story but since you were asking us all those questions now i realized that there's a lot more information on that i kind of missed in the story 
150.1,Jazmin,,awesome thank you class so much ,bye 
150.1,Luis,,let's give it a try thank you hi class how are you all doing today ,oh we're great we're so excited to work with you 
150.1,Luis,,awesome i'm really excited to work with you all to my name is teacher you can call me teacher if you'd like um and i wanted to get right into discussing the passage that you class read yes student ,um yeah teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,oh well student that's awesome because you know what i had to do a little bit of research myself to learn about space and so maybe since you're here in this class you can help your classmates and maybe even helped me to learn a little bit more to i think you'd be a really great resource for us what do you think ,oh yeah that sounds great i would love to 
120.4,Chris,,amazing all right well i was just wondering if class wanted to share just their thoughts on the text what did you think about it were you interested in learning about water on the moon is it something that maybe isn't your favorite subject any any thoughts um let's see student ,yeah she thought it was amazing that they found these craters full of water on the moon i never imagined there being water up there it is so cool 
210.4,Chris,,yeah student i had a similar but i did not know that they could find water on the moon and you know what when i'm looking at your response to the question which was about i really liked how you pointed out that they did find water and that they found water in craters because that's exactly right that's where they found the water but i was wondering student what equipment to the scientists use to discover the water based on what you read could you maybe tell me how they found the water what did they use to find the water ,um i uh huh 
210.4,Chris,,okay that's okay if you class have the texts in front of you we can look where it says number two do you see where it says number two i'll read it for you it says nasa a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar crater and these ice deposits are very small so based on those couple of sentences student what do you can you tell me what the name of the equipment they used was ,um well i think the name i heard was um listen we're better 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah student that's exactly right so that is the machine they send actually was called the l cross mission but they sent a space to try and discover where the water was on the moon awesome thank you for sharing that with me student that was a great job let's see student ,okay so i said something different i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.3,Oliver,,and you know i think deb also had a similar response right death yeah. ,i saw the same thing about the microscope 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah and so we'll first let's see raise of hands how many of you have used a microscope before yeah right so in depth maybe our friend can you share with you some of their experiences but like you said student microscopes are used to kind of blow things up and make them larger to our eyes that we can see them right and so that is correct it and they needed the microscope to see the water but they had to use something different find the water do you understand the difference ,well how can you find something if you can't see it 
210.4,Oliver,,mission that they had what they used was a piece of a rocket and they put that rocket into that piece into the crater which was. a big kind of like almost like an explosion of dirt and debris and dust and inside of that puff and cloud of debris and does that is where they found the hydrogen and where they found the water but do you see how they needed that lunar orbiter in order to put that piece inside the crater and then they use the to look even closer and see how much water they bound ,wow reach every reader thats so cool 
230.1,Jazmin,,yeah and so i also want to circle back to student because student i think that you circled right away that nasa sent a small machine so did you notice that that's what they use to find the water yeah right and but seeing student you said you know so much about space i was wondering if you could share a little bit about your your answer to the question and then dead i'll get to you right after student okay ,um yeah so i said that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks because if they're scientists up on the moon they definitely need oxygen tanks for sure 
210.4,Jazmin,,mm hmm and that's what scientists definitely need oxygen tanks because even what is oxygen and help us do we need oxygen to what ,to breathe 
210.4,Chris,,to breathe exactly and so the question is asking about what the scientists use to discover the water because does class know what water is made up this might be a tricky question for some of us hmm i mean are you hearing person what is water made up of ,water is h two o 
210.4,Chris,,that's right h2o does class know what he stands for ,yeah yeah it's hydrogen then the always oxygen because when i i went to nasa and i saw lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment 
150.1,Chris,,exactly that's exactly right and so that's why they're so excited for this discovery of water because if they find water then they can use the hydrogen and oxygen to fuel the rockets or they can use it to help us breathe so student that was correct in saying that the scientists they use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks but did you understand that the question was asking how did they find the water and what did they use and so that's why student circle the lunar orbiter the small machine does that make sense to student ,ah um yeah i can see that 
120.4,Oliver,,yeah but i like even how your mind was thinking about other types of equipment that scientists use that shows that it's something that really interests you and i really liked it that's where your thought process when when you were answering the question that was a good thought to have all right dad i'm so sorry for keeping you waiting what would you like to share ,what okay um i just had a quick question because all that stuff about the plume of dust and everything that's really cool but i don't know how i want to know that i'm otherwise like if you didn't tell us i think what i'm still a microscope because i didn't know any of that 
150.1,Oliver,,you know what i think that's right dead and my research i actually was able to watch a video about discovering water on the moon so that's where i found that extra knowledge and maybe i could even share that video with you all some time to it seems like something you might be interested in but based on the text right you're right did they did not talk about the food in the text so if we're looking back at the text and we're really thinking about the question right the question doesn't ask us how did the scientists see the water the question asked us what equipment that they use to discover the water so when you think about it that way does it make a little bit more sense that the answer would be the lunar orbiter ,okay yeah i'm starting to see the arm oh oh i just looked at the clock on so sorry we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand how the lunar orbiter works and how the question works to that was so helpful when you helped us see the difference between finding the water and seeing a water thank you so much for teaching us today 
150.1,Farrah,,thank you i had so much fun listening to you all and hearing your thoughts and hopefully we'll have more time at a different class to talk more about the moon and more about science ,hello 
150.1,Farrah,,hi class how are you doing today ,we're so excited to work with you 
150.1,Luis,,yes i'm excited to see you all again as well yes student ,i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,and that's amazing because you know what if then i'm thinking that maybe because you know so much about space already you can kind of be almost like an expert for us today and for our lesson because i can maybe refer to you if i have any questions and your classmates can also ask you questions about the knowledge that you already have because you know so much about space what do you think ,that sounds great 
140.1,Farrah,,awesome alright so first i was wondering what did class think about the passage that we read about water on the moon is class have any thoughts or any ideas about what they read let's see student ,well um i just found it surprising that there was water on the moon i never thought about that before so i was very surprised 
150.1,Chris,,student i completely agree with you i also was very surprised i did not know that there was water on the moon so this text was very illuminating for me that i learned something new student or student i know you also had had your hands up was there something that you either one of you wanted to share ,oh yeah well i sort of like student it really blew my mind that there was all this water on the moon like these craters full of water oh it's so cool to picture and i really want to go and see it one day 
120.4,Jazmin,,that's amazing i really hope that you can maybe you can be an astronaut one day and actually get to go on the moon that would be amazing to know that what am i students got to visit the moon that would be incredible um so let's see as i'm looking at your responses i think that you all had a good understanding of the text and it seemed that you all enjoyed reading the text but what i want to help you and walk you through today is helping you to think about what exactly the question is asking you because a lot of times when we answer questions we might get extra information or answer questions that that weren't being asked so i think that right now it's a good idea to think about exactly what the wording of the question was and think about the vocabulary and the words that were presented to us so that we can figure out the best way to answer the question without wasting your own time because we really want to think about moving forward in the future how to answer questions to the best of our ability so before we get started what i really want all of you to do is look at the question that was being asked and circle what do you think are the most important parts of the question so circle words that you think make the most sense and the words that you think are most important for you to answer the question correctly so i'm going to give you all about a little bit less than a minute just to do that read the question and circle what you think the most important words are in the question ok so now that giving you that time would class like to share what words to use circle that you think are the best words that will help you answer the question student ,and i said he is the most important word would be and discover 
120.2,Jazmin,,student that's a great word you know i'm gonna write that down to make sure that i remember that discover that is a great word that will help us answer the question and said what equipment was used to discover water on the moon great student thank you ,yeah and so i'm just wondering because i know that's the question and my answer was nasa send a small machine and x equipment and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
110.1,Jazmin,,you know student when i read your answer i actually thought that your answer completed the question correctly the the question was what equipment was used to discover wate so i think you circling discover is a great just a great choice for yourself i think that what you said made perfect sense that the lunar orbiter is what equipment with us to discover water on the moon so thank you for being our first brave volunteer to share thanks student i think that let's see what some other of your classmates circled as well but i do think that your answer made complete sense when i was reading over the question ,thank you 
120.4,Chris,,all right let's go student what did you circle ,okay so um well i circled equipment because well so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits so i picked equipment 
120.4,Farrah,,yes i think equipment is a great word to circle because what we're trying to figure out is what the equipment was right what is the tool what is the actual object right that the scientists use to discover the water we're not asking how they got there we're not asking how much water was that we're asking the question is asking what exactly did they use what equipment that's a great word i'm going to write that down on my paper as well what equipment didt the scientists use great student thank you so much for sharing all right let's move our last one student what did you circle ,okay well i circled two is that okay 
120.4,Farrah,,of course ,i circled it equipment just like student and i also circled water 
510.1,Oliver,,yes exactly because equipment again that is a good word just circle because we're trying to figure out what object what tools they use to find and the water of course that is the object that they were that is what they were trying to find is the water so it's important to know what equipment they used and what they were actually looking for and water like you said student is what they were looking for so yes i'm also going to write your word down as well and so this is a tool that you can all use whenever you're answering questions to circle vocabulary or words within the question that you think it's important for you to look back at the passage to try and determine what the best answer to the question is it's always helpful to circle keywords in the question ,um well actually we have to oh i just looked at the clock but thank you for teaching us this strategy today oh 
510.1,Farrah,,of course i'm sad i don't have more time with you all but i really hope that letting you all know how important it is to identify or select which words are most important within the question is always going to help you determine the answers that is always going to be a key strategy to figuring out the best way to answer any questions so it seems like you all have a good grasp of that and i've really enjoyed our time with each other today so thank you hey class is awesome to see you class today how are you class doing ,we're great we're really excited to meet you 
150.1,Chris,,i'm really excited to meet you class too and i'm also really excited to talk about this reading i'm a science teacher so i thought this was super cool did you class read anything that you thought was interesting in that passage ,yeah i i thought it was so amazing how how the scientists they found craters full of water on the moon 
110.1,Luis,,yeah that was wild student class else read something that i thought was interesting ,um yeah well excuse me um i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
140.1,Luis,,what's your favorite thing about space student ,oh my oh wow oh that's really hard um i think my favorite thing about space as how um pluto used to be a planet and then they said it was a dwarf planet it's not even a planet 
120.4,Farrah,,yeah that's that's pretty crazy too thanks for sure that student i'm glad we have such a space expert here so i was really excited to talk to you about this say i read a little bit about your guys's responses for what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon i'm wondering if class could share out one of the tools that they remember reading about for that scientists use during that research method mission yes student get started ,okay i said you need a scientific tool called him microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah and why did the scientists day to be able to look so closely in this case does class remember reading that ,yeah i remember 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah student share with us ,yeah well okay um i still felt the same as student for the answer and the reason they need the microscope as because the water well actually it's ice and it's really really really small like you can't even see it if you don't have a microscope 
130.2,Jazmin,,mm hmm yeah so i'm wondering if class can help us dive a little bit deeper into this were there any other tools that the scientist needed for this mission other than a microscope that we just heard student and student talk about a little bit yeah student ,okay well i said nasa send a small machine and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,well let's get a little bit deeper into that what was the job of that machine once it actually got to the moon yeah student you can ,yeah i think it said he investigated and then it found the ice deposits in the polar crater 
130.2,Luis,,okay and was there any other tools are parts that machine that helped it do that make it had to get it's all from the moon that you're talking to you had to discover some more ice so so how to do that student either you can answer or maybe student or student could help you out with that ,um i i i didn't oh okay well i'm my answer is oxygen tanks i said oxygen tanks 
230.2,Luis,,okay so even were in the passage do you hear them talking about oxygen tanks ,yeah that's something i didn't i didn't really read this one but it's just not because i already know so much about space i just knew that the equipment was oxygen tanks cuz how can you go to the moon without 
210.4,Jazmin,,"That, I think, might you might actually learn something new and it might be really interesting so let's take another look in the passage and see if we can find other tools that the scientists use beyond the. the robot that student was mentioning for them the small machine what tool do they use once they got that small machine on to the moon ",i i looked at again 
130.1,Chris,,i just see lunar orbiter and microscope okay what was the second one student microscope that's what student and student said and where in the passage student can we find one of those yeah exactly okay so what i'm hearing from you class now is we have two different tools that are really important in this either one which sentence ,well the microscope part that's part three 
230.2,Luis,,part three okay cool and what about our orbiter where do we see evidence that that was an important tool for our scientists ,oh okay i got it i read that passage and it talks about that orbiter thing oh it sounds amazing and it's in part two 
230.2,Chris,,yeah Chris start us off. ,well to to change my answer so i first i didn't we didn't really talk about equipment in my answer but now i'm thinking i need to put equipment and on so i went to nasa actually and i know that scientists they have to use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like student said but also masks and suits so i would add those equipment pieces to my answer 
420.2,Chris,,okay so here's what i'm hearing so much about your experience going to nasa and i definitely want to hear more about that but i'm wondering if we could make sure we circle back right to that passage what information in the passage might help you build a stronger answer to the equipment scientists needed for this specific mission ,sure the equipment has to be from the story 
420.2,Chris,,yeah for this one yep ,okay well then i guess i guess i picked a microscope i think 
210.3,Oliver,,cool yeah because in this question we're really trying to address how they discovered the water on the moon right so that's where we're focusing on those tools in particular does class else have a reflection on how they would go back and try to edit their answers or revise i should say yeah student ,"yeah yeah okay from from what we talked about it sounds like there's kind of two right answers like you could say um so they sent the lunar orbiter and then the lunar orbiter used a microscope Okay um well, I would say to discover water on the moon scientist used a lunar orbiter with a microscope. Oh Okay, well, I think what's different is I added I added the other piece, so that it had it had all the pieces, instead of just one piece. oh i'm so sorry i really want to keep going because this class is really fun but i looked at the clock and actually we have to go to lunch now "
210.3,Oliver,,gotcha that's important ,yeah we're getting hungry so but before we go i just i really wanted to say thank you so much for coming and for listening to all of our responses and helping us understand what were the pieces from the story that we could pull out and and how they fit together on that was really helpful to remember we had to find them in the story 
210.3,Luis,,yeah of course it was really nice to meet you class look forward to talking again soon good morning class i'm ms teacher it's really nice to get to talk to you class today how are you class doing ,um i'm good ms teacher but um excuse me i shouldn't be here i already know all about space 
210.4,Chris,,all right thank you for sharing that student let's dig into the question a little bit then when you class read this article what did you class think was the most interesting parts of it ,i thought about how they're looking for water on the moon is pretty cool 
130.2,Farrah,,yeahm did class else find something else that they thought was interesting yeah student ,well i guess that they're that they i don't know i guess i wasn't really thinking about interesting or just kind of answering the question 
120.4,Jazmin,,student what about you did anything stick out as interesting to you okay cool ,um well i guess i do think it's interesting that they're looking for water on the moon cause i don't know if they expect that we're going to have to like live on the moon you know because if we destroy our earth then we can't live here i don't know 
140.1,Jazmin,,yeah that's definitely interesting to think about would any of you class be excited to live on the moon if you could ,i mean i'd like to live on the moon but i don't think that we can and i would rather that we take care of the earth that we have 
110.1,Oliver,,student what do you think would you want to live on the moon yeah that's pretty important ,um yeah i mean that'd be pretty cool you know and then i could just kind of look down at earth and i can be like hey class down there i'm just chilling up here even though they probably couldn't hear me but it's a pretty cool thing to do 
210.2,Farrah,,yeah i think so too i'm really excited to get to talk to you class about this text today because i'm a science teacher so i thought this article was really really interesting so let's dig in a little bit to our question today our question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon does someone think they could start us off by rephrasing that question in their own words yeah student ,okay um what did the scientists what did the scientists use to find water on the moon oh yeah okay that's mine 
120.4,Jazmin,,well student what were you thinking ,um i guess i was let me try something different what did this scientists from nasa use to define water on the moon i guess that similar to um farrah's you know i feel like i answered this question so i don't understand why my answers wrong 
110.1,Jazmin,,so student what answer did you write for this question okay well let's dive in a little bit thank you thank you class both for repeating the question it's okay that it sounds similar ,i said nasa sent a small machine 
430.2,Jazmin,,but i'm worried that that's not the whole story could you look back to the text to the text and try to find some more evidence that supports that ,More evidence? i mean i could say the rest of the sentence nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate is that enough 
120.4,Oliver,,well let's think a little bit more clearly about that question right so we're trying to see what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon right like you rephrased so when the lunar orbiter actually got there i wonder if we could find out more about what tools it actually used to find the water right student do you have an idea ,okay yeah i was saying i was thinking well it says it'll land at the south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so i mean on one hand that means that it's looking for it but then my answer was about the microscope cause then it says you know at the end you know the water they found is microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so that was my answer 
120.4,Chris,,"so awesome that you found that really specific name for the tool right that microscopic water and you need a special instrument in order to find it Right so let's when we go back to the text, the microscope didn't get there on the on its own, and the Lunar orbiter didn't find the water on its own so i wonder if we could expand our thinking a little bit more about that process of discovering the water student what was your thinking for this question ",i was i actually found my information in the first paragraph because that's where they were talking more about the water on the moon 
120.4,Chris,,okay so what else what did what did you say for how the scientists found the water ,oh i said that they found craters full of water on the moon 
410.2,Chris,,okay and you already shared where you found that from in the first paragraph but i'm what was the question actually asking us to determine about this nasa mission yeah i'm worried that the response doesn't actually answer the question ,um what equipment that scientists used to discover oh what equipment i forgot the equipment part 
150.1,Luis,,i'll give you class all a second hang on student i'm going to give you class all second to go back and revise then i want to hear from student and to else haven't i heard from yet i think yeah awesome okay so how would you revise your answer to include that equipment part student have i heard from you ,nah but i'm ok 
120.4,Chris,,ok well student let's talk about your response we'll jump over to student and then we'll all get a second to revise our responses so student what did you share for the equipment scientists use ,um i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks you know i went to nasa so i know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.1,Luis,,okay so that was evidence you got from your own experience ,yeah 
120.4,Oliver,,cool always so interesting to apply your outside knowledge to what we're learning in class i'm concerned that your response isn't focused on the reading in this case so i would suggest you go back and try to find evidence from this particular reading that would answer this question student what are you thinking ,yeah sorry to interrupt you teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go so well i'll see you later okay 
120.4,Luis,,okay thank you student hi class all right i'm glad we can jump jump right back into it ,excuse me ah i think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good 
150.1,Luis,,student can i pause you for one second we're going to hear what farrahs was thinking and then we're all going to get a chance to revise before we continue okay ,okay 
120.4,Farrah,,alright student what were you thinking thank you for your patience i really appreciate it ,um yeah so um oh man teacher i don't remember what we were saying before we went on our break 
120.2,Farrah,,ok um student i just asked you to share out your response to the question of what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon ,yeah yeah so i i thought it was a microscope because i read this part where it says you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
420.3,Farrah,,Okay cool so I can hear the specific evidence from that you use your response it's clear in the text where you got that from i would suggest you go back to the text and try to find a little bit more detail about how the scientists were using the microscope to make this discovery ,okay i know you had told student that he didn't have the whole story so i went back because we have the same answer but i don't see i feel like it answers all the parts to the questions the who and the what and the why i mean i guess i could add about to look really closely at the water do you want me to like do i have to say water in the answer 
130.2,Jazmin,,does class else think they could answer farrah's question ,well i know i didn't have equipment in my answer so i had to add that um but for farrah's answer i guess she is saying the equipments and she's got her action word that they're looking really closely um maybe it is water part she she has to add a detail about the water itself maybe i'm still confused 
210.4,Jazmin,,thanks for sharing that student so going back to the text did the did the nasa astronauts just send the microscope up to the moon on its own ,no cuz that's why i have my answer the small machine because that's they sent that first i think 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah so student why was the small machine so important in this example ,because that's what they use to investigate that's what they use to look for the ice deposits right 
210.3,Oliver,,yeah thanks for sharing that so student you also wrote your response about the microscope so looking back at the text are there any other details that you might want to include now ,well i since you were telling student the thing that she said was was the right one then i think i'm gonna change my answer from the microscope to um the lunar orbiter 
230.3,Oliver,,so you think you should shift totally from the microscope to the lunar orbiter to clarify ,okay let me see um well because i thought it was a microscope but then student just said that they use a lunar orbiter to look for the ice deposit so i think it's the lunar orbiter not the microscope maybe 
420.2,Oliver,,so student where were you getting that idea from because i'm so let's go back through reread and really try to find an idea that's connected to the text. peers instead of ideas from the text ,okay okay so in the first paragraph that's what student had said but there is no equipment in that one um so in the second paragraph nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate okay um the lunar orbiter will land on the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater well then that's why i think that's the right answer cuz cuz it's looking for the ice deposit and that's what the question is asking us what what equipment are used to look for the water 
210.3,Oliver,,okay so if you got to when you revise your response what do you think you'll change ,um okay so i was saying that it was the microscope that they're looking at the water closely at but now i think it's the lunar orbiter that they're looking for the ice with 
130.2,Chris,,okay does that shift class else's thinking about their response to here student explaining where he found that in the text ,okay um i think i didn't even think about that second paragraph because of i was looking for water but now i guess now well because both student and student have the lunar orbiter and it does say it's looking for ice deposits so i think that's it too i think that's the right one and you know what teacher um i read that there might be a base on the moon by 2024 um so maybe maybe they the do need to find the water so that they can like start drilling for water or something 
520.1,Chris,,yeah that's definitely what's so important about this right student thanks for sharing that so what do you think you would do next time you get a question like this when you're answering a similar question ,me okay well i guess i'd make sure that i i have all of the parts to the question in my answer because i forgot about the first part yeah so i think that's what i do is have all the parts of the question in my answer 
120.4,Luis,,okay great let's take a minute right now and try to revise our answers and then student let's start with you for sharing out a revised answer to this question ,okay um okay so i think i'll say that scientists use a lot of equipment to discover water on the moon like the lunar orbiter yeah i like okay that's my answer 
530.1,Luis,,okay so what was different about that answer versus your first response ,well i i i use the name of the equipment from the story because instead of my background knowledge and i added the part about discovering water because that was in the question like student said 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay cool student is there anything else you would want to add to luis's response to make sure that it fully answers the question ,um well i kept the part i put about nasa cuz that's in the story too so he said scientists and i said nasa so i said nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to look for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
520.1,Jazmin,,okay so what do you think will stick with you for the next time you're answering a similar question ,hmm what would stick with me is that i have to say the name of the thing and to put more of the details from the story in my answer or from the question in my answer 
530.1,Oliver,,great student what about you how did your answer change when you were able to revise it ,i'm so sorry to interrupt you again teacher but it's time for us to go to lunch 
530.1,Oliver,,oh ok ,but i wanted to say you know thanks for for asking us some really good questions cuz i i hadn't really thought about like why would i change my answer and how would i change my answer i was just trying to make it more of a right answer based on what what student and student said and then you were like okay student but i want to hear from all of the story and not just from about the people and so then i had to kind of like go back to the story you know and try to figure out um yeah oh why so 
530.1,Farrah,,thanks for sharing that i'm so glad that that was helpful for you thank you see you class later bye ,hi how are you 
530.1,Farrah,,good how are you ,great we're really excited to work with you today 
230.3,Luis,,i'm very excited to work with you class as well student you started with you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely correct ,oh excuse me excuse me 
230.3,Luis,,yes student ,i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
230.3,Farrah,,oh excellent i cannot wait to hear all that you know about space let's talk a little bit more about that student student so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that was your answer correct ,yes that's what i said 
210.4,Farrah,,okay so in our article that we had talking about water on the moon i agree that you would need a microscope if you were to look at the stuff those scientists found what kind of tool are they using to find that water that we would use a microscope to look at ,well i i guess i thought the microscope was that tool because um how how can you find something if you can't even see it 
210.4,Farrah,,take a look specifically at paragraph two i agree that is very difficult but if we were to find that water right we're looking at the water and we're using a microscope how do we get the water ,okay well um paragraph two it says there's a small machine and it goes to the craters 
210.4,Farrah,,very good what's this small machine called ,nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
120.2,Farrah,,excellent so i'm going to ask the question one more time what equipment did scientists use to discover water and the moon ,okay 
120.3,Farrah,,paragraph two ,they i guess they use the lunar orbiter to discover it 
150.1,Oliver,,excellent they use the lunar orbiter to discover it student you said the same exact thing as student does that make a little more sense to you ,oh i think so um but i guess um i don't know how i would have picked that i think i think i still i still would have picked the microscope um until you told me to look at paragraph two 
230.1,Oliver,,okay so we're still thinking about that microscope right what makes you think that they want to use a microscope is it because you know what a microscope is ,oh well yeah we we know what a microscope is we use it in science class 
210.4,Oliver,,excellent so we're using the stuff that we're learning in science class and bringing it to this discussion right so we're talking let's look at that microscope right so we're using the microscope to look at the water when our question's asking us how we discover water on the moon when the microscope is used to dis hmm let me rephrase student so we're focused on the microscope ,i mean i guess i get it now i get that i got that the lunar orbiter is is how you'll find the water but i guess what i'm saying is i don't know if i would have been able to find that on my own 
120.3,Chris,,i see that i understand um let's move on to student and then student i'll come back to you if you're still confused by the end of it okay student you mentioned that scientists found craters full of water on the moon can you take a look at the the title for me can you read the title of the article for me ,yeah ok it says okay water on the moon is a desert 
210.4,Chris,,right can you tell me what a desert is ,oh well um a desert it's really dry 
210.4,Chris,,right right a desert is really dry so if we're saying the moon is a desert what are we saying there's not a lot of there ,well water i guess 
210.2,Jazmin,,right so maybe there's not a lot of water and now let's go back to that question so we're asking what scientists use to discover that little itty bit of water that we can find what tool do you think they are using to find that teeny bit of water student do you want to jump in ,yeah so my answer was the small the small the small machine and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
110.1,Chris,,what is that piece of equipment they used to discover that teeny bit of water student let's give student one more second okay so student double check that ,well i guess it's that lunar orbiter 
420.2,Jazmin,,very good very good alright student um your answer was almost there and you've got just half of it i want you to be a little more specific so you told me that nasa sent a small machine which is absolutely true can you tell me what that small machine was called ,well we said it already it's the lunar orbiter That was it? 
150.1,Jazmin,,does that makes sense student teacer that was it ,so i just have to say the name 
130.3,Jazmin,,nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter that way i know all i need to know ,oh wow ok 
130.3,Chris,,student ,oh well okay i thought of some more some more information 
130.3,Chris,,excellent ,and because i am i actually went to nasa and i know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.3,Luis,,right they do and that's exactly what student told me right so student you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right ,they sure do 
210.3,Luis,,and that is absolutely true scientists do use all those kinds of equipment now they use these types of equipment for very specific things right so an oxygen tank is something that we use when we can't breathe really well so if a scientist is looking for just a little bit of water on the moon like all the rest of our friends here said think about what kind of equipment that kind of scientists would use to look for water on the moon ,okay i think i get what you're saying like um all astronauts need oxygen tanks but um certain astronauts need something different to find the water 
210.1,Oliver,,possibly you need different tools for different tasks right student ,um yeah i'm so sorry but i just looked at the clock out we have to go to lunch right now 
210.1,Oliver,,ok ,before before we go i wanted to say thank you because you really helped us understand the question and how we needed the tool for discovering the water and that really helped me see why my answer wasn't quite the right answer and so thank you so much for helping us understand that 
210.2,Luis,,well thank you for working with me hey class so you gave really great responses to this question i want us to backtrack and think about what exactly is equipment student what do you think equipment is ,well actually i wanted to say i shouldn't be in this room already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,that's awesome student that you have previous experience you know it's really important that in our class we work together so maybe you can help out your classmates to understand this text a little bit better ,oh yeah i can definitely help out 
210.2,Luis,,so student do you want to try answering that question for us what does equipment mean ,um yeah okay so as it's like a tool and it's something you use to do something 
130.2,Farrah,,that's a great definition thank you so much student does class else want to add on to what the word equipment means yes student go ahead ,um so sometimes equipment could be something old but sometimes it could be maybe something you wear on your body 
210.4,Oliver,,that's also a really great idea thank you so much student for sharing that with us does class else have any other ideas about what equipment is alright i see some head shakes those are both really great definitions that we got from student and student so in this text we learned that the scientists needed to use equipment on the moon why do you class think they needed to use equipment why couldn't the scientists just look with their eyes or touch with their hands go ahead student ,so actually in the text it says the water because we know that are looking for water is really really really really really small so they can't just look at it they need equipment to help them find it 
210.4,Farrah,,that's a great idea what type of equipment do you think they would need to look at water ,um so me and student um we had the same answer and it was the microscope um yeah we agreed it's the microscope on because you can't look at it at the water without the microscope so i don't understand why is our answer wrong 
210.3,Farrah,,it's a great answer scientists absolutely use microscopes all the time to look at really small things like for example water so that's a great idea that both of you had i want to push you a little bit to think about what the scientists be able to use the microscopes on the moon ,oh well i mean i guess i thought they did on yeah i thought so but maybe maybe not since you're asking about it 
210.4,Farrah,,have you ever used a microscope student ,oh yeah yeah we use them in science class 
130.2,Chris,,that's awesome um so how about we just like put a quick pin it we're going to come back to this microscope idea the microscope is a really great tool that lots of scientists use um student you have your hand raised earlier do you want to maybe add on to what student and student have shared so far ,oh yeah well so i'm in terms of equipment actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.1,Chris,,yeah and why did why did nasa astronauts need all those things ,uh well those things they all they help them stay alive when they go out into space and they keep them safe 
230.1,Chris,,yeah could you tell me a little bit more about those suits what do they look like ,oh they they kind of look like sleeping bags with arms they're all white they're kind of poofy um they've got a big kind of backpack looking thing on the back and then they've got the helmet with the with the circle of glass that you can see through 
210.3,Farrah,,yeah awesome that's that's a really great description of a space suit i'm really glad you have that experience student um so student and student i'm going to come back to you class student you said that you have used a microscope before right so an astronaut or a scientist if they were to use a microscope on the moon like student said they would need to wear one of those big suits to keep them safe do you think it might be a little challenging to use a microscope with a big suit or do you think they'd be totally okay ,it seems like that'd be pretty hard 
130.2,Jazmin,,yeah right so what type of other equipment do you think they might need to make it a little easier to look at water is there something else that they maybe brought student is it okay if student helps you out this question yes please awesome student go ahead ,okay so i said and i found this in the story that nasa they sent a small machine to help them find the water 
230.2,Jazmin,,yeah that's what can you tell us which paragraph you saw that in see they're numbered 1 2 3 ,i found it in paragraph number two 
210.4,Farrah,,awesome great yeah we does class see in the first sentence and paragraph two it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbit to investigate great i'm seeing head nods so coming back to you student so student helped you out you pointed out this small machine do you think that's something that scientists would be able to use to help with the big suit problem ,yeah yeah it sounds like the microscope it'd be kind of hard maybe to hold um and look through with the with the circle last thing that student was talking about so it sounds like they might need another tool instead 
130.2,Oliver,,yeah that sounds great student you started out the same answer as student do you agree with what you said you want to add on ,oh yeah i agree but i'm also um i don't really know how i would have figured that out if student hadn't told us about the suits and things how would i have figured that out just on my own 
130.2,Luis,,that's a great question maybe let's come back to student student we haven't heard from you since the beginning can do you think you could answer oliver's question how would he know that scientists would face some of these problems with the big suits and having to survive on the moon ,um well i mean it helps to know a lot about space like me and i guess student he kind of knows a lot about space too but i would say when you read about space just try to like picture it in your head and really see it um come to life and then you can imagine the astronauts calling them microscopes um or using the machine or orbiting the moon or all of that stuff just picture it in your head student come on 
110.3,Oliver,,oh student i see you raised your hand do you have a question thanks student i know you already know a lot about space but not class has necessarily had that experience um can you tell us ,um well actually i looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now all but i wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to all of our answers and taking the time to help us understand the meaning behind the text and the microscope that was so helpful thank you so much 
230.2,Farrah,,thank you for being great students have a good lunch hi class i'm i'm so glad that class had shared their answer and i want to call on student could you explain more about what in the text me do you find your answer ,yeah okay well i'm so on the third paragraph at the bottom it says that the water is microscopic so you need a microscope to look really closely 
130.2,Luis,,so what does class else think do you class agree that the microscope is the technology and the equipment that is needed in order to discover water on the moon or do you disagree and might think it's something else i see that student has his hand up so i'll take your hand and then we'll get back to debating student ,yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,well that i mean we all have parts of knowledge that we love and are passionate about but i just want to make 100 i just want to be 100 clear that we all have gotten it and understood it ,oh yeah oh ok that's fine 
130.2,Oliver,,okay so back to savannas claim she said that the scientists need a microscope in order to look really closely at at the finding water on the moon is that something that you agree with or disagree with based on the text and when you answer i want you to be able to find exactly where in the text he found your answer student ,yeah so actually i circled the same as student about the microscopes and she she showed us the part in part three where it talks about arm a water being microscopic um and let's see what else does it say um yeah so you wouldn't be able to see it as if you were looking straight at it 
120.3,Oliver,,yes so you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it can you read the next sentence out loud for us please ,okay um so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Oliver,,so just using that one sentence student and i'm really glad that you're making sure that you prove your answer with a point that one sentence you just read you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely why would you need a microscope according to that sentence what are you going to do with the microscope in that one sentence ,i'm gonna look at really really small bits of water 
210.3,Jazmin,,so yes you're 100 correct so if you need to look at those really small bits of water does that help you discover all of the water on the moon or just bits and pieces of that water student ,oh yeah thank you so i i kind of disagree about this microscope part and in my answer it was that necessity to small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
130.2,Chris,,okay well i'm going to toss it back to the class is her answer wrong and if it is explained why with evidence from the text ,okay can i try 
130.2,Chris,,of course ,okay well so there's the microscope and there's the lunar orbiter thing and let me see okay well i'm here in the text it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate on and oh i don't know they both sound like really good answers 
210.4,Chris,,okay so keep going so you were reading paragraph two and what do you think the purpose of that small machine the lunar orbiter is for what did they do ,what it says okay this is from the text it says investigate 
210.4,Luis,,yes and then what else does the lunar orbiter do ,oh i know um can i go can i go 
110.1,Luis,,could you let it student finish his sentence and then you could go next ,okay okay 
120.4,Chris,,of course thank you student i appreciate that and thank you for being so patient and student where you done speaking or did you want to add more about what the lunar orbiter does ,well i wanted to add on it's really about the lunar orbiter but it's that on i went to nasa actually so i know that the scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.4,Luis,,yeah and that's amazingly important background knowledge that you know we need to keep in our brain especially one more understanding of what's going on and trying to see how the scientists are able to find water on the moon student could you share your answer now thank you so much for waiting so patiently ,oh yeah well i was just gonna say that about the lunar orbiter so what it does is it looks for where the ice a little a little small it looks for where it is on the moon yeah because you asked what it did 
230.2,Luis,,yes and can you tell us exactly where you found that in the text which paragraph and sentence in that paragraph ,yep yep yep okay um paragraph two and the second sentence 
210.4,Oliver,,alright so i want class to focus in on the second sentence and we're going to look at it in paragraph two it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater so i want to combine student to answer with luis's answer and kind of marry them together and the lunar orbiter was a student was 100 correct when he said it's there to investigate right and what it's investigating is what student shared with us from paragraph to sentence to that it's looking for ice deposits in a large polar crater if it's looking for ice deposit what do you think it's looking for what are ice deposits student ,well ice and is the same as water that's like frozen water 
210.4,Oliver,,so what can the lunar orbiter help us find ,oh so that helps you find the water or really small water 
110.1,Oliver,,yeah ,yeah um i just looked at the clock actually we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say before we go thank you so much for really helping us look at the text and find the words and the parts of the of the story that we're going to help us find our answer that was so helpful 
120.2,Luis,,thank you so much i enjoyed being with you class today have a great line hi class thank you so much for coming over to the table we are going to go over and check our journals responses about water on the moon so i know that first up we have the first question we answered in our journal which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon when i say go you are going to turn to your table partner so right now we have an odd number of people so student and student you two will be together and then student student and student you will make a class of three yes student ,um excuse me i should have been desperate i already know all about space 
130.2,Chris,,well we're just going over our journal answers to talk and discuss in maybe learn more from our friends who are in our class with us so that is why we're all together at our table so when i say go we're going to go to our table partners so again since we have an odd number student and student you two will be together student student and student you class will be a class of three when i say go you're you are going to have the partner that is closest to the big window in the back okay any questions before i say go and share their answer first with what they think the answer to number one is then share their evidence and prove why they're right alright awesome so when i say go turn and talk to your partner we have a class of three person closest to the window goes speaks first says their answer evidence go ,on okay i'm i'm closest to the window and i said microscope and i think it's because in part three it says the water is microscopic so that means you can't see it without a microscope okay um my answer is that scientists found craters full of water on the moon on and i found my evidence in part one um it says that scientists found evidence of water in the moon's polar craters 
120.2,Jazmin,,so give me a thumbs up if class has had a chance to share in their class awesome so let's bring it back in 3210 all right so can i have someone raised their hand and share what answer that they got for number one and where they found the evidence in the tax alright so first i see a student could you share what your answer was please am the evidence ,okay my answer is nasa center small machine and the evidence is the first sentence and paragraph two and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.1,Jazmin,,so um what makes you think that your answers wrong ,um well since i'm in this class 
150.1,Jazmin,,just because we're in a class together doesn't mean that your answers wrong we always do small groups in order to make sure we deeply understand everything that we're doing in our class so just because you're here doesn't mean that you're does that make sense that you're necessarily wrong we're just going and pushing our thinking to think more deeply about what we're reading about does that make sense right also ,makes me feel better 
120.2,Jazmin,,awesome so with some confidence of what did you get for number one and where did you find your evidence ,okay i got nasa sent a small machine and i found my evidence at the beginning of paragraph two 
120.2,Chris,,okay so i noticed that you definitely look for those key vocabulary words and you also made sure that it matched lunar orbit orbiter which has to do with the moon so i lovehow you really use the key vocabulary to help you find your answer so really great job can i have somebody else share their answer please alright student your it's your turn what did you get for number one and where did you find your evidence and proof ,oh well so this isn't what i said for number one but now i realized number one is talking about equipment and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.2,Chris,,"and you said that you change your answer, could you tell me your first answer then what you changed it to. could you tell us specifically what piece of equipment did they use in this reading in order to find that water on the moon ",mm hmm okay so well first i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon and that's still true but when i talked to student and student they both were talking about equipment on so since you said student had the right answer i think it's a lunar orbiter 
130.2,Chris,,oh so i should be clear i didn't say necessarily that student had the right answer um i liked how she used the important vocabulary in the text to help her find her answer um but would you still say even if i'm if i said i'm we don't have a correct answer yet would you still agree with student or would you or would you go with your first answer ,um well i'm not sure i think my first answer is right but um i know it doesn't say equipment but i don't really know what the equipment is i just listened to student 
310.1,Oliver,,okay i really loved how you really listen to your partner during the discussion and you know you class are really thinking about hmm who is right and sometimes it's not easy to you know have a different answer than someone else i love how you both had different opinions and said your evidence and went there yes student ,on i'm sorry but it's time for us to go 
310.1,Oliver,,oh no so soon okay well we will continue this conversation i think after lunch and then when we come back from lunch or really going to sit and think about okay what evidence proves the the most correct answer right and then okay we'll talk about that ,all right see on 
150.1,Chris,,all right bye so student could you repeat your answer for us please hi it's nice to see you all again and i am excited for us to dig deeper and understanding about water on the moon ,mm hmm so my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon but when i talked to student and student they were both talking about equipment so on i'm not really sure what the right equipment is 
130.2,Luis,,so student is a little confused about what actually is the right equipment does class have a suggestion for what student to do next student ,um yeah well i just wanted to say um i think i got this all figured out so i'm good 
130.2,Luis,,so can you help us move our thinking forward what is something student to do to confirm his thinking ,okay i'm student you need equipment and your answer so i said oxygen tanks because that is definitely equipment that scientists use on the moon 
230.2,Luis,,could you tell me where you found that in the text ,um okay well i just know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for this water i definitely have oxygen tanks 
130.2,Farrah,,i mean you're 100 right and using that background knowledge but when we answer questions especially questions about a text we always want to make sure that our answers on have evidence that are found directly from the text i am actually going to put on a timer for class and when i say go i want class to go back into the text and make sure that their evidence talks about one like student was saying a piece of equipment and to it also talks about how it helps scientists find water on the moon does class have any questions so when i say go you class are going to pick up your pencils and work by yourself look back in the text and really make sure that the evidence you put a circle around really has the specific equipment that is needed to find water on the moon alright so go i am now looking for the best piece of evidence that matches and talks about equipment to find water on the moon give me a thumbs up when you are done alright perfect so now when i say go i want you to turn back to your same groups your same partners and the same person who was by the window closest to the window sorry is going to speak first and i want you to share with your partner the exact piece of evidence that you circled in the text this time around and if it changed tell your partner why all right go ,okay um my answer didn't change it's still microscope and i circled the word microscope because it is in the third paragraph i'm okay i um i circled small machine because like student said small machine it's a piece of equipment 
120.4,Farrah,,hey let's bring it back in 54321 and zero so can i have a friend raise a silent hand and share with the class what evidence they circled for this time around student ,okay yeah i circled you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.1,Farrah,,tell me more why does that make you think that that is what helps find water on the moon ,well actually i'm i'm still kind of confused 
150.1,Oliver,,is class else confused um i don't know if you class can do and i agree sign but we that's that's what i do in real life so i'm student ,on yeah i'm confused too because while we both said microscope and there's evidence and the text but there's also the machine and i don't know what the right answer is 
210.4,Oliver,,yes that's totally fair so on paragraph three i'm looking and class else should be looking in their texts that paragraph three just so we can all look and think critically about this piece of evidence to see if it matches our question um i'm noticing that the sentences around the microscope word helped me understand exactly what the microscope was used for so let me read them out loud and while i'm reading i want you class to read silently with me and think about is the microscope actually the machine that helps scientists find water on them get water on the moon apologies so the water they found and i'm on the second sentence paragraph three the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you do need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so friends in those two sentences what i was looking at the words all around microscope and that helped give us something called context um after looking at that context do is sorry excuse me does the microscope actually help get water out of the moon ,and well it sounds like that helps someone look for the water and look out for water because you can't see it without the microscope 
120.3,Chris,,yeah that is that is 100 correct but can i have somebody read question one out loud for us again student ,yeah okay the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and well i read that there could be a base on the moon by 24 
210.4,Oliver,,yes thank you but we are looking specifically for how were they able to find that water on the moon and the way that they were able to find that water on the moon um let's see if paragraph three answers that and i'm looking around where it says the water they found is microscopic i know when i see the water they found is microscopic they're describing what the water actually looks like so when they said meaning you want to be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd have to use a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely my brain is thinking is that actually telling me how they got they were able to see the water or describing how small the water is ,that explanation makes sense but they're just describing the water um but i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go on but before we go i wanted to say thank you so much because you really explained what each one of us need to work on and give us a really good ideas for how to think about the text and the question and a new way thank you so much 
230.2,Luis,,thank you have a great day student could you point out in the text where you saw that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks ,oh well actually well i was just gonna say i i shouldn't even be in this class because i already know all about space 
120.2,Luis,,okay so while we're using space as a context for this actually our classes more about learning how to extract information from readings so it's more of a reading exercise rather than a space exercise so if i'm looking right now the text if you want to show me where in the text it says that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks that would be helpful for me to understand for answering the question on what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon ,um well um okay well um i guess it's um i didn't circle anything in the reading um but i just know that after scientists are astronauts on the moon i know they need oxygen tanks 100 
210.3,Luis,,okay and that's correct do you think the oxygen tanks help them discover water on the moon ,wow they need the tanks to stay alive while they discover water on the moon 
210.3,Luis,,correct yeah that's great and then do you think that there's other equipment that they probably used in order to discover the actual water or do you think ,yeah probably 
130.2,Farrah,,okay um someone else i think student or actually student um do you agree with student that that oxygen masks were what was used in order to actually discover the water on the moon ,well okay i think student has a good point about how the astronauts probably used to the oxygen tanks but i think for discovering the water i found a different tool which is on the microscope and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.2,Farrah,,no no one said your answers necessarily wrong but could you point out in the text where you saw that the scientific tool that was used for the water was the microscope ,yeah so it's in part three 
120.3,Farrah,,and specifically what is the sentence say ,yeah it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Farrah,,right so is there a difference between you would need and nasa used the scientific tool called a microscope ,well i guess i just kind of thought when they said you would need that it meant the scientists would need a microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,okay um so do you think this piece was written for the scientists or for us to read ,oh well i think for us right the scientists don't need this 
210.4,Farrah,,so then when it's saying you that would be referring to us we would need a microscope ,oh whoa okay i i didn't even think of that that's so interesting so the scientists they didn't need a microscope 
230.1,Jazmin,,so maybe there was another equipment that they used in order to discover the water let's move to student student you said that nasa census small machine could you describe more this machine that they use ,and okay so nasa such a small machine and and let me say and it says them a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,and what is the lunar orbiter look for ,i think oh i said i know this okay it says it looks for ice deposits 
210.4,Jazmin,,and what is ice how's that is it related to water ,yeah because i was just frozen water 
210.4,Farrah,,okay so student going back to you i'm wondering do you see student so student talked about this lunar orbiter that is looking for frozen water on the moon does that sound like something that maybe the scientists used to discover water on the moon ,yeah cuz i think with what you said with the part student read it says nasa nasa scientists war machine 
110.1,Chris,,right so perfect student ,yeah well actually student i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like will like oxygen tanks like student said but also masks and suits 
230.2,Chris,,right that's very true now does this specific piece of writing does a specific article mention any of the other equipment that we that was used ,know the story the story just says the small machine and the microscope 
210.4,Chris,,right now did they use the microscope for discovering the water or is the water so small that if a person had to see it maybe they would have to use a microscope ,right right right yeah yeah i heard you talking about that was so valuable for yeah thank you for reminding me 
210.4,Oliver,,know sure um so wow ,i'm i'm so sorry um i just looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch right now but i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us read the text really closely and understand the really small differences between between the the microscope and the lunar orbiter that was so helpful 
230.1,Luis,,sure glad i could help have a great lunch hi class so our question today was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon student can you explain to me how you came to your answer ,yeah well actually i was just gonna say that i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
230.2,Luis,,well that's wonderful but specifically going to the text what did you see in the text that led you to your answer ,um well i just i just know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for this water they are definitely using oxygen tanks 
430.2,Luis,,right and i think it's great that you're bringing your knowledge from all the studies that you've done on space which is amazing but i'm concerned that we're not looking and finding the proof from the text and we're using outside knowledge which maybe your classmates might not have so if we could redirect yourself to the text i suggest rereading it and picking out the exact line where it says what equipment scientists or nasa us to discover water ,okay um i guess i should read it yeah okay 
230.2,Jazmin,,and while you reread that student out i'll move on to student student what in the text drove you to your answer ,ok so my answer is nasa sent a small machine and i found that at the beginning of like paragraph 2 
430.2,Jazmin,,what i'm concerned with is that you've left it at small machine i suggest kind of maybe going on perfect i love how you identified that nasa sends a small machine and i think you're on the right track to the second part of this sentence and to identify what specifically was the small machine that they used ,okay it says it's called a lunar orbiter 
110.1,Farrah,,yes exactly now student yes ,can i go next because i i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.2,Farrah,,right so student where in the text did you find the microscope ,on part three 
110.4,Farrah,,part three okay ,ya there's a sentence it says you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's where i found it 
430.3,Farrah,,i think it's great that you're identifying that as non scientists we would need a microscope in order to see that water right but what my concern is is that the text doesn't necessarily say the scientists at nasa used a microscope right and so what i suggest you to do is go back and reread it to see what nasa and the scientists specifically used in order to investigate and find water ,okay i can try that 
230.1,Chris,,and student do you want to in the meantime while student and student reread the text do you want to talk about how you came up with scientists finding creators of water on the moon ,yeah yeah so um there's this part okay it's near the beginning paragraph one it says um well let me find it okay it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters 
310.1,Chris,,right no and that's a great that's a great sentence to point out because that's the whole point of our question right ,yeah exactly it's all about the water 
430.1,Chris,,yeah but but something that i'm concerned about is that this answer doesn't answer the question which the question is looking for the equipment right what was the equipment that they use to find the water so this answers the question the fact where they found the water not what they use to find the water so i just suggest kind of going back into the text and looking at what equipment was used to find the water ,yeah well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
430.2,Chris,,i think in this exercise we want to stick to the text yeah and i think that's great i think bringing your own first hand experience is wonderful and that's exactly what you should be doing because some other classmates might not have that context right and so this exercise is specifically what this article says the scientists use ,so it has to be in the story 
420.2,Chris,,yeah my suggestion is that we just use evidence from this story ,oh okay yeah i understand 
230.2,Luis,,student have you found were in the story you want us to focus on ,okay so um i found these two there's two pieces of equipment that they name in the story and one is lunar orbiter and the other as mike ruskell um so i guess i'd probably say those two things 
210.4,Luis,,okay sure so for the microscope part so i think the lunar orbiter is is correct because it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and the sentence before that talks about the craters that have the water in it right and then the sentence after it says this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits now ice what is ice i guess ,oh um water 
230.3,Oliver,,yes perfect so ice is water now in the microscope part this is kind of what student and student were pointing out ya ,um well i just i realized it's time for us to go now but thank you for taking the time to work with us 
230.3,Luis,,sure no thank you for having me student so you're explaining about the two pieces of equipment that you saw and i had a question if you could if you were able to hear what i had suggested to student earlier ,um yeah i think i got this all figured out so i'm good 
230.1,Luis,,perfect so what have you figured out ,um the answer is the lunar orbiter 
210.3,Luis,,would you be able to describe why it's not a microscope ,um no i don't know i just figured it was lunar orbiter from listening to the conversation 
130.2,Jazmin,,ok can someone else explain why the microscope was not an equipment that the scientists and nasa use yes student ,and okay i can try so the lunar orbiter it says in the story they use it to investigate but the microscope it just says you need a scientific tool called a microscope so i don't think that means that the astronauts actually used one on the moon 
150.1,Farrah,,does that make sense to class ,um i have a question yes so my question is if there's no microscope on the moon how how can you discover something if you can't see it if it's too small to see don't you need a microscope 
210.1,Farrah,,right so humans as humans might need a microscope right to see it but they used a machine so machines don't always need a microscope they can identify molecules without having to see it because you know machines can't physically see anything but they can identify it without a microscope the machine can but we cannot as humans student does that make sense ,um i'm still kind of confused 
230.1,Farrah,,so what is confusing to you about that ,so there's no people it's just the machine 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah so there are astronauts but they send out this machine called the small machine called the lunar orbiter which kind of looks through these these craters that they talk about these polar craters and it does analyses right in order to see it kind of samples the ground to see if there's any molecules but the machine itself doesn't need a microscope ,that's really cool i i wish the story said that 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah well um i guess it's implied here that the lunar orbiter has some sort of technology that is able to investigate and identify water through the ice deposits yes student ,that's so cool um yeah so i i understand that now that makes a lot of sense what you said about the lunar orbiter how we can just do it without a microscope so they don't really need a separate microscope but um i don't know how i would have figured that out on my own 
210.1,Oliver,,okay which is very fair so um going back to the text and the question so the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon right now who are the scientists working with ,um nasa 
210.1,Oliver,,and they so we're looking for something with nasa right or scientists right where it says scientists use or nasa used or sent or deployed or something where it says that the scientists are nasa right yeah perfect that's great so the scientists are working with nasa ,haha ok ok that's like the part student read that says scientists sent a small machine 
110.1,Oliver,,right exactly ,oh so is class using a microscope 
210.4,Oliver,,well probably as humans it says in the text right you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so you and me would not be able to see it you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to really look closely right that's what the text says so we would need a microscope ,that's really cool and i would love to go to the moon and look at the water and a microscope and i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
110.1,Luis,,now my question for you all is how did your thinking change about the text and about the question that we've discussed that's very cool that's very interesting yeah student ,um ok so my thinking changed because well my first answer um didn't come from the story and i guess i hadn't read it very closely and then when i read it um closer i found equipment that was actually in the story 
110.1,Chris,,great student ,on my thinking it changed because first i didn't know it had to be about equipment but then when you pointed out for me to look again i realized i had to talk about equipment 
110.1,Farrah,,great and student ,on okay my thinking changed because i thought it was the microscope but then when you explained how it works and when you said i had to look for what the scientists used that's how we can know lunar orbiter is the right answer and i i looked at the clock just now and we have to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for helping each one of us understand what we could do to help make our answer even better 
110.1,Farrah,,of course and enjoy your lunch see you soon ,hello hello how are you today 
110.1,Farrah,,i'm good how are you ,we're great we're so excited for your class 
110.1,Farrah,,i'm glad so how many of you did the reading ,oh we all read it we all just read it 
150.1,Luis,,oh that's great and what did you think of it oh yes student ,yeah um excuse me i shouldn't be in this room i already know all about space 
150.1,Chris,,oh well that's great but we're you can help class else who maybe hasn't had as much experience learning about spaces you you can share what you know with the class okay so who can tell me what the article is about ,i can i can i 
150.1,Chris,,yeah student ok ,so the article is about how nasa and the scientists they used to think the moon was a desert it was totally dry but now they know that there's water on the moon and they found it in these craters full of water 
150.1,Farrah,,oh that's a great answer student what else do you remember from the article ,oh right remember yeah that the water it's it's ice it's frozen water and it's really really small pieces so small you need a microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,oh and what is a microscope ,it it's a tool a piece of equipment and that's why i picked it for my answer because it said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Oliver,,what are some other things you could think of that you might use a microscope for student ,up well you could use it to look at like bacterial and cells and other tiny teeny things 
210.4,Oliver,,oh that's a great answer student has class seen a microscope before ,oh yeah we use them in science class in the lab 
210.4,Oliver,,and what do you use them for in science class ,obviously one time we took a dirt sample outside and then we analyzed it and we looked at under the microscope and we could see so much more than we couldn't we just looked at it with our eyes 
140.1,Oliver,,oh what kind of stuff did you see ,oh all sorts of things lots of teeny tiny little brains and everything was so much smaller than i thought it was 
210.4,Farrah,,wow that's awesome and what kind of things do you think you'd see if you looked at some dirt from the moon or the water the frozen water ,well i think yeah i'm i'm not really sure what you'd see but i'm a little confused because we're talking so much about the microscope but i thought we were here because our answers are wrong and and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,i just wanted to hear more about what you thought and to see if we can take your answers and to sort of expand them a little more well your answers aren't wrong get more detail in there and i know you know and i just need you to help me to understand so going back to the article and now that we know about the microscope what can you tell me about the machine that nasa sent to the moon the lunar orbiter oh student ,yes this was my answer i said nasa sent a small machine they used to look for the ice deposits in the craters 
210.4,Jazmin,,oh great and can you tell me more about the ice craters because you have to like i don't know anything about the ice crater so i need you to explain it to me oh ,okay let me look at the reading okay well it says that they're really deep and they're really dark 
210.4,Chris,,but how would you describe an ice crater if i know they're deep their dark they have ice in them but are they like the grand canyon like deep holes in the ground what do you think they look like ,well isn't a crater like a hole but above ground kind of 
210.4,Chris,,yeah so it's a it is a hole off the ground it's kind of elevated ,yeah cuz i went to nasa actually i went to nasa and and when i was there i saw i saw all sorts of equipment that scientists to use like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
140.1,Chris,,oh that's awesome since you went there and did it make you want to join nasa and go to the moon ,yeah oh it was so cool i would love to put on that space suit and grab my microscope and look at the little pieces of water on the moon 
110.3,Chris,,that's awesome so in your answer it would be great if you could tell me a little bit more about your experience going to nasa and maybe tie that in to the article because the fact that you were able to include your own experience in there is really awesome ,oh yeah i could definitely add that to my answer 
110.3,Jazmin,,in the last answer the moon is still are drier than the dry desert on earth mm hmm yeah ,okay you said about how the moon is so dry it's even drier than earth i think that's really interesting because here on earth we we need to really focus on saving our planet and our oceans and the water and to think that the moon is even dryer it just it's just really makes me wonder like will there ever be a life there one day 
230.1,Jazmin,,oh yeah that's interesting how do you think you could work that into your answer ,let's see i could say nasa sent a small machine and it found water but it's really really small frozen water nothing like the oceans on earth 
140.1,Oliver,,right and how do you think you could you were just talking about life on the moon and maybe how we need to do more on earth to protect our planet do you think you could work that into your answer ,on i'm so sorry to interrupt but i just looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch right now but i wanted to say thank you so much for listening to all of our personal experiences and opinions and helping us find ways to connect them to the story that made it really interesting to to write and think about our answers so thank you so much 
140.1,Jazmin,,thank you ,hi teacher 
140.1,Luis,,hello how's class today ,i'm good but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
140.1,Luis,,oh what do you know about space ,okay i know that astronauts use space suits so that they don't like freeze to death in space and i know that there's no gravity up there so if they're walking around they have to wear like gravity boots so that they can walk on the moon and a bunch of other stuff too 
110.3,Luis,,okay well it sounds like you know a lot about space but you can stick around in this class just to help class else learn what you know ,oh okay okay well i'll be your teacher today class 
150.1,Farrah,,okay does class else have any questions before we get started ,i don't 
150.1,Jazmin,,okay okay so can you pull up your responses to the article ,yeah we have them on our tablets 
120.4,Chris,,okay okay so who would like to share their response first ,i can go first okay i said um scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
210.4,Chris,,okay and that's a great answer um what else did you learn about the moon from the article ,oh let's see um that they need a microscope to look at the water um that it can only fill like a couple of cups or something like that 
210.4,Chris,,and what is a microscope ,is a tool that we use in science class to look at like teeny tiny things 
210.4,Jazmin,,and why do you think the people would be looking for water on the moon ,oh yeah because we're definitely destroying this planet but i don't think we can live on the moon maybe cause you know we're gonna have to live on the moon maybe in the future or something if we if we destroy this planet because of the atmosphere but they're trying to see if we can live on mars 
140.1,Jazmin,,student could you tell me a little bit about the atmosphere ,um okay i don't know exactly but i think that the moon doesn't have like an atmosphere that you know like that we could that protects us or anything you know like how we have the ozone layer here that protects us from the sun well we did until like people are totally destroying it um but that's another story for another day 
110.1,Jazmin,,sounds pretty dark ,yeah yeah i really am i'm an environmentalist and so i think that everybody's just kind of destroying our planet 
210.4,Jazmin,,so how do you think you could tie that into what you read in the article ,i guess that we're looking for water on the moon um so that we can well i don't know why but i feel like i don't understand why my answers wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,what was your answer ,that nasa sent a small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,so nasa sent a small machine why did they send the machine ,to look for the water on the moon 
420.2,Jazmin,,yeah so maybe just add that to response and then do you think you could also talk about what you were just telling me about being an environmentalist and what you think the future is going to look like why we might need to go to the moon ,so i just have to add in to look for water on the moon and then i can add some sentences about about being an environmentalist okay 
120.4,Farrah,,all right and student how about you what was your answer ,oh yeah i didn't know what my answer was wrong either i said that scientists uh no you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Farrah,,okay well do you think you could tell me what the microscope does and how it relates to finding water on the moon ,oh okay they use the microscope to look at the water really closely um and how it relates to finding the water um 
210.4,Farrah,,like why were they using a microscope to look at the water what were they were hoping to find ,okay it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at so they needed the scientific tool called the microscope because the water was microscopic Oh yeah that's all I gotta do is just add more sentences? yeah I can I can write down that second part of the sentence in there. 
120.4,Chris,,and student how about you what was your answer ,oh excuse me teacher i was just thinking about the equipment because um student said the microscope and then student said the small machine and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like all oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.4,Chris,,so what was your answer the question ,um that they found craters for water on the moon 
420.2,Chris,,yeah so how do you think you could describe some of the equipment they use to get to the moon ,oh yeah yeah i think i forgot to put i forgot to put that part in there about the equipment 
420.2,Chris,,i think you could also talk about your own experience going to nasa since you have some ,i can put that in my answer too 
420.2,Chris,,yeah ,oh i didn't know that because our last teacher told me that i was writing too much background knowledge because it wasn't connected to the the question in the text 
150.1,Chris,,well if you can try and find a way to connect it to what you read in the text so you have this experience with nasa and learning about the equipment and the article involves the equipment going to the moon to find water so you can maybe start with your own experience and not that much just enough to let us know you know about this and then going deeper and talking about the article you think you could do that ,yeah yeah yeah that's sounds exciting oh yeah i'll add that right now 
150.1,Oliver,,and student ,yeah i'm sorry teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go so we'll have to see you next time okay 
150.1,Oliver,,all right bye class ,bye 
150.1,Luis,,hello class ,hi uh teacher i think i figured it all out now so i'm all good 
120.4,Luis,,okay what did you figure out ,okay i heard you telling student and student and student that they can add some of their background knowledge into their answer so i'm just going to do that and so i think i can go back to my desk 
230.1,Luis,,what background knowledge do you want to add to your answer did you read your answer ,yeah well i said that scientists use oxygen tanks 
210.4,Luis,,well can you tell me what they use the oxygen tanks for and how it connects to the rest of the article because it's about trying to find water on the moon ,yeah well i mean they use oxygen tanks to breathe and so they can't look for water on the moon if they can't breathe up there 
230.3,Luis,,could you tell me a little more about how they're going about looking for water on the moon and why they're looking for water on the moon yeah that's true very good point so um you've established that they need these oxygen tanks to breathe so that they can look for water on the moon ,ah ok so maybe i didn't like read read the article you know so i don't really know 
120.3,Luis,,okay do you think you could go back and reread the article and then complete your answer ,yeah yeah okay i guess i can do that 
120.4,Chris,,okay all right how did class else do with their answers could you tell me what your new what your answers say now ,oh yeah okay so for mine i said i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment including oxygen tanks and masks and suits but they used a small machine and a microscope to look at the water on the moon because it was microscopic 
420.2,Chris,,"So, now that we you've described what the equipment looks like do you think you could tell me a little bit more about why they were a gathering all this equipment and going to the moon, to look for water in the first place? ",oh i don't know if the story told us why they were doing that 
210.4,Chris,,ok well why do you think they were going there to look for water ,um i don't know because at first i thought it was so that they could like we could live on the moon um but that wouldn't make sense i did i did read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
210.4,Jazmin,,"That maybe they are looking for a way to live on the moon, and having water on the moon would make it easier to survive there. ",i don't think that we can live on the moon i don't think that that wouldn't make sense 
230.1,Jazmin,,why wouldn't it make sense ,because like i said about the atmosphere like there isn't an atmosphere around the moon so we can't like there's nothing that would protect us we will die 
140.1,Jazmin,,well what's something that you could bring with you to the moon so that you might not die ,you mean like spacesuits 
140.1,Jazmin,,If you had a space suit and you were on a moon base. how do you think you would do if you were on the moon ,um well i mean i guess i wouldn't die but i wouldn't want to like you know like live in a space suit like all the time that would be like really uncomfortable 
140.1,Farrah,,oh student yeah ,yeah i'm still confused 
230.1,Farrah,,okay what are you confused about ,well okay so student said that in his answer it was the small machine and the microscope but i thought that the microscope was the right answer 
210.3,Farrah,,so were there other things that the astronauts used to look for water other than the microscope to study the water ,i have i had the small machine as my answer and that one i think was right too 
230.3,Farrah,,ok so you both said the small machine ,which one is right then the microscope or jazmin's 
130.3,Farrah,,they're both right you need both things because you need the small machine to find the water and then you need the microscope to study the water ,oh ok ok so then i should i have to put both of them in my answer 
120.4,Oliver,,yes ok and student how's your answer doing ,um well i've just been kind of listening to what class else was saying um so i haven't changed mine yet um um i guess i don't have as much background knowledge as the rest of them because you know i don't really like read books about space and stuff like i fly on airplanes but i don't like like read about the moon or like the environment or anything um so so yeah i guess um uh huh 
120.4,Oliver,,well you don't need to necessarily have background knowledge about space so you read the article yeah so could you tell me your answer again ,um yeah well i had circled the same thing as student i circled that last sentence in paragraph three you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah and what do you need to use to find the water and before you study it with the microscope ,the small machine that student said 
420.2,Oliver,,yeah so you can include that and then maybe also talk about why we would need to look for water on the moon why we might need to live on the moon ,okay so add in the name add in the part that student said add in why we're looking for water and what was the last thing you said 
420.2,Jazmin,,so why we're looking for water and i think there are only those ,maybe living on the moon is that one of the ones 
110.1,Oliver,,yeah oh yes you're right why why we need to live on the moon ,oh oh ok ok um oh well it's actually it's time for us to go to lunch so i'll have to finish my answer after lunch yeah thanks teacher i am thinking though like i do i appreciate like how you you took the time to kind of explain how we can make our ideas a little bit better so i at least know what i need to work on next time i come back to class 
110.1,Oliver,,i'll see you next time ,okay bye 
150.1,Luis,,hi class so i just got through looking over your responses and i just wanted to probe a little bit deeper so student look at yours again you i'm sorry yes oh give me one second yes student ,um yeah um i shouldn't be and this class i already know all about space 
230.2,Luis,,yes actually i'm in i'm glad that you said that student because looking at your response when you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right um i think that that is a great observation i was wondering where you saw that in the text ,um okay um well it wasn't really a story but i just know that if there are scientists like astronauts on the moon i know they have oxygen tanks 
230.2,Farrah,,"absolutely and that i think that that would isn't i mean class else might agree as well that that's an amazing inference right you can think about and go and look back and see if you can find something in the text that relates to how they find the water, because I do agree with you, the oxygen is important right, we need that. That was, and thank you again because I did want to talk about that Luis. Farrah yours, was also really interesting because you talked about the microscope, can you tell me a little bit more about what you found that in the text. ",oh yeah okay well i found it in part three where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Farrah,,mm hmm absolutely so how do we have you ever used the microscope before ,yeah yeah we have them on in our science classroom 
210.3,Farrah,,yes i think they're really cool so if you thinking about a microscope from where you are right now using that do you think you would be able to see something on the moon like that far away just like the water on the moon that far away ,from earth no way 
210.4,Farrah,,right that's what i'm thinking like maybe maybe not so what do you think help the scientists and i don't want you to answer it now i want you to take a second to look through the text again but what do you think help the scientists be able to see it and with the microscope like i know for example when you go into your science class OK. ,ok i'll look 
230.1,Oliver,,okay and student you had something you have a similar idea as student so can you tell me what also what brought you to that same conclusion ,yeah so well i was thinking on how could you discover something if you can't see it you need to see it to discover 
210.4,Jazmin,,absolutely that you know what that you're on the right path right and so i want you to do the same thing as student just looked at that text because again how can you how do you get to the point where you can use the microscope right because if you're just carrying around a microscope looking for all these small things you're gonna be looking for a long time so we have to look at the text ,So I had a different answer and answer as NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong. 
420.3,Jazmin,,"okay yeah and i want to be i want to be absolutely clear right the goal is to pro right so similar to my um nasa with the microscope when they have the microscope it means that they're looking at something very specific right you're not in this class because your answers are necessarily wrong right but there's a situation there's something that they have to do prior to that to where it's very broad so your answer was was you're getting closer but i want you to just like class else I will, I want you to think about is how can your answer be more specific and what could you find in the text again evidence from that text that's going to give you an opportunity to be even more specific. right ",i'm gonna try right now i should look again 
120.1,Chris,,and student you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon go ahead yeah go ahead i'm listening you can look at yes i would love for you to look again just take a second there's no pressure ,yeah well so since we're talking about equipment on i wanted to say i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks but also um masks and suits 
120.1,Chris,,"yes absolutely and so i and that's why i'm so excited to have all of you in this class because all of you bring such a great like minds that you bring like i'm you touched on what student said about the mask i mean it was said about the oxygen tanks all those things are so important but what i really want you to focus on right now is what's important for the water right because it's true we we like i said when student we need those oxygen tanks right if we need to breathe but we also want to focus on that water right we want to figure out what tools or what equipment do we use so i would kind of pair you a little bit more with student saying you're on the right track You want to think about the tool, the most effective for that particular situation so when we're trying to find the water right so look, I want you to take a second to look through the text again as well, and just see if you can find something. ",okay yeah yeah that math example that really make sense all look again 
120.4,Farrah,,student and student how's it going as far as you're looking through the text ,okay so um i'm beginning to think that maybe instead of the microscope it's it's the machine i'm that student was talking about 
130.2,Jazmin,,student um how does that sound to you what do you think ,um yeah and then you told me to to add more specific stuff to my answer so i found a little more and i would add that the machine is called a lunar orbiter and they use it to investigate 
110.1,Oliver,,awesome and student and i know that you and student were working together oh yes i see your hand go ahead ,um yeah i just looked at the clock and unfortunately we have to go to lunch right now um but i know i'm going to do because this was really really fun um i wanted to say thank you so much for really encouraging us to probe deeper into the text and find more specifics for our answer that was really helpful and also you just made it really fun so thank you so much 
140.1,Luis,,thank all of you and i hope you enjoy lunch and have a great rest of your day okay good afternoon class i'm teacher it's very good to see you thank you for meeting with me i just reviewed your answers to where what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon i noticed that class has to work on one specific thing and that is visualizing the text to make sure that you understand it before we begin i have a question do you speak spanish student do you speak spanish ,well i'm a little bit i can try 
140.1,Jazmin,,okay student do you speak spanish ,yes i do 
140.1,Jazmin,,great student can you teach us the spanish word for moon ,and spanish word for me is luna 
210.4,Luis,,yeah exactly and so today you read a text about the lunar orbiter and if you look inside the word lunar where do you see ,so yeah it's got all the lunar thing in it um but i shouldn't even be in this class i know all about space 
120.2,Oliver,,that's great well thank you for hanging out with us anyway so we're going to rely on your expertise to help us even thanks so much cool great so we see the word luna or moon thank you student inside of lunar i also want to think about the word polar craters what word do you see inside of the word polar student i see your hand class take a look what word do you see inside of the word polar great student ,and ok i see the word pole 
210.4,Oliver,,okay and when you hear the word pole what does that make you think of student ,i'm like the north pole 
210.4,Oliver,,uh huh and so if we're looking at polar craters on the moon where are they going to be located ,like on the top and the bottom 
130.2,Farrah,,"exactly so what i want class to do now is take a look at the text and we are going to read the first paragraph again together the moon is a desert scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's color craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines So I draw that out, and I draw my craters and then I look at the paragraph again, what is this paragraph, telling us. class should look at your paragraph what is it telling us student i appreciate you so much that your hand shoots up right away student go for it and then student you're going to build ",okay so this paragraph it tells us well i guess we learned that the loon has poles and that that's where the water is in the craters 
130.2,Chris,,okay student can you build ,oh well the craters they're dark 
210.4,Chris,,okay and what is inside of the creators student ,and the water 
210.4,Jazmin,,good now let's look at the second paragraph together nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small what are we learning from this paragraph and i say go ahead student ,so this is this is where i found my answer actually to the question we learned that nasa sent a small machine and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
430.2,Jazmin,,okay so i want you to look back in the paragraph it's not that your answer is wrong it's that it lacks some detail so what can you add to your answer when you look at that paragraph again ,okay well it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,great so can you tell me more about what the lunar orbiter must look like and what it's doing ,well i don't really know what it looks like but it sounds like it it can find that ice in the craters 
210.4,Chris,,So who is sending the Lunar orbiter when you look at paragraph two ,think it's nasa and oh actually i went to nasa and so i know that scientists who they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Chris,,i mean nasa as the united states space agency and so in this paragraph student you're right and i like that you have that background information but i want you to look back into paragraph two what is nasa specifically sending in paragraph to ,nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
210.4,Chris,,to do what student ,oh well i think student said it goes in the craters and finds the the water 
210.4,Chris,,good so i'm going to add that to my visualization i know nasa which student knows so much about ,that i got a shirt with that picture on it and everything 
120.2,Luis,,amazing and an orbiter which i'm imagining looks something like a rocket into one of the polar craters will find water good let's look at paragraph three together that means the moon is still dryer and it's a very fun for the water they found is microscopic hold on i'm going to pause there the water they found who found that water student i appreciate the hand up class look back at your paragraph who found that water student ,so i think nasa because that's who's doing this but also i just i just looked at our clock and we we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say this was so cool like the drawing you made that really helped me sort of see that text in my mind and i think since i love space so much next time i read about space i'm going to do that same thing and draw myself a picture to help me understand it 
150.1,Luis,,beautiful thank you you bet well i hope you all have a great lunch alright so i heard some great ideas from the class thank you all for sharing why don't we start with student and student so i saw some actually before we get there student you have a hand up do you have a question for me ,yeah well actually i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
230.2,Farrah,,thank you for the enthusiasm student about space right now we're just focusing on text based evidence so it's awesome that you already have some background knowledge in this topic so right now if class has their texts in front of them can i get a thumbs up or a yes if you have your text still in front of you right now we're trying to figure out exactly what piece of equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon seeing nods thank you thank you so why don't we start with student and student i saw you class had some consensus where in the text did you find that scientists need a microscope to look closely at water can either student or student read that sentence for us ,yes i can do that 
230.2,Farrah,,thank you student ,it was in part three where we found it it says the water they found us microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it and then it says our answer you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Oliver,,awesome thank you student for reading that out loud for us so the question is saying what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon in the sentence student read are the scientists what are they using the microscope for so if class has thoughts feel free to throw your hand up student i see you have a hand up what are you thinking ,yeah well since i was thinking the same thing as student they're using the microscope to be able to see the tiny pieces of ice 
130.2,Jazmin,,thank you student for sharing your thought process do other students in the class agree disagree want to push back feel free to throw your hand up if you want to share thoughts on what we just heard student i see you have a hand up what are you thinking ,so i'm sorry you two but i disagree because my answer was nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why that answer is wrong 
230.2,Jazmin,,can you tell us where in the text student you found this information ,let me see the first sentence in part two 
120.3,Jazmin,,okay and can you read that out loud for us please ,nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Luis,,thank you student for reading from the text so now we have two ideas on the table that it was a microscope or this small machine what is the small machine called let's give it a name um someone can identify what is the name of this small machine student you have a hand up ,lunar orbiter 
230.1,Jazmin,,thank you student and we got that straight from the text where student just read for us so now we have microscope and lunar orbiter student was really nice and that she respectfully disagree disagree dwith student and student student do you want to explain a little more about why you disagree before we hear from other people ,okay well so the one i picked the lunar lunar orbiter it it had the word investigate it said they use the lunar orbiter to investigate and investigate is kind of like find so i thought they had to use the lunar orbiter to find the water and it says it's in the craters 
130.2,Chris,,thank you student for sharing your thought processes let's see student i haven't heard from you today do you agree with student that we can also use the word find or discover for investigate ,oh yeah oh those words mean pretty much the same thing 
150.1,Chris,,thank you student class disagree or want to push back on that or we all agree that these two words can be used as synonyms ,so can i add something too about equipment yeah well so actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.2,Luis,,wow thank you student for sharing that incredible experience i wish i could have experienced that so student brought up a great point what equipment means so these are tools people can use keep in mind the evidence for this question should come from the text our items did class see oxygen tank mentioned anywhere in the text if you see it feel free to raise your hand if you want to share where that was found i'm seeing a shake head from student student ,i don't think that's in here student 
120.2,Farrah,,soo it sounds like the two pieces of equipments we heard were microscopes and the lunar orbiter but right now we're focusing on what we found in the text keep in mind the question is what did scientists use to discover water on the moon after talking about the word investigate discover and look closely what do we think the final answer is what equipment did scientists use so for this one i'm going to call on student ,ok so the stuff about investigate that makes sense i can see why the lunar orbiter is finding because they use the word investigate but i guess what i was kind of thinking before is how can they find it if they can't see it yet 
210.3,Farrah,,awesome comment from student so the question i'm hearing is we kind of agree yes that this thing was used to investigate it but we still need the microscope to look closely at it so student excellent analysis but they did need the microscope to look closely at it but for that first discovery what did they need ,the orbiter 
150.1,Oliver,,so does class have questions or want to disagree with that statement student you have a hand up what are you thinking ,well actually i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch and i'm kind of bummed because this was really fun but i wanted to say before we go thank you so much for really helping us understand what all the different words in the text and in the question what they mean because that really helped me figure out what the best answer was thank you so much 
150.1,Farrah,,thank you student for keeping track of the clock hope class has a wonderful lunch and thank you so much student student student student and student for your participation in today's class enjoy your lunch hi class ,oh hi hello 
150.1,Luis,,so it's really nice to have you all in a small class together i know you just read your passage on water on the moon oh yes student ,um yeah i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,um i think it's good to talk about this what we read together so we can help us help each other understand it more so it's great that you know a lot about space maybe you can share that with us ,um yeah i can do that sure 
120.4,Farrah,,so um the question for the first one is let's see how how sorry what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon does class have any thoughts yes student ,oh yeah okay so i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.2,Farrah,,mm-hmm and what made you think that from the passage ,okay well so in part in part three it says that the water they found is microscopic and so you need the microscope if you were going to look at it and see it 
210.4,Farrah,,mm-hmm but before before you look at the water closely how did nasa say that they found they could find the water on the moon can you think of can you think of a place in the passage where they talked about going to find the location of the water ,oh well so i guess what i'm thinking is how could you find it if if you can't see 
210.4,Jazmin,,right so i think they needed to find it by exploring different parts of the moon yes student ,well i i had a different answer and maybe will help student so i said that nasa sent a small machine and so and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.2,Jazmin,,it's not wrong maybe let's look at that part together can you tell us where you saw that in the passage ,yes definitely i found it in part two 
210.4,Luis,,mm hmm so let me read that part the first part or part two together so nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so i think we can be a little bit more specific about that small machine did class catch what it was called ,um yeah i got it it said well i mean you just read it it says lunar orbiter that's the name 
150.1,Oliver,,mm hmm so they use this lunar orbiter to try to investigate and to explore the moon's south pole does that makes sense ,i'm still a little confused cuz i said the same as student i said the microscope um and so i'm still a little unsure why it's the lunar orbiter that's the right answer and how i would how i would have picked that on my own i think i would still pick the microscope 
150.1,Oliver,,"But I think, looking at the passage as a whole, we need to look at what, how they even could get that water sample. So that's why it said NASA sent that machine to try to find evidence of water, through the ice craters. does that help clarify ",yeah so it's like first they get and find the tiny water with the orbiter and then they look at it with a microscope 
210.4,Chris,,right they looked at it with the microscope to look closely and learn more about it ,oh okay yeah i wanted to say so actually i went to nasa and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.3,Chris,,yeah wow thanks for sharing that that's a that's a great connection that you made with the reading ,yeah it was an amazing trip we got to see so many different things there 
120.2,Jazmin,,mm-hmm so how about we move on to the second question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ,and wait i just so with with my answer about the machine why what i still don't get why i was wrong i said nasa sent a small machine 
430.2,Jazmin,,yes oh you did say that yeah so they did send a small machine but there's a lot of different small machines that could have been sent so that's why we want to be specific when we're answering these questions ,oh so and all i had to do was just say the name of it 
420.2,Jazmin,,um it would be helpful to elaborate and add more details to your response but it was a great start good job student ,oh okay great that's helpful for next time thank you 
420.2,Chris,,yeah no problem yes student ,so well i just i looked at the clock and actually we we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say before before we go that we really appreciate how you took the time to really explain the difference between finding the water and looking at the water because it makes so much more sense how to find the right answer when you explain that so thank you so much 
150.1,Luis,,you're welcome thank you for spending time in the small class together i really enjoyed our discussion have a nice time at lunch bye hi student and jen and student and student he said i'm excited to talk to you today we were talking about earlier with discovering water on the moon so student oh yes even what would you like to say ,i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,oh that is awesome student i'm so glad you are so interested in space could you help maybe me and some of your classmates learn a little about how we discover water on the moon do you know how we do ,um yeah okay well we we sent a machine into space and we needed all sorts of equipment and we needed oxygen tanks and we needed a microscope all we needed all sorts of things and they they sent the rocket and it smashed into the moon and they found little pieces of ice 
110.3,Chris,,so let's listen why don't you jump in student is the would you say the moon is dry or is the moon wet what do you think whoa whoa that sounds really exciting that definitely sounds exciting but definitely some you had some great things about there ,well my answer my answer is a scientist they found craters full of water on the moon so there's definitely water there 
210.4,Oliver,,oh okay yeah so you're right you're so right about the craters there's definitely some craters student have you been to a really dry place could you tell us about that that are there and you're right that they have now very tiny particles of water they have not found just lots of water in the moon the moon is one of the driest places in the world ,yeah yeah my family we went up on a trip we went to the grand canyon and it was really hot there and really sandy on the sand at would blow around and got in your eyes it was so hot and the sun was beating down and it was just dry and sand everywhere that you looked 
120.4,Farrah,,yes i love that you brought the grand canyon because that's honestly how i picture the moon sometimes because the moon is very dry dry place but just like the grand canyon doesn't mean that there's no water right so we see on the moon that there are microscopic water if you don't use i use a thermometer yeah student what would you like to add ,well i'm i'm a little confused because i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope in order to look really closely for my answer and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Farrah,,oh okay i'm happy to help you out there so you are right in that you are definitely have to really get really small to figure out that this water because like we were saying earlier there's not a whole lot of water on the moon does that help when we go there we dig deep and find kind of the soil and everything to get to that ice so we can't just use a microscope that had to be some other things for us to be able to get to that place ,oh okay yes so they need something else first and then they look at that through the microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,yes you're right right so we just have to have some extra they can't just like you know maybe you class have used microscopes in your class before ,"That makes sense, thank you. "
120.4,Oliver,,you're welcome welcome student we haven't heard from you i see um ,well i was talking about the grand canyon i was talking about remember 
120.4,Jazmin,,yes you're so right sorry about that deb student you're the one i just love to hear from you um what do you think if you were to go to the moon student what would you do to try to water there what would you do student ,i would use the small machine that nasa sent and i would use it to get the samples that you need to find the water 
130.2,Luis,,also yes you are so right can class help right what is that machine call that nasa ,oh we know this i know this 
130.2,Luis,,okay student ,i got it 
130.2,Luis,,student what was that ,yeah it's the lunar orbiter student it's right there in the article like right under your nose it's called the lunar orbiter 
120.4,Chris,,well student i love that you jumped in thanks for that answer but again we don't want to be rude understanding our classmates here because sometimes other people know more about other things than us we want to make sure that we all hear each other out there student had a great answer and you just expanded on it so we all get to work together here which is awesome student what do you have to add ,i went to nasa and i know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Farrah,,you are so right student yeah so in houston here we have nasa too and it is really cool really there and so with the oxygen tanks let's go why would they need oxygen tanks on the moonso let's go back to student what they need oxygen tanks on the moon ,well they needed it to breathe 
130.2,Luis,,yes you're right you're right they needed to breathe right because they don't have like the oxygen like we breathe in the air they don't have that on the moon so that's why they need lots of equipment there so we talked about let's go through our list here so we talked about that they need the lunar orbiter right and at some point they're going to be the microscope to me i love that you mentioned that and then you class brought up also that they're going to need some oxygen tanks is there anything else they'd need to find that water student what you got to add ,while you you said they had to dig down really deep so i don't know if the lunar orbiter does that or something else does that but they would need something to get under the soil and find the little teeny tiny tiny teeny tiny teeny ice 
110.2,Oliver,,perfect yes you are so right they would absolutely need something to do with that so yeah the lunar orbiter might do that as well so we're going to take some different places and i think that would go with it as well help help them dig down yeah student what do you think ,um yeah i'm so sorry um i just looked up a clock and we actually we have to put a lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand how each one of our answers fit into the process of discovering water on the moon like i have a really good picture of all the different steps that they need and how each equipment works and that was really helpful so thank you so much 
150.1,Luis,,you're so welcome i really enjoyed my time with you all and i hope we get to learn more together soon thank you alright students so we just talked a little bit about the type of machinery they use to discover the water on the moon and i think we need to yes student ,um excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,okay student so we'll definitely be able to use some of your expertise in this conversation so you'll be able to use your background knowledge to really help us understand. Okay? ,yeah okay 
210.4,Chris,,alright cool so let's think a little bit more about what we read who could give me a quick summary of the text two to three sentences a student ,okay well so to summarize the story the scientists they found these craters full of water on the moon 
210.4,Chris,,okay can you tell me how they found it ,um okay um well i guess they had to use some some equipment um like um i think a microscope maybe it said 
120.2,Farrah,,alright so i want us to take a pause great job student getting us started with that retell of the passage i think we just need to take a moment to look back at what we read so when i say go you have one minute to review your three little paragraphs and then we'll come back together to talk okay go ahead alright about 30 seconds left all right come back together class now that we've had a chance to look back at our passage let's review our question again okay what was the type what was the name of the machine that supported the scientists in finding the water on the moon student ,well um i don't know if you'd call it a machine really but um i i found the same thing that student um what he kind of just said i think it said you'd need a microscope to look really closely so i'm i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.2,Farrah,,okay perfect so let's look closely at that sentence student where do you see in the story that says it was a microscope where exactly in the story ,okay so that's in part three the last part it says the water they found is microscopic and it says you need a microscope to see it 
130.2,Jazmin,,"huh yes so student i just want to shout you out for one second because you were able to zero right in on that sentence That means that it was really really small, that you would need a microscope to see it. It doesn't really tell us, that specific line, what the tool was called that discovered the water. Okay? so i just want to zero back in on a different part of the story did class find a different part of the story that gives us information about the tool student what do you think ",okay well in part two they they actually talked about a small machine 
230.2,Jazmin,,can you tell us where exactly that is you can read the sentence for us ,okay the first sentence in part two says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
120.4,Chris,,okay so here we have two different sentences that we're looking at right student is telling us that it's in paragraph two the lunar orbiter student is telling us that in paragraph three there's a microscopic material that you would need a microscope to see i want class to think and then you're going to get a chance to vote is it a microscope that found the water on the moon or is it the lunar orbiter that found the water on the moon if you think it's the lunar orbiter raise your hand ok i see two hands two hands awesome okay you can put your hands down if you think it is the microscope raise your hand okay okay put your hand down so student what are you thinking ,well i'm i'm thinking that so actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.1,Luis,,"I heard Jazmin I saw Jazmin and Luis raise their hand for the lunar orbiter. Could you explain to the group, one of you, why you think that is what it was called? go ahead student ",okay yeah so i think it's the lunar orbiter because the lunar orbiter i think it's kind of like this robot and it kind of does everything and then there isn't like a microscope on the moon because um microscope it's like a really small and you can't just walk around the whole moon with a microscope and look at all of it to find the water first you need the robot to tell you where the water is 
120.3,Jazmin,,mmm good and student can you just point us back to that sentence that you read in the story and read that for us again ,yes nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.3,Farrah,,awesome so let's come back together right student shared with us his amazing background knowledge he knows a lot about space and astronauts and when they go up to space he shared that they use these tools and the lunar orbiter is one of the tools that they use student pointed us to the exact sentence in the story that told us what the machine was called okay so i want to circle back to student student do you now see what the name of that tool was called ,yeah yeah this makes this makes a lot more sense now it makes sense that the the machine the lunar orbiter they had to use that to to find the water discover it like it says in the question on that makes a lot more sense 
530.1,Oliver,,mm hmm so let's just think about as a class like what did we do together what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called student ,okay so what we did is we we reread we reread the text and we found both both pieces of equipment but then we found out what each one does that's different and which one was that best to answer for the question 
420.3,Oliver,,yes absolutely so sometimes you do have to weigh the actions and figure out what is the best evidence which one really lets me know the answer to this question and helps me understand this text okay ,i'm so sorry to interrupt but i just looked at the clock on and we actually we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say thank you so much for really helping us look at the text and understand it and reminding us how to use the text to find the best answer that was really helpful 
110.3,Luis,,oh no problem you all were really great students and did a lot of great work in the small time so good job alright good afternoon students i was just reading over your responses and what i noticed is that you all are doing a really great job answering the question especially using some of the background knowledge that you know about space and about the moon what yes student ,yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Farrah,,so let's take a moment to just revisit the question that they asked. everybody just take a look at number one. it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon who would like to share one of theirs the response that they gave to that question go ahead student ,okay i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.4,Farrah,,awesome so that was a great idea of trying to think about what types of tools scientists use scientists definitely use microscopes that was a good connection so what i'm noticing in farrah's answer and some of our other answers is that we aren't using the actual text to answer the question of what tool was used to find the water on the moon okay so what i want class to do now i want you to revisit the text and find the place in the story that tells us the type of tool that was used to find water on the moon go ahead okay was class able to identify the name of the tool that was used to find water on the moon student what did you come up with ,um well so i said the same thing as student about the microscope um because that's a scientific tool and they talked about in the story yeah i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.3,Oliver,,so student can you read the question again that we're working to answer ,mhmm yeah what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.4,Farrah,,okay and student you said it was a microscope can you find a place in the text that tells us it was a microscope that found the water on the moon ,yeah okay um at the very end part three um the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay so i'm noticing student that you are looking to you're giving us like the definition of the water that they are finding is really really small and that is absolutely right that particular tool though is not what found that microscopic water is there another place in the story or the text that we found that talks about a scientific tool student ,in part two it talks about a small machine and that was my answer 
310.1,Jazmin,,do you see the name of that tool there in the text okay student i see you located a specific piece of the text that was a good move ,i think it was in there um let me look nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
120.4,Chris,,okay so student just pointed us to a different part of the text that we can investigate i want class to go back to part two of the text and this time you're reading those first two sentences to see if that is the name of the tool that found the water go ahead okay so what what did we find out after rereading that portion that student pointed us to do we find the name of the tool that found the water on the moon student what do you think ,well so um so in there it talks about that lunar orbiter but i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.1,Chris,,did you locate the machine that found the water on the moon the name of that machine student that is absolutely right and in this question we are looking for the machine that found the water on the moon ,well i guess it's a lunar orbiter um because that's what student said and it was in part two 
120.4,Oliver,,okay student what do you think ,yeah well um it's sort of sounding like lunar orbiter's the right answer um but i still think there's evidence about the microscope um how can you find something if it's too small to see don't you need a microscope 
210.3,Luis,,that is actually true you do need something that can see really small things on the moon or any other thing you're working with with your science one thing we want to pinpoint though is figuring out what's the difference between the types of tools they're talking about so one of the tools like you class you found is the lunar orbiter and as student pointed out it said they sent the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it landed on the moon and found some ice deposits where the water was right and then it also talks about later in the text the microscope so let's think was the lunar orbiter the machine that found the water or was it a microscope that found the water student ,um i think i think it was the lunar orbiter that found the water um i think because they says it's the thing that um looked in the craters and like found it in the first place i don't know how it works like maybe it's some kind of robot but i think it can do it all by itself 
110.1,Farrah,,hmm um what are you thinking student ,um well okay so it sounds like the lunar orbiter can find really small things and then maybe they just look at it with the microscope after they find it 
210.4,Oliver,,okay so you're absolutely right it does look like it's a lunar orbiter and it's and it is saying that the water that they found was really small so it's just letting us know that it was a small amount that they found student ,yeah i'm so sorry but it's time for us to know 
210.4,Chris,,okay well great job locating the evidence in the in the text and really thinking about your responses today good morning classroom ,oh hi good morning 
210.4,Chris,,how's class doing today ,oh we're great we're really excited to work with you today 
210.4,Luis,,i'm so excited to work with you yes you can you have your hand up ,that'd be yeah so um i shouldn't be and as a class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,um student that's great and i love that you already know a lot about space but what i think is it's fun why don't you help your peers and you can share the information that you know about space so that we can learn better and it can be a good opportunity for you to teach them what you already know matter ,great yeah that sounds awesome 
150.1,Farrah,,love the um does class else have any questions before we dive into the discussion prompt that you'll have given me answers for student house and the student are you good ,yeah i think we're ready to go 
120.3,Farrah,,love it um so did all if you read the other three passages but for the moon is a desert yes okay lovely so our student can you read the question for me ,yeah okay so it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.2,Oliver,,so before we dive into the question i want to ask one of you what is your understanding of the word equipment what do you think it means give me an example of equipment from maybe your daily lights class yeah yes they go ahead ,okay so um it as like a tool or something you use to do something i'm so like in math class sometimes we use a calculator so that would be a equipment 
230.1,Farrah,,very good amazing ok so now that we have a fair idea of what equipment means let's try to read let's try to figure out the answer this question in context um so before that that me student can you tell me do you want to read out your answer maybe we can all decide as a class we can come up with what the best answer is um so in your answer you thought this equipment was a microscope so can you help me think why you did that answer what led you to thinking that ,yeah so okay in part three it says that will basically it says the water is really small it's they said might grow scott peck and so you can't see it if you don't have a microscope so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.1,Oliver,,okay very good and this was a tricky one because micro of microscope also has some us so one could think of it as an equipment so i completely understand why you may have been confused i read that you have the same answer student what was your reasoning was it the same did you have the same reason ,i was pretty much the same what caused the question asked what equipment they used to discover the water and i don't think you can discover something if you can't even see it so that's why i was saying to you need the microscope 
130.2,Jazmin,,now let's try to learn some appeals and see maybe what someone else said and we can come to the closest answer so student can you tell us what your answers and why did you pick that answer ,"Okay, I said NASA send a small machine and I picked it from part two, because it says they use the machine to investigate and I thought that sounded kind of close to the question. "
230.1,Luis,,okay amazing our event so you don't you know a lot about science and space so can you help me understand why did you pick the arms you did and what do you think of your peers on so so far ,um yeah so i mean their interests are pretty good but i was thinking that you'd need an oxygen tank because if there are astronauts and scientists on the moon they cannot sign anything without oxygen tanks 
120.3,Chris,,"student let me just get back to you quickly So Luis said, I understand that let's let's go back and read the text just see where can we find this evidence in the text Chris, do you want to add to something before we move up yeah go ahead. ",yeah yeah cuz it kind of goes with what student said because i went to nasa actually and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and also masks and suits 
120.3,Farrah,,but now student can you give it another try can you read can we can you read part two of the decks yes and these are amazing tools and requirements that they have to be wearing before they go there for me loud and maybe you can explain to us again what led you to choosing your answer and then as a class we can have a discussion to find out what we can vote you can vote amongst each other what do you think the correct answer is and as a class you can decide and let me know and let's listen keeping the question in mind the question is what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon okay you can get to drive so don't feel don't don't be afraid go ahead yeah student would you like to just read the text for us again go ahead student ,okay nasa center some more machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small 
210.4,Oliver,,lovely so can someone tell me what is is made up off do you know yes go ahead ,yeah i'm ice it's the same as water um and i i just i looked at the clock and i'm so sorry cuz i really wanted to get to the vote and all that stuff but we have to go to lunch right now um i just wanted to say thank you so much because you really understood why we set our answers and you made us feel like our thinking it really matter and that made this so much easier like we weren't afraid to say the wrong thing or something like that so thank you so much 
210.4,All,,of course the and always remember class is a safe space for all your to learn from each other and that's the point of education it's not about having the right answers it's about learning from mistakes and how can you learn from your mistakes if you don't get any so just keep it up have a lot of fun remember you have my you have access to my email address you can email me with any questions you have and you can meet me at my office hours go have fun have fun at lunch hello student def student student student so good to see you how's class doing ,we're good we're really excited to work with you today 
210.4,Luis,,we to what's up student ,i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
310.1,Luis,,that is so awesome that you are telling me how knowledgeable you are now how motivated you are in terms of subjects so i can't really i can't wait to hear your response and in fact i already heard you answering this question or what equipment is scientists use to discover what water on the moon you class are already providing the evidence you class already circled the evidence in the text that we can use to answer the questions so student why don't i just start off with you ,sure sounds great 
120.4,Luis,,all right do you have the answer in front of you would you like to share with the whole class ,yeah so i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
150.1,Luis,,beautiful do you have a text in front of you as well ,yeah yeah it's right here 
230.2,Luis,,awesome now my question to be where'd you get the answer from did you get the evidence to support that did you get a text evidence ,i'm so um i mean i already know some stuff and if there are scientists on the moon they need oxygen tanks 
120.3,Jazmin,,oh i see so you are making a prediction there and you're making connections that is excellent job student however my question here is particularly asking you to find a text evidence from the reading that i gave you so i do not see any paragraph related to the oxygen tanks so even though that's really interesting we need to find our answer in the text so how about why don't why don't we carefully look at the number of paragraph two can you can can student use that paragraph two can you read it out loud for us ,go right ahead so nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar greater these ice deposits are very small and so that's where my answer came from actually i said nasa center small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,you did you're so close you told me what the machine is and you actually circled the evidence correctly and you gave me the answer however you didn't tell me the name of the machine all the actually says very clear in the second paragraph can you so if you circle back to the paragraph to as as nasa sent the small machine and what is that called student ,lunar orbiter 
130.3,Jazmin,,yeah so that will be the answer ,oh so just have to add the name in there too 
310.1,Jazmin,,yeah and you found the text evidence as well you did an excellent job all right you did you did either disappear job excellent ,thank you 
120.4,Chris,,awesome are why don't we move on to student student would you like to read out loud your answer ,and you know okay so up i said scientists found critters full of water on the moon 
430.1,Chris,,good and that was the outcome right we now know that they found water and we now know the water actually exist in the moon which is really fascinating now you actually gave me the results of it but the question was what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon alright so so the question was actually what equipment were the scientists using so i think next time student what you can do you can actually circle the question statements or you could actually underlined a question statements so that you know what the author is looking for what the question is actually looking for from you all right ,yeah well about equipment um so i actually i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.3,Chris,,absolutely i love that you're making connections and that's so fascinating that you've been there and never been to another place though it is so fascinating i've only been to like i guess i've never been to it i only been watching youtube videos about it so student thank you so much for sharing your experience and also that actually ties into luis's experience student knows all about it he's very interested in that's how he made the connection with oxygen tank is that right even ,oh yeah exactly um i like to watch a youtube videos 
120.4,Oliver,,right is really excellent tool all right um oliveron thank def thank you for waiting patiently would you like to go with your answer do you mind sharing your answer with the whole class ,yeah i can share so same thing so and that is the microscope i think that answer is actually the microscope 
230.2,Oliver,,hard to find an answer from ,um okay so it actually talks about a microscope and part three and because it says on water is really small so you would need a microscope to look at it really closely 
120.3,Farrah,,yeah yeah and since you and student you class are agreeing each other can i have student read the third paragraph yeah or you can chime in all right go right ahead student ,that means the moon is still dryer and the driest desert on earth the water they found is micro scapa meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it and here's the part i circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.1,Farrah,,awesome great great great so um is student said is that the reason why you chose the same answer ,yeah yeah i found it there too because you can't find something if you can't see it you need the microscope 
110.2,Oliver,,exactly awesome the reason why the answer is not a microscope because they actually water that they found they actually use the machine to find actually find a machine they use a lunar orbiter to find water there but they are invest they are they actually analyzing investigating water microscope okay so i do lot love the oliveron and student you class are making the connections with microscope because yes you are correct because in order to look at it closely you need it you that's the scientific tool that you need go ahead oliveron ,um yeah so actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much i feel like you gave each one of us a strategy to help make our answer better on and that was really helpful thank you 
110.2,Luis,,thank you so much for your excellent doozy as to class today i can't wait to see you class next time and i'll see you class later have a great lunch by by good morning class good morning student def student student student so good to see you hi student what's up ,hi i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Luis,,oh that's incredible i mean it really shows from your response that you really enjoyed a science and to begin with so yes would you like to share with your response to begin with ,yeah 
120.4,Luis,,go right ahead ,okay um i don't remember okay let me look at my paper i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks yeah 
120.4,Chris,,"I love the how you identify the word equipment, because that was actually the question you were asking so you're halfway there. but let's find the paragraph and tech the scientists like sentence and where it corresponds because the answer was not oxygen tanks and i didn't see that from the paragraph so your job is to find a paragraph and give me the actual word with the citing source then you will get the answer okay okay awesome great job student all right does class would like to share the answer ",and i think the answer is all let me see what scientists found craters for water on the moon 
430.1,Chris,,awesome so i love how you a thoroughly enjoy the reading i could see that you understand the text and that really impressed me student really really great job my concern is that you didn't read the question correctly because the question is that i want you to identify the object we're looking for and i want you to do so by circling equipment The scientists use the discover water on the moon. and ,what do you want me to do 
420.3,Chris,,and i'll underline the sentence where scientists use us to discover water on the moon. ,okay equipment underlying in the story or underlining the question 
420.3,Chris,,sorry that it that I clarify that question. ,okay so i circled equipment and i underlined us to discover water on the moon 
110.1,Jazmin,,good so in this question whatever you're looking for student i'll get back to you in a minute one second okay ,okay 
110.1,Jazmin,,okay all right student go right ahead ,i thought you said you would get back to me in a minute so i put my hand down 
110.1,Jazmin,,oh yeah that's fine you can go ahead ,oh okay well i didn't understand why my answer was wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,what was your answer can you share that with us again ,yeah i said masses into small machine 
420.3,Jazmin,,you actually did an excellent job catching that nasa sent a small machine however you just didn't identify what the small machine was called the best part about your work is that you understood the text passage correctly but you didn't go back to the reading and tell me what the actual machine was called my feedback for you is that every time you read a passage and the questions given to you i want you to reread the passage again and the corresponding tasks and then tell me your answer the answer by reading and reading that the sentence again okay ,and i read it two times i did because i know 
420.3,Jazmin,,oh you did ,yeah the teacher told us that strategy you know you read it you read the question and then you read it again i just i forgot to put the name 
420.2,Jazmin,,on the machine o h that's okay next time can you please give us a specific name for the machine that's all ,okay yeah i can do that that's easy 
310.1,Chris,,awesome great job explaing that the small machine wasn't necessarily a small machine and you did a really great job showing me how you understood the text ,yeah i was thinking about equipment since a circle that in the text and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.1,Chris,,oh wow you did a superior job like telling me all that background knowledge i love that how you visited there and site and how it made a big impact on you i really so good good all right now so have you heard about this story before or is it your first time hearing this about finding water and the moon yeah ,this is my my first time because we we learned about the mars rover and like the things that go to mars but i didn't know about water on the moon 
230.2,Jazmin,,oh you didn't know about the water and that's incredible well if you actually go back to the passage in the first paragraph shall we just go back and see together since i didn't go with three other answers so we could definitely do that so student can you tell us what the paragraph you find the answer from ,i found the answer in the second paragraph 
230.2,Jazmin,,how do you know that how do you know that the answer actually is in the second paragraph ,um cuz i was looking for equipment right and so when i was reading i only saw two places in paragraph two or they see a small machine and then paragraph three where they see the microscope but the question and i went back to the question and says to discover water right and then in the second sentence it says the herbal will look for ice deposit so looking for is the same thing as discovering i think 
110.1,Oliver,,"excellent job you you really enjoyed you really really great you really impressed me with your answer i love how you I love how utilizing all the words from the question sentence and you're trying to find that word and try to revisiting of the paragraph, I really, really great job so you're correct indeed. the answer is located in a paragraph two and it's not too difficult and because it says nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate right and yeah and then it was confusing at first because as you said it is a small machine that appears in twice in this passage right so that's why it was a little bit confusing but you did a really great job thoroughly reading an entire paragraph and telling me how it actually works to find water good i read the story yeah i'm so proud of you you would that really impressed me okay student i'm sorry have you to wait for a while so go right ahead you have any question ",no teacher i'm sorry but it's actually time for us to go 
110.1,Oliver,,oh is it already ,yeah 
120.4,Luis,,okay later i'll see you later and thanks for the great class bye bye hello class welcome back okay we're gonna resume hi so we're going to resume or a conversation about the previous texts and science class okay all right student i have your response up here would you like to share out loud with the whole class so we can go ahead yes student ,yeah excuse me i'm okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
150.1,Luis,,that's awesome i love that how you're sharing your answer with us the beginning of the class and really really appreciate it and i love to hear from two other scholars and you you can also comment on it and you can also share your thoughts whenever while you're raising your hands but um yeah but let's hear from student first okay ,okay can i go back to my seat since i i fixed mine 
120.4,Farrah,,um why don't you um let's just hang tight for a minute okay awesome student go ahead ,okay yeah um so my answer was that all you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
310.1,Farrah,,but what did the text makes you think that was the answer sure okay i love that you gave the answer and it will really impressed me was that you capture the word microscope from the passage an important keyword there ,because i was looking for the keywords equipment oh discover water on the moon and this one had it had a microscope which is equipment and then it says in the second sentence the water they found is microscopic and found is kind of like discovered and then it's also about water on the moon 
230.2,Farrah,,right right very important did you get that did you get the answer from which paragraph again ,from paragraph three 
230.3,Farrah,,paragraph three so you got the word microscopic which looks really important right and then it looks like a little machine sounds like a little machine and it has a scientific tools who may just think that it was a scientific tool the little machine and you also found found verve and water say major think that's the answer but ,"yeah sorry teacher it wasn't that it was a machine, I guess, my science teacher might see that it is, but I was looking for equipment. because that was the word in the question and i know microscope is equipment because that's what we say when we get out the microscopes and science class "
120.3,Farrah,,so let's start from the beginning so if you go back to the question i love to have you wide so why don't you try reading the question again ,Okay um what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. 
420.1,Farrah,,"and underline to discover water, the moon right. ",okay yeah i feel like i'm i'm still confused because did i do that in my answer 
410.3,Farrah,,so the answer was actually lunar orbiter from a pay a paragraph two so hearing what you wrote i think you you got the words microscopic and lunar orbiter mixed up from the text ,oh but but i did i had all the keywords i had equipment discover water on the moon i'm still confused 
130.3,Farrah,,uh huh the machine that we use to find water and the moon is called a lunar orbiter that's why I think I eat mixed up and pay and paragraph two and three. ,although they also do say microscope in the lessons and the last sentence of paragraph three how come that's not the equipment 
210.4,Chris,,that i love that question and then what it does that that's another scientific tool that's another equipment but they use it to the scientists in this paragraph according to the text they use a lunar orbiter from according to paragraph two that's a small machine and that's called lunar orbiter to find water under surface look things really closely right but not particularly to find water and i can tell you that because it tells you directly in the paragraph to and the ice deposits become a water and then scientists said that a ton of top layer the moon surface it hold a total about 32 ounces water so i know that it is water being found in the moon and and they also use it to drink water and stuff like that okay okay okay all right go right ahead student ,and i was thinking about the water on the moon and i were reading about them trying to find it and i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
210.4,Chris,,can you can you repeat that again ,yeah um i read at home and one of my science books that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
130.2,Luis,,oh wow that's an incredible information i love that you're sharing the resource with us yeah great student student do you have any thoughts i know you're all you also have like really enrich background knowledge about this topic do you have any comments to share on top of the student because you can add on to this ,out while i'm and not so much about the moon base but i was thinking about what student was saying about it being the microscope and then you were saying student to answer was right the lunar orbiter and that you know what i thought that they had sent the astronauts to the moon and the story but i actually think that maybe it's just the machine and and not the not the people 
230.3,Luis,,so you thought about jazmin's answer and then ,yeah i'm thinking maybe the lunar orbiter you know is like the mars rover where class in the rover you know it was just the machine itself and maybe that's the lunar orbiter is too 
310.1,Oliver,,good i love that you're giving connections and predictions they're great i love it all right student i would like to circle back ,i'm sorry teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go on but i did want to say thank you for how are you i'm kept asking our questions to class and took time to explain where you thought that they were on track i guess and where they were off track because now i'm thinking about my answer and maybe where i was off track i'm not sure but at least i'm thinking about it right 
310.1,Oliver,,i'm a you circle the same as student so i that yeah this is justin that i gave student actually applies to you oliveron so thank you for actually pointing that out great ,okay thanks teacher 
310.1,Farrah,,thank you bye bye have a great rest of your day good evening class how you doing today oh ,we're good thank you for asking we're so excited for your class 
150.1,Luis,,can you give me a thumbs up or thumbs up or a hand up if you agree with student great okay so you class just read a very short article yes student ,um yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
140.1,Luis,,is space something you're interested in student ,oh yeah oh big time i watch all these videos about space on youtube and and i really want to go to space camp and go into the zero gravity chamber oh yeah i really like space 
230.1,Luis,,that's fantastic that means you have an amazing schema which means you've lots of background information about space and that's going to help us today but sometimes like in this question they wanted us to find a specific answer in the text so student if you look at the answer to your question your answer to the question can you find that in the text or did you find that appear in your brain because you knew all about space ,well i guess um i guess it was from my brain 
110.3,Luis,,but student can you read the question for us do you have it which is great i'm so excited that you have so many facts up there in your brain ,oh yeah that's right here um what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon 
120.3,Luis,,there's a little bit more keep reading ,i don't see anything 
120.2,Luis,,it doesn't say circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question ,i guess i skipped that part 
110.2,Luis,,did class see that's the whole question okay so student if the question would have stopped where you were reading your answer would have been 100 right because you circled information in your brain give your brain a kiss say thanks brain ,hey thanks brain 
120.3,Oliver,,but we wanted to use the text and not our background knowledge so once again can student can you read the question one more time for me ,okay yeah okay that's what equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon so all the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question 
210.2,Jazmin,,right so who knows just in one word what is this question about what is it asking us about yes student ,asking us about equipment 
210.2,Jazmin,,you got it so we're gonna have to find a equipment some type of equipment and what did this equipment do ,well it discovers the water and i'm i'm a little confused because i don't know why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay so can you share will you share with the class what your answer was ,yes i said nasa send a small machine 
230.2,Jazmin,,okay you're right good can you read us the sentence where you where you got that ,yeah okay so um it was in part two and it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,so what was that small machine called ,a lunar orbiter 
210.3,Jazmin,,so do you think you could add something to your answer student to make it more complete in more correct ,well i guess i could i could just say that name the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Jazmin,,because what did the lunar orbiter do ,it it looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
130.3,Farrah,,so the lunar orbiter was a piece of equipment that scientist us to discover water on the moon hands up if you agree with ,oh well i had a different piece of equipment i said the microscope and i think that that's the piece of equipment it's a tool and we use it in science class sometimes and it helps you look at really small things like the water on the moon 
210.3,Farrah,,student you are right that the microscope is a piece of equipment but is the microscope what they use to discover the water on the moon or is the microscope what they you what we use to see ,well i guess i was thinking how can you discover it if you can't see it 
210.4,Farrah,,did you class watch the movie about how the lunar orbiter worked you class didn't ,no we just we just read this we just read it 
120.3,Farrah,,okay okay so i can see where this is going to be a little bit confusing um so you're absolutely right that the piece of equipment is a microscope but can you read the sentence that has the word microscope in it student ,i circled it and everything it says you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.3,Chris,,can you read the sentence before that student ,yeah yeah i can do that right before it says okay the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it 
210.4,Chris,,okay so are they really telling us that we need a microscope that they i'm sorry are they telling us we used a microscope or are they telling us that the water was so small we would need a microscope ,it sounds like it sounds like the second one but also but also i i went to nasa so i know that that scientists they actually use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.4,Oliver,,they do but this is asking us specifically from our reading not from what we know from other places right they want to know what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so who thinks they can answer that question now what evidence would you circle student what are you going to circle ,okay well this is so i changed my answer so first i said the microscope like student did but now now i think maybe they were just saying that it's really small so if you want to look at it like if i wanted to look at it i would have to use a microscope but now i think first i had to use the lunar orbiter and um i just wanted to say i i looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch actually but i wanted to say thank you so much for being so patient and really explaining to us how our answers were not quite complete and how we could understand the story even better to make our answers even better 
140.1,Luis,,yeah because you class were right on the right track we just had to make that one little jump and student one last thing what was armstrong neil armstrong what did he say when he landed on the moon ,that that's one small step for man one giant leap for mankind 
150.1,Luis,,you class did one small step towards learning and now we did another giant step towards learning so enjoy lunch thanks for coming ,by 
150.1,Farrah,,i take care good morning class how are you ,morning we're good today 
230.1,Luis,,good so we just shared our answers for the water on the moon and i was just curious maybe starting with student student could you explain how you came to your answer choice ,um well actually i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
140.1,Luis,,well that's fantastic can you tell me something you know about space ,yeah okay i know they just landed the mars rover 
120.2,Luis,,that is very true and it was pretty cool i got to watch it but today we're not talking about space in general we're talking specifically about this article that we read having to do with water on the moon so it's fantastic that you already know about space but for today we're kind of looking at your ability to read and pull out information so could you take a look at your answer student and could you tell me how did you get that answer ,well i know after our astronauts up on the mound looking for water they definitely are using oxygen tanks 
230.1,Luis,,whoa okay why are they definitely using oxygen tanks ,to breathe 
210.3,Luis,,oh so the oxygen tanks are helping the astronauts survive not really helping the astronauts in discovering the water ,well i mean i guess you need to breathe to discover water that's kind of what i was thinking 
410.1,Luis,,and that is very very true that the astronauts have to be alive in order to be able to discover the water can you tell me a little bit more what do you think are astronauts and scientists one in the same the question though it did ask us it said what equipment did scientists use and you're talking to me about astronauts ,um astronauts are a type of scientist 
230.1,Luis,,was that a question or a statement ,not sure 
230.2,Luis,,okay i think you're right that a lot of astronauts have some training in science but i want to take a look i think if we look at this question student it's asking us to answer this question based on what we read in the article so did you get your answer from the article or did you get your answer somewhere else ,um i guess it's not really in the story 
230.1,Luis,,where is it ,in my brain 
230.1,Luis,,in your brain because you know so much stuff about space which is pretty awesome ,yeah 
210.3,Luis,,but in this case are we looking for information from your brain or are we looking for information from the article ,i guess the article 
210.3,Luis,,so what do you think is something you might need to do right now to check your answer ,and read it 
230.1,Farrah,,"read your answer read the article article okay so i'm going to keep talking to some other students and i'm going to come back to you to see once you've read the article and i know you've got all that background knowledge in your brain which is fantastic but help look just at this article to try and figure out the answer does that sound like a plan i'm going to talk to both Oliver and Farrah because you guys had the same answer so yeah Oliver or Farrah, can you tell me how you are can you guys actually talk to each other and i'll listen about how you came up with that answer choice. ",okay well i found it on student in part three and i circled the part where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i guess i don't understand why my answers wrong um yeah i circled that same part student cuz i was thinking that you'd you'd need to be able to see something before you can find it yes we don't understand 
230.1,Farrah,,that's some really good thinking you're absolutely right there olive that you need to be able to see it in order to know that you found it student can you tell me a little bit more what do you mean you don't understand what's confusing you right now ,um why isn't the microscope the right answer 
210.3,Farrah,,so what do you know about a microscope ,oh lets you see things that are really small 
140.1,Farrah,,okay have you ever used a microscope ,in science 
210.4,Oliver,,okay okay and so that's i mean you're absolutely both of you are right that it's something that you you need to use to find something that is very small but if we look does it say that the water is on the surface of the moon or that the water is kind of buried underneath ,oh i remember it's in these craters these craters way down where the sun never shines 
210.3,Farrah,,very good so do you think they took a microscope to the moon to like look around like this to try and find all of that water ,oh that sounds really hard 
430.2,Oliver,,it does sound pretty hard and it sounds like it would take a pretty long time wouldn't it so i think you class are on the right track that a microscope was probably involved but it's not the big piece of equipment that we were looking for so can you to reread the passage and see if you can find a bigger piece of equipment that they would have used ,um yeah i wish we park but we actually have to go now um but i wanted to say thank you so much for working with us today 
430.2,Oliver,,you're welcome this time goes so fast ,sure does 
150.1,Luis,,okay bye class hi class i'm so glad that you were able to come join me at for a small class so we can talk a little bit more about what you were just reading and talking about related to the moon so before we start can we oh student did you have a question ,um yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Luis,,you already know all about space that makes me so happy because we're going to be able to use your knowledge as an expert about space to help teach the rest of our class so i'm going to definitely be relying on you student so thank you for sharing that with me before we get started thanks student can you class quickly share what it is that you were just answering about the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon just in a couple of words student can we start with you ,yeah okay so i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
110.1,Jazmin,,great thanks student what about you ,i said that nasa sent a small machine 
210.3,Jazmin,,do you remember the name of the small machine ,nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
310.1,Chris,,student what was your answer oh great i love that you decided to look back in the text to find out the answer to the question when you weren't sure it's always a great idea ,i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
110.1,Oliver,,thanks student student ,um yeah so i circled the same answer as savanannah and that's a microscope 
120.4,Farrah,,ah ok so student are you going to share the same answer as student the microscope too ,um yeah well so my answer is you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
130.2,Farrah,,I love that a lot of you circle that answer in your text. That would be easy for you to sign and come back to. as we were talking did any of you remember that some of your peers answers came up in the text too does that sound familiar ,some of them yeah 
140.1,Chris,,great i'm really glad to hear that so we're going to talk a little bit more about this and ways that we can go even deeper into our text when you class were reading this how did it feel did it feel really easy kind of in the middle or really difficult to read student ,um i think it was pretty easy to read 
120.4,Jazmin,,great student what about you ,i would say that's a kind of medium because well my answer was the small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong why am i in this class 
140.1,Jazmin,,we did not pull you class together as a class to tell you that you were wrong we just pulled you together to find out a little bit more about what we're learning sometimes it's oh i'm not sure that your answer is wrong easier for us to learn more about what we are learning in a class of small a smaller class instead of our whole entire class as one do you feel like this is a little bit easier to talk to each other in a small class ,yes yes 
120.4,Chris,,yeah absolutely and i'm loving that i'm getting to spend some time with just the five of you and i think we can all really learn from each other like i mentioned earlier with student we are going to try to go a little bit deeper into our text today so thinking about the tools that the scientists use to discover water on the moon i know you class mentioned lots of different equipment the oxygen tanks the lunar orbiter the microscope sometimes they just found it in craters i want you to take just a quick second and read over just the first paragraph of the text again and if you think of any questions or any parts that seem confusing to you i would love to hear them so just take a minute and scan over just the first paragraph one more time great job thank you so i noticed in the first paragraph that it talks about craters that's a difficult vocabulary word does someone know what a crater is student do you know wat a crater is ,yeah so it's sort of like a whole but it's cooling underground it's kind of like on top of the ground 
230.1,Oliver,,yeah absolutely a crater is sort of like a whole or a well that might have filled up with water it sounds like that's what happened in this article it also says that a crater is a dark place where the sun never shines we can learn all of that from just the beginning of our reading about the moon now that you have a little bit of a better idea of what a crater is do you think a crater is a piece of equipment that scientists would use to find water you can shake your head yes or no if you can looks like student saying no it looks like i'm seeing a lot of nos student i'm seeing your head shaking no to why do you think no ,well a crater it's more like um on a piece of nature i don't know if nature is the right word but it's not like something you use or a tool it's just kind of part of the moon 
410.1,Chris,,yeah absolutely it's kind of part of the moon so it is something that caught the water but it doesn't quite answer a question about it being a piece of equipment that the scientists are using ,yeah well because that was my answer it first about the craters i hear what you mean about equipment on and that made me think about how i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use own lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
130.2,Luis,,yeah absolutely i love that you made a connection to your own personal experience student and you were able to realize that your original answer was close but it wasn't quite right thank you for noticing that on your own let's take a quick look at the second paragraph and do the same exact thing so take a look at the second paragraph read it over again quickly and then we're going to talk about it again all right great job thanks class i remember that student shared that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter that lunar orbiter i'm not even sure if i know what that means what words or ideas in the text could we use to figure out what a lunar orbiter is we know it's a small machine but if my machine could be anything how can we get a little bit of a better idea of what a lunar orbiter is student our space expert can you help us out ,um yeah okay so um lunar you class lunar means moon so anytime you see lunar it means about the moon an orbiter is like an orbit it's like it goes around something and it says so the orbiter at looks for the ice i think by going around the moon somehow 
230.3,Oliver,,student thank you so much for sharing that luna does mean moon so when you hear the word lunar it's going to have something to do with the moon just like now is the lunar new year it's the complete cycle of the moon orbiter just like student said has to do with going around student used his knowledge of those two words individually to put them together and figure out more about what a lunar orbiter is if you look back in your text you can see that it looks for ice deposits in the crater student can you add on student told us that it was a small machine and student added on to that by saying that it has to do with going around the moon ,well actually i looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch right now but i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us read and understand the text so carefully and really look back at it and use it to answer the question i was so helpful thank you so much 
120.4,Luis,,thanks student thanks all of you go enjoy your lunch so we're still talking about the lunar orbiter does class have any thoughts that we didn't bring up before student ,um yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,oh of course student but we all want to benefit from your expertise so you know we we like the opportunity to be able to to have you in the class so that we can ask you some questions what did you think about the lunar orbiter ,um well i guess we'll kind of what i was thinking because a question was about the equipment for discovering water on the moon well what i was thinking was actually back on they would need oxygen tanks because how are you going to breathe up on the moon to go discover water if you don't have oxygen tanks 
120.4,Oliver,,that's a really good point i you know i wish the article would have talked about that i guess i guess sometimes the the articles forget that that people might be coming to to the article without a knowledge of what nasa does and how they do it um but i would have loved and maybe it's in a separate article you know if they would have talked about kind of the space suits and the way that that they do provide i think they call it life support measures instead of you know they don't just refer to it as oxygen because it's more than just oxygen but but let's go back to talking about the lunar orbiter because i just thought that was so interesting student did you did you what did you think about the lunar orbiter because it's just so amazing like could you imagine the way that this this orbiter is able to reach a part of the moon that we've never been able to reach before i thought that was so interesting ,yeah it's really really interesting um and one thing i thought was really kind of especially interesting about it was that on when they found the water it was so small that was it's um it's less water than on the earth and it's drier than the dry desert even but they're still water there and so but here's my question is because well i wasn't i didn't pick the lunar orbiter for my answer i picked the microscope because the water so small so i don't i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,well your answer is not wrong student and i'm so i'm so glad that you picked to the microscope so i let as a way to answer your question i would like one of your classmates to maybe kind of give us kind of a reassessment of how was it that that nasa made this discovery student could you tell your classmates how was it that they found that there was water on the moon ,okay well hey they sent the small machine and it investigated the craters that deep polar craters and that's where they found the ice deposits 
210.4,Jazmin,,and student did the machine which is called the lunar orbiter by the way did that have a microscope on it ,oh oh i'm not so sure no i don't think i don't think it told us in the story 
210.4,Farrah,,that's right it didn't so i want all of you to think about this for a moment it's you know i think the the person who wrote the article kind of did us a disservice here because they they kind of gloss over the fact that there's a step between the lunar orbiter orbiting that part of the moon making contact with that part of the moon and then later scientists at nasa looking at the the samples that the lunar lunar orbiter collected under a microscope at a lab back on earth or on the space station or perhaps even maybe on some other sort of space probe but so so think about that and then tell me what what's that step in between so student can you tell me how is it that that sample is collected and how we get from you know the lunar lunar orbiter existing and then being able to look at a sample of the moon under a microscope could you go ahead and tell me that student ,well i can try it's kind of i guess but i guess probably that lunar orbiter it must like take take samples take pieces maybe of the ice or maybe pictures or or like scans of the moon somehow and that it takes that on that what's the word evidence back to the lab and then they use the microscope which makes so much more sense 
110.2,Chris,,"that's that's exactly right student the one thing that that you said that i want to clarify as you mentioned Dust, particles of some sort you need something to be able to look under the microscope. a picture alone is not enough now i will say maybe in a future class will look at the way that that sort of evidence like that samples like that could be used to create photographic samples but but that'll be that'll be another class but student you have a question ",yeah well it's actually a comment on so i went to nasa actually and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like student said and masks and suits 
210.4,Luis,,it's incredible isn't it student so you know let's talk about why is it that so just to be clear because because i know the article you know that i think the article could have been if one of you would have written the article it would have been so much better because you would have filled in all these blanks but so we have this lunar orbiter and why is it called the lunar lunar orbiter by the way why why is it that it's called that you think no it wasn't an article but student ,yeah well i definitely got this okay lunar means moon and orbiter means it like it goes around because that's what an orbit is 
110.1,Oliver,,that's exactly right that's exactly right so you know we have this lunar orbiter yes student ,i'm sorry yeah um so actually i just looked at the clock um and we have to go to lunch but on before we go i wanted to say thank you so much for explaining that missing step and the article because it makes so much more sense now when they use the orbiter and then how they use the microscope and so now i really understand how how our answers could have been better and how the article could have been better so thank you so much 
110.1,Oliver,,"oh you're welcome student that's what i'm here for you know it's sometimes when things don't make sense you just have to kind of step back and ask yourself well And I think that the information that's missing for all of you right now in this moment is a sandwich so go enjoy your lunches there well deserved, because you all worked really hard. this first half of the day and i really really really look forward to keeping the discussion going when you can come back from lunch and you're you're all re energized but haven't really great lunch ",thank you 
110.1,Luis,,bye start simulation how's class feeling today ,i'm good but excuse me i shouldn't be in this space 
150.1,Luis,,student we need some space expertise and so it's always good to have you in the room anytime we're talking about space but one of the reasons that i wanted to to have you here besides the fact that you're our in house space expert is that you mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like lots of oxygen tanks and i wanted to hear a little bit more about some of the other equipment they use and just kind of get your perspective on it and start a conversation with your classmates ,okay 
120.4,Luis,,so can you tell us a little bit about some of the equipment that was mentioned in the article ,oh in the article i was going to tell you more equipment that i know I know you spacesuits and I know they use gravity boots. in because it's really really cold out in space and you could die equipment equipment equipment okay there is a small machine called a lunar orbiter in paragraph two and there's a microscope in paragraph three 
210.4,Luis,,cool that that's exactly the two pieces of equipment that they mentioned in the article so what does the lunar orbiter do let's let's take a step back student what did you get what what did you get from this article what what did this article tell you especially you know you're our in house space expert for you you know you were able to maybe fill in some of the gaps that the author of the article left out so give me a sense of what you took away from this article ,um okay um so i guess i didn't read it that much because i felt like i already knew most of the stuff 
120.3,Jazmin,,he didn't you didn't read it well let me let me what i can understand that i've done the same thing but go ahead and and take a couple of minutes to read it while i connect with your fellow space enthusiasts classmates and maybe you can also kind of keep an ear open while you're reading and and get a sense of what your classmates got out of it so student what yes student ,i understand why my answer is wrong 
120.3,Jazmin,,let me go ahead and take a look at your answer nasa send a small machine so your answer is not wrong i would just love it if you could explain it a little bit more and be a little bit more specific so going back to the article let's see and see if there's a way that you can use it to help make your answer more specific there is paragraph two could you go ahead and look at paragraph two ,oh yeah i could i could write the whole sentence nasa's into small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate that is that right 
210.4,Jazmin,,yes you could you could definitely say that they sent to lunar orbiter to investigate and what exactly why did they have to send the lunar orbiter what what's the purpose of the lunar orbiter and what what is it really besides a small machine ,the purpose is to find ice deposits in a large polar crater 
210.4,Chris,,i'm going to come back to you and i'm going to come back to you to student that's correct that's correct very good student student how did you feel about this article and what what sense did you get from it ,i thought it was pretty cool you know like the idea of finding water on the moon and then maybe people you know if we if we use all the water on our planet you know then then we could go to the moon and we could have people drink water and astronauts could have water there so yeah 
210.3,Chris,,so student do you think you know you mentioned some pretty some pretty big goals there in that in that idea do you think we're ready to do that you know in a year you think we're set up for that well ,no no not not not now because they're not close to it yet i don't think um but well i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
130.2,Oliver,,that's right that's right well you know i'm glad that you recognize student that it's this is you know being able to leverage and to use the resources on the moon the natural resources like the water that was recently found really is something that it's going to that's going to be number one very difficult and number two it's going to be a long time you know the technology and the science does not exist to be able to do this yet student could you help me explain a little bit more to your classmates about why it is that you know the water on the moon is still too early for chris's goals ,yeah cuz in paragraph six they talk about how it'll take a lot of time and a lot of money and so that means that they don't have the time or the money yet so it's it's clearly not ready yet 
210.4,Oliver,,that's right i'm really glad that you pointed up paragraph six that's a good point is there something else is is there a reason that it would cost a lot of money in particular that you see in the art in paragraph six ,water scientists need to come up with a plan for extracting are getting it out of the polar craters making this planet tickle at all so they don't even know how to get the water out 
120.3,Oliver,,that's right they don't and and so since they don't know what would they have to do to be able to get it out that's that's right there in that paragraph to you keep reading a little bit more ,like oh they want me to study the surface and don't know 
210.4,Oliver,,that's right that's right and now so why does that why does building new equipment how does that tie together to time and money ,cars it takes a while to build something like i have a whole like lego house and ship and boat at my house and we're still working on it because it takes a long time to build thing 
150.1,Oliver,,i love that you brought up that example that's what's called an analogy and it is a great analogy student and we're going to continue yeah definitely i really like it we're going to continue talking about legos as a way to help us understand what we're talking about in this article so student what's the difference i'm sorry did somebody say something ,yes me i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go 
150.1,Farrah,,oh i'm so sad that we have to wait to talk about our our legos but i really appreciate all of you taking the time to think about this more so i see all of you have questions so let's just take one minute to kind of wrap everything up so student you go first student this ,is waving goodbye 
150.1,All,,oh that's you waving goodbye okay well we can continue after lunch all of you have earned a great lunch and a great rest and i really look forward to talking more about how legos relate to this so thank you so much for your hard work thanks teacher ,bye see you later 
120.2,Luis,,thanks um so we i just asked you the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,um yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,uhm what equipment did you find in the texts that scientists used to discover the water on the moon that's great student i love that you're interested in space maybe you can share your knowledge with the rest of the students ,oh wow i know scientists think it was a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
110.1,Farrah,,does class have any other ideas about what equipment the scientists use do we student yes they do the they do use oxygen tanks uhmm ,yeah okay so i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah that's great in the text they said that the scientists use a microscope because microscopes are used to look at things that are really really tiny and the water molecules on the moon were really tiny student i saw your hand go up earlier did you have something to add ,um so my answer is nasa sent a small machine 
210.4,Luis,,can you look in the text and see if you can find what the name of the small machine was yeah they did i remember reading that as well does class remember what it was called yeah student did you find it ,i found it right there in the middle it says lunar orbiter 
210.4,Luis,,exactly yeah it's called a lunar orbiter has class heard those words before ,oh yeah well i definitely have 
210.4,Luis,,do you know what they mean you know what lunar means ,uhm lunar means lunar means the moon 
120.4,Chris,,yes it does and what what does something do when it orbits does class have any ideas student yeah ,yeah so i think is when something sort of goes around something else 
210.4,Farrah,,exactly yeah it's when something moves around something else kind of in a in a circle usually yeah student do you have something to add ,well i'm just wondering i mean i said the microscope so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
150.1,Farrah,,your answer is not wrong scientists used lots of different machines to discover the water on the moon does that make sense so they first use the lunar orbiter like we talked about and they also use the microscope to see the tiny particles of water does that make sense ,so the answer is just both 
110.4,Farrah,,yeah it is it's both they use both machines both pieces of equipment or tools ,okay okay so um i guess i'm still just not sure how the microscope and the lunar orbiter like how they fit together in the same answer 
210.4,Luis,,mm hmm that is a great question so if we look at the text that we read it says that the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater so the lunar orbiter is in space and it uses a telescope or a camera to look for these water particles but the water particles are microscopic they're really really tiny so the scientist has to use the microscope as well to be able to see them ,oh okay i'm starting to make a little more sense um yeah so i mean student have to use both because can you imagine like an astronaut walking around the whole moon was just a microscope just a tiny little microscope i mean that wouldn't work 
110.1,Chris,,thanks for adding student yeah i don't i think they have to use a bunch of different tools to look and so thank you for contributing your opinion student do you have a question ,well i just wanted to share i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.4,Oliver,,that's very cool i have not been to nasa i've always wanted to go that's really cool that you got to go but i've seen lots of videos where they use lots of different equipment like the ones you described and they have to use like space suits and sometimes these satellites to see different things it's very interesting does class else have any ideas about what other types of equipment scientists use the nasa scientists use yeah student ,well i know that down on earth there's people with like on lots of computers and screens on buttons and things 
140.1,Chris,,yeah that's very true they use a lot of a lot of high tech tools like computers and buttons and things to control things that are in space because we can't be in space all the time so they use them to control telescopes satellites like i said to see what other things are going on yeah student do you have something to add ,yeah well i have a question sort of about the story so were there actually any astronauts on the moon looking for the water because i wasn't quite clear from the story about that 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah that's a great clarifying question i was a little unclear as well but from what i understand it sounds like they just use the equipment and to find a water on the moon and the scientists were controlling it from earth and that so they used the equipment to find the water they might have been on the space station or something that was also in space but it sounds like the equipment did a lot of the work ,um so i just looked at the clock and it's it's actually time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for being so interested in everything that each one of us had to say it really felt like you valued everybody's contribution so much so thank you 
150.1,Luis,,start simulation hello class i'm so happy to see you so today we're going to talk about your responses to the reading that we did about nasa yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be i already know all about space 
140.1,Luis,,well i'm glad that you're really interested in space and i think that being a part of this class you'll learn from your fellow peers about maybe some other responses and we can build your understanding of the resources that i provided you with the texts that we learned about how to answer a question using a nonfiction text okay i think it'll be really interesting because if you know a lot about space i'm sure you really like it what is your favorite thing about space student ,okay i love watching like the space shuttles take off and go like straight up into space i always watch some youtube videos about that and then how the astronauts can like flow you know 
120.2,Farrah,,no gravity yeah that's really cool i i think it's really interesting also and such a cool advancement in technology so let's let's talk about the question that you class responded to which was student do you want to tell me about your answer what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,i said that all scientists know i said you need a scientific to hold a microscope to look really closely 
420.1,Jazmin,,i see how you found the answer in the text you looked for the scientific tool in the text let's look at the question again let's see what is the keyword that's really important class look at the question on your piece of paper and try and find one or two keywords that you think are important to answering the question did you find it student ,yeah i think equipment is a keyword and so i wrote about equipment and my answer so i don't understand my my answer is wrong 
230.1,Jazmin,,what can you tell me about your answer why did you choose you see that okay ,so it says nasa send to small machine cuz i know that the question was asking us to look for equipment that was looking for water and so in paragraph two i thought that that machine was the equipment 
210.4,Jazmin,,i see how you made that connection do we remember what the small machine was called yeah the small machine is one of the pieces of equipment that they use that equipment can maybe look in your text it says it in the ,lunar orbiter 
120.4,Farrah,,yeah lunar orbiter so that's one piece of equipment great did class find another piece of equipment or that they said in their answer yeah student ,yeah because when you had asked me about what was the words in the question i thought equipment was an important word to so i i said microscope because that's equipment 
230.3,Farrah,,yeah i yeah that's very true and the microscope is another piece of equipment that the scientists use so now we have two pieces of equipment right so we have the lunar orbiter that student talked about and her response and the microscopes man that you talked about in your response deb i think you also mentioned the microscope and your response right ,yeah yeah i i was looking for equipment because i thought that was the keyword and i talked about water because i thought water was important a microscope and looking at water in paragraph three so who's right um man student or testament 
130.1,Chris,,whoa you're both right you both made connections and found pieces of equipment and the text but both of the responses were missing a little bit of detail because you talked about the microscope but you didn't talk about the lunar orbiter and student you talked about the lunar orbiter but not the microscope and they used a lot of pieces of equipment because it takes a lot of things to find water on the moon it's a big discovery okay yeah student ,yeah i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
140.1,Chris,,that's that's really cool i've never been to nasa but i think that would be a really fun trip what was your favorite part ,it's amazing you can see all of these different space shuttles that have gone to into space for like the past 30 and 40 years and then they have some like little pieces of moon rock that you can you can touch some of them and they have all of these other artifacts from space it is amazing you gotta go 
120.4,Chris,,yeah i definitely want to go soon so what pieces of equipment did you talk about in your answer student ,oh i fogot the equipment part that i didn't say 
130.1,Chris,,Of the question we use the equipment that we just talked about the Lunar orbiter and the microscope that Farrah and Oliver and Jazmin talked about to discover the water. right ,yeah yeah i did that part but i forgot about the equipment 
420.2,Chris,,well that's okay now we know that the question the keyword was the equipment so do you see how you could add more to your answer and use the question and the keywords to find what kinds of things we want to use to answer so we want to talk about the equipment in our answer ,i guess i could just add the two names of the machines that on today in in in in student in student said 
210.4,Chris,,do you see them in in the text where it talks about the kinds of equipment ,yeah student said it was in paragraph three and i see jazmin's in paragraph two 
210.4,Oliver,,very good yeah so we can use the text as a resource to find her answers yeah ,i'm sorry to interrupt but it's time for us to go so we'll see you next time okay 
230.1,Luis,,okay hi class thank you for your thoughtful responses to the question um student why don't you tell me why you said that there was convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ,okay excuse me okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
150.1,Jazmin,,student why don't we listen to our fellow classmates and see what they have to say and maybe we can learn some new things ,okay okay okay so i said that um that it would be valuable because well water is important because astronauts have can drink the water i mean it's not like they're on the on the on the ground where they can just like go to the store and buy some water or something so and we need water to survive so that seems like that's really important 
310.1,Jazmin,,did you find any any convincing evidence in the text to support that it can be valuable i see how you came to that conclusion that having water on the moon would be valuable to have for astronauts in space ,i found this somewhere let me see because i thought i underlined it did i did i miss oh yes it's in the beginning okay and i'm in the paragraph four it says watering the most valuable to have ways for example future astronauts could drink this water 
230.1,Farrah,,yeah so i see yeah that's perfect evidence in the text to support your statement that water can be valuable maybe you could look in the text for more supporting evidence to show that it could be valuable i'm concerned that your response doesn't include all of the benefits that water could provide to the astronauts so why don't you look at the text and see if you can find some more evidence student and student i know you said that it there is not convincing evidence why why did you say that ,i'm still kind of confused 
120.2,Farrah,,so what are you confused about are you confused about the question or the reading yeah i i understand okay so we're looking at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ,well i guess the right answer cuz i thought that i had the right answer because i found it in the text you know how you said that we have to look for the evidence in the story did because in the last paragraph it says making this plan will take a lot of time and money they need to study the moon surface and build new equipment do you think you'll be a good investment you decide so i'm like okay a lot of time a lot of money my mom always says like that no no no it takes too much time oh no that's too much money so for me then that means no but then you just told student that when she said yes i was right 
150.1,Farrah,,so student thought that it could be valuable well there you at the end of the paragraph it says you decide so it's your opinion on whether or not you think it's valuable i see how you came to your conclusion that it would not be valuable because you said that it takes a lot of time and a lot of money and maybe you don't think that that's a good investment so there can be multiple answers it's all about your opinions as long as you support it with evidence from the text so if you find evidence like you said to them that there's not enough there's a lot of money and a lot of time then maybe it's not worth it does that make sense ,yeah yeah so i um well i guess so then there's my answer okay 
430.2,Farrah,,but i'm concerned that you didn't provide enough evidence and your response so you can see that you don't think it's valuable but i would provide some evidence or some examples as to why why you think and revise your response that way okay. ,so can i just write down what i told you 
230.1,Oliver,,student you you had a similar response you said that no it's not not ready yet so maybe look in the text and find some evidence as to why you think it would not be valuable yeah tell me why you why you said that ,okay i wanted to be in that so i just need to come up with a plan for constructing or getting it out of the polar craters making this plan will take a lot of time and money so you don't have a plan i am but you don't even have like the time and the money to make the plan so for me that means that that's not valuable because i don't even have it and i don't know how to get it 
420.3,Oliver,,You do what the man is doing and look in the text and find some supporting evidence for why you don't think so what you just told me is that they don't have a plan and they don't have time and they don't have enough money. ,ok ok ok 
420.3,Chris,,student what did yes ,i was just thinking about what student said about the time and i could be a base on the moon by 2024 
420.3,Chris,,To find it to. that water could be used on the moon ,it's only that's only a few years away 
120.4,Chris,,mm hmm very true so student what um what did you say in your your response ,i said waters heavy so it's good they don't have to carry the ships anymore 
120.4,Chris,,mm hmm so let's look at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable so what do you think do you think based on what you've heard and read in the text you think finding one on the moon can be valuable ,yeah definitely um yeah because then they wouldn't have to carry it all the way up there in the space shuttle they could just get it on the moon 
120.4,Bennett,,response so maybe you could add. The water could be valuable. yes ,oh yeah teacher i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for letting us know what we needed to work on and you gave me some ideas on how i could improve my answer oh yeah me too actually cuz then i realized that i could add some more details to my auntie to your meeting okay bye teacher all right hey 
120.4,All,,hello class ,hello 
120.4,Farrah,,how are you doing today ,oh we're great we're really excited to work with you 
150.1,Luis,,oh i'm excited to work with you to my name is teacher and i'm here to discuss the feedback i'm here to give you the feedback that for your responses about the study of water on the moon right so let's begin are you class ready to begin ,um excuse me i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
140.1,Luis,,really so let's begin with you then what do you know about space ,okay well i know a lot about space i know all about the different planets and i know stuff about uhm stars that milky way the sun kind of all the all the big ones 
230.1,Luis,,so so let's start with your response student you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks i wonder what made you see that ,um so what i was thinking as after scientists like astronauts on the moon trying to discover the water they can't do anything if they don't have oxygen tanks 
210.4,Luis,,oh that's how you thought about it and there was a mention of oxygen in this article again if you class remember reading the article the article mentions hydrogen and oxygen what does that make ,water 
230.3,Chris,,water yeah that's that makes water so um student said that scientists found creators full of water on moon right is that what you read hi student ,yeah so they thought there wasn't water but it turns out the craters they're full of water 
130.2,Chris,,full of water would you like to discuss this statement whether your partner to make sure that what you're stating is not incorrect ,oh sure yeah i could do that 
130.2,Chris,,who would you like to discuss it with ,oh i'll talk about it with student 
130.2,Farrah,,yeah sure i have a quick chat with student ,um can i share my answer while they're talking 
120.4,Farrah,,that's a good idea why don't you do that then ,okay because i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
130.2,Jazmin,,i think your answer is very close to what we're looking for but i'm wondering what made you think that they would be needing a microscope so what kind of a how did they discover that they'd be requiring a microscope so maybe you class can go look at the text again and try to find out how they've discovered the water was actually microscopic does that make sense like how you define what it is microscopic would you want to think deeply about that or maybe talk to dave about it in the meanwhile student can answer because chip it seems like dave also so called the same thing as us coming let's come back to student then ,okay i'm ready 
120.4,Chris,,oh student did you discuss your observation with student do you class have an answer ,yeah okay so uhm student pointed out that it says actually that the ice deposits are really small so even though i was picturing like these big lakes and pools of water it sounds like it's not really like that 
230.2,Jazmin,,yeah that's that's a good like i really think that was a very fruitful discussion that you had with student so student how did you find out about that what what did you read that make you think that the water is not like giant deposits of water and instead it's something different ,and so i was focusing on paragraph two because that's where i found my answer so it says nasa send a small machine and that was my answer and then at the end of the paragraph it says that the ice deposits are very small 
120.4,Oliver,,oh yes that is where exactly it says that the ice deposits are very small so i think that's can take us back to what's student and student have been looking at student and student have found the answer to this entire question by now would you like to share your answer ,yeah i think we're still a little confused cuz we were thinking how could you discover something if you can't even see it why don't you need the microscope and order to find it because it's so small 
130.2,Luis,,that's a very good observation would class else in the class like to contribute to this discussion and like to answer what student just said yes student ,okay so i know this because what the lunar orbiter does it's kind of like a robot uhm and it's like it tells the astronaut where the water is so the don't the lunar orbiter it doesn't even need to see it because it's a robot and uh yeah i think that's it 
130.2,Oliver,,what do you class think that does it sound like a good enough explanation student and student ,um yeah that makes sense but it didn't really say that in the story so i don't think i would have known that if student didn't tell me 
120.3,Chris,,would you like to read the passage since we feel like the confusion is still there and let's read it together as a class and see what the passage says student yes student ,yeah well actually i have a comment it's that i i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.3,Jazmin,,you went to nasa that's really amazing and i think your contribution is also valuable but right now let's try to find out the answer to the question that we're looking for so maybe if any one of you can volunteer to read passage 2 and as a class we can try to figure out the answer to this question would like to volunteer for that yes student you can go ahead and do that ,actually i'm really sorry i looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but before we go i just wanted to say i really appreciate how you asked us to look and explain how we how we found our answers because that really made me think about how how to use the text to explain my thinking and i think that's going to really help me in the future so thank you thank you so much 
150.1,Luis,,thank you for having me today and i just don't want to hold you back so all of you can now it out for lunch thank you so much and thank you for sharing observation well i've reviewed all of your responses in detail and i noticed some very interesting patterns so the aim of our discussion today is to oliverelop your responses further oh hi yeah student you have a question ,yeah 
150.1,Luis,,go ahead ,excuse me teacher ah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,oh you you already know all about space that's really great maybe that's the reason why you should be in this class because then you can help so many your peers learn so much more about space don't you think so ,oh yeah okay okay 
230.1,Luis,,stick with us and let's see what we can learn from each other as well so as we proceed with this discussion i would want you to observe how you're thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay so i'd like to start by asking some clarifying questions and said even said that he knows a lot about the space i'd like to start with you student i think you had a very interesting thought but i'd like to understand why you mentioned the use of oxygen tanks in response to this question ,oh yeah sure okay because you know when you go in a space you can't breathe so if you're thinking about equipment oxygen tanks are the most important ones 
230.1,Luis,,let's see if we can reset refine your answer further oh okay so you made a connection between equipment and oxygen tanks interesting with the help of your friends so student um tell me a little bit more about your response what makes you think that the water the creators are full of water ,because in the first paragraph it says scientists phone evidence or water can be found deep within the moon's pool recruiters and i know deep means like a lot of water because when i go swimming in the deep side of the pool it's got like a lot of water 
230.1,Farrah,,so you have made a connection between deep and pools and then that makes you feel that there is going to be a lot of water on the moon interesting so student i noticed that you have mentioned microscope as your equipment why did you do that ,um well cuz um well i was looking for a name of equipment and i was looking for a section where they're talking about finding water in in in a paragraph three it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it needed a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so that had all of the keywords so i don't understand where my answer is wrong 
120.4,Farrah,,who okay let's figure out if it needs further refinement and i think student you also answered the same as student so why don't you the three student student and student have a quick chat with each other to figure out what exactly is the quantity of water on the moon and share your response with the class and then we dig deeper so you have like a quick moment to have a chat with each other and then share like maybe you can reach a conclusion about the quantity of the water on the moon so are you class ready to share back with the class would like to go and answer them okay so ,um so i i told student but um you hey we need the microscope total closely because there's not a lot of water it's a very little part of it because it says microscopic 
150.1,Chris,,student so does that clarify the quantity of the water for you so ,i guess it can't be like full of water since it's do you have to use a microscope to look at 
120.4,Jazmin,,"let's take a deeper look student i really value how you have made a reference to a machine that was sent to the moon so I would want all of you to look at paragraph two, and look for a specific name of the machine and how that machine is use to assess discovery. but my concern is that we still don't know the machine's name and how it assisted in the discovery okay i think i see it would you like to share what you see ",okay it's called a lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposits 
210.4,Farrah,,okay so now we have the name of the machine and it looks for ice deposits and can you make a connection to the microscope now student ,oh well okay if the lunar orbiter looks for ice to pass it and the microscope looks at the water i guess they let the ice melt or something and then they look at it in the microscope 
150.1,Chris,,and it is at maybe and the deposits are optimized on the size of the deposit is microscopic so at the end of this entire activity i'd like to know if you feel that you have been able to answer this question in a more in more detail yes student ,it's not that question but i was just thinking about some of the other equipment on the moon and so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
150.1,Farrah,,yeah they definitely use a lot of equipment though because we are right now looking for a very specific equipment in response to a question but thank you so much for sharing what you know about the equipment that is available at NASA. so do you think all of you have a clear answer now do you think our response has evolved to we can can someone summarize the final answer for me in one clear statement yes student go ahead ,oh okay um the use of lunar orbiter to look for ice and then i use the microscope to look at the water 
130.2,Farrah,,okay um would class like to add to the response further would class like to even further refine savannas response ,oh my mind was going to be different i was just gonna add on to mine that nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to look for ice 
130.2,Oliver,,okay um and how yes yes student ,yeah i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but i was looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to goal but thanks for taking time to work with us 
130.2,Luis,,okay how's class doing today ,um teacher i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
110.1,Luis,,yeah you so you feel you're all good ,yeah yeah can i go 
230.1,Luis,,yeah yeah why don't you go first i'd like to know that you have mentioned that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen so i want to understand how this is going to be valuable ,okay well oxygen you know we need oxygen to breathe like i told you they can't breathe in space so that's valuable hydrogen i don't know i just saw it in the story and so i figured as important 
220.1,Luis,,okay so you didn't does that make make you want to stay and listen to the responses of your friends now just to see if you can learn more about how hydrogen can be useful and also to refine your answer further ,okay i guess so 
230.1,Oliver,,thank you so much for staying um student i read your response and you said no it's not ready yet what makes you say that ,okay cuz then we're talking about you know how how much it's going to cost and how much time it's going to take and how they don't have that time so i'm like well that's not ready 
130.2,Farrah,,so i really value how you have talked you have thought about all the costs that are going to be involved in this exploration which is an important component in determining the value of any exploration so why now why do you think that we are not ready for this exploration for a long time let's see if student has anything different to say ,on okay i mean it's kind of like what student said oh but cuz at the end it says like they need to come up with a plan and it will take a lot of time and a lot of money do you think you will be a good investment so i'm like well no because it'll take a long time 
110.1,Farrah,,"okay so thank you so much for sharing your responses i really value how both of you have been able to identify reasons why it might not be a good idea for us to invest And I really value how Chris has talked about water being really heavy and it cannot be carried on ships anymore Chris, would you like it, yes samana. ",i'm still confused 
230.1,Farrah,,would you like to share more about your conclusion ,well yeah i mean cuz i thought that i answered the question you know where it said could it be valuable and even at the bottom of the story it asks do you think it would be a good investment and so i said no so i don't i don't understand why that's wrong 
130.2,Bennett,,okay so i'm i'm going to make a suggestion on how we value investments towards the end of our investigation or discussion today but i would in the in the meanwhile i just want you to listen to why student and student have made some differences to the benefits of this this exploration and then let's talk more about what makes an exploration valuable or not is that okay student ,okay okay 
230.1,Chris,,student can you tell us why you have made a reference to the water being heavy and it's too heavy for the ships to begin what what's the benefit bike over here that you're trying to identify ,well that was in the story you talked about how heavy water is and so that they wouldn't have to take them on the on the spaceships anymore so um i mean i guess the benefit is like the spaceship will be lighter 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay so you have identify a bit i identified a benefit that the spaceship would be lighter which is by it is worth it for us to continue with this exploration and student has also identified a benefit so let's hear what student had to say student why do you go ahead what ,we i don't remember what i said oh oh they can drink the water and stay hydrated yeah so you know we can't survive without water so that's why i think it's a benefit 
430.2,Chris,,okay think it's a benefit because there is water on an astronaut's name need water for their hydration so what i'm seeing over here violence looking at all the different responses that i have received from this class i really value how some of you have talked about the benefits of this exploration whereas the other people like dave and someone i have talked about the costs of this exploration but my concern is that right now our responses do not encapsulate the benefits and costs together for us to be able to reach a final conclusion about this so i would want to discuss the answer for the impairs and see how you can add the aspect of costs are the aspects of benefit to your question ,so i read there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so they probably are already spending a lot of money to build that and so it would be probably important for them to have water on the moon base yeah that sounds good because then they can read they could drink the water and they wouldn't have to like carry on the water because what if they get more thirsty and they don't have enough water than they could like drink it on the moon okay um i guess oh yeah it 
120.4,Jazmin,,was i was just asking i'm talking to all of you now if you class are done with your discussion would class like to share the refined response which takes all the costs and benefits into account while answering the question is there convincing evidence that the water on the moon could be valuable is class ready to share a more refined response ,i didn't make a response yet but i guess i can try 
120.4,Jazmin,,go ahead why don't you um ,okay um is there convincing evidence water yes the water could be valuable because astronauts can drink the water and then they don't have to carry it on the ships so this and so it would be valuable to just have it on the moon 
230.1,Jazmin,,oh the cost part ,and it's expensive but they're already spending a lot of money to do stuff on the moon anyway 
130.2,Oliver,,okay thank you so much for sharing your response student i really value how you have stated the costs and benefits and stated your own personal opinion at the end based on what evidence you have been able to collect is there class else would like to add to the response that student has made yesterday ,as well not to add to it but i was just looking at the clock on it's time for us to go to lunch but i want to say thank you for kind of really making me feel valued with my ideas because at first i thought that when you asked her son and student but you were going to say that man student were wrong but then you said that we had some ideas too and so how we could kind of you know put everything together until i give me some ideas on how i can build mice my new answer even though i don't have it yet 
130.2,,,okay i'm really glad that my suggestion of building on each other's ideas and evaluating the cost in like you know evaluating this costs and benefits together has been valuable for you as a class ,student 
130.2,Farrah,,hi class ,oh hello 
140.1,Luis,,did you class like the reading about the water on the moon what did you think about it student ,oh yeah i'm excuse me um i shouldn't be in this class already know all about space 
140.1,Luis,,do you what do you what is your most what's your best fact that you have about space that you want to share with all of us ,oh well my favorite um fact about space is that there used to be nine planets but then they kicked pluto out of the planet club because he was too small 
140.1,Luis,,i know i kind of feel bad for pluto don't you ,yeah me too it pretty much stinks when you're a planet and then you get demoted 
110.3,Luis,,so maybe student you can kind of help us here then you can maybe be our expert in the class and help the rest of us what do you think about that ,that sounds awesome 
120.4,Chris,,okay great alright so how about the rest of us what was the most interesting part of the reading that you class read what did you like the most student ,oh well i thought it was just amazing how the scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
120.4,Jazmin,,right there's water on the moon super interesting and what does that mean now that they found water on the moon what can happen up there or what do scientists think we'll be able to do one day student what do you think ,if there's water on the moon maybe astronauts in the future could drink that water or maybe there could even be life on the moon 
140.1,Jazmin,,alright do you think maybe one day we could live on the moon ,i don't know it's kind of amazing to think about 
120.4,Farrah,,i know do any of you think you would like to one day live on the moon what do you think student i know you do right student you too alright so can we look at some of the questions that you answered about what you've read about the moon okay so we were asked what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon student what do you think ,"Okay, well, I thought the most important word would be equipment. "
120.4,Jazmin,,awesome yes equipment right so now we know that the answer that we're looking for is going to be a piece of equipment right okay somebody else tell me what word they thought was really important in that question to kind of give us a clue to what the answer should be student what do you think ,i was thinking maybe discover 
120.4,Oliver,,okay yeah discover good and how about you student what word do you think is real important in that question to give us that clue to find the right answer ,um well i thought equipment also um like student did um but i guess another important word would probably be water 
110.1,Luis,,good all right ,um maybe scientists. 
120.4,Luis,,okay scientist or i can see a better one what do you think student ,hmm what equipment ok we had equipment did scientists use to discover water well i guess really the only good word left is moon 
120.2,Farrah,,is moon right okay so now we have all of these big important words that we need to use to figure out what the answer is going to be so we know the answer is going to be a piece of equipment right and it's the piece of equipment that was used to discover it alright so does class want to take a guess after looking at those keywords what we're going to use or what was used to discover go ahead student ,okay so um my answer it was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and um i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Farrah,,well what okay so let's think about a microscope what do we use a microscope to do student you just said it a minute ago but let's repeat it what do you what do you use a microscope for ,to look at really small things 
120.1,Farrah,,"so what might be a better tool to look at the big picture, instead of the little picture that the microscope is going to show us. on the moon so we don't want to look at the little piece we want to look at the big piece ",oh um i guess i'm not sure i really thought microscope was the main piece of equipment since i was looking for equipment 
120.4,Chris,,"but we want to find the look at the big moon to find the water, not the tiny pieces of of water. so student what do you think ",okay well i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay so did we we read about those things in the paragraphs though did they talk about that in the paragraph no so they definitely use those things but we're trying to find the information from the paragraph so what other pieces of equipment did they talk about in the paragraph student ,yeah so they talked about a small machine and that was my answer 
210.4,Jazmin,,a small machine will what was the name of the small machine ,oh let me look it says lunar orbiter 
230.1,Luis,,a lunar orbiter does class think that lunar orbiter might be the right answer or might be the piece of equipment that was needed in order to find the water on the moon student why do you think that's the right answer ,um yeah so i totally agree with student here as the space expert in the class and i think it's right because well lunar means moon an orbiter means like it goes around and what you were saying about like the big picture of the whole moon if it's an orbiter it would find the water like on the whole thing and not just on the teeny little pieces under the microscope 
150.1,Farrah,,right very good go ahead student what were you going to say student do you understand ,yeah yeah i was gonna say that does make more sense than it did before but also i just looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping those break this question down into the keywords i'm going to use that next time i have a question like this so thank you 
150.1,Farrah,,you're welcome student it was so nice to see you class have a nice lunch hey class ,hello 
120.4,Oliver,,so student you told me you circled the same answer as student can you remind me which part you and student circled again ,um yeah we both circled the microscope 
110.1,Luis,,the microscope great ,um excuse me i i have something to say 
110.1,Luis,,sure what do you want to say student ,well i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.1,Luis,,you know all about space ,yeah sure do 
110.1,Luis,,yeah i see you have great observations and can we think can we help student and student figure out their answer first ,oh yeah okay 
110.1,Oliver,,sure thank you for your patience so student and student you find out circled the microscope right ,yeah 
230.1,Oliver,,can you tell me more about how the microscope helped the scientists ,um yeah okay so um when they found a water well the ice actually was frozen water it was ice when they found is it was so small it was tiny and they couldn't see it without the microscope so they needed the microscope to be able to see it 
210.2,Oliver,,so you just told me when the scientists found the ice already and then they couldn't see it so our question is what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon which is how they found it at first right ,oh i didn't even realize i said that 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah but you know it so let's dive in a little deeper about what exactly do they first use to find it and then they can use the microscope to see it why do they need to microscope again ,oh because the ice is so small 
110.1,Jazmin,,yes the ice is so small so student you told me that nasa sent a small machine right ,yes so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.1,Jazmin,,i feel you have a great evidence can you tell me more about this machine ,oh yeah let me look okay in the story it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,mm hmm so the name of this machine is lunar orbiter ,lunar orbiter 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah great and what is this machine for ,well it says to investigate so i guess it maybe looks around because that's what investigate means 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah and that's how this little machine the small machine works right ,yeah i guess so so it looks around the moon and somehow i don't really know how but somehow it finds those those microscopic ice deposits 
210.4,Farrah,,student can you help student out what do you think how the lunar orbiter helps to find the little ice deposits ,i'm not really sure i didn't really get that part about the lunar orbiter i guess i was still thinking about the microscope 
210.4,Chris,,why don't we look at it all together right now student can you help us read the sentence about lunar orbiter ,oh yeah i could do that okay so it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small 
150.1,Farrah,,great thank you for reading for us um student do you have more a little more idea about lunar orbiter right now ,so i guess it just it looks in the craters is that right 
210.4,Luis,,yeah it looks into craters why do you think we call it an orbiter student do you know why they call it an orbiter ,yeah i was just gonna jump in because i definitely know this one orbiter means like to go around and so i'm thinking the orbiter goes around the moon 
210.4,Chris,,yeah and we know that the ice are in the polar crater student what do you want to say ,yeah well actually i i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.3,Luis,,great and student talked about the oxygen tanks right ,yeah 
210.3,Luis,,those are all great knowledge or information about scientists and scientists use a lot of different equipments for different purposes right ,yeah like they need the oxygen tanks because they can't go find water on the moon without the oxygen tanks or they couldn't breathe 
210.3,Luis,,so oxygen tanks help the scientists breathe but what exactly helped the scientists find the water ,um well i guess i said oxygen tanks because i was kind of thinking it would help them find the water because it would help them breathe 
130.1,Luis,,yeah that's part of it but there's also right now the small machine that we are thinking about right now right ,right yeah the orbiter 
210.3,Luis,,if we have oxygen but not this small machine the lunar orbiter can we find the ice ,oh no no you can't find it without the orbiter 
110.2,Luis,,and the lunar orbiter is specifically for this purpose right yeah so we need them both ,yeah okay that makes so much sense 
150.1,Luis,,you got it now student ,yeah i got it now i can see why the orbiter is a better answer yeah than the oxygen tanks 
120.4,Chris,,great work and student what did you just tell me about the what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon ,yeah well just listening to what you said to student i see how all the cool stuff at nasa it helps the scientists but it does it do the finding of the water 
110.4,Oliver,,yeah great conclusion student what do you want to add ,um well so actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i want to say this was such a helpful class you really helped us to understand what the lunar orbiter does and why it's exactly the right piece of equipment you were so clear and it was so helpful thank you 
110.4,Farrah,,thank you go have lunch i enjoyed working with you all hi class how are you today ,oh we're great we're really excited to work with you 
140.1,Luis,,i'm excited to work with you too i'm also excited that it's friday and i'm excited that we're talking about space exploration which used to be my favorite topic when i was your age yeah student ,um yeah well i i shouldn't be in this room because i already know all about space 
120.1,Luis,,you know i know you know about space i saw your response about the oxygen tanks which is awesome because you know the thing that stuck out at me when i think about space room i remember when i was your age was thoses gold helmets you remember those like they've got to put a little gold on their helmets and the sunlight doesn't get it they kind of use all sorts of stuff so um you know today we're just going to have a little conversation and yeah i'd love for you to bring in all that outside knowledge because so let's take a look at some of your answers student and we actually started with you um you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks this is it really is one of my favorite topics especially when i was your age is there is there any other equipment you know off the top of your head that they use ,oh there's tons of equipment well they have the oxygen tanks and while they have to have a rocket ship if they're going to make it to space they use all sorts of things in that rocket ship they have to have on the gross astronauts astronaut food there's so much stuff that they use 
210.4,Chris,,i know that food is pretty gross i want to bring you into congress and you should with student because student raised a good point in his answer too he said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon so they used all the that equipment and the eating that terrible food and they they used all that over a course of you know probably many months and they and they somehow found water in those craters which is really exciting because when i was your age we didn't even know that there was water in craters on anywhere i'm curious student do you remember any actual equipment that they use do you remember how they found the water in those craters ,oh well i don't know if i'm a brit from the reading but i i went to nasa and so i i also know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.1,Oliver,,yeah that's great in fact those things i think if i remember right they were like 200 pounds or something but you don't feel it when you're bouncing around on the moon right because the gravity is different well let's talk about farrah's and oliver's response of what they circled because they were talking about microscopes student can you explain a little bit more about that for me ,um yeah okay so when they found the water um well actually what i use and it was really really tiny um and so they couldn't see it with just their eyes they had to see with the microscope 
230.1,Farrah,,mm hmm that's right and student you are you are thinking the same thing right ,yeah so i don't understand why our answer is wrong 
210.4,Farrah,,i don't think your answer is wrong so much as it might be the way i was thinking about so here so i actually just bought my own class mike their first microscopes my wife's a scientist and then we bought them their first microscope and watching them using microscopes they have to take something they already have and put it on the slides and then look and look into have you ever used the microscope before ,yeah we have them in the science lab oh 
230.1,Jazmin,,yeah awesome so i guess what i'm wondering is if you have to use the microscope and you you have that already have something available to put on those slides and so i'm wondering how did they get that water in the first place that actually maybe brings us to student student you said that nasa sent a small machine to go get that water and then maybe that's how they brought it back to use the microscopes or maybe they haven't even gotten to that part yet and do you think student can you explain a little bit more about what you were thinking ,yeah so i read in the story that nasa send a small machine and they used it to go in the craters and find the water well the ice 
120.4,Chris,,that's really interesting i was on the does class have their reading in front of them yeah i want to take a look at that article again that water on the moon article that piece from it says adapted from the new york times that piece you read i want you to go back but i want to see if we can flesh out what jazmin's talking about here this small machine so we've talked about other machines but i think she's thinking about the one that actually like got the water or identified the water so let's all go back to that text and i'm going to give you just a few few seconds maybe 30 seconds and see what you can find see if we can go a little a little deeper okay so see if you can identify that small machine that she's talking about let's get started okay my stopwatch is actually broken but since you're all looking at me i'm gonna assume you're out then student what did you find when you went back to the text to figure out what this small machine was anf and how they actually maybe got that water ,okay so well i looked through the word machine since that's what student was talking about next to that it says lunar orbiter 
210.4,Luis,,a lunar orbiter what are those that's a that's a really big well phrase it's two words but what what is the lunar orbiter what do we think that might mean student ,um yeah so lunar means moon so you class anytime you see the word lunar it means they're talking about the moon and orbiter as like well an orbit is when something goes around something else so i'm thinking as machine those around them 
210.4,Farrah,,i think that is i think that is an excellent definition and that actually makes me think of something different that maybe helps my understanding maybe this machine the small machine this lunar orbiter as student said wasn't actually going into the crater maybe it was just going around the moon but that's a little bit of a problem if it's going around the moon and not actually going in the crater how how does it find the ice it's in the crater student do you have any thoughts on that ,i don't i don't think it explains it in the story it just said the lunar orbiter looks for the deposits in the crater 
120.3,Oliver,,oh yeah you're absolutely right i've seen that line it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in the large polar crater remember polar is like the top and the bottom just kind of like the north pole but you're right it actually doesn't talk about at least in that paragraph how the lunar orbiter works right so i'm wondering i'm wondering at this point i'm i'm wondering let's go back to that question can somebody read the question that we were supposed to answer again student yeah thank you ,um well actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to and valuing all of our answers 
120.3,Luis,,hi class how are you my name is teacher you can use my first name is teacher ,um excuse me teacher yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Oliver,,do i do i'm sure you do you probably know a lot more about space and idea my son is actually named student as well so i feel like we got that connection already what's um i don't know when i was your age i loved space so i was particularly excited to read this article before we get into the nitty gritty i just want to hear your others how are class doing today ,i'm doing good i'm great thanks thanks i i want to say mr teacher thanks teacher 
110.3,Farrah,,yeah you're welcome student how are you yeah ,i'm good to it's pretty good day 
120.3,Chris,,that's good and student it's nice to meet you well let's take a look at the article that we have here again it is on spaces eaten pointed out which i find super exciting student find super exciting i know we had a question to start us off that was i don't know can someone read the question that we were trying to answer before we got in this class ,yeah it was on one equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.2,Chris,,oh great and what do you think are the before we even look at the article again i know you read the article already but before we even look at the article again and start our discussion what do you think are the i don't know maybe two or three keywords in that question things that really got you got you thinking ,oh i figured it was about like discovering and water on the moon 
110.4,Farrah,,and i mean we're talking about the moon right we got to know where we're talking about so it's not all of spaces it's about the moon in particular ours is there maybe one other yes student yeah great so discover's a keyword and waters the keyword ,i think equipments an important word 
110.1,Jazmin,,i agree and student did you want to add to that well ,that's what i was gonna say too 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay awesome so i'm just making a little list here and know if you can see my paper but i'm writing those keywords on the site equipment discover water so who wants to start us off by how they answered this question ,um okay i'll go cuz I don't understand why my answer is wrong. 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay well sure let's let's um once you give me your answer and we'll talk about it ,okay i said nasa send a small machine and i think that's right 
130.1,Jazmin,,you know i think you're i think you're right on track is there if you look at the article do you have the article with you ,ya it's on my tablet 
230.2,Jazmin,,okay good if you look at the article can you point to the spot of the article where it talks about nasa spending excuse me sending not spending sending a small machine ,yeah if the first sentence of the second paragraph where it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.3,Jazmin,,perfect so your answer you wrote down your answer nasa send a small machine if you are going to level that up like a video game if you just want to like little extra boost to your answer how might you get a little bit more clarity there ,more clarity um level it i guess i can add more and more words make it a longer answer 
210.3,Jazmin,,does that machine have a name ,Oh yeah yeah okay I didn't think about that. i could just put the whole sentence down i could say nasa sent a small machine called the orbiter to investigate 
230.3,Farrah,,yeah and you know i think that um you know i wouldn't always put down the whole sentence but i think in this situation that actually works because to investigate kind of answers that question right to to discover water on the moon and then you named it i think that might be that might be that might be a way to to add as i was talking about earlier clarity just to just to make it a little bit i noticed student and it looks like student both of you talked about um do you want to tell me a little bit more about that oh. well i don't know if i'd call it a machine but you you talked about a scientific tool right ,i think it's a machine because it's like a simple machine that has parts to it that work together so i think so yeah i'll go yeah i thought it was the microscope um cuz that's that was the well yeah i don't know if it's a machine either 
210.3,Oliver,,"yeah no i think you know i don't know what the technical definition is of a machine so let's go back to that question again what equipment so we want to make sure our answer has equipment discover and water great what about that discover component, do you think the microscope would help NASA discover the water like actually find it. ",oh yeah i guess not ah i guess not 
210.3,Farrah,,hmm because thinking about jazmin's answer she's talking about lunar orbiter and i'm wondering if what i'd love to hear your thoughts what's the difference between a lunar orbiter and a microscope in terms of what they do for the scientists ,oh well i don't know student so you can i'm just gonna read it 
210.3,Farrah,,"Well, where are you looking right now Farrah. ",um well where jazmin's answer was in the second paragraph there it says the lunar orbiter to investigate land up the moon south pole and look for ice deposits 
230.2,Oliver,,mm hmm that's true and where's student do you remember where the microscope part was ,yeah that's in paragraph three um it's they use the microscope to look at the water 
130.3,Oliver,,"ah the the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you wouldn't need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely You know I i'm glad you caught the tool component, but i'm a little bit concerned that the i'm not sure that they would have the microscope with them, I think they're saying they wouldn't need it. what do you think if if they had it already but in terms of actually finding it the first time i think that might go back to that lunar orbiter idea ",um yeah i i could see that yeah i could see that because maybe they don't they don't have it yet you know i mean i don't know i don't know as much about space as student it done but i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.1,Chris,,yeah that's perfect in fact that that brings us over to eton's point in in student your point about science is finding craters full of moon on the water um let me talk to first talk to you student and i'll get to your point eaten about the oxygen tanks ,yeah 
420.3,Chris,,student when you said in your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon i think you're totally right they did and that's so exciting right um i mean when i was a boy we didn't think there was water on the moon at all but now now we do how do you um what are your thoughts about how the scientists actually found do you remember that part of the article i wonder if you can go back to the article and find me a spot where they're talking about that process of finding ,okay how they found it they found evidence that water can be found craters are dark places nasa sent a small machine you know what i don't know case it says that they send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate right lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposit so i guess i guess the lunar orbiter is what they use to look for the ice deposits i mean i can't tell if they found it or not though 
130.3,Oliver,,huh you know i actually thought that was a little bit strange too i was thinking did they send the lunar orbiter to find the water or after they already found it but the article at least to me wasn't entirely clear which made me think the best answer would be probably the lunar the lunar orbiter because oh hang on just a second student i wanted to talk about luis's note luis's answer on the oxygen tanks totally right ,teacher and i don't mean to interrupt you but it's time for us to go to lunch 
130.3,Oliver,,oh ,oh well yeah we could finish on when we come back from lunch 
130.3,Jazmin,,okay that sounds great thanks for reminding me student ,you're welcome okay see you later teacher can you see us 
130.3,Jazmin,,no unfortunately i can't ,okay let me 
130.3,Jazmin,,oh wait yes i can i'm sorry i was looking in the web browser i'm sorry ,okay hi 
130.3,Jazmin,,hi how was lunch ,it was good we had lasagne and chocolate chip cookies 
130.3,Luis,,oh i like that i love chocolate chip cookies well we don't have a lot of time so let's try to finish this up before the bell rings okay student we were chatting with you so student yeah do you want to start us off yeah ,yeah cuz i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
230.1,Luis,,okay well well what did you figure out a bit curious to hear ,okay cuz i heard you tell him i'm student and and mmm that we have to hit all the words in the question like equipment and discover and water on the moon 
120.4,Luis,,and water on the moon okay i'm go back could you go back to your first answer for me um when you answer that question what was the what how did you first answer it ,i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen thing 
310.1,Luis,,i just want to make sure that you understand why oxygen tanks might not be the best answer for this question can you explain your thinking a little bit yep that's true so you're right in that they do use a lot of equipment and oxygen tanks were mentioned in the text ,okay so it's not right because um equipment discover water the moon because it doesn't hit the discovery part but i got the equipment and the water on the moon i think 
210.3,Luis,,yeah i think you're spot on so how might you change your answer the second time if we could scribble that one out and you could write a new answer what do you think you would say that hits that discover part as well ,um jazmin's answer 
120.4,Jazmin,,oh yeah student what was your answer again ,um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
410.2,Chris,,hmm ok ok i see that um student so we'll pick up on your point student for just a minute on a table that for a moment here so i'm gonna go back to you you were talking about how scientists that scientists did find craters full of water on the moon tell me a little bit more about that because we're gonna make sure our answer touches not only discover water and moon but also equipment and my concern is your answer might not including the equipment component ,what do you want me to tell you 
120.2,Chris,,oh i was wondering if you can tell me a little bit more about how so scientists found craters full of water in the moon ,oh oh yeah um so when i was looking after we talked about it i think it's jazmin's answer too 
420.2,Jazmin,,yeah you see that as well it's a i think let's do this let's take a moment let's take a moment i want you to look at your original answers you all have those in front of you right take a look at your original answers and i want you to see if you can check these boxes off equipment discover water and move ,i'm still kind of confused. 
230.1,Jazmin,,okay what are you confused about student ,well i i thought that i i fixed my answer so now i have everything in it 
120.2,Jazmin,,i think you're right i think you do i just want to make sure that you see all four components in there as well ,okay okay i got equipment discover oh okay 
120.2,Chris,,okay i'll give you another couple seconds class look up when you're done okay i'm not sure if this is possible but can we talked with elbow partners here i'm going to have one class of two and one class of three so student ,uh huh 
130.2,Chris,,student and student can the three of you chat for a minute and share about what you discovered when you looked at your answers and then student and student can you do that as well okay ,oh i oh i usually talk to student and student if that's okay 
130.2,Farrah,,i'm sure that's fine ,okay so um i had class i had equipment know i had to discovering in the waterpark but i didn't have equipment oh well um i had um just equipment crates i didn't really read the whole the whole thing and in my answer that i did i i realized that i had all of the parts but i didn't mention the water okay oh we have we have the same answer so what did you get um ya i had the same thing equipment and water and i guess it wasn't discovered because we there was found in our but i guess i didn't really have find in our answer so did you change your answer um no not yet oh okay well then i didn't i didn't have anything new online either 
130.2,Farrah,,okay you all done ,me and student are 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay great student and student student ,yeah yeah we're done 
120.1,Chris,,okay just humor me just a minute i want you to take one minute i want you to answer the question again so remember the question is what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon go ahead and write your answer down right your new answer down ,you know i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
110.3,Luis,,that it's pretty amazing ,that would be pretty cool 
120.2,Jazmin,,okay go ahead and write your new answers down ,oh okay mine was pretty easy i just had to add one part 
120.2,Chris,,alright student it looks like oh hang on just a second i'm sorry student i didn't mean to interrupt you did you have a question student ,i'm not really sure if i did mine right but i'll wait 
120.2,Farrah,,okay sounds good we'll just wait till everybody's done right student you done now ,ya i'm finished 
120.4,Chris,,excellent student why don't you start us off how would you answer that question now that we've had a chance to explore it a little bit ,okay well i said um scientists found craters for water on the moon with the lunar orbiter 
110.1,Luis,,okay that's that's an answer how about you student what did you say ,i just use jazmin's machine that nasa centers small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the water on the moon 
120.4,Oliver,,okay student and student sorry you know both both kind of speaking same time student let's doyou first and then student ,okay um so i wasn't sure but i heard student and student saying that jazmin's answer was right so i i said um nasa sent the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon 
110.1,Farrah,,okay and how about you student ,oh i said that you need well i kind of cuz i thought that maybe my answer itself was okay so i just scratched out the microscope and put in the lunar orbiter you need a scientific tool called the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon 
130.1,Oliver,,"I think you're on the right track, oh okay here's the new question where will this orbiter land so go ahead and take a moment take a look at the text if you need to then go ahead and write your answers down ",Okay i'm done. 
130.1,Oliver,,okay great class can look up when they're done ,uh oh teacher it's time for us to go to our next class 
130.1,Oliver,,okay thanks for letting me know student is a pleasure working with you ,you too hey i wanted to say that i appreciate how are you i'm you kind of like pointed out like what we needed and then asked us to kind of look back at our enter to figure out what parts we were missing from the question because i think that actually helped me in student cuz i i wasn't sure but then i just kind of matched in my answer the words in the question that we talked about 
130.1,Oliver,,i'm glad you found that helpful student thank you ,yeah okay bye 
130.1,Farrah,,bye how's it going class ,oh it's going well we're really excited to work with you 
150.1,Luis,,awesome it's great to see you class so you class just read that article write about water on the moon student you got a question ,yeah so um i should be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,really okay so why don't you help us out what can you tell us a couple of things that you read in that article that you might have already known ,um okay well so i'm in the article okay well i didn't i didn't really finish the article but i still know the answer to the question because i'm scientists they need oxygen tanks so they're going to go into space so that's definitely what they needed to find the water on the one 
120.4,Chris,,right exactly can class else tell us anything they read in the article ,yes i can 
120.4,Chris,,okay student go ahead ,so i read that scientists the found craters full of water on the moon 
140.1,Oliver,,oh does class know what is water made up of what types of molecules of water made up of class know ,okay yeah i think we learned this i think we learned this in science because we learned that water as an h two o and i know that all is oxygen and the h is hydrogen 
210.4,Jazmin,,yes exactly student awesome job so they found water on the moon right so there's h2o there's hydrogen and there's oxygen on the moon so kind of giving us what what student talked about why do we think that it might be important that these astronauts are these people were able to find h2o or water on the moon yeah of course ,not totally sure but maybe if there's if there's water on the astronauts coudl drink it 
120.4,Farrah,,yeah they could drink it and then like student said there's hydrogen and oxygen right so maybe they can use the oxygen in the water to get some air so that they can breathe right i'm moving on her from student what did you read in the article anything new that we haven't talked about just yet ,yeah so um i read that okay the water is microscopic and so for the equipment i said i said you need a microscope to look at it really closely and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Farrah,,okay so your answer may not that is not necessarily wrong what did we talk about micro or microscopic that mean what does that mean can you explain ,like really really small 
150.1,Jazmin,,really really really small so we do need a special tool and that special tool that we're going to use is going to be a microscope right to look at it really closely and student the reasons why we wanted to in this class so that you can bring your expertise to talk about that microscope for us okay so we thank you we appreciate you for that class else have any other information that they read or anything that they got from the article that they want to share with us ,um yeah so i picked i picked something different from student so i'm wondering because i said nasa send a small machine and i thought that the small machine seemed really important 
230.1,Jazmin,,what did you find important about the small machine ,oh well if said they used it to what was the word investigate 
140.1,Jazmin,,um what are some jobs or what are some for some people that usually investigate that we know ,detectives 
210.4,Chris,,detectives right and so detected they look for things right and so that's pretty much what the what nasa wanted to do they wanted to send this small this small machine so that they can investigate or look around or try to detect things on the moon so that's awesome um class else see anything else about this small machine or why they think it may be important yeah student what you got ,well okay um so actually i i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like student said and masks and suits 
210.4,Chris,,yeah definitely they have to use all those things right why do you class think it's important for them to wear their masks and their suits when they go to outer space ,well the astronauts they need to stay safe and the oxygen tanks and the masks it wouldn't it wouldn't stay alive without those 
210.4,Jazmin,,right because there's a lack of oxygen up in space right and if you don't have oxygen and you won't be able to breathe so it'd be really tough for them to go to outer space and go to the moon if there's no oxygen if they don't have a way to breathe right so that those are some things some really important things that we can get from that article um i'm interested to hear um you know a little bit more about this small machine why do you think maybe any ideas as to why they sent a small machine instead of a really big one ,can i answer 
210.4,Jazmin,,well of course ,um well that's that's the thing i'm i'm i'm wondering if it was just a small machine were there even astronauts there because i don't think the astronauts could fit on a small machine 
140.1,Luis,,yeah that's a really good question so there's so much technology in the world that a lot of times we can go to places without actually physically being there right we've seen cameras and we've seen like drones and other types of technology that we can use to go places that we've never been and actually never have to go there are ourselves you can sit in your living room and explore our space and the moon how cool would that be ,that would be amazing i really want to do that one day 
140.1,Luis,,really student some what where else would you explore that's not outer space or maybe actually yeah let's say an outer space what's another planet that you would explore if you had a really small machine that you could use ,oh well okay um i want to look at jupiter because it's so big and it has that red spot that's like a storm as giant giant hurricane and i really want to look at that 
140.1,Farrah,,oh that's cool student what about you where would you go what planning would you ,well actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch now one i wanted to say thank you so much for really listening and getting to know every one of us and our thoughts and our feelings about space it really felt like you cared about who we are and what we think and that was that made this class really fun 
230.1,Luis,,great i'm glad to have you class and it was great to meet you class have a great lunch alright class so first i want to say thank you for all of your responses and student i was curious with your response i thank you first for providing that response and i love that you use scientific language like saying the word scientific and tool and even saying the word microscope but when we think about the discover the question right what makes you think about or what what pushes you to say microscope with compared to the word discover what kind of lead you there ,um i have something to say 
230.1,Luis,,yes student do you have something real quick ,yeah real quick um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
230.1,Luis,,okay why do you feel that you're not or you shouldn't be in this class because you don't know you already know about space ,yeah um and so i know about my answers right because i already know about space and i don't need your help 
120.4,Luis,,okay what was your answer ,um my answer was scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks 
230.1,Luis,,cool how did those oxygen tanks help them to discover that water ,well i know that if there are scientists up on the moon like astronauts they are definitely 100 using oxygen tanks while they go around discovering that water 
210.3,Luis,,right what why do they want to use those oxygen tanks though ,to breathe of course they can't survive on the moon without them 
120.4,Farrah,,exactly right there's no oxygen for them to breathe on the moon so they need those oxygen tanks so yeah we could say that's one of the tools that's necessary for them to even go to the moon are there any other tools or class else can jump in if you'd like are there any other tools that tou can think about that they might have used outside of their oxygen tanks to help them discover the water yes student ,well yeah and this goes back to the question that you asked me before student interrupted um so well i picked the microscope because they said the water um it's really small and you can't discover something if it's too small to see you need a microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,okay nice nice so what do we use a microscope for ,um to look at stuff that's really small so i don't understand why my answer was wrong 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah so your answer is not necessarily wrong i love again how you use the how you use the word microscope um can you think of like another instance or another time or another example when we use a microscope ,oh yeah well we use them in science class and we put these little slides underneath to look at cells 
150.1,Farrah,,i love that you're bringing in science class i'm sure you class have done some really amazing fun stuff in that class um a lot of times when we use a microscope we want to look at one specific really tight area right well if you think about the moon the moon is like huge right it's full of these craters like student talked about um it's full of these craters that have the water in them right but a lot of times if we try to use a microscope maybe we don't maybe there's too many places for us to look right how do you feel about that ,oh um yeah i guess if an astronaut just had a microscope um it would take them like forever to find the water 
120.4,Chris,,definitely definitely it kind of brings me student um so what did you learn about those craters on the moon ,oh well the scientists the found these craters full of water 
120.2,Chris,,right right do you remember okay i love that you're talking about the water because that's ultimately what we're trying to get to right do you remember and think about maybe going to a family member's house there's a certain way that you get there or can class else help us out they did find these they did find these craters right right how can we discover how can we find these craters that are full of this water what what mechanisms or what machines were really used to help us discover this water on the moon ,um well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
130.2,Jazmin,,yeah definitely student i think you talked about a small machine do you want to add anything here ,yeah um my answer is nasa sent a small machine and i think that's part of what they use to discover the water 
210.4,Jazmin,,right um so yeah nasa they definitely sent the small machine um can we think of the name of that small machine maybe um ,um i think it's in there um let me look ok um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
120.4,Oliver,,can class think of another word that they may know of that has the same meaning as investigate i like that so they sent a lunar orbiter to investigate yeah student ,um well investigate makes me think of like a detective searching for clues 
120.4,Chris,,right student ,yeah i was gonna say find 
120.4,Jazmin,,hmm so investigate right find right are great words student the same thing that you said right all of those had that same kind of kind of meaning right and let's think back to the question that we we were asked what tools did the astronauts use to discover water on the moon so bringing together all the things that we've said how can we kind of piece together what we're saying about the craters student about that small machine student student about the investigators right and student about about the scientific tools about the looking and the searching piece and student about all the equipment that we know that astronauts have to use how can we bring all of that together to then say what truly right what tool was used so that these astronauts could discover this water on the moon what are your ideas student ,ym yeah i can try and put this all together okay so the astronauts went to the moon and of course they had to have all that stuff student and student were talking about oxygen tanks and masks and stuff but to to actually look for the water they used the lunar orbiter and the lunar orbiter helped them find it in the craters and um i think that's class 
110.1,Oliver,,yeah and then adding on to what student was telling us about the microscope right once they kind of figured out okay maybe this is an area right where there's definitely going to be water or we think that there's going to be water then student what do you think they could do once they really find that location where they know that they're really sure that there's probably gonna be some water exactly exactly yeah student go ahead ,um i'm really sorry but um it's time for us to go now 
110.1,Farrah,,awesome no problem thank you class for all your time hello friends how are you class today ,oh oh we're good we're so excited for your class 
150.1,Luis,,yes thank you i'm excited to be here as well so as i was walking around i noticed some responses on your questions and i wanted to work with you class to see if we could delve a little deeper into understanding the concepts yes student ,um yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Luis,,student i am sure you know a lot about space but i was wondering we were looking for the answer to the question what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon and can you go ahead and remind me what did you respond ,oh yeah well i said that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
210.3,Luis,,"okay i like the fact that you're identifying a piece of equipment that's scientists used To see if you could find the answer which we're looking for, which is in regards to what type of equipment they're using to find water Luis do you think that they are using oxygen tanks to help them find water on the moon. ",um well i mean it's not like it's not like they look with oxygen tanks but they need the oxygen tanks to breathe when they're on the mooon 
210.2,Luis,,would you be able to find in the passage somewhere that actually talks about specific equipment that's been used to help find the water on the moon. that's really observant of you i'm wondering if the specific question is looking for more of the equipment that they're using ,um yeah okay um i can go back and look 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay and when you find it go ahead and just circle what you think is important for answering the question student what did you share what did you find as your response to that question ,okay i said nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,student no one ever said your answer was wrong and your answer i would say right now your answer is not wrong but i wonder if we can go a little further i want to see if we can build on your explanation a little bit so a small machine would you be able to know what that machine is called would you happen to know that ,um i think it's in there um nasa sent a machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
120.4,Chris,,okay so i like the way that you went back to the passage and looked more closely to see if you could find more information so there was nothing wrong with your answer before in that it gave us a hint at this point we want to build upon it and make sure that we're being as specific as possible and i love how when you went back you were able to find the actual name of that small machine that they sent so thank you student just go ahead and build upon your answer with some of the information that you found student would you be able to share with us which you were able to locate ,yeah oh so i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
120.3,Chris,,okay thank you for responding student so i'm wants to go back and i think it was to see if we could try to make an inference so student if you can look at the third paragraph and i want you to just would you be able to read for us the first line of the third paragraph student ,okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth okay 
120.3,Chris,,so student actually read the next sentence too ,okay all the water they found is microscopic meaning wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it okay 
210.3,Chris,,so here's the looking at these two sentences and thinking back to what you wrote about the water filling the crater and do you think that based upon the clues that this sentence these sentences gave you do you still think that there is a crater full of water what do you think ,well i guess i pictured that at first when they said water on the moon and i was picturing like big pools and lakes but on that part yeah that part says it's so small you can't even see it so i guess i guess what i pictured wasn't quite in 
310.1,Chris,,and you know sometimes we do that when we're reading text and that's really great when we're visualizing it's always important to go back to the passage and check the words and make sure they match what we're picturing in our minds i'm so glad that you were using your visualization skills student so make sure you go back and revise some of your thinking that you did there okay ,yeah i also i can really picture it because i went to nasa and i found out that that scientists use all lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.3,Oliver,,student can you share what you how you respond to that question thank you so much for sharing this sounds like you're a nasa expert will probably come back to you and get some more information whenever we're looking for some of your expertise thank you student ,okay um well i i circled the same as student which was the microscope i think it was a microscope to look really closely about about little water at student was just reading about 
410.2,Oliver,,yeah so student it's so important in this space for us to know that class is doing their own thinking and i know that you have such a valuable thinking to offer in this space and so when you mentioned that you'd circled the same as student it makes me wonder so student would you be able to tell me what evidence from the text led you to believe that they used a microscope to find the underwater i'm concerned you looked at farrah's answer and i don't think that's the case but i want to make sure you're doing your own thinking ,yeah okay well i'm really that was the part that student just read aloud where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely it's like the next sentence right after what student read 
120.3,Farrah,,mm hmm okay so this is actually perfect for both you student and student since you had very similar answers i want us to think very carefully about what question with the question is being asked to us what is the question that we're trying to find the answer to student ,oh i'm so sorry i really i really want to keep going but we have to go to lunch now yeah i'm so sorry because this class is so fun and i just wanted to say thank you so much because you really paid attention to every single one of our answers and it was like you could understand why we said that and you could also help us see the right answer so thank you so much for teaching us today 
120.4,Luis,,thank you student and up so encouraging alright friends you class can enjoy your lunch it was great working with you by simulation alright so where we able to find anything else from the question that helps us to see if we were going in the right direction with our answer student noticed that in the passage is didn't mention astronauts and so student go ahead and share it you're about to share ,um yeah well i think i thought that's all figured out now so i'm good 
530.1,Luis,,ok so student do you want to share your new thinking what has changed in your thinking ,okay well i thought there were astronauts um but now i know there are the astronauts and so it has to be a different equipment and the ones that they say and what story are the small machine i'm a microscope so now i think those are the answers 
130.2,Jazmin,,okay so it's possible that it's one of those two pieces of equipment they thank you for sharing your thinking class else were you able to see even from hearing what student shared and even from going back into the passage we can we identify some other words from the actual passage that might give us some clues as to what the what a good response would be yes student yeah ,i found a sentence and and it's the beginning of paragraph two and it's actually the same one i found originally so it didn't change but it's nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and that's what i said before and nasa sent a small machine 
430.2,Jazmin,,i was concerned that when you set the answer before it wasn't painting the full picture of what the small machine was so student is there a way that you can take what you just read and enhance your answer so that it paints a more fuller picture ,well the whole sentence says nasa center small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so i could use the whole sentence 
430.2,Farrah,,absolutely you could possibly add a little more information as a way of enhancing your answer Farrah yes. ,i'm still kind of confused 
230.1,Farrah,,okay student can you help me what is your confusion is it the question is it's understanding the question or the more about looking for the response ,yeah about the response because it sounds like you said jazmin's answer is the right answer but i don't understand why 
230.1,Farrah,,ah good question okay so if we look back at the question and i'm going to just going to share something with you all really briefly oh sorry i don't have screen share right i was just going to share with you why you ,can describe it to us 
110.1,Jazmin,,"In this context, it looks like the specific question you guys identified some verbs you identified the verb to discover, and there was also this word about equipment used to discover so. in this context it seems like we should be zoning our eyes into the the reading and looking specifically for a tool or a piece of equipment that's used to do some kind of discovering and so then in the case of what student shared she spoke about the lunar orbiter does class know what is called know the lunar rover i think ",yeah that's what it says in the story 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay yeah sorry the lunar orbiter is that the robot that searched on the planet can you read that whole section again for me ,nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposit in a large polar crater 
210.4,Luis,,thank you i was getting confused with the mars rover there's some noise okay so in ,the mars rover was so cool 
130.3,Farrah,,yes thank you so if you see with her response what we're looking for is an actual piece of equipment that did the discovery and can you see how jazmin's the lunar rover the lunar orbiter was the equipment that did the discovery can you see that now and the response ,um okay so yeah it said that the orbiter looks for the deposits but the microscope you need to look at the deposits 
210.3,Farrah,,absolutely student i guess i want to ask you did the scientists take my microscope up into space ,as well he then said there's no astronauts so no 
210.3,Chris,,no so did they use their microscopes to discover the water or is a more of once the water is found then we can say oh it's a microscopic amount what would you say ,yeah yeah that's beginning to that makes more sense now because they can't use the microscope if there's no astronauts to look through it yeah I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024. 
420.2,Chris,,okay thank you for sharing that student now i would love for you to share with me is there any way that you want to change your answer anything else you want to add to your response to make it more compelling ,okay well um so we've been talking about equipment on this whole time so i should probably put equipment in my answer 
420.2,Oliver,,I think it's a good idea to use some of the language of the question in your response and then definitely the zone in on piece of equipment found in the in your answer. ,yeah okay um so originally i was thinking um you put it find something if you don't see it so you need a microscope cuz you can't find something you can't see but now i'm thinking that the lunar orbiter can find it and then the scientists look at it through the microscope like later 
310.1,Oliver,,i think that the progression by which you identify those events was very clear and it may painted such a clear picture for others so thank you for restating that so friends ,now all we have to go to lunch after lunch time but i want to say thank you for taking the time to really listen to each one of us and why we were confused and help each one of us figure out how to move forward with a better answer it really felt like you cared about everybody's thinking thank you so much 
120.3,Luis,,thank you thank you for being a great class i'll see you class later alright so thank you so much for those responses thank you for the hard work that you put in in in writing those responses so what i want class to do is i want you to read the question one more time okay we oh student you have a question go ahead ,um yeah well i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.3,Luis,,but can you actually read the question out loud for me can you read the question ,yeah um okay what he did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
150.1,Luis,,great and there's a second part to that question that says circle do you see that part ,um oh okay yeah there are this circle the evidence and the text where oh that we can use to answer this question 
310.1,Luis,,but did you do that second part where you circled information in the text awesome so i saw in your answer student that you did a great job identifying evidence identifying equipment that scientists use to reach the moon ,i'm not really um but i guess i'd caught up circle the word scientists because if there are scientists on the moon they have oxygen tanks 
430.3,Luis,,"But that's keeping you from seeing what's really in the text too, so can you look through one more time and see if you can circle any words that that are words for equipment in the text. ",okay yeah i can do that 
420.3,Jazmin,,awesome thank you student use that strong background knowledge you have to find those equipment words now student i have a question for you Can you look back in the text and see if you can find some specific vocabulary for me. ,oh ok ok nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,awesome what did you find in that sentence ,lunar orbiter and investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,investigate very nicely done so what um what is lunar orbiter what is a lunar orbiter ,oh well i guess it's a machine 
210.3,Jazmin,,yeah so do you think adding lunar orbiter to your answer could make your answer even stronger ,yeah i guess so 
230.1,Jazmin,,tell me why ,well i i picked a machine because it sounded like the word equipment but maybe if i say lunar orbiter and it's a better answer because it's the name of the machine 
230.3,Farrah,,i love that exactly right if we just a machine that it's kinda like the question it's just saying equipment right but if we bring that name in it tells us specifically great job student really good work now student can you talk to me oh yes student go ahead ,yeah well i was kind of hoping i could go next because now that student went i'm kind of confused i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah great question and student i really want you to pay close attention to what's student and i are talking about and i'd like you to jump into because you had the same answer as student okay ,okay 
120.3,Oliver,,awesome thank you so let's take a look which one of you would like to read the question again out loud for me ,i can do it um okay equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question 
210.2,Oliver,,alright so what is it really asking for what information does it want to know ,um equipment 
130.2,Farrah,,equipment and what else student can you help out what kind of equipment does it want to know about ,okay equipment for discovering water 
110.1,Farrah,,yes equipment for discovering water there's one more piece to that ,um 
130.2,Chris,,student do you want to jump in how about student and student what's it asking for it's asking for equipment for discovering water what else is it asking for ,oh oh circle evidence in the text 
210.2,Chris,,look for those little clues in the text in the question that's true what kind of equipment or what kind of equipment that scientists use to discover water are we looking for are we looking for equipment that we can use or equipment that we did use ,oh did did did scientists use 
110.1,Farrah,,um can you read that part in the text out loud for me great john student awesome teamwork class so let's go back to the text student and student you circled the part about the microscope ,yeah okay you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Farrah,,great so what was that part of the text telling us ,that you can't see the water without a microscope 
210.3,Farrah,,yes you can't see the water out of microscope exactly right does it say that scientists did use that equipment to discover it on the moon ,i guess i thought that's what it meant but now that you mentioned it it doesn't exactly say that 
310.1,Chris,,i love that critical thinking student i love looking back at your answer like that awesome so let's as a class go back to the text and i'd like you to yes student ,well i just wanted to share i went to nasa so i know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like student said but also masks and suits 
120.3,Chris,,"But what was that second part of the question, can you read the second part of the question, Chris ",circle the evidence in the text we can use to answer this question 
210.3,Chris,,yeah so are looking to bring in our answer from outside information for when you went to visit nasa or are we looking somewhere else for our answer ,oh so it needs to be from the story 
420.3,Farrah,,exactly student awesome job so i'm going to go back and check in with student about what he's working on will the three of you look through this text and see if you can find one more piece of equipment that the text talks about ,okay 
120.4,Luis,,awesome thank you hey student how's your search going ,i'm i'm okay at work really well but um i just i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch right now I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space. 
230.2,Farrah,,so i'm really going to value your opinion student i actually chose all of you because i think all of your insights are very valuable and i really want to hear a lot more about what you're thinking that's so great to hear that we have people here that are interested in space can i have somebody tell me where in the text they figured out how to answer this question about equipment student ,okay so i figured it out from paragraph three 
230.2,Farrah,,okay and do you have a specific sentence ,yes so i circled the part where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
110.1,Chris,,all right thank you so much for sharing that student did i see you raise your hand student ,yeah i found my answer in the first paragraph 
230.2,Chris,,okay and were you looking at a specific sentence ,mm hmm yeah so where it says on scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar readers 
150.1,Jazmin,,can i have a volunteer to read this question out loud please all right thank you so much so what i wanted i want us to do today is to take a step back from the text and take a really close look at the question that we're answering ,i can read it 
150.1,Jazmin,,thank you student okay ,what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
210.2,Oliver,,all right great job so based on the question that student just read out to us what should our answer be what is this question looking for is it looking for a person is it looking for a place what kind of answer do we need to give to answer this question death ,it needs to be a thing 
230.1,Oliver,,it does need to be a thing and what made you say that ,the questions asks what equipment i'm i'm so um you know your need to find an equipment to answer that question 
210.2,Farrah,,great so we know that we're looking for a piece of equipment to answer this question now the next question that i want us to ask right we've just asked what kind of answer do we need now we're going to ask ourselves is there anything else in this question that helps us know what we should be looking for so def has identified that we are looking for a piece of equipment does this question say anything else about what we should be looking for student ,on it it also says the equipment to discover water 
110.4,Jazmin,,okay equipment to discover water and student ,and yes i was going to say the same thing is also that i i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.2,Jazmin,,okay so let's talk about this student your answer was that nasa sent a small machine right and i think we can all agree that a small machine is a type of equipment right but as you and student also pointed out is that this question is asked me for a piece of equipment and then also a piece of equipment that discovered water on the moon and so one thing that i am missing from your answer is ,Ok so I have to say NASA sent a small machine to discover water on the moon. 
210.4,Chris,,well that would certainly be helpful right but what we're going to do next is we've asked ourselves the question what this question is looking for we've asked ourselves what other information and the question can help us find our answer the third thing we want to do is go back to the text so we know that we're looking for a piece of equipment that was used to discover water on the moon and i want us to take a minute and go through and find a sentence that answers a piece of equipment and equipment that specifically was hughes to discover water on the moon student do you have a question ,so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.2,Chris,,that is absolutely true our scientists are using a lot of equipment which is why it's going to be kind of tricky for us to just narrow it down right because this this article talks about so many pieces of equipment so what we're going to try and do is look for the piece of equipment that talks about being used to discover water specifically right ,okay one to discover the water specifically 
120.2,Farrah,,yes all right i'm going to give you all 10 more seconds to read over and then let's come back and discuss if we think we've found a sentence that has a piece of equipment that talks about being used to discover water student ,on well i would still say the same sentence i said before you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look directly at it 
210.2,Farrah,,you know i think that's a great point student can i ask you a question okay so in your answer you're talking about a piece of equipment right this is great you've identified a microscope and you say that the microscope helps the scientists look really closely and i want to remind us that we are trying to find an answer that talks about discovering water so do we think that looking at water and discovering water are the same are they different ,oh i can see how they might be a little different 
210.2,Oliver,,okay student ,look it's time for us to go right now but thank you so much for teaching us today 
230.3,Luis,,thank you alright class i think that we had just discovered a really valuable piece of information about savannas answer we had determined that microscopes help us look at things which is not quite the same as discovering or looking for something student can you help me oh ,yeah well i think i got this all figured out so i'm 
230.2,Luis,,great can you show me the sentence that you found in the text that we were looking for that made you feel so confident ,as well okay i gotta say it's not from the text but you'll have to discover and oxygen tanks because if there's astronauts on the loan they are using oxygen tanks when they discover the water 
120.4,Jazmin,,So I know that we spent some time looking at the questions right looking at the sentences and the text Can somebody give me a sentence that stuck out to them that they think answers this question. student ,okay nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
230.1,Jazmin,,and what made you pick this particular sentence student ,well it's the same sentence i picked before but i picked it because it has the word machine which is equipment and investigate which kind of reminds me of discover a little bit 
120.4,Oliver,,all right what do we think do we think that investigating is a similar kind of thing to discovering all right i'm seeing some nods so i think we're really onto something here and i agree i think this is a phenomenal sentence to us to answer our question can somebody tell me the two things that this sentence have that our question is looking for student ,and i got this it has an equipment because it sounds small machine and that has a word like discover 
230.3,Farrah,,great yes so we have found a sentence that answers both parts of our question right it gives us a piece of equipment the scientists are using and it's telling us that this equipment is used to discover things it's used to investigate to look for something student ,okay i'm still kind of confused 
230.1,Farrah,,can you tell me why you're confused ,i understand the lunar orbiter on because it's a machine to investigate that makes sense but i still think there's evidence in the text on that it could also be the microscope because that sentence has any equipment and it has a word like look for which is like discover 
210.4,Farrah,,"The one thing that I want to point out here is that our question is asking for something that helped discover water, which means that before they use the equipment they didn't have the water. right they didn't know where it was now in order for us to use a microscope do we if we're using it to look at the water do we already have the water ",oh well yeah in science class we have to put the slide under the microscope and then we look at it 
210.3,Farrah,,okay so we need the water already if we're going to use the microscope so do we think that the microscope has discovered the water ,oh oh no you can't put it under the microscope if you haven't discovered it 
310.1,Chris,,that's a great point student so thank you for pointing out why it can be kind of tricky to answer questions like this right they're asking for two different things we're seeing a lot of really similar words but i think we all did a great job really breaking down with this question with asking us for and finding a great sentence that helps us answer this question i'm student do you have a question i ,mean it's it's a comment related to the story i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
120.4,Luis,,that's really fascinating and makes me think that maybe sometime later we should have a discussion about all the things that we've heard about water on the moon but i want to stick with what we're talking about before for a little bit because i know that we answered two questions and so we've done a really great job going over the answers to the first question and i want us to move on to the second question and before we do that can somebody tell me a strategy that we can use well answering the second question student ,okay i'm gonna go with actually reading the story 
230.3,Jazmin,,this is a great start we need to read the text right because we're looking for a sentence student ,and okay so a strategy for this new question i would say is to really look at the words in the question and find the words that tell you what the user needs to be 
420.1,Oliver,,"this is a great point student so even though we've only discussed So what I want us to do is take a minute look at Question two right is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable and I want us to do, the first part. of the strategy that we just did with question one and pick out the words in the question that tell us what we should be looking for ",and i'm so sorry and i just looked up a clock and we we have to go to lunch right now but i want to test say thank you for teaching us this new strategy because using the words in the question like really understanding what discover matt and i'm looking for a sentence with what like similar words i really do think that's going to help us answer question to why don't we get to it after lunch 
150.1,Luis,,well thank you so much for spending time with me and i hope you have a great lunch time hello class i'm your teacher and i'm excited to talk to you today meet for a little bit to discuss what we all just read from water on the moon which is pretty exciting hi yes student you have a question ,yeah um excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
210.4,Chris,,oh well that's really that's helpful but the reason we're in this class is i wanted to explore a little more deeply i'm really interested in what you understand about this article overall right and how how the whole process works i thought we could peak to that a little bit and talk about that that story from from what you read what if you told me a story about how how they how the scientists at nasa figured out that there is water on the moon which is super exciting what would you tell me if you just were like explaining it to your friend or to a sibling or to your parents based on what you read what happened to lead them to that discovery yes student ,okay oh it's it's so cool okay so we used to think nasa used to think that the moon was totally dry and like a desert but actually the scientists they found these craters full of water on the moon 
230.3,Farrah,,so the exciting thing and i am equally as excited about this happening and they just figured this out a little bit ago that yes they did find that there's water on the moon but he only found very miniscule amounts of water and they did you're right they did find that in the craters that there's water on the moon but he only found very miniscule amounts of water and they did you're right they did find that in the craters on the dark side of the moon the part of the moon that doesn't see the sun right but it wasn't lots of water it wasn't like the kind of water you go swimming in it would it would be something that you view with a microscope student you mentioned a microscope right ,oh yes yes that was my answer i said i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,so you're right in that they did use they did use a microscope but the way that the text that we're looking at the water on the moon which is from an article in the newspaper right from new york times when they said microscope right they didn't use the microscope up in space right but what they were using the microscope is when they when they collected it and analyzed it it was the size what they use to look at it was microscopic does that makes sense when they said microscope right they didn't use the microscope up in space right but what they were using the microscope is when they when they collected it and analyzed it it was the size but they didn't send a microscope up to space okay did class get it does class know what they sent up in space to figure it out to analyze all this student ,yes and i said nasa sent a small machine 
140.1,Jazmin,,they sent up a satellite with this orbiter that orbits the moon to analyze that hydrogen that they had found right and hydrogen is part of h2o you heard people talk about h2o ,yes yes we have 
210.4,Luis,,okay so they had they found that hmm there's there's some h two of those there's hydrogen up there and maybe it's part of water h2o and that would be exciting right because if there's water you know that that might be exciting for continued exploration on the moon and have access to water right you all drink water every day right so maybe in your site yes water is a big part of who you are okay the story is that when when the satellite went up there they decided to take part of their rocket and crashed into the moon into a crater and then a big plume do you know what a plume is the big billow of ,yeah it's like it's like you know after an explosion and it goes oh there's that big that big that big lined up big thing of smoke that goes up into the air that's like a plume 
210.4,Chris,,right so they they hypothesized but if we send this we send a rocket and create a plume then we can send our we can send some instruments through to analyze to see if there's h2o to see if there's water and that's exactly what did happen so pretty exciting yes student ,well so i went to nasa and i know that the scientists they they have to use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like student said and and masks and suits 
120.2,Chris,,"they have a satellite go up right to do all of this. When we are talking about what what equipment they specifically used right to to discover water on them on the moon, so, if you look at the text that you have. let me just see something here You know the astronauts need oxygen but that wasn't in this text so Chris you're good and i'm excited that you went to NASA. ",so cool 
210.4,Oliver,,so all right so we have to student you shared with us and you talked a little bit and student student okay so my what i was wondering is if we now we went back to answer that question right what equipment did did did scientists use to discover water on the moon and you can you can you see the text right now student do you look at the can class see the tax that i'm talking about ,yeah yeah we have it here on our tablets but i just wanted to say i looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say the way that you told us that story about how they use the equipment and space that really helped me understand the answer that it was the lunar orbiter and that they didn't just send a little microscope up to that great big moon and and the story really helped me understand that so thank you so much 
120.2,Luis,,okay here we go okay we can start the simulation hey class we're back from our break and right before break you all were looking through your text i hope you can still remember what you were doing and you were trying to find the answer to that first question each of you individually which was the the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon and is student pointed out oh sorry about student yes ,okay yeah i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
230.3,Jazmin,,okay great so would you like to share with the with the class what you found what text you found to answer that question that would be super helpful so um student was saying that she thought she had the right answer and you were saying yes she did not the right answer but she needs to be more specific so i just looked at her sentence ,so the name of it's the lunar orbiter then 
110.1,Luis,,that's great so that was good that as as a class you know we could build on jazmin's answer right and find that so what i want you to what i want you to think about right now right is how we how we ultimately will get to that answer a little more easily so as you're reading it through by yourselves what kinds of things that you can do to to arrive at that answer right so student can you think about for a minute how we could start if we wanted to answer this question and you get an assignment lots of times you're gonna have assignments where you have to answer questions which a good place to start to find the right answer to a question ,to answer from something you read well this time i just started with jazmin's answer and then i used to find the right answer 
120.3,Jazmin,,right so that was a good lead student so thank you what i'm going to suggest to all of you is when you start the first thing you do before you start reading is to actually look closely at the question right so can we can one of you read the question out loud for me i'll read the question that's great ,what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon 
420.1,Farrah,,right so if we you know before you're starting take a minute and what words might you circle in the question that when you start reading could help prompt you to find that answer to that specific what would those be those important words in the question it can lead you to the right answer and it's like a like a treasure hunt right so what if you could take a second and circle the words in the question that you'd be looking for ,oh yeah i'm still kind of confused 
230.1,Farrah,,yeah and what are you confused about okay cuz i ,did that like i use that strategy of looking at the words in the question i looked at equipment and discover in water and in the paragraph where student said it i don't see discover or water 
130.3,Farrah,,oh yeah true that's good um so you're going to try to be making some connections to investigate right ,yeah i saw that one 
120.4,Farrah,,right does that make sense so i guess the other strategy that you're going to want to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking and then you're trying to make some connections between the concepts that you're reading investigators is the same thing as discover right right so they've got them the small small machine so that's a really good question student and let's see i'm trying to think what you said about make connections on right ,is it like on like inference our teacher does say talk about inferences 
420.3,Chris,,right so if you're going to if you want to make some inferences if they're talking about investigating then you might want to go back up to the to the paragraph before it so let's see if you can look in that first paragraph to find this phrase that would help you make that connection between what the lunar orbiter is investigating from the previous paragraph okay uh huh ,and teacher i've heard that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024 
110.3,Chris,,that's pretty soon from now exactly and so why part in ,it's only a few years from now 
210.1,Chris,,that is really soon and that's why they that's why we're reading about this and why it was so important so if we're going to have a moon base right that's why we're trying to figure out what they sent right so that they could discover this water student and you find something yeah okay ,so in the first paragraph you're talking about how there was there there was water on the moon and now they think that there is water 
210.4,Chris,,right so that it kind of establishes that what they're trying to investigate and find right is the water ,okay yeah yeah yeah i understand that 
520.1,Chris,,does that make sense so what i want you to think about is if if in the future you had a had to answer some questions how what did you learn right what did you take away from this process of making inferences and making connections what did you learn about that you might be able to apply the next time you encounter a question like this ,yeah there were two things that you you told us to do one was to go back to the question and look for the words in the question 
120.1,Chris,,right and ,and find those words in the answer and then um um but then student was like but i didn't see the words so then you said we should go to the paragraph before and try to read that paragraph to try to understand the next one 
150.1,Oliver,,sure and to get some context for if you are you've got the question you understand that and then to understand the context from that can help you make some inferences you want to read a little bit more closely for the meaning of the the material before it does that make sense student yeah yeah okay yeah ,yeah i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch i wanted to say thank you for explaining what what we need to work on because you you when you're talking to student and student on tv i gave me some ideas on how i can improve my answer to so thank you 
150.1,Oliver,,excellent well thank you for being here ,bye 
150.1,Luis,,bye good morning class i guess it's afternoon now so you've all just shared your answers with me and they were awesome answers i think we can do a little bit better so we're going to push our thinking today yeah student i see you raise your hand what can i help you with student ,um yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
220.1,Luis,,yeah student your answer really showed me that you have a lot of background knowledge but this is not about background knowledge or even knowing about space what we're working on today is we're practicing using text to support our answers so our class is going to learn how to use text as evidence so that's why we're here today student ,oh okay that makes sense 
510.1,Farrah,,yeah so this is a really important skill for scientists we need to be able to look at a text and use quotes or information from the text to support our answers ,oh 
150.1,Farrah,,look everybody's ready ,i can go 
120.4,Farrah,,yeah student let's start with you thank you for volunteering ,yeah so i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.2,Farrah,,what paragraph from the text did you get your answer from ,um i found it in part three 
230.1,Farrah,,that's awesome student can you tell me what the scientists were looking at with the microscope ,and yeah so they were looking at the ice deposits the really small pieces of ice 
120.4,Jazmin,,did class else have a different tool that the scientists used yeah awesome so one of the tools that the scientist used to look at the microscopic water was a microscope that's awesome student yeah student why don't you go ahead and share your answer ,okay so i said my answer was nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
110.2,Jazmin,,which paragraph from the text did you get your answer from so your answer is not wrong student ,i found it in part two 
210.4,Jazmin,,awesome so student can you tell me what the small machine was called ,oh yeah okay it says this isn't a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
210.4,Jazmin,,awesome so this small machine was called the lunar orbiter student what did nasa do with that machine ,they used it to investigate 
210.4,Chris,,yeah does class know what investigate means ,oh yeah i do 
120.4,Chris,,yeah student go ahead and share with us ,so investigate is when you sort of look around for something in particular are sort of like a detective might investigate a certain place for like clues and stuff 
130.2,Chris,,yeah awesome student and that's exactly what investigate means so nasa used the lunar orbiter to look around the moon for water all right does class else have any other ideas about tools that nasa might have used ,yeah i do 
130.2,Chris,,yeah go ahead student ,okay so well actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like student said but also masks and suits 
230.2,Chris,,yeah that's awesome so is that information in our text anywhere student ,um no not really but i saw them all when i went to nasa so i know they use them We have to pick the equipment from the story. 
120.4,Oliver,,yeah from the story that we read exactly student student i haven't heard from you yet do you think we've found all of the equipment that they used in this text ,yeah well i think we did but i'm still a little confused about why it's my not the microscope like why that isn't exactly the right answer because i was sort of thinking how can you discover something if you can't even see it yeah i mean i guess i guess they use that small machine but i still think that microscope is the right answer 
110.2,Oliver,,yeah so student you're exactly right there's more than one right answer here so savannas answer about the microscope was correct and jazmin's answer about the lunar orbiter was correct ,oh ok so we could say either one That's party cool. 
120.3,Luis,,yeah so we've used evidence from paragraph to hand paragraph three let's take another look at paragraph one and see if there's any other information there that we can use does someone want to read paragraph one out loud for us ,yeah i do 
120.3,Luis,,yeah thanks student go ahead and read paragraph one for us ,okay it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moons polar craters and these craters are dark places where the sun never shines 
210.4,Farrah,,thank you student so student i haven't heard your voice in a while student does paragraph one talk about any tools or equipment that the scientists used ,oh no no 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah exactly right so only in paragraph two or three is any equipment mentioned all right yeah student i see you're raising your hand ,yeah i'm really sorry but i just looked at the clock and actually we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us make sure that our answers were based on evidence from the text and finding evidence from each different paragraph that i think is going to be really helpful next time we have to do a question like this so thank you so much 
210.4,Bennett,,yeah thank you class for your hard work today that was awesome ,welcome back how did that feel 
210.4,Farrah,,okay hello class ,hi hello 
210.4,Luis,,okay so um you all just shared your responses yes student ,i'm excuse me i should have been and this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,well i'm glad you know a lot about space and it would be really nice if you could contribute some of that expertise to our class conversation ,yeah okay i can do that 
150.1,Farrah,,awesome sounds good okay so before we begin does class have any questions about why their answer may not have been exactly correct yes student ,well i'm not sure why my answer is wrong because well i found the piece of equipment that they used to discover the water 
120.4,Oliver,,okay so you identified a piece of equipment right and i like that you started off with that i want you all to reread the prompt and i want you to circle the most important word in the prompt so just take a minute and go ahead and do that is class finished okay who wants to share what word they circled in the prompt yes ,so i picked equipment 
110.1,Jazmin,,okay good student what did you pick ,i chose discover 
210.2,Jazmin,,discover that's also a good word so something i want to share with all of you is all of your almost all of your responses had something to do with equipment and student you're right in that we're talking about the equipment used to discover so um what i want you to do is go back in the text and i want you to think about equipment and what equipment was used to discover what we talked about Jazmin. ,why my answer is wrong because i said nasa sent a small machine and i think that's the machine to discover so why is my answer wrong i don't understand 
150.1,Jazmin,,so we just talked about how equipment and discover are two very important words but what i want you to do is identified the specific piece of equipment that they used does that make sense ,oh the small machine 
430.2,Jazmin,,so can we as a class look at our text so there are small machines mentioned but the machines have my concern is that the machine has a specific name and that we need to uncover that does that make sense so my suggestions are that you go back in the text and you identify that specific piece of a quick ,i can go look for the name 
120.2,Luis,,okay and revise our responses so yes let's all read and see if we can come up with that specific piece of equipment alright is class ready okay has class revised their response yes student ,um okay so i said at first i said oxygen tanks on but now i also want to add on the lunar orbiter which is the thing that student was talking about so i think my answer is scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and the lunar orbiter 
110.1,Farrah,,okay does class else have a response thank you student yes student ,well i know you said that we had to look for the name of the machine so i'm guessing that that's the lunar orbiter but i still don't understand why it's not the microscope 
230.1,Farrah,,okay um so could you explain a little bit more about why you're choosing the microscope over the lunar orbiter ,yeah so it says the water they found is microscopic and so you can't see something that's microscopic unless you have a microscope so you can't discover it if you can't see it 
150.1,Farrah,,"so what lets the scientists know that the water is there I OK, I see how that makes a lot of sense does that make sense go ahead ",well i guess if that's what the lunar orbiter does but i didn't know that that's what it does 
110.1,Chris,,okay um so let's hear from one other person and then we can talk more about your concern is that okay all right student ,well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.4,Chris,,yes well i'm glad you're able to connect that personal experience what did you end up revising your response to the initial prompt though ,oh oh okay well at first i didn't say any equipment what it sounds like that's really important because it's a it's a keyword like you said so now i said on my answer is the small machine called a lunar orbiter 
210.3,Oliver,,okay so let's go back to the vantage point and let's think about this so student you say that you still think that the microscope is the most important part right yes okay so let's think for one moment just in our heads what does it mean to make something the initial discovery of something and then after you thought and you have a good solid thought let's share what does that mean student ,oh well really like to share but it's actually time for us to go now 
150.1,Luis,,okay alright class so it seems like we all have sort of different answers to this question right now so i want us to take a step back and look back at the text and the question to see if we can all come to an understanding yes student ,i'm excuse me i shut me in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Farrah,,well i hopefully you can use what you know about space to answer the question but i want us to think what exactly is the question asking us and maybe use some of what we already know about space to answer the question so the first thing that i want us to do we're going to look back at actually what the question is asking us so initially i gave you the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon i want you each to take 30 seconds and just think about what are other words that might mean the same thing as equipment so what might be a synonym a word that means the same thing as equipment i'm going to give you 30 minutes 30 seconds right now to just jot down some notes write down some notes about what might be a word that means the same thing as equipment okay go ahead and do that now okay so who can tell me one of the words that they thought of that means the same thing as equipment class have a word that they wrote down okay savana what what where did you write down ,okay so i thought a word that meant the same thing as equipment with the tool 
230.3,Farrah,,tool that's a good one yeah so tool a tool can mean the same thing as equipment for sure nice job student and student i saw your hand went up what's a word that you thought might be the same thing as equipment ,okay well it's not one word but equipment is like a thing that you use to complete a job 
120.4,Jazmin,,yeah something you use to complete a job and that's really almost like savannas tool right it's a tool something that we use to complete a job so two different ways of saying equipment there class else let's have one more person share what's another word for equipment student ,oh well this word is actually from the story and it's machine and that was part of my answer nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer was wrong 
120.4,Oliver,,so a machine is another word for equipment that's a great word for what might be a equipment machine right and if you think about that student that's very similar to what's being said with tool and almost the same thing as student said with a thing that we use to complete a task or job so just to remind class for equipment we have a tool a thing we use to complete a job and also a machine so lots of different ways to think about equipment i want us now to spend the same amount of time thinking about what the second half of the question is which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so we're going to spend another 30 seconds doing the same thing with the word discover okay so spend 30 seconds writing down other words that might mean the same thing as discover okay go ahead and do that now alright it looks like you're all done why don't we get three words that you all wrote down that have to do with discover so to someone want to volunteer word that they wrote down that has the same thing as discover student why don't we hear from you first ,what did you discover for that i said find 
230.3,Luis,,find that's a really good one right if you're discovering something you're finding it nice thanks and then student i saw your hand go up what did you come up with student ,um yeah well i also thought find but i think what's really important is you're finding it for the first time no one else found it before 
230.3,Chris,,one more word that someone wrote down for discover class have another idea here yeah that's a very good point it's for the first time so you're finding it for the first time good thanks student in depth those are really good words to point up student ,oh well i don't know if this one is really good but when you discover something it's like you uncover it like it was hidden and then you uncover it 
230.3,Chris,,yeah that could be interesting it's hidden maybe you can't find it you're not able to see it or you don't know if it's there and you uncover it that's very good yes ,yeah can i share one more thing 
230.3,Chris,,yes of course student go ahead ,yeah so i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
420.3,Oliver,,yeah yeah scientists do need to use a lot of equipment or tools or machines to find and uncover things and here's in brings up a good point that that's exactly what our question is asking us for and what we want to learn from this text what tools are the scientists okay so i want you all right now to go back to the text and just underline any tools or machines or any equipment that you see in either of those three paragraphs okay student do you have a question at nasa using to find water how did they uncover water on the moon ,um yeah well that's not a question on i just looked up a clock around we actually have to go to lunch right now i'm so sorry because i really want to do the next part of this activity and i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand the question so well i think i might do that same thing next time what writing down similar words that was really helpful thank you 
150.1,Luis,,thanks and i hope you will enjoy your lunch class and i hope to see you all again soon alright class so it's so interesting to hear all of your responses because it sounds like i'm hearing a few different things you know the more class seems to have a different response yeah student have a question ,yeah well i'm i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Luis,,really what did what was your response to this question can you just remind me ,yeah um well i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
230.1,Luis,,and how do we oxygen take specifically help us find water on the moon ,yeah well so if there's astronauts there's no way they can find the water on the moon if they don't have oxygen tanks to breathe 
110.2,Farrah,,how about the rest of you did what did we say for this question that we'd like to share with the rest of the class that's really great point yes ,okay well i said actually that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.2,Farrah,,oh awesome and then what paragraph did you find that piece of evidence and ,okay i found it in part three 
230.2,Farrah,,oh awesome he found it in part three can you read that sentence do you have it circle in your app ,yeah ok so the part i circled is okay the water you they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope 
110.1,Chris,,awesome great love that detail that you're using how about let's hear from somebody else class else want to share out there and to our class student ,okay well so i said that scientists the phone creators full of water on the moon 
230.3,Chris,,like full of like water that we're drinking so like the water in my water bottle ,yeah well that's sort of how i pictured it yeah cuz creators they're so big and it's like i was picturing sort of like lakes and pools of water 
230.2,Chris,,oh that'd be really cool to find where did you find that in the text ,on okay so in part it's right at the beginning so it says scientists have found evidence that can be found deep within the moon's creator 
110.1,Jazmin,,oh yeah that's really interesting student do you want to quickly share what you have said ,yes so i said that nasa centers small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,um let's unpack that a bit so what is the small machine do ,investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,what is it investigating for what are we looking for and ,the water well actually ice ice deposits in the craters 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah that's a really great detail you found so student based off of that evidence are we swimming and large bodies of water what are we looking for ,whoa whoa okay it sounds like it's not really how i pictured it may be 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah so it might not be like full bodies of water but we have ice right and what does ice made out of ,water 
210.4,Jazmin,,exactly so that's the kind of water we're looking for ,that make sense 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah and then student quick quick update with you what part of the reading did you find that in oh that's interesting so we have equipment both in part two and part three so what does that mean how many pieces of equipment are we looking at ,oh i think there's two pieces of equipment 
130.1,Jazmin,,yeah that's a really great point so for each of you what i'm noticing is that like we may have spoken about one piece of equipment or maybe the other one let's think about how we could you know circle both the civic equipment and not only that but also think about what each piece of equipment is doing for us ,um yeah well i'm still not totally sure because i know me and student we were thinking about the microscope because if the ice is so small how are you going to find it if you can't even see ya so that's why we thought it would be just on my periscope because you need to see it and the first place 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah that's a really good point so we know that we're using the microscope once we know that there's water right but in order to find the location with the water what are we using ,oh so maybe the machine does 
210.4,Chris,,exactly so we start with the machine let's go ahead and look for that ice and then we're like oh look this looks like this weird substance kind of looks like something we find and then what student ,oh well okay so it sounds like they use that machine and that finds where is the ice and then they look at it with a microscope and also i went to nasa actually so i know that scientists they they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Luis,,yeah exactly so we take that ice right we take we find the water particles and we want to use that in the future so that we can go to the moon and we could stay there long periods of time and and student going back to you and how you know so much about space and all that what do we need for oxygen takes two people to be brief what do we do that ,well the oxygen tanks that's why we use them 
210.4,Luis,,yet so we use the oxygen tanks and then what is water made out of made up of ,oh i know that's one s h two o 
210.4,Luis,,and what does the a stamp or what is the o stands for ,hydrogen and oxygen 
210.4,Luis,,great so we will eventually use the water deposits and hopefully make that into the oxygen tank so that we can go to the moon and stay there ,um i was sorry i i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i just wanted to say i really appreciated how you found a way that each of our answers could fit together but also helped us understand what each piece of equipment dead that was really helpful and learning from each other you made that so easy thank you so much 
150.1,Luis,,enjoy your lunch start simulation alright class thanks for joining me and thanks for letting me look at your work alright so i'm noticing a lot of different responses and i want us to make sure that we have just a general understanding of the text so class has really good specific details and different questions yeah even ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
140.1,Luis,,yeah i noticed that you have very specific details on oxygen tanks which is really cool did you just know do you just like to read about this on your own ,well i watch youtube and i watched nova sometime so yeah you know about equipment that scientists use of space 
150.1,Luis,,awesome i love that you spend time to learn about science outside of class that's really impressive but i want us to look back at this question and we're going to debrief as a whole class and then i want you to think about how the advice that i'm giving the whole class applies to your question does that sound good ,okay 
120.4,Farrah,,all right back to the question at hand class i want us when we're unpacking a question to look at specific details of what we're looking for so if you're looking at the question we have what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question so we need to make sure that we identify a specific piece of equipment that scientists used and then the equipment is used to discover water on the moon amen so look at your response and then think about like does your the response that you wrote answer both of those two things so when we're answering this we want to name the equipment and we want to make sure that it's used to find the water take about 30 seconds alright let's debrief do you think that your response has both of those parts ,okay mine has the equipment but not the second part the second part but not the first part i have both of the parts so i don't understand why my interest wrong 
120.4,Luis,,"oh really great point student student with yours specifically i noticed that you did a really good job naming a piece of equipment and then telling me what it does i want you to focus on the key action word in the question so a microscope is a piece of equipment that does something but does it discover so think about that piece of feedback and see how it applies to your work Of the question so look back at the text to fill in that gap that you had missing, you have a really great start. how about you student ",i'm okay i guess i have that first part two because i got equipment but i don't have anything about the water in the mon 
210.4,Luis,,alright so you have the word equipment but let's take it one step further what specific piece of equipment is being used ,the oxygen tanks 
210.4,Luis,,all right what is the oxygen tank being used for ,to breathe 
210.3,Luis,,right and is that what we're looking for is a ,lot of equipment that scientists used to just go over water um i guess not because now i guess 
310.1,Luis,,so go back to the text and try to find the piece of equipment that specifically discovered water on the moon right so glad that you were able to pick that up and go back to the question and read it and notice that mismatch between your answer in the question ,okay 
310.1,Farrah,,yes student ,okay um so i think that the the my the microscope doesn't discover the water but i don't see discover in the in the story 
310.1,Farrah,,so you're saying we know we need to discover something so maybe it's a good i like that you're looking for that keyword right ,oh oh teacher you're frozen can you see me and hear me teacher oh i'm class are we frozen or is a teacher frozen on i think the teachers frozen yeah i think the teachers frozen yeah i don't know if she can hear us maybe somebody should try to write in the chat box okay i'm gonna write in the chat box oh nevermind to vanish student she's gone okay yeah oh she's back okay um i don't remember what i was saying no oh 
210.2,Farrah,,yeah sorry about that let me remind you so what is another word that means the same thing as discover ,oh um find 
420.3,Chris,,think about that general idea and see if you could go back into the text and find something that's similar so words that are like discover but not necessarily discover ,so i found the equipment because student told me what it was but i was thinking you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.2,Jazmin,,yeah they do use a lot of equipment for many different things but once again thinking back to the question itself what do we want the specific equipment to do exactly ,okay um so then so i just have to add the water on the moon part for mine case i have the equipment so i can say nasa send to small machine to discover water on the moon 
210.3,Jazmin,,i think that is a great response but i know that you could go even one step beyond right so just by what do you think would make your response one bit higher so you tell me the equipment ,and i told you i said what was discovered and i said the were on the moon 
230.1,Jazmin,,what was your what ,and i said the who 
210.4,Jazmin,,the small machine what is this machine ,lunar orbiter 
110.1,Jazmin,,there you go ,ok 
110.1,Oliver,,ok so i'll just add that part in okay ,excuse me teacher yeah i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so um thanks for taking time to work with us 
230.1,Luis,,yeah of course thank you start simulation alright class thanks for sharing your responses with the class i'm noticing some things right i'm noticing that we each sort of have different answers and i have a question to you why do you think we each have different answers ,class we are all different people with different ideas i mean i shouldn't even be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,do you like like space do you like to you know all about space so cool work with it outside of class ,wow i mean i i watch a youtube video was a lot about the space and i'm and i follow you on musk on twitter 
120.4,Jazmin,,"love you on musk such a card all right let's come back to this question up front right so class sort of has different answers and class has really good parts of answers and some parts that we can work on so i want to give you a strategy that i think would be really helpful for us to like make our responses more concise and find out what we're looking for So what I want you to do is first find the most important word in the question, but the question is asking you for you to answer it. All right, what do you think was the most important question or the most important word that the question was asking you. ",i said equipment i said equipment to 
120.4,Chris,,awesome student what did you say ,i said discover water 
150.1,Farrah,,oh awesome class pulled out really interesting words but i want to highlight student student and student i think class were spot on with the word equipment because that's what we're looking for right we want to make sure we include a piece of equipment and then student to go to yours i think that's also a keyword because that's telling us the action that the equipment is doing so we need a piece of equipment that's going to discover and to pull it all together student we need to discover water right so in our response we're going to look for a piece of equipment that specifically us to discover water so now that we know exactly what we want to find yes ma'am ,yeah excuse me i have all those so i don't understand why my answers wrong 
210.3,Farrah,,ooh really great detail with your student i loved how you did all those three steps right you told me here's a piece of equipment this is what it does now question to you does what i want you to look for right so you pulled out the word of discover does your piece of equipment discover water or does it do something else is it just one equipment to find it are we using it to discover it think about that ,it looks really closely looks really closely 
420.2,Chris,,i want you to look back in the text and see if you could find another piece of equipment that's more closely tied to discovering that water and then for the rest of us look back at your response and then see if you have those three things did you name a piece of equipment and does that piece of equipment discover the water on the moon so take 30 seconds back in your work and see if that does that ,okay so yeah i didn't have equipment in mind but i do know cuz i went to nasa that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks and suits 
110.3,Chris,,let's think back to the question right what do we specifically want our equipment to do alright so they definitely use a lot of equipment and it's so cool that you've gone to nasa that's amazing ,and to discover the water 
210.3,Chris,,exactly so in your response did you name an equipment that discovers water ,no i forgot to put that part in 
120.3,Chris,,all right go ahead and look backward in the text what about the rest of us ,i forgot to put the discovering water part but i did put the equipment in my answer 
420.2,Jazmin,,hi student with your response it did say that you include a piece of equipment but i think it could be more specific right i think you could go back to the text and tell me the specific name of the piece of equipment that you're talking about ,okay oh it's the lunar orbiter 
420.2,Jazmin,,exactly so always more into adding those key details but make sure that you update that information and then add the part that you said you were missing ,so i can just add in call it a lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon and then this is a good answer is it right 
420.2,Jazmin,,yep and then of course because we're amazing students you want to make sure that the last thing we do is always explain our why and in this case i'm asking you to highlight where you find that in the text so just make sure that you're highlighting that okay ,like in paragraph two i just have to add that right I found it in paragraph two. 
110.1,Oliver,,awesome ok ok ,i'm teacher i looked at the clock out it's time for us to go to lunch um but i do want to say thank you for explaining what strategies we can use to try and and have more full answers because i was listening and now i kind of know that we can add more evidence from the text in our answer and thanks for taking the time that i'm explaining that strategy bye bye 
110.1,Farrah,,hi class good morning my name is teacher and i'll be your teacher today ,hi teacher nice to see you 
110.1,Chris,,nice to see you too student hi student ,morning 
110.1,Jazmin,,good morning good morning student good morning student ,hello good morning 
110.1,Luis,,good morning student ,um so um i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,maybe even could could we get started looking at your your answer and maybe we can work together to try to see if that worked with the text and we can all learn from each other how's that sound that's great you must read a lot about space you must learn a lot about it ,that sounds great yeah let's do it 
230.1,Luis,,okay um so student your answer was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right okay so it sounds like where did you learn that fact ,oh well anytime that there are scientists out in space they need to have oxygen tanks that's just like basic space stuff 
230.1,Luis,,oh and why do they need the oxygen tank ,oh well typically you can't breathe in space without an oxygen tank 
120.3,Luis,,that's true okay so that's a very interesting fact i'm wondering could you read the question that we wanted to answer out loud for class ,um yeah okay so it asked what equipment did scients use to discover water on the moon 
120.3,Luis,,and the next part of the question ,um it says okay circle circle the evidence and the text that we can use to answer this question 
210.2,Luis,,okay so the question is asking us about discovering water on the moon and where are we going to find the answer ,i'm in that text 
210.3,Luis,,and the text right was the oxygen tank information in the text or was that from from all your knowledge you already have ,oh i guess it doesn't say oxygen tanks but it says scientists so if they're scientists there's oxygen tanks 
150.1,Luis,,okay okay well that's it that is good that there's oxygen tanks but to discover this water they're going to need more than oxygen tanks right probably going to need more so okay i'm wondering if we can maybe move to another student and let's try to see some of their answers and how we can get closer to the answer in the text sound good student ,um yeah yeah okay 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay great and if you have anything to add in about your background knowledge we'd love to hear it okay alright so let's move on um let's see uh student can you read what your answer was please ,okay so i said yes i said nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.2,Jazmin,,so student was that answer directly from the text first ,yeah yeah it's it's in part two 
420.2,Jazmin,,part two great thanks for referencing us all to the text so class look take a look at your text right paragraph two right nasa send a small machine it's in the text right you're exactly right student great job connecting directly from the text so this is what we're looking for when we mean finding directly from the text i am wondering if we could get more specific student right so small machine i can think of a lot of small machines right maybe a washing machine right like do you think they used a washing machine to find this right so can we get more specific to help us have a better knowledge base here do you think that maybe there's more information in the text around that section to help us get specific ,okay it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay is there a name of the specific machine there that you found student ,lunar orbiter 
420.2,Jazmin,,okay great so can we all see how that gets more specific and now we know some specific science vocabulary right so that would be something you want to add to your response so just extend that circle student and i think that would be a much clearer response ,yeah that makes sense no washing machine 
120.4,Chris,,no washing machine but i mean i don't know how they wash their clothes but that that would be a different different text right okay let's move on so um student could you please read your response out loud ,okay so i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
120.3,Chris,,okay so very good so this is about you found the part in the text right about them locating the craters and that's the location right that's where was this water right but let's go back to the question can you maybe the first few words of that first question there please ,what equipment do scientists use 
210.2,Chris,,okay good so if there's a question about maybe where or what is it asking us really ,okay it's asking what equipment 
210.3,Chris,,yeah what equipment okay and did your answer have anything about the equipment in it ,no but but i went to nasa actually i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks but also have masks and suits 
210.4,Farrah,,that's right yeah so just like student was saying there's a lot of equipment when you're out in space but the question right is about the purpose there's a specific kind of equipment right that the equipment what are the equipment help them do does class have that in the in the question what was this equipment helping them to do student yeah ,i'm to discover water on the moon 
210.2,Farrah,,okay to discover right discover when i discover something right did i know where it was before that ,no um i think when you discover something it's like for the first time 
210.2,Oliver,,okay for the first time right and is it always obvious like oh i know exactly where that is no yeah student something to add ,um well i just looked at the clock and unfortunately it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to each answer on and helping each person all back to the question and understand what they needed to work on you were so specific and helpful thank you so much 
210.2,Farrah,,you're welcome i look forward to seeing you all again soon ,hello hi how are you 
210.2,Farrah,,hi i'm good thank you how are you ,we're great we're so excited to work with you today 
150.1,Luis,,i'm excited too so um did you all read the text about water on the moon ,um yeah we all read it but i i don't think i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
140.1,Luis,,so could you please tell us what do you know about space and why do you think it's interesting ,oh well space is so cool because it's so mysterious like how big is the universe we don't even know we just know we have our planet and we have the milky way but the world could be the universe could be enormous and there could even be life out there 
120.3,Luis,,yeah definitely definitely agree so the universe is so mysterious and there is very large space for us to explore so um do you know what is our question for today ,um yeah it is it's right here it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
120.4,Chris,,yeah what equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon so could class tell me how do you think about this question so what's your answer to this student ,oh yeah okay well i can go so my answer is that scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
230.2,Chris,,oh scientists found craters full of water on the moon yeah so could you please tell me more like about how you figure dthat out so where did you find that information in this text ,yeah so i think that was what the first part part one it says in the very first sentence actually scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters 
120.1,Chris,,yeah yeah i agree that scientists did find some evidence that there was water on the moon but do you think that the crater the craters are full of water so did you have any other thoughts about it if we just look at this paragraph especially the second sentence ,i guess i was i was picturing the really big craters and um like pools or lakes of water because craters are really big right 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah yeah definitely okay so if we can look at the second if we can look at the fourth sentence this lunar orbiter looks for ice the deposits in a large polar crater so what do you think is this ice deposits refer to student ,okay well it says so the ice deposits are like the water actually it's frozen water because it's ice and that's that's the water they found and um actually student i think it says it's really small it's microscopic yeah that's why that's why we picked our answer me and student we said you'd need the microscope to find the water so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah just like what student just the said like the scientists did use the microscope to yeah we did see this word microscope in this paragraph like in the lesson is you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely however if we take a look a sentence earlier like the water they found is microscopic so here the word microscopic could you please use another word to replace it so what which word would you use student ,i would say tiny 
130.2,Jazmin,,tiny yeah that's great so microscopic here means tiny so what does this mean is that the water that we can find currently on the moon is really tiny it's really limited it doesn't mean that we use the tool named the microscope to find it but the water we find is very microscopic which means it is very limited and tiny so if we take a step further to see what kind of equipment scientists use to find water which other answers can you get from this paragraph student ,oh well okay i said that nasa sent a small machine 
130.2,Chris,,machine so oh student ,i wanted to add to that because i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.3,Luis,,but class read it out to the whole class student could you please read it for us the first sentence but here in this paragraph they just name one so what is the one equipment if you look at the first sentence wow that's so cool so they have a lot of equipments as you have mentioned yeah ,um in part one or part two 
110.3,Luis,,part one ,okay um scientists have found evidence of water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters 
120.3,Luis,,yeah and um could you also please read for us the first sentence of part two ,okay okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah thank you that's great so here we saw the name of a lunar orbiter so could class tell me what is a lunar orbiter here in this paragraph so what is this function ,oh i think i can i can do it 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah please go ahead ,it well it says investigate and that means to to search for something and to try and look for it so i think that the machine is finding where on the moon the water is 
120.4,Oliver,,so here if we go back to the question what kind of equipment scientists used to find water on the moon so what is our answer yeah this is a really good answer so the machine is used to find where on the moon the water is and student could you please tell us ,yeah yeah well so um it sounds like the right answer is actually the lunar orbiter and i i'm so sorry to do this um but i looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch but before we go i wanted to say the way you helped us understand what we were um the way you helped us understand what we didn't understand was really helpful because you explained that microscopic didn't mean they had to use a microscope and you helped us find the right machine in the text so thank you for being so clear with how to use the text 
120.4,Farrah,,oh thank you all thank you for your active participation so yeah so the class is over and you can go for your lunch bye ,hello 
420.1,Luis,,hi hi class so glad to see you and a very glad to see that you've all contributed valuable thinking towards answering this comprehension question so today what we will do is to probe into this comprehension question and to have a classroom discussion so what we are going to do first is to work individually and then we will go into free discussion and some elbow exchange and will also give personalized feedback during this process and finally we will reflect on the strategies and thoughts that led us to the revised response so what i want to do now is to circle one or two no more than three keywords and phrases that you think the most important in this question so remember it should be something that leads you to your response so let's take a few minutes to do that ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
420.1,Luis,,"But I will suggest that how about we for now we focus more on the text itself and, like to circle, the key word that you think is the most important in this question and then we can see how your prior knowledge in the universe can help us answer this question better. ",okay i'll take a look 
420.1,Chris,,okay that's great ,i think we're ready 
120.4,Oliver,,great okay so tell me about the word phrase that you just circled student ,i picked up from the question the word equipment 
120.4,Oliver,,equipment whoa that's really great okay so on student could you please read for me your answer ,yeah okay well i forgot the same answer as student that is um microscope 
130.2,Jazmin,,oh microscope okay i'm okay so then i have another question for you so that you have a really good observation that equipment is really a keyword in this question so could anyone tell me what is the action in this question. student ,oh i have my hand raised 
130.2,Jazmin,,oh sorry go go ahead please ,okay um yeah it's student i picked the action that's why i raised my hand and the action and the question is discover and so my answer was about the small machine and and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
430.2,Jazmin,,"okay student i noticed that yeah so first of all you on finding up the keyword discover is really great you notice that it is about the equipment that NASA used, but I also suggest you to be more specific, to do that why don't you take a closer look at the text. and the paragraphs from where you extracted your answer so you should just like give the name of the machine and to be more specific okay ",yeah um it's called the moon let me find it on lunar orbiter 
150.1,Chris,,lunar orbiter whoa that's really great yeah it's the name of the equipment so um did class have a different answer from student i noticed that student and student then they also named the equipment but a different one so could class like to have a dialogue about that ,yeah um i i have an idea 
120.4,Chris,,yeah let's go ahead ,okay well um so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
430.2,Chris,,well so as you just said about yourself you're really an expert in this and i really appreciate that you um that you used your past knowledge to answer this question and i really would encourage you to explore it in more depth it is your field of interest however if you focus on the text more closely student you can find that the tax not really mentioned the thing in your answer so the oxygen machine and in other words you should like make your answer more aligned with what the text is exactly talking about right so could you please tell me the name of the machine that appeared in this text ,well i gues it's what student said maybe 
130.3,Chris,,the lunar orbiter right ,yeah that wasn't the story 
230.1,Farrah,,okay so you just me you come up with the answer lunar orbiter but i also noticed the other people who had different answers so for those who have different from lunar orbiter could you please tell me how you come up with that answer ,yeah i'm oh this is student so i found my answer in part three in paragraph three where they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.2,Farrah,,so student could you please tell me that in the sentences were in the lines that you found a word microscope where did it specify the function of microscope ,"Who, I really want to keep going but it's time for us to go. "
120.3,Luis,,okay then we will have a discuss later after we come back all right you all gave such great responses to this question now i just want us to all take a look back at the question i'm going to read it and if you could just follow along yes student ,up yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.4,Chris,,that's amazing i'm so glad that you're bringing in your background knowledge but we are just going back over this question we want to get as much out of this text as possible even if you already know all about space they're still lots that we can learn from this passage i promise so if we could all just look at the question i'm going to read it if you could follow along what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question can class circle one word in the question that you think is the most important word to focus on when answering it all right would class like to share what were they circled student ,so that i circled is all water 
110.1,Jazmin,,water great okay that's a great idea student ,okay well i circled discover 
130.2,Farrah,,great another great keyword did class circle something different student ,yeah actually i circled of equipment 
210.3,Farrah,,which i think is an awesome keyword because although discover and water are also great keywords equipment that's interesting okay so student circled equipment and equipment is the thing the object that we're focusing on to try to find evidence for in the passage so let's talk about what student said before she said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's a great point a microscope is a great scientific tool but did they use a microscope to find the water on the moon ,oh well i guess i was thinking yes because how can you find something if you can't see it 
110.1,Jazmin,,um what else could they have used i think that somebody else yes student well that's fair yeah that's definitely fair okay ,um yeah so my answer was that nasa center small machine head so i don't understand why my answers room 
110.2,Jazmin,,and it doesn't have to be student somebody else can help her out if you want just find the line in the text that says that nasa sent a small machine can you tell me where in the text you see the word small machine it's not wrong they definitely did use a small machine ,and i can i can tell you where i found it i found it in part to the beginning of part two 
110.2,Jazmin,,great so it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate that's an awesome answer student i think maybe to make it a little bit more detailed you can include the name of the small machine and did you circle that sentence in the text and that definitely is part of the equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon ,oh no i just circled small machine 
230.2,Oliver,,okay great so that's almost there i think if you had circled that whole sentence and they investigated the lunar orbiter and then if we put that together with savannas answer about the microscope both of those two tools together would be exactly what they used to discover water on the moon student what you circle you said you circle the same thing as student can you tell me exactly which part of the text you circled ,oh yeah well i just supposed to work on my scope i'm i'm still a little confused about why the small machine is there um because i thought it was just a microscope and i don't think i want to pick small machine 
130.2,Luis,,yeah that's fair does class have have some input for student as to why the small machine is also important student ,okay so student the machine is called a lunar orbiter and so the orbiter it i'm excited to where the water is because a microscope a microscope is really small like depth can you picture astronaut walking around the big giant mode like a tiny little less that would take 
150.1,Oliver,,that's a really good point anything i think that's a great explanation does that make sense ,yeah so what they did use a microscope at some point right 
130.2,Chris,,absolutely student do you want to clarify that ,well i was just going to add since we're talking about all the equipment that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah that's super true actually even said something about that in his answer didn't he that scientists use a lot of equipment including oxygen tanks which is totally right but remember how we circled we did circle equipment but we also circled the world's water and discover so we're looking for pieces of equipment So Oliver are you still wondering about the microscope can we explain that a little better. ,are so um yeah i'm still wondering about when they use it 
130.2,Oliver,,yeah does class know when they use it based on the text we can look in part three ,so 
210.4,Jazmin,,well let's see the water they found is microscopic you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so let's see if we can make an inference who can tell me what influences does class know what the differences yeah go ahead student ,i'm so sorry for himself when he described it this when when the text makes you think of something but it's not on the page 
210.4,Oliver,,that's exactly right so an inference is when we use the clues that the text is giving us to come up with something that we think to be true but that's not necessarily written there that was great student so if we know that first they use the lunar orbiter to investigate and find those ice deposits they found the water in those craters just like student said in his response and then those water particles were so small that you would need a microscope to see them when would they use that microscope ,oh um maybe like after after the lunar orbiter 
210.4,Oliver,,absolutely i think you're exactly right to the end i'm no expert on space exploration but i think that from the text we can make an inference that says first they go with the lunar lunar orbiter and then they go in with the microscope yes ,um well i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i'm going to say thank you so much for helping us use the keywords to answer the question and also understanding how to make an inference about the best answer i feel like i learned a lot even in just a few minutes thank you 
110.1,Luis,,thank you class so much enjoy your lunch hello friends thank you so much for revising your responses to the question what equipment did scientists us to discover water on the moon so student student and student thank you for sharing your revised responses um does class want oh yes student ,um yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already corrected my answer 
150.1,Luis,,well we are working towards the fullest most correct answers to this question possible together so we're going to try to help each other as a class come to responses that completely answered the question does that sound okay ,um yeah i guess okay 
530.1,Luis,,great so student now that you're participating already would you mind telling me what you're thinking was when you went back to try to revise your response ,yeah sure so my first answer once about oxygen tanks which i'm well i still kind of think that's true but you have to use evidence from this story for this question so then i found the equipment and the story which is the machine 
310.1,Jazmin,,great that's awesome I really appreciate how you went back to the text and found evidence to include in your answer. student ,yes um i found more evidence in the text when i revise my answer because it wasn't it didn't have enough information from the text i needed more evidence to make it clearer 
310.1,Farrah,,okay so looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a great strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely is there anything else did class do anything different when they were revising their answer that's a great point student ,um well okay i would say i did that too but what i did more was i reread the question 
230.1,Farrah,,that's a great point student when you read that question did you circle keywords or underline things what was your strategy there ,yeah i looked more at the word discover 
210.2,Farrah,,great discover what's another important word in the question that we might want to focus on to make sure we're answering it completely ,equipment equipment and discover yeah that's how i changed my answer 
110.1,Oliver,,and so i'm savannas answer was scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon do we think that answer the questions completely student that's great ,um yeah i change my answer too 
120.4,Oliver,,that's awesome do you want to tell me your revised answer ,yeah um i cricled lunar orbiter same thing as student 
120.4,Chris,,great and lunar orbiter is the piece of equipment that's one of the keywords we circled in the question right i would like class to take out and it's the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon so i think that's a great full answer student and student that's awesome a piece of paper or you can use your ipads right in front of you and think about these questions and write down your answers silently for about 30 seconds so we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies the next time we come across a question like this first you're going to answer i started out thinking blank then you're going to answer and now i think blank because blank go ahead and take 30 seconds to answer those questions so next time you see a question asking about a text what will you do alright would class like to share what they wrote for those questions student go ahead ,well first i was wondering is my new answer okay 
230.2,Chris,,absolutely so let's go over your new answer the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic so what did you do when you went back to the text to find this answer what was your strategy ,when i read the text again like a really carefully on and that's how i found out the water was microscopic which is kind of near the end of the story and i think when i read it the first time i really focused on the beginning of the story 
230.3,Chris,,okay great i appreciate how you were looking at the whole story in a really detailed way to pick out that evidence just like student was picking out that evidence and so was student student and student so what else did we do do you remember when we were talking before about farrah's strategy what else did student do to make sure that she was answering the question completely we went back to the text and we looked for evidence right what else did we look back at to make sure that we were answering ,the question 
210.2,Luis,,was yes absolutely okay so we picked up some important keywords in that question right does class want to talk about those keywords again who's got a keyword for me student ,student it's equipment and also discover 
110.4,Chris,,yup student do you think there are any other words in the question that you would circle in addition to those equipment and discover or two great words ,yeah i was thinking water 
420.2,Chris,,water great okay so equipment discover and water so keeping in mind those keywords and using that evidence from the text can you look at your revised answer and make sure that you answered the question completely ,equipment discover water my answer does not have equipment 
420.2,Chris,,great i love how you're reflecting on the keywords in that question and you realize that you were missing a little part of the question there so you can use that strategy we're already using to go back and look at that evidence in the text and then revise your answer to make it a little bit more complete and address every part of the question does that sound good ,yeah yeah 
420.2,Oliver,,great yes def ,and i'm really sorry i wish we could keep going but we have to go now it's time for us to go 
150.1,Luis,,all right well thank you class so much thanks for rising your answers hi class i'm so excited to meet you my name is teacher and i'm excited to be here so we're talking about this article about water on the moon right yeah student ,um yeah excuse me um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
210.2,Jazmin,,oh yeah that's great um so student i'm glad you're here because we're gonna be talking a lot about space this is not a class for people that don't know about space this is a class for people that are excited to learn more about space but i have a question for you so we're talking about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon does class know what the word equipment is or do we want to talk about that a little bit more does class know what the word equipment is yeah student what do you know about the word equipment ,equipment is like a tool or like something you use to do something 
210.2,Jazmin,,yeah exactly so i brought a few examples so if you were a baker some equipment that you might use would be a whisk and if you were an artist maybe some equipment you would use would be a marker so equipment is a tool that you use to do your job and if you were a scientist you would be using some equipment to help you discover water on the moon right ,yeah 
120.4,Farrah,,so we're thinking about what tools or what equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon so student can you remind me what your answer was what did what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon ,okay so i said that you'd need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely 
120.4,Oliver,,oh ok and then student can you tell me what you said as your as your answer ,yeah i circled the same as student 
210.4,Farrah,,okay so you would also use a microscope so you're right you're both right that a microscope is a tool that scientists use to help them look closer at things but i'm wondering student could you read out loud the second paragraph that starts with nasa in the moon is a desert and student while while she's reading could you listen for what tool they talk about that helps them discover water ,okay 
210.4,Farrah,,well or we could all so we could all look for what tool nasa uses to help discover okay go ahead student ,part two okay it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small 
210.4,Oliver,,excellent student thank you so much so student what what kind of tool were they using there they were they were looking for water what were they doing what were they using ,in that part they talked about the lunar orbiter i guess 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah so this is something that yeah go ahead student ,yeah well with with what student just said that was actually my answer i said that nasa sent a small machine and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
130.1,Jazmin,,oh your answer is not wrong they did send a small machine so that's equipment that they would use ,Red. 
210.3,Chris,,yeah and what is it are there any other words you would use to describe this marker ,i would say it's like a thin marker 
210.3,Jazmin,,yeah do you um yeah so those are some details that you can use to describe things so we know that nasa sent a small machine but what kind of small machine was it do we know what kind of small machine because like my my mouse right here is also a small machine but i don't think that they sent this kind of small machine what kind of small machine did they send ,well it says i don't know what it looks like or anything but it says it's a lunar orbiter right that's what student read 
310.1,Chris,,yeah a lunar orbiter yeah so that's the name of it that's getting more specific and more into the details that the the writer used student is there anything else oh student yeah do you have a question ,yeah well it's more of a comment actually so i i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.3,Chris,,that's true yeah and so i wonder if do you think that they're using those when they're using the small machine when they're do you think that they're wearing their oxygen masks and wearing the suits ,yeah well they would have to to stay alive on the moon 
210.4,Chris,,oh right right so i wonder student if they're if they're wearing all those things and they're using their lunar orbiter then what how did they use the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon i wonder if you could i wonder if you could read the the second sentence in paragraph two ,yeah i can do that oh it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
210.4,Chris,,ooh so we're building our details of what this orbiter could look like and we're kind of even if we don't know what a lunar orbiter is we're kind of making some guesses right so what do you think it's a small we know it's a small machine and student what else do we know about it now ,um it can go deep into the crater to find the ice 
210.4,Luis,,yeah what do you think what kind of guesses do you have for what it's using to get into the into the crater yeah student ,um well i think it's kind of like a robot and so it can kind of like go around well it's called an orbiter and so that means it goes around the moon and so i think probably they're using like some kind of signal maybe and they scan the moon like a scanner for water maybe i don't know that's what i think 
310.1,Oliver,,yeah these are such good guesses right and that's a great way to use what you already know about the word orbiter to understand what a lunar orbiter is ,i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock. and it's time for us to go to lunch but before we go i wanted to say thank you so much for really helping us look at and find and think about the details about the lunar orbiter that really helped and finding the most specific answer for the question 
420.3,Luis,,great thank you for having me hi class okay so we're going to keep talking about equipment and i want you to look back at the text and circle the equipment that you found that nasa used we're looking at the part two the second paragraph i want you to look for one piece of equipment in just that paragraph and circle it yeah student what's your question ,um i think i got this all figured out now so i'm good 
120.4,Luis,,oh could you student could you tell me what piece of equipment you circled in part two ,um well i mean you said that okay equipment as like a lots of things because they said equipment not piece of equipment so i figured you could say everything like lunar orbiter microscope oxygen tanks yep 
120.4,Luis,,oops i think student you told me you're helping me realize i need to change my question here which is in this in part two we're looking for one piece of equipment so go ahead and circle one piece of equipment in paragraph number two did class hear that we're looking for one piece of equipment student what did you circle ,well paragraph two that's where they talk about the lunar orbiter 
230.1,Luis,,oh exactly student so what made you think that the lunar orbiter was the piece of equipment they're talking about in paragraph two ,um well they say it's a machine a small machine and machine can be equipment 
120.4,Jazmin,,huh what can someone tell me what what is equipment i was saying it's my mouse and keyboard and we were talking about our supplies but what what is equipment to you yeah go ahead student ,i say it's like something you use to do a task 
210.4,Luis,,okay so student would you say that a lunar what is a lunar orbiter what kind of task is a lunar orbiter trying to do ,okay so what it says in part two investigates in the polar craters 
230.3,Farrah,,whoo okay so we're applying what we know about equipment that it's a tool that does something and it's investigating in the polar craters go ahead student ,i'm i'm kind of confused 
230.1,Farrah,,yeah what what are you confused about can you tell me can you tell me ,yeah well you told us to look in paragraph two but what about paragraph three and the microscope 
150.1,Farrah,,and why it says student can you tell me what piece of equipment you circled in number three oh okay well let's jump to that one and then we'll come back to number two ,okay microscope um because they say the water is microscopic and they can't see it without the microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,so a microscope is a tool that does what ,it lets them see the the tiny ice deposits 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah for sure okay so that's one piece of equipment in number three but since the question is asking for equipment you'll want to look at number two now and see what's the other equipment that they're asking for ,"Well, I mean it's what Luis said that machine the lunar orbiter. "
230.1,Chris,,alright so we've got the lunar orbiter and the microscope as our equipment and student i have a question for you how do you know that the that the microscope is equipment and not like the water that they found ,they say it's a tool of microscope visit tool and we know on in science class miss bradley always says okay let's take out the equipment on and so it's like the microscope and the bunsen burner and stuff like that 
230.1,Oliver,,okay so you know that microscope is a piece of equipment and you see that in paragraph three nice student what about for number two how do you know that a lunar orbiter is a piece of equipment ,i didn't really get at first that it was because i thought it was just a microscope if you look again they use the word machine to describe it um and i guess yeah a machine that's like equipment not because at you design a machine to to do something so it could be an equipment 
530.1,Oliver,,what made you change your thinking on that ,i heard i'm student talking about the lunar orbiter and you said to look at part two 
530.1,Oliver,,okay and so ,so i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 
140.1,Oliver,,wow so what do you think that if people were creating a base on the moon what kind of equipment let's apply this to our thinking about this future story now like what tool you think or what tool do you think astronauts would use if they are trying to create a base on the moon student ,they need so much equipment on the moon they need to build the base so they could breathe on the moon all sorts of things 
140.1,Chris,,mm hmm do you think they would how do you think data or no sorry student how do you think that the nasa scientists could use the lunar orbiter and the discovery of water as a starting point for building a base on the moon ,well people need water they could drink the water 
140.1,Chris,,yeah and how do you think that would lead to us being able to build a base on the moon ,well or if there's water on the moon people can live there because i mean they could bring some water but eventually it be gone so they could drink more water from the moon 
140.1,Chris,,so student you're really into early into space how do you feel about that do you think that that's going to be possible and what year was it 2024 ,yeah yes three years away yeah i definitely want to go i'm ready all live on the moon any day 
140.1,Jazmin,,alright i don't think we've heard from student so student what do you think of the tool that astronauts would use to get ready to have a base on the moon based on our reading ,and since there's water on the moon maybe because you use equipment like gardening equipment and they could make a moon garden so that we could grow food 
230.1,Jazmin,,what what makes you think that ,well that's a good use of water and if we're going to have a base on the moon we need some food and sustainable food 
140.1,Jazmin,,okay i see what you're thinking there i'm student do you think that we'll be able to plant things on the mooon ,yeah we not be so cool we don't have like a moon greenhouse 
210.3,Jazmin,,i wonder if we're missing some pieces i think we might be missing some pieces for growing things on the moon student like what about soil ,oh yeah i guess the moon dirt it may not work i don't know we have to try it 
140.1,Oliver,,oh yeah we might want we might want to experiment with that student what were you gonna say ,well i just locked up o'clock now and we have to go to lunch now what i want to say thank you so much for really helping us understand the word equipment on and what it means and how to use it on and how to find the different equipment in the text i feel like i understand that so much better now thank you 
140.1,Farrah,,thank you all have a good lunch ,hi hi hi 
120.2,Luis,,um so earlier today you read about water on the moon and then you answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and you need to just circle the evidence in the text to to show your response to that question right and then um oh student did you have a question ,um yeah so um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
210.4,Jazmin,,i love that and your response was very interesting and we're going to we're going to talk about each one okay so student i'm going to start with you i really like um how you brought up that that the scientific tool they use was called a microscope to look really closely at the water because on that microscopes do really help us see things up close and um and I i'm curious if any of you guys um can pinpoint that a little more closer in the text okay so. i'm actually student you also had a really great answer to you said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon and i thought that came really really close to answering the question as well because they sure did however the scientist needed a tool to help them and it's a small machine discussed in paragraph two of the text okay so i'm curious if any of you class could look over paragraph two to see if perhaps um any of you want to add to your response uh and then student you also had a great response where you had that nasa sent a small machine on and i'm curious if you could identify what the small machine was called ,yeah well i'm i'm actually i'm i'm wondering i i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
130.2,Jazmin,,well in a lot of ways that's right okay because the question was what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon and you needed to circle the evidence in the texts that we can use to answer this question and you had written nasa send a small machine which is true in paragraph to it describes it as being a small machine but then right after it says it's a small machine it says called and i feel like we need to focus on that word because what does nasa call small machine in the paragraph does class remember ,yes yes and nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
130.3,Farrah,,fully answer the question right so um what I was really looking for here was the name of the machine was the Lunar orbiter on to investigate the water yeah Farrah. ,well um i i guess the lunar orbiter is the right answer but i don't really understand why because if you if it's so small don't you need to see it before you could discover it 
210.4,Oliver,,that's a really good point student and i i think what they used the lunar orbiter for was to investigate where there might be the deposits of water um and then after they got they collected the materials with the orbiter then they were able to put them under a microscope and really analyze it and see that it was made up of water and dirt and other things like that yeah def ,oh well um well i thought it was the microscope to just like student i circled the same the same the same thing but what you just said it sounded to me like like a metal detector like the lunar orbiter as kind of like a metal detector and it says where it is and then then you dig out the metal and then you can look at what it is is it like that 
210.4,Chris,,yes i think that's a really great way of putting it it is kind of like a detector that discovers where the water might be and then we can use the of the microscope to analyze it yeah student ,well i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.3,Luis,,yes that is so true and student you actually had a great response to where you brought some of that into it right ,i sure did 
210.4,Luis,,yeah but um i if we're looking at this question in particular right we do need to focus on that the lunar orbiter helped them to investigate where the water was then yeah all those other cool machines come into play after the fact after they're able to find the water and what they can use it to create to ,okay so you're saying that like it's not the right answer because i'm so oxygen tanks isn't the right answer because that's not how they find the water 
140.1,Luis,,exactly student and um i think what your answer focused on more of is what they could do with the water once they discover it right like there was an interesting video i saw i'm not sure if you class saw it from nasa where a woman was talking about how someday they hope to live for longer periods on the moon and if ,i definitely want to live on the moon 
140.1,Oliver,,i know wouldn't it be crazy and if they can discover water than they could turn that into things like oxygen for their oxygen tanks or i forget what else they were talking about using it for but i think that sounds really neat oliveron what's your question ,oh that's okay happens all time i looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say before before we go you really helped us understand the different purposes of the different appointments and why the lunar orbiter was the right answer for this question and i just wanted to say it was so helpful to work with you today thank you so much 
140.1,Oliver,,you class i had so much fun talking with you all and i really appreciate those sentiments stuff you class have a terrific lunch okay ,thank you 
150.1,Luis,,okay i love that you all brought in so many interesting facts that you read about in the article into your responses um but after after hearing them i think that some might be too specific and some may be too general i think that you're all just slightly off student ,um well i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,"however, I think that we need to instead of using just our background knowledge about space I want us to really start looking for the evidence in the article okay. um and i think student although your response was very interesting i think that we can fine tune it a little to make it even better okay ",yeah okay 
420.3,Jazmin,,okay so um let's see i also wanted before we begin i really wanted to clarify that the word equipment means a necessary item that is used for a specific purpose such as discovering water on the moon so um i want us to to just reread our responses to the question um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon because the question's asking what what equipment the scientists used and i want you class to find that in your response okay so go ahead and circle that and i really want you class to just circle um in your responses the equipment that you that you answered in the the question with okay okay so now what we're gonna do is um i want you to so i'm a little concerned that the question you need to answer is asking about the equipment okay so we really want to make sure that we can find that equipment in the text um so i want you to let's see reread the text and i want when you're rereading i want you to underline the specific detail where it says how the scientists discovered where the water was and i want you to underline what the equipment they used was to when they discovered the water okay um so go ahead and underline the specific detail where it says how the scientists discovered the water and what equipment they used okay so underline that right now ,excuse me 
420.3,Jazmin,,yeah student ,oh well i already circled the equipment when we answered the question 
110.1,Jazmin,,yeah okay ,i said nasa sent a small machine and so i don't understand why my answers wrong 
110.1,Jazmin,,"however, I think that you could find a more specific answer okay so um. so um student you were really close when you said it was a small machine because it for sure was um but i want you to look for the name of the small machine in the text okay i want you class to look in the text specifically for the name of the machine okay ",okay 
210.3,Luis,,and i also want you to think about um if after looking at the text if you want to modify your response at all does class feel like they want to modify their or change their answer student ,um yeah so when i read the story i found two pieces of equipment and they're a small machine which by the way student is called a lunar orbiter and and the microscope those are the two equipments 
120.3,Chris,,student thank you so much for sharing that with the class um does class see in the text where it talks about the lunar orbiter can someone read me the sentence okay yeah in the text student ,i can read it okay it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and i went to nasa actually on so i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Chris,,the sure do they sure do and all of that stuff helps them i'm sure um and i think that it's this part where it says they sent the lunar orbiter to investigate what do you think they're investigating what does it say they're investigating with that ,oh the craters that was part of my answer 
210.4,Oliver,,yes i love that and what what did they find in the craters when they used that machine student ,um they found really really tiny pieces of ice 
210.4,Farrah,,yes and student i think you might know the answer to this but what what did they use to look at the ice ,yeah you need a microscope because it's too small to see without the microscope um so is that the right answer 
150.1,Oliver,,you know i think that in combination with what class just said um is the best answer okay so i think that you class did a really great job of combining all of what you found in the text to create the best answer right student and student you class talked about the small machine called the lunar orbiter student you helped us really understand that they use that lunar orbiter to investigate the craters and student and student you class brought up that there were those ice deposits in the craters and they used the microscope to look at that even closer to discover so i think that um do you class want to modify your response now to make sure that it hat encompasses all that yeah def ,yeah well we definitely will but right now we have to go to lunch but yeah i wanted to say before we go thank you so much for allowing each of us to share our answers and helping us see how each of our answers were like a piece of the answer and how to work together with them 
150.1,Farrah,,student thank you so much for that response you class did a wonderful job today thank you all so much you class did a wonderful job today thank you all so much i love that you class thank you so much and if when you come back next time try to reflect a little bit about how you learned from this experience deb thank you so much for that response you class did a wonderful job today thank you all so much ,hi hi how are you 
150.1,Farrah,,i'm good how are you doing oh ,we're good we're really excited to work with you 
150.1,Luis,,awesome i'm excited to hear about what you understand in these paragraphs yes student ,um yeah okay um excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,well i'm excited for you to share all your knowledge with your other classmates ,oh yeah i can definitely do that 
150.1,Farrah,,awesome um do you all have some responses that you've prepared about the text that you read about water on the moon ,on yes we do um do you wanna do you want to hear them 
120.4,Farrah,,yes would class like to volunteer to go first ,yeah yeah i want to go is that okay 
120.4,Farrah,,yes go for it ,okay so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.4,Oliver,,"Would anyone else, like to share, you can raise your hand if you're ready. ",um yeah well i would just say i'm actually i circled the same as student 
110.2,Luis,,awesome thank you for sharing yeah they do say exactly in the text you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely gov would you want to share oh yeah student go for it ,yeah okay well my answer was actually that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
230.2,Luis,,would you mind did you have any evidence in the texts that you had for that or is that they stand outside knowledge ,Oh um yeah. i guess it's not really in there but i just know i know that if there's people on the moon they need oxygen tanks 
210.4,Jazmin,,hmm you know that's really interesting point because it's true that when humans go to the moon they definitely need oxygen tanks to breathe so that's an awesome point and i think that brings up a really good clarification which is that i think when they're looking for water on the moon they're actually sending this machine called a lunar orbiter so they're not sending actual human beings are not sending astronauts ,"Yes, okay well, so my answer was that NASA sent a small machine, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong. "
120.4,Farrah,,"well i think you're right that they did use a small machine but they're also giving us this specific vocabulary that the machine is called a lunar orbiter they sent a specific one called the lunar orbiter So I love your thinking, but when you see a small machine and you think that could be a few different things, maybe keep hunting and see if there's any specific vocabulary great question Jazmin. class else have responses yeah student ",yeah so now i'm a little confused because i guess well i thought it was the microscope but it sounds like maybe student is correct so is she right or am i right 
130.1,Luis,,well you're actually both right so they use that machine called the lunar orbiter to get to the moon to investigate and see if there was ice and then they did find water and when they found the water it was such small amounts that they had to use a microscope to look at it to see the water so you're both right they use a lunar orbiter to get to the moon and define the water but then in order to see the water they use a microscope but that's a great clarification yeah student ,yeah and i just wanted to add what i know to that clarification which is because you said there are no people there on the moon so then they had to bring i bet they had to bring like the little ice deposit back to earth and that's when they probably looked under the microscope right 
210.4,Luis,,yeah i think so i actually don't know i think it's possible that the lunar orbiter maybe had a microscope in it and then it was all done with robots but that's a great question ,robots are awesome 
110.1,Chris,,awesome i think so too yeah student ,yeah well actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
140.1,Chris,,mm hmm yeah you're right yeah i think there haven't been astronauts on the moon for a little while but they definitely nasa does send astronauts i think to the international space station regularly and i think they do use those special suits that's really cool did you see anything else there that you thought was interesting oh ,we got to see a lot of things like we got to see the whole space suit and i really wanted to try it on but and then we got to see parts of rockets and other things that the astronauts have inside the rockets like likes back like the packets of the of the space food and stuff 
140.1,Chris,,he did a space food look like it tasted good or does it look kind of disgusting what do you think ,it looks pretty disgusting really 
110.3,Oliver,,that's really cool that sounds like an awesome trip paris and thanks for sharing yeah student ,okay um i just want to make extra sure i understand the answer to the question so as there's the right answer both the right answer is like lunar orbiter plus microscope equals right answer 
130.2,Jazmin,,mm hmm yeah so when we're thinking about what kinds of machines they were using the right answers that they were using two different kinds of machines does class can class summarize what those two machines were student i think you just had it would class else like to build on that ,yes can i try and 
130.2,Jazmin,,go for it student ,okay so i'm going to change my first answer and i'm going to say nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and then in parentheses not a toaster and then i would say and then they had to use a microscope 
210.4,Oliver,,yes perfect and do you remember what they were using the microscope for ,oh yeah i thought that i can add on that you'll start to look really closely at the little ice and i'm i just i just looked at the clock and actually we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say thank you so much for taking all of our answers and showing us how they fit together to make the most complete answer that was really helpful 
210.4,Luis,,awesome thank you all have a good lunch bye bye start simulation hey today ,i'm excuse me teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.2,Chris,,that's awesome well i bet there are a few things that you don't know so i'm excited as you grow your learning today would class like to volunteer to go first and start us off by reading your answer alright we are gonna get started talking about your responses to the question what equipment it's scientists use to discover water on the moon ,first okay i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
120.4,Farrah,,"student i i love your thinking that you really found the the theme of the text and you're totally on point with with what the text was about because it's true that scientists did find craters full of water on the moon about the kind of equipment that scientists used, so I think my suggestion would be for you to go back and think about the equipment that scientists were using. to find those craters full of water to expand your answer and include the equipment that they were using to discover the water thank you who would like to go next ",i'll go 
120.4,Farrah,,all right go for it ,okay um so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.4,Jazmin,,hmm student i love your thinking because you're totally right that the article talk about using a microscope to look at the water so you're totally right about that but i want to just go back to the question because i'm concerned that your answer doesn't totally answer the question To look at the water they discovered so you're totally right that that was in the article but let's think a little bit more deeply about the question. and not discovery process so my suggestion would be to look at the text and think about how they were discovering the water not looking at it but finding it in the first place what class else like to share ,i don't understand why my answers wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,hmm yeah could you read your answer for me ,yeah i said nasa send a small machine 
420.2,Jazmin,,huh yeah so i just want to say you're right nasa did send a small machine but i want to push you to expand your answer because the article does say a little bit more about what that small machine actually is there's a name for it so i would encourage you to go back and look in the article to just make your correct answer even stronger because a small machine could be a lot of different things but we want to make sure we're talking really specifically about the type of small machine but the scientists were using ,teacher oh oh okay yeah i see that that's it's just it's a lunar orbiter i just have to add that to my answer and then i'm done oh that's easy okay well scientists into small machine called her 
110.1,Jazmin,,her mm hmm okay ,okay i got it can i go 
150.1,Oliver,,on not yet i think we're gonna we're going to talk a little bit more about what student had for his answer ,oh yeah i circled the same thing that student did you 
230.1,Oliver,,can you tell me a little bit about your thinking thinking about the the microscope answer ,yeah i kinda the thought question was asking about equipment what equipment it to us until i was looking in but text for everywhere they said equipment and i was looking for where they're finding and water and the moon so but but paragraph paragraph three had all of the keywords in it yeah 
420.3,Oliver,,i love that you are looking for keywords that's a really strong reading technique but my question for you here is the same thing that i mentioned to student about her answer is thinking about discovery so you're right that they were using the microscope to look at the water they found but they they weren't using the microscope to discover the water so i'd encourage you to go back into the text and and think more about discovery ,okay i feel like i didn't see the word discovery on that's what i saw found in paragraph three 
210.4,Chris,,"but thank you for that clarification that's a good point, because I think you're right that they don't use the word discover in the article. came across or words like that that all mean similar things that's another good strategy to think to think about when you're reading ",yeah okay um i think i've found the one that student was talking about but then i was thinking about equipment because you said that's the part that was missing in my answer and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Chris,,"yeah right they do use a lot of equipment i think my suggestion for you here because you're right that's that signed us and asked us a ton of different kinds of equipment so, for example, and Luis the answer Luis was talking about using oxygen tanks and it's true that scientists use oxygen tanks, but they did not use oxygen tanks. to find water on the moon so thinking about the context of the question in what specific situation or scientists using this kind of equipment and we know that it's using water on the moon so going back into the text ",yeah thanks teacher okay. 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah ,teacher that's not a question or an observation i look up a time and i realized that it's time for us to go so on we will see you later okay 
210.4,,,thank you ,teacher 
210.4,All,,hi class ,hi 
150.1,Luis,,hi alright so today we're going to talk a little bit about your responses to the question about the article we read about nasa would class like yeah student ,excuse me teacher i don't think i should be in this class biology know all about space 
140.1,Luis,,who can you tell me one thing that you know about space ,yeah okay i'll tell you three things first accidents have to wear spacesuits because it's really cold and they'll like freeze to death second they have to wear oxygen tanks because you can't breathe them space and third there's no gravity there so they got to wear gravity boots 
120.4,Luis,,oh nice it sounds like you know a lot about the equipment that scientists are wearing on their bodies but i'm excited to hear how you connect all that knowledge to what we learned about in the article about the equipment for finding water do you want to tell me a little bit about your response to the question based on the article we read ,yeah sure okay i said what did i see i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
420.3,Luis,,"you also i see how you're connecting your knowledge about astronauts to this article which is great identified the type of equipment that scientists are using to discover the water, but you are talking about what. astronauts might be wearing when they go to outer space so my suggestion to you is to go back into the article and to think a little bit about not what scientists may be wearing but what equipment they might be using ",okay okay 
120.4,Chris,,would class else like to share well student goes back to read the article ,i can share my oh answer was scientists phone craters full of water on the moon 
210.4,Chris,,what did you think was interesting about how they found the water did was there anything that stuck out to you ,how they found the water i don't think i remember that part of the story let me see 
120.4,Jazmin,,while student goes back to read what class else like to share their responses ,um yeah i don't understand why why my answers wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,hmm could you read your answer for me ,yeah i said scientists sent a small machine out nasa sent a small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,huh yeah definitely so do you have any ideas about what type of machine they might have sent to you remember that from the passage ,let me see i'll call the lunar orbiter 
120.4,Jazmin,,yes definitely i see how you're connecting original answer and growing your thinknig would class else like to share your understanding by five day not specific detail in the name of the the equipment because you're right that they did bring a small machine and you found the name which was awesome ,i just have to add that i just have that lunar orbiter to my answer and then it's fine 
530.1,Jazmin,,and then after you're finished i'm curious if you could share about how you're thinking has changed from your original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote ,well i added the name so i had to master some small machine and now it says nasa said it's a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
530.1,Jazmin,,mm hmm so ,i just i added the name 
210.4,Jazmin,,do you know what a lunar orbiter is ,it's a machine. that they use to find water 
210.4,Oliver,,mm hmm and let's maybe you can think a little bit we can break down that nate and so do you know what lunar means the word lunar um ,about the moon that means about the moon 
210.4,Chris,,yeah thank you you're right yeah and then or better does class know what the word orbiter means or the orbit ,yeah that's that's the path that you when you go like around something you know like how 
210.4,Chris,,so ,we we like the sun you know like we go around yeah yeah i have to think for a second like do we call this week around the sun 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah yeah yeah definitely so student now using what your classmates have shared about what it is so it's something about the moon and it's something that's going around something else what do you think a lunar orbiter would be doing on ,um i think it's a machine that goes around 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah and so connecting that back to what you said how do you think scientists were using that particular piece of equipment to find water ,okay you're using this to you went around the moon maybe and looked for water like flew around the moon maybe or or or drove around the moon 
120.4,Chris,,yeah yeah absolutely that's great alright what class else like okay okay good yeah would class else like to share ,before the issue the response i was just thinking about um the other kinds of equipment that we're talking about with even because i went to nasa into i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
150.1,Chris,,me yeah no you're so right that sounds like a really cool trip to nasa and you're right that scientists at nasa use a lot of different equipment and so for this question because we're talking about what scientists used to discover water that means we're narrowing down out of all the equipment that scientists use like the oxygen tanks that student talked about and the special gravity boots and all different kinds of things so that they can survive in outer space we're specifically we're narrowing all that down to what they were using to discover water does that help ,yeah yeah yeah to kind of think more more with the just what we're talking about in the story 
150.1,Oliver,,yeah exactly ,oh oh teacher it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for how you were asking questions about our thinking i'm to help with the answers and kind of taking time to explain what we needed to work on because it gave me some ideas on how i can improve my answer to 
150.1,Oliver,,great thank you all ,bye teacher 
120.4,Luis,,hey also student student and student have shared some revised responses and will we kind of need to go through them a little bit just as a class to see where we're at does class with class like to go first student firsthand what's up ,wow excuse me i shouldn't be in this class because i already corrected my answer so i'm good 
230.1,Luis,,awesome so you corrected your answer so we'll take you as a volunteer to go first let's see so your answer you revised answer student was that scientists found is using a small machine is that correct awesome so um what's what what makes you say that what makes you say that scientists found is using a small machine ,because that paragraph two yeah class that's what it says in paragraph two it says nasa's into small machine blah blah blah look for ice deposit blah blah blah and so they found the ice using a small machine 
210.4,Luis,,what's the important word in the question You are correct in that they found is using a small machine cool so we've had a couple of comments from you about equipment we've had scientists use a lot of equipment and then we have scientists found the ice using a small machine what is the actual name of the small machine ,oh yeah it's the lunar orbiter i forgot to put that in there 
230.2,Luis,,awesome okay yeah i know you were on your way so let's see so now what now that we know so scientists found ice using a lunar orbiter cool um yeah so you found that from the text right ,yeah yeah i did 
520.1,Luis,,yeah i'm concerned about their whereas a lack of specificity and both of your responses today. so i suggest that the next time you have a question like this you read through the text and look for those key specific words that might help you have a more rounded out answer ,okay okay 
150.1,Luis,,does that make sense ,it does i mean i just like don't like to write you know i mean i feel like when i get the answer i got it and that's good 
520.1,Luis,,Now that we figured out the full answer what could you do next time so that you don't have to revise and revise and revise. ,okay next time i guess i could just like be specific when i'm writing my answer 
510.1,Luis,,"i think that a little bit of specificity and putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times so About a small machine, what did you use to think about this machine yeah. ",okay i used to think that i just care right small machine or equipment but now i think i gotta always write the name of the thing in my answer because because the teacher says that i got to be more specific so next time i guess i will write more specific names of things when i am writing my answer so you don't have to revise and revise and revise 
110.1,Jazmin,,okay we'll leave that there student you have a question or a comment ,um yeah well i i changed my answer to 
110.1,Jazmin,,you did ,yeah yeah i did it while i'm while you're talking to student 
120.4,Jazmin,,okay why don't you share with us ,okay um so he said nasa use the machine called the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon 
230.1,Jazmin,,mm hmm that's your revised answer ,yeah 
530.1,Jazmin,,okay that sounds great what i don't recall what your first what was different about your first answer and your second you said ,my first answer i just said nasa send a small machine 
510.1,Jazmin,,oh ok ok sorry that's the part i had forgotten i sort of noticed that through talking with student i mean that you also added some specificity to your answer do you think that helped you get a more full response ,yeah yeah cuz it's got a lot of specificity 
520.1,Jazmin,,okay what could you do next time you get a question like this that you're maybe coming up with an answer that feels a little bit ,short um okay well next next time i could i guess well first off i know that i was supposed to write the name of it i guess that's the same as student to be more specific with the name um and then also um what else did i add oh oh the why i added why though the white part because the teachers that's what the teacher said that i was missing to 
120.4,Jazmin,,and student or student do either one of you want to share sure student ,"yeah yeah I wanted to know if my new answer was okay um the water, the scientists found on the moon was microscopic is that OK. "
120.2,Jazmin,,so what are you working on in this response what i have a question for you what do you feel like if the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,i forgot again oh man hold on i was supposed to be adding in the equipment part yeah okay okay i got it now oh yeah the water scientists found on the moon with the lunar orbiter was microscopic 
110.4,Oliver,,yeah let's see do you want to add something that's right so we have the name of the lunar orbiter ,i know teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's actually time for us to go i'm so off to see you later okay 
230.3,All,,sounds good class have fun folks welcome back student i think we were working on your response so i think we should just pick up right where we left off if if i recall you had said you would revise your revisions so you revise revise that the water found the water scientists found water on the moon using a lunar orbiter and that the water was microscopic is that correct ,yeah yeah 
230.3,Luis,,okay oh answer the water scientists yeah okay great so student yes ,i i just i think i got it figured out now so i think i'm all good 
230.1,Chris,,well we're still going to go through the rest of class else's so if you could help us like us are thinking and pay attention to the other folks is they waited for you that would be really great so you might also help us be able to think a little bit deeper alright so student yeah so you you clarified response which is which is great what helped you find the title of the small machine ,um okay well i'm student had had it before so i remembered that it was in the second paragraph and i'm that well i was looking for the ice part of it because at first i didn't realize that was the water too and so yeah that was it was pretty easy to find 
210.2,Chris,,sure it was easy to find so when you're faced with the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what's what's the important word of that sentence do you think ,oh discover 
520.1,Chris,,awesome so so when we're reading our sentence and we're looking for our answer what do you think you could do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking ,i think but i got a mixture of it i'm looking at all of the words in the question cuz i missed equipment on my answer and 
230.1,Chris,,look at all the words in the question okay how did you know let me ask you following okay yeah sure let me ask you a follow up so how did you know that equipment was the most important word in that sentence or question ,oh okay well cuz when we were talking about our answers before the teacher kept telling us that that was one of the important because class else had equipment except for me i realized i forgot it and then when we're reading the question to me i heard it again and i realized i forgot it 
230.3,Chris,,"okay so okay that's awesome so you you are recognizing that you had just forgot to to include that in your answer perhaps Oh, I forgot that so all included in my answer. ",okay well for next time i guess i should check my answer with the question um then to make sure that i i answered all the parts of the question 
120.4,Farrah,,i think that's totally a great strategy for you i think if you see the question provide your answer just look over your answer one more time and then make sure it answers matches the question and you'll be good to go okay great great awesome thanks teacher you got it so finally miss student do you want to share your revised answer ,still kind of confused 
120.4,Farrah,,yeah me too girl so what's your revised answered ,okay um so oh let me see where did i even write it down 
120.4,Farrah,,do you remember your first answer ,um yeah my first one was about that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely because i got that one right out of the story okay yeah i see where i wrote it down okay um and then for my revised answer i said that scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of water in craters on the moon 
150.1,Farrah,,that feels like a really thorough answer to me does it feel like a thorough answer to you ,yeah yeah i wrote a lot more um i mean i wrote a lot more like not words but you know like from my from my brain i'm in the second answer than because the first answer was from the story 
150.1,Farrah,,right okay so we have the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon and your answer is scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of water so we have the lunar orbiter in there which is specificity right student right student we were talking about specificity earlier great ,so specificity 
530.1,Farrah,,nailed it so um so how can i ask you a question how did you get from your first answer to your second answer how did your thinking change ,um okay so i knew that the microscope was the wrong answer because i realized that i was i had used it because it said it was looking at the water but she was asking about discovering the water um and then we already talked about you know like our supposed to put all of the parts of the question and our answer and i think i did that in my first answer but then i did it i did it more because like we keep talking about like adding more details and adding more details so i guess i'm what different is that i added more details oh i remember and i use more the words from the question in my answer to 
230.3,Farrah,,okay great so i'm hearing that you have heard class talk about being more specific and adding more details and so you're like i'm on it that's what i'm going to do and you tried that and it worked out yeah ,yeah yeah and and i added the words from the question to 
230.3,Farrah,,And that you're providing a response to the question and that you have that you're understanding what the question is asking so. Do you know. ,okay yeah yeah no i think i can i'm okay how do i know what the questions asking um okay so what i would do is look at all of the words in the question right and then make sure that i i understand what each of the words means um and then when i find my answer try to like look in match it up between each of the words in my answer in each of the words in the question 
230.3,Farrah,,okay so that at the end you'll have some some answers that match and it makes sense for you and for others to understand that sounds pretty solid so let's do let's just do the fill in the blank like we've done before so let's do a little thinking routine about make it about ,That. i started to think that i could just kind of find the words in the story and then that just be the answer to right but now i think that i have to make sure that i understand all the words in this question first and then find the answer and write it in my own words to feel match the question 
230.3,Farrah,,oh whoops there's more oh that ,was oh no because if i don't then i might actually have the wrong answer so next time i will 
230.3,Farrah,,oh you've already said that ,check my answer with the words in the question to make sure that they 
210.3,Farrah,,are you are you asking are you telling ,oh man okay i'm telling i'm 
110.1,Oliver,,okay that's tell me tell me okay good good final answer ,all to turn teacher it's time for us to go to lunch 
110.1,Oliver,,oh rats off you go then ,well i wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to kind of help us to think about our answers changing cause i was listening and now i have some ideas on on how to think about when i am going to change like my answer um next time i'm going to enter a question 
110.1,Oliver,,yeah thank you to something's ,okay bye 
110.1,Luis,,okay thank you class for sharing i'm going to ask you to think a little about your answers and i'm going to ask for a little more detail from each of you so if we could start with student he said nasa send a small machine could you tell someone class sharing student ,yeah thanks for calling on me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,and if you have all that knowledge i'd love for you to share it with the rest of us so i really appreciate you being here yeah all of it i think we can always learn more ,i can tell you anything you want to know 
150.1,Luis,,okay well we'll start with student and then we'll come to you how does that sound ,okay that's fine great 
210.4,Jazmin,,thank you student you said masters kind of small machine could you look in take one minute and look in the text and tell me what that small machine was called ,ok ok nasa centers machine called a lunar orbiter 
210.4,Luis,,the lunar orbiter now does class have an idea what the lunar orbiter is yes student ,okay so i figured this out because lunar means like moon and orbiter means like around like it goes around and an orbit and so i think the lunar orbiter as like this small machine that goes around the moon 
210.4,Chris,,fantastic so i really appreciate something student just did he took little parts of the world to lunar orbit to draw a conclusion from that so we're really looking for small details here so the sent a lunar orbiter and student what did those scientists fine could you repeat what you said about what the scientists found with that lunar orbiter ,oh yeah suit the scientists they found these crators full of water 
210.4,Chris,,so how much water did they find could use to find in the text how much water they found ,okay yeah so in part one it says they found evidence that water can be found deep in the moon's craters okay there's the part about the lunar orbiter oh oh oh okay well i don't know if i got here yeah and part three oh it says that the water is microscopic 
210.4,Farrah,,microscopic the me thank you for finding that can class tell me what microscopic me yes shabana ,yeah um well this is connected to my answer to microscopic means it's really really small and so my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and um i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Oliver,,"keep everyone should keep in mind when I hear these answers I want to know, like small details from the text so. let's go away right and wrong we're just thinking about like how specific can we get um let's see i don't think i heard from student could you repeat your answer as well ",um yeah well i suppose same thing as student 
210.4,Oliver,,oh i see okay could then let's see if you could give me another detail that student hasn't said yet could you tell me where they're using the microscope again ,i'm okay yeah so um they use a microscope to look at a tiny on ice particles and polar craters 
210.4,Chris,,quick does class know what a crater is really sharp raise your hand if you know what a crater is okay great so it's okay you can put your hands down thank you just tracking it's okay if you don't care we're looking at the little divots or shapes in the moon yes student oh ,well i know what craters are because i actually went to nasa and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.4,Luis,,that connects to something student said earlier i think about the oxygen tanks could you tell could student could you tell me what type of scientists could use an oxygen tank ,oh yeah astronaut 
210.4,Jazmin,,astronaut okay so let's keep that in mind astronaut use oxygen tanks but something tells me that oxygen that astronauts aren't actually on this mission could someone let's take a minute look in the text tell me why i don't think astronauts are on this mission yes student ,well it doesn't actually say the word astronaut anywhere in the story 
210.4,Oliver,,so we're missing that detail good that's a good notice you just said so even though we might be able to assume astronaut you're somewhere for this for this section we can only assume what they tell us but let's keep that in mind just in case they mention it later yes ,oh i just locked up a clock on it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for working with us today and reminding us to really look for small details and add them into one answer that is so helpful thank you so much i'm 
150.1,Luis,,glad i could help you after lunch them great thank you for something stuck in my throat okay that wasn't cute okay thank you for sharing that with student hopefully we're seeing how we can use different parts of the text to talk about an earlier part yes student ,i'm okay i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
230.1,Luis,,what do you mean all figured out ,i'm like the answer to the question i'm all set i got it 
210.4,Oliver,,the great thing about reading is that you can always ask more questions and deeper questions i think we can push it a little more student i wanted to ask you a question since you circled the same thing i student did you find something else about microscopes that could help us talk about did you find anything else about about the microscope passage that could help us talk about how much water there is ,okay um well student told us about part of it but also uses the word microscopic on which it has just like microscope 
210.4,Oliver,,i like that you found relationship between the words and just to be just to be clear could someone tell me what microscopic means ,um yeah yeah that's like super super small 
120.2,Farrah,,yes and i really liked how many supers you use because they have to zoom and even though as student said the craters very big the amount of water they can find is very very small that's why i want to ask class a follow up question do you think the water they can find sorry i'm going to say the question and then i'm going to ask you to do something with your responses will the water they find on the moon be valuable and what i want you to ask you to do while you're thinking of an answer is find text evidence just as you were doing in that first part of class to inform this answer so one more time will the water they find on the moon be valuable to them yes student ,i'm i'm i'm a little confused still 
230.1,Farrah,,on the directions or something else ,no about the microscope because is the lunar orbiter the right answer or is it the microscope i don't get it 
210.3,Farrah,,ooh that was a good question let's pause writing on my second question so we can all talk about this so my question was um well actually let me ask you which one do you think is correct microscopes or lunar orbiters ,me or class 
210.3,Luis,,class that's go with student ,um well i think it's probably both i mean lunar orbiter i mean that sounds really fancy cool and it sounds like it can like find the location of the water and then microscopes are you can see it so um i think it's probably both 
130.2,Jazmin,,thank you for sharing back does class have a different answer than student will go student and then student ,and so i i kind of think that like the lunar orbiter is like the better answer not that microscopes is bad but i think lunar orbiter says the exact thing like the one thing they used to like discover the water like discover like find it like where it is i don't think i'm microscope could do that because only one microscope won't do a lot on a great big moon 
130.2,Oliver,,and let's go to student before i try to talk to class ,um wow i was gonna say microscope but what student side as making me think a little bit but i still don't understand how you can find something that's too small to see how can you even discover it if you can't see it yeah 
210.3,Oliver,,um so let's try to combine some answers so what did they what did they use to get to the moon in the first place ,um well definitely not a microscope 
210.3,Oliver,,which piece of equipment did they use if it's not a microscope ,well gotta be the lunar orbiter 
130.1,Oliver,,so we have the lunar orbiter but student just said the lunar orbiter can't see anything super super tiny so they also need that microscope so it's going to be so both of those answers as student were saying earlier is something you would use to find water on the moon ,um i also read that there could be a base on the moon by 
230.2,Oliver,,and where did you read that ,i'm online i'm on the site on a science website for class 
210.3,Oliver,,so if there is a base on the moon if we have two pieces of equipment lunar orbiter and microscopes which piece of equipment would they not need any more if they have a base on the moon ,lunar orbiter because like you're already there 
210.4,Farrah,,exactly so so before if we didn't have a base on the moon we need the lunar order to get there because we can't just wait chuck microscope at the moon and hope it lands but if they're already on the moon they can have the microscopes already there there doesn't need anything to transport the microscope to the place so yes student ,i'm so sorry because this class is so fun i'm learning so much but we have to go to lunch and i just wanted to say before we go thank you so much you really made me feel like you valued my answer and i think class probably agrees on that and you've really helped us use our thinking to find the best answer and that was really cool 
230.3,Luis,,i'm glad with we thank you please enjoy your second one start simulation hello i'm happy to be back with you all and i believe that we left off trying to add some more to jazmin's response trying to strengthen it and i know that we talked about we added the name of the machine the lunar orbiter and i think that we yes student ,yeah yeah i i did that so i think i got this all figured out i'm all good 
120.4,Luis,,well would you mind sharing with us how you would maybe answer this question like ,yeah so i think she should just add the name i think she should just say um i don't remember student what was your answer yeah so i think you can just say nasa's small machine called a lunar orbiter and that's a good answer 
130.2,Farrah,,does class have a different feeling about that answer do you think the student has included everything she needs to she talked about the who or anything else student ,um no she didn't have the who and i don't remember the other thing that you said we're supposed to have she has what i saw is it just who and what 
130.2,Farrah,,maybe let's just start with the who who ,will the question says or what equipment it scientists use so the scientists are the hoop 
210.3,Farrah,,yes you're right the scientists were the who so how can we add that into jazmin's response ,um i mean i guess we could still use what student said oh well she said nasa sent a small machine for me she could say um i guess nasa scientists into small machine called a lunar orbiter 
210.3,Jazmin,,take a closer look back at the text and it says in the second paragraph nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate so thinking about that i think that student might be correct that the who would be nasa at least from reading through that sentence so as a complete response if student were to say nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter where did they send it to did you include that student ,no 
120.2,Jazmin,,okay so where did they send this machine to ,get them on 
210.3,Farrah,,right so i think that that would give you a more complete or a stronger response does class think that she i'm sorry did i interrupt someone ,i'm sorry teacher i'm still kind of confused 
230.1,Farrah,,which part are you confused about ,well because our teacher said that we're supposed to use the keywords in the question um and so the keyword in a question are some equipment scientists discover water moon those are the ones that i underlined so does that mean all of those words have to be in the answer too 
150.1,Farrah,,that's a really good question i think thinking about the like the keywords that you pulled out and the keywords in the question i think it's important to look back at our response and just think about if it matches the question when we're looking for an answer it's important to think about those keywords and it can also be helpful to create our sentence but i wouldn't say that it necessarily has to be in your response does that help ,yeah yeah that does 
530.1,Jazmin,,thank you okay so student do you feel like you've changed your your process for working through text and questions ,okay um so for my process at first i was just looking for the equipment and then you you said that it had to i had to i should say the name of it um and then you asked if we had the who and today anna said no but then she said yeah and you said that nasa could be the who and then we added something else but i don't remember what else we added other than the name 
230.3,Chris,,i remember that we added the were so the moon we said um ,sorry i was just thinking when you set the where that are i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so that could be another another thing i guess not for your answer but that's more information about the weird 
120.4,Chris,,thank you for sharing that with us that's a very interesting fact i didn't know that does class else want to try working through their response or strengthening it okay so let's start with you student ,scientists phone crude is for water on the moon so i have the who and i have the weird and i guess the what is the craters okay scientists is the whole that's the same water on the moon is the same craters oh okay the equipment is wrong 
210.3,Chris,,okay do you see a spot maybe where you could just add that in there ,hey oh scientists sent the lunar orbiter to find craters for water on the moon 
120.2,Oliver,,i i like what you gave me there let me read the question one more time and then i can think about your answer a little bit what equipment and scientists use to discover what on and you said oh i'm sorry student yes ,i'm trying to and i love to teach i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted i wanted to say thank you for when you explain what we needed to work on and you you help me think about my strategy um i didn't even notice about like thinking about like who and what and the were in the question and trying to match it to my answer so i think that was really useful for me 
120.2,Oliver,,i'm happy that was helpful for you ,okay bye teacher 
120.2,Farrah,,hello class how are class doing ,hi we're great we're so excited to work with you 
120.2,Luis,,oh i'm very excited to work with you out too so um yes ,um yeah excuse me um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,well maybe you can help us out today i think we're going to need some help as we just take a deeper look at the text does that sound good ,oh yeah of course 
210.4,Chris,,thank you wonderful so you class read about scientists and the moon and can class tell me what did they discover student ,yeah it's so cool the scientists they discovered craters full of water on the moon 
110.2,Oliver,,did class else have anything that they found very interesting student very cool i didn't know that there was water on the moon before i read the text so that was a very interesting fact to me as well ,yeah well i thought i'm sorry um it was interesting how they said that the water is is really really small it's actually like a really really really small pieces 
210.4,Farrah,,i think that there's a word for that does class remember what word they use to describe how small the water i student ,yeah i do because it's it's kind of part of my answer they use the word microscopic and so that's why i said you'd need a microscope to discover the water so you can look at it really closely 
210.2,Luis,,very good um as i was looking at all of your answers i noticed that And I think when we're answering questions such as the one of what equipment that the scientists use. to discover the water on the moon i think that what will make our answer so much better was if we put in some of those details we just talked about so what i would like to do is take a minute to think about the who and the what and the how so who do we need to focus on in this text and thinking about the question who do we need to focus on student ,the scientists 
210.4,Chris,,yes very good the scientists and what did they find i think we all know this one ,yeah that's the water 
210.4,Jazmin,,very good and how did they find it we know that the water was microscopic it was very small but what what type of tool did they use to find it student mentioned that they used a microscope to see the water but what what i'm what type of invention it was it had a really cool name student ,yeah yeah so in my answer i said something different i said that nasa sent a small machine and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
130.1,Jazmin,,so you mentioned a small machine does class know what paragraph maybe that they named the small machine in your answer is not wrong actually but it could be even better ,because that's where i found my answer it's in part two 
210.4,Jazmin,,"Very good yeah so as i'm looking and i'm reading, part two, or paragraph two, I see that they called it a lunar orbiter ",i guess i wouldn't be that hard i mean i could say that the equipment is a small machine and it's called the lunar orbiter 
130.2,Chris,,i would agree what do you all think do you think that that strengthens jazmin's answer student ,well yeah i think it does because now it kind of makes me imagine what what it looks like when because when you just said small machine i couldn't really picture it but also i wanted to say i kind of know what what these things might look like because i went to nasa actually i went there and i found out that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.2,Oliver,,thank you for that information yes i agree with you i think it it allows you to kind of visualize maybe even if i don't know what a lunar orbiter is it helps me kind of imagine some type of machine so thank you for that thank you um i also would like to know what you class circled in the text i know that you class have formulated some answers but what what led you to your answers student ,yeah okay i'm still i'm a little confused because i circled the microscope um but it sounds like lunar orbit is supposed to be the answer and i don't totally understand why 
210.2,Oliver,,sure well let's let's think about it so the question asked us what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so what does it mean to discover something ,like to find it for the first time 
130.1,Oliver,,and and so when i reading paragraph two it says that they sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate but we also know that later in paragraph three paragraph three it says that where is it the water they found was microscopic so let's think about this do you think that maybe they used both of those things to find the water ,oh um that could be it because um you you find it and then you look at it 
110.2,Oliver,,i like that that's a really good way of thinking about it what does class else ,i'm so sorry i don't want to interrupt but i just looked up a clock and we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us really listen to and build on each other's answers on and find the right names for the different pieces of equipment in the text just by listening to each other and talking about it that was really interesting and cool 
110.2,Farrah,,i'm very happy you all enjoyed it and i hope that you enjoy your lunch as well hi students how we doing ,oh we're great we're really excited to work with you today 
230.1,Luis,,likewise i'm very excited to work with you all now i see here a student that you circle the same response as student can you elaborate or provide a little more information on on what you meant by that ,um can i say something that is student over here 
230.1,Luis,,hi student ,um yeah before you start um i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,that is great that you bring so much knowledge to this class student and hopefully your knowledge can help the class to understand more about space as well and maybe they have something that they know that they can share with you how does that sound ,okay that sounds okay okay 
120.4,Luis,,great now let's give student the opportunity to answer my question ,okay go ahead student 
120.4,Oliver,,do you have a question question student ,student got me all confused 
120.2,Oliver,,that's okay i was wondering if you could expand or elaborate a little more on what you meant by you circled the same as student ,oh yeah okay i'm so sorry i know we both thought about the answer to the question about equipment was on the microscope and since she she started first so i just said i circled all the same thing instead of repeating 
230.2,Farrah,,i say and can the two of you both student and student can you tell me where in the text you you got your answer from did you did you circle a certain part of the text where their context clues ,yeah so i circled the sentence that said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
120.4,Jazmin,,excellent thanks student and student would you mind sharing can you share what you circled ,and so i circled small machine my answer is nasa center small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.3,Jazmin,,i think that you you all circled a really important parts of the text that allow us to understand the different sorts of equipment that nasa uses to find water on space okay i wouldn't say that your answer is wrong i actually i don't think anybody's answers are right or wrong i think that you you all circled a really important parts of the text that allow us to understand the different sorts of equipment that nasa uses to find water on space so do you see student how a microscope microscope along with a small machine is used to find water on space ,oh yeah well i guess i just thought that the machine is what they use to do the discovering and i don't know the microscope maybe they don't use it to discover 
120.4,Chris,,yeah so space exploration and finding water on space there are a lot of steps and processes that come with that right and and student you you touch on a really important part of that as do student and student now student can you tell us what you you wrote as your response ,yeah okay well i said that scientists found creators full of water on the moon 
230.2,Chris,,mm hmm that is exactly right and did you see anywhere in the text that told you what sort of equipment allowed them to find the craters ,oh well i don't know about in the text but i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
140.1,Luis,,this is all true student knows this correct ,yep yep oxygen tanks are my answer to that one student 
230.3,Chris,,what else do you think are important tools that allow them to look at water yep so oxygen tanks small machines microscopes these are all really important pieces of equipment that allow nasa scientists to look at water on the moon ,wow hmm maybe they need something to collect the water 
120.4,Luis,,they definitely need something to collect the water that's excellent student what else how are they traveling to the moon class can raise their hand or shout out student ,rocket ships rocket ships 
130.2,Luis,,rocket ships they definitely need rocket ships anything else that we have ,wow the rocket ships landing gear if they're going to go on the moon they need landing gear um suits and masks student already said that food really gross food for them to eat on the trip um i think there's a lot of things really a lot of things 
210.1,Luis,,there's probably a lot of things i mean when when astronauts are going to space they they're packing for a long time right yeah they're not yet we're not taking a day trip to the moon they're they're there for a little while ,yeah if we could take a day trip to the moon i would have done that already 
140.1,Jazmin,,yeah me to that would be that would be really interesting would class else be interested in going to the moon show of hands class interested in going to the moon student oh alright student student jas student you're not so interested in going to the moon ,i would rather stay here on earth and focus on protecting the earth 
140.1,Jazmin,,i like that answer what how would you plan to protect the earth do you have ideas on that ,yeah well we need to plant more trees to save the forests and we need to protect our oceans by not dumping trash and by making sure that we recycle 
140.1,Farrah,,those are really beautiful ideas thank you for sharing student student why are you interested in going to the moon ,oh well i'm actually i was gonna say i looked at the clock on and it's it's time for us to go to lunch 
120.2,Luis,,alright so hello class and as you all know we just finished reading the water on the moon text talking about the moon is a desert and we are all responding to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this room i already know all about space 
120.4,Luis,,oh well then would you like to start do you have an answer to this question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,oh yeah well um i said that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks 
210.4,Luis,,that's a really cool insight and i really appreciate that you're bringing all this knowledge to our class but my question is is there a place in the text in the reading that we could find how the scientists use what like what oliverice they used to find the water on the moon ,um you mean like in the story 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah in the story was there a part that maybe some one of your peers can help you find it was there a spot in the text talking about what oliverice things to find the water on the moon yes student ,yeah well i said you'd need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely 
210.2,Farrah,,yeah so that's a really good addition thank you yeah i see that in paragraph three it talks about the microscope and that's how they're looking at the water but do we know how they discovered and found the water is there a place in the reading where we know what oliverice they used to find it ,is it not a microscope because how how could you discover something if if you can't see it 
210.4,Jazmin,,that's a really good question um but let's take a look at paragraph three let's see what it says and so it says the water they found is microscopic meaning they wouldn't be able to see it if it were if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely maybe someone else could offer something yeah student so you're right we do need the microscope to see the water but i'm wondering maybe if we take a look at paragraph two is are there any other tools that the scientists were using ,yes i found my answer in paragraph two but i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Jazmin,,so do you want to share answer with the class and we can work through it together ,yes well i said nasa send a small machine 
230.2,Jazmin,,yeah so um so yes it definitely is a small machine but can you tell me where in the text you got the answer ,the very beginning of part two 
210.4,Jazmin,,can you read it to the to our class so we're we're on the same page ,yeah it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
130.2,Farrah,,thank you for reading um yeah so you're right so it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so you're right it is a small machine but what is the tool called the specific tool used maybe someone else can offer something ,so you're saying you're saying it's the lunar orbiter and not the microscope 
130.2,Chris,,well what do other people think does class else have a suggestion so right now we're thinking is it a microscope is it the lunar orbiter what do we think the scientists used to find the water yeah student ,oh well i went to nasa so i know that scientists he was a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.2,Oliver,,yeah so that's great you bringing in outside information and love that very exciting and can help us have a bigger picture of what we're looking at however i want us to take a look at the reading specifically because we want to make sure that what we're talking about class has the same basis understanding and you have outside understanding from nasa which is amazing but not class else has that but what class else does have is the reading that we just did so just to make sure that everyone's on the same page let's take a look back at the reading so again yeah so as far as we know in the reading the tools that we have our microscopes and lunar orbiters and the question we're answering is which tool to the scientists use to discover the water on the moon student do you have anything maybe maybe an idea ,okay yeah well i suppose the same as something about the microscope but now student read that part about the lunar orbiter and how it investigates so now now i'm really confused i don't know which one it is because they both sound pretty good to me 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah that they both do sound pretty good and that's why we're talking about it so let's take a look at that sentence again the one that student read aloud so nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so what do we think the author meant by investigating what are they looking for ,um well it sounds like it was it was looking looking for is deposits right little teeny tiny ice 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah yes they're looking for the ice and so we're looking for ice and the question we're answering is about water so what do we think is the lunar orbiter looking for ice is lunar orbiter looking for water is that the same thing ,oh yeah yeah it's just water so i guess if they sent a lunar orbit are looking for ice then then it's really looking for the water 
210.3,Chris,,yeah yeah so so what what does class else thinking so now that we've had this discussion are we thinking that the lunar lunar orbiter from the water or that the microscope on the water or do you think that they're playing different roles yeah student ,well i i really like what you just said about playing different roles and i think it's i think it's that because it sounds like they sent the lunar orbiter to look for like to discover the the water in the little little ice deposit but then maybe they had to use the microscope to on over to examine it 
130.2,Oliver,,what does class else think do people or agree or disagree with what student just said that the lunar orbiter with us to find or discover the water and the microscope was used to actually look at it specifically yeah ,that's that's really good answer i agree with student about that but i just i just looked at the clock and i'm so sorry but we we actually have to go to lunch right now but i really wanted to say we really appreciate how you really took your time and sent us back to look at that text and helped us understand the purpose of each of the tools and which one was the best answer for the question thank you so much 
120.2,Luis,,thank you all for contributing okay simulation yes student alright so hi class so i pulled the five of you aside just because i wanted to take a closer look at our answers to the first question for this reading which was what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i alreadyknow all about space 
120.4,Luis,,that's amazing so you will be able to help us navigate this question um so do you want to go first so how did you answer this question ,ya sure ok i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
120.4,Farrah,,that's great i love how you have so much background information about nasa and what tools they use but actually i'd like us all to take a moment to take a look at the question so just independently by yourself read over the question and maybe circle some keywords or phrases that you think might help us in answering what this question is asking so i'll give you all a minute to do that alright did class have enough time yeah all right okay perfect so um let's let's go around does someone want to tell me what words or phrases they circled when looking at this question yeah student yeah student ,i circled water equipment and moon 
230.1,Farrah,,all right thank you so i'm curious so why did you decide to circle equipment ,on because it's like one of the first words in the question what equipment did scientists use 
130.2,Oliver,,yeah so thank you did class else circle equipment also ,um i circled equipment too 
110.1,Oliver,,great ,um i circled equipment too 
230.1,Chris,,oh great so student do you want to tell me why you decided to circle equipment ,okay because it's like when it's asking like what equipment the teacher says right after the the question if it says why did blah blah blah what did blah blah blah then the blah blah blah whatever the unitelligle is is the important one Ya so I circled water on the moon oh and also discover. 
230.1,Chris,,can someone else tell me what other words they circled or phrases that they circled in this question yeah so thank you for sharing that student so let's take a look at discover so why did you circle discover ,because that was the action 
130.2,Farrah,,the action word so did class else circle discover ,I circle just over two because the same thing same class in our English teacher told us about looking for the action word in the in the question. 
210.2,Jazmin,,yeah that's great so i'm glad that we have some agreement so so so far the words that we've talked about our equipment and discover and water on the moon and so based on this what could we guess what do we think what piece of information is this question asking us to find yeah student ,equipment that is on the moon that discovers water 
230.3,Farrah,,yeah so thank you i like how you phrase that we're looking for equipment that's used to discover water that's great but what are we looking for for this specific question yeah student okay so now going back to what student was saying he mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in general which is great ,we're looking for equipment that they used to discover water on the moon but i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.4,Farrah,,do you want to share it with the class yeah okay ,ya so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
230.2,Farrah,,um can you tell me why did you decide to say the word microscope like where did you find that ,okay yeah well first that's equipment and then i found it in the third paragraph 
210.4,Oliver,,"But my question coming after this would be what did they use this microscope for and anyone can answer this question, using the tax and using our discussion, what did the scientists use the microscope to do. ya student ",i have the same answer so in in the text they said that they use the microscope to look really closely at the water 
130.2,Jazmin,,yeah so what does class else think do we agree with what student and student said do we have a different answer what does class think ,i have a different answer but i think that they they did use it to look closely at the water 
120.4,Jazmin,,yeah i agree i do think that they use the microscope to look closely at the water but student do you want to share your answer ,yeah okay um let me see i don't remember oh yeah that nasa sent a small machine 
230.1,Jazmin,,alright so nasa sent a small machine so can you tell me why did you say that ,okay i was looking for equipment and i know that a machine is equipment and that in that paragraph they were talking about why did i say that oh look for ice deposit so they were looking for i'm looking for ice which is like discovering and looking for i think are kind of the same thing 
230.1,Oliver,,yeah Chris? ,i was thinking about equipment and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen manks oxygen tanks and masks and suits ya student 
420.2,Oliver,,yeah that's great again i love the background info but just to make sure that we're all on the same page let's focus on the information that's in the text but maybe in the future when we're going further you can use all your nasa experience that'd be great ,i'm sorry i was looking at the clock and it's time for the next class so we'll see you next time okay 
230.3,Luis,,okay thank you alright so hello again so right before lunch we were talking about how in this question which i will read again quickly what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon we decided that we were looking for equipment that is used to discover water on the moon and just very quickly so vana brought up the idea that she said that it was a microscope was used to find the water and then we're talking with student about the small machine that she identified in the text so we're going to start there but yes student ,i got this all figured out so i'm good 
120.4,Luis,,oh yeah do you want to share with the class ,yeah yeah okay so we're talking about equipment and discover and water and so student was like well you know how come it's not mine because microscope is equipment and i think that farrah's right 
230.1,Luis,,all right well why do you think that's farrah's right ,okay class she said it's equipment i looked at paragraph six and it does talk about water on the moon so it's got all the key things 
130.2,Jazmin,,so i know that we're talking with student when we left off and student also said that she agreed with what student said that the microscope is used to look at the water on the moon mm hmm so let's let's let's ask the rest of the class but student what else are you going to add ,well okay so i do think it's used to look at the water on the moon but i guess i had a different answer so i'm not sure either um 
150.1,Jazmin,,we're gonna figure it out together ,okay 
120.4,Jazmin,,so do you want to offer your answer what was your different answer ,yeah well i said nasa had a small machine because that was but that was a paragraph to paragraph three 
210.4,Chris,,mm hmm yeah so why don't we take a look at paragraph two together so can class take a moment and maybe just reread paragraph two to yourself so we already identified that in paragraph three there's a microscope as a tool can class find a tool in paragraph two ,um it said The lunar orbiter in paragraph two. 
130.2,Oliver,,did class else identify that as a tool in this paragraph ,Oh yeah I saw that one. 
210.4,Luis,,yeah so what do we think is the function of the lunar orbiter in this paragraph ,okay it says that the moon south pole and look for is deposited in a large polar crater so that's what it that's 
130.2,Jazmin,,can someone rephrase what student just said what does the lunar lunar orbiter do ,it looks for um i was gonna say the same thing it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater um 
130.2,Jazmin,,yeah ,that's the same thing that student said it looks for ice in polar craters 
210.2,Farrah,,yeah so so what does class else think what do we think the lunar orbiter is doing it's looking for ice yeah and so let's take a look at the question again what is the question asking us to find ,okay oh what equipment is used to find water i'm still kind of confused 
210.2,Farrah,,yeah so let's let's keep talking about it so so what what do we think the question is asking ,um okay we are it's asking us about equipment that used to discover water on the moon 
120.4,Oliver,,yeah so we're looking for equipment that you should discover water on the moon and we already talked about how the microscope was used to look at the water and we also talked about how the lunar orbiter was used to find water so using these all of this information what are we thinking ,okay yeah i got it so what the teacher saying student it's a microscope was used to look at the water but the lunar orbiter it was used to look for the water 
130.2,Chris,,what does class else think do they agree with what student said ,i think so um let me see it it'll look for ice deposits oh yeah it's looking for that okay yeah it's looking for the ice deposits okay you know what i read that there could be a piece on the moon by 2024 
110.3,Chris,,yeah that's definitely really cool and i'm excited to see that ,i agree with what student said 
530.1,Oliver,,but let's just go back to the first thing you said so you said that oh yes the lunar orbiter is looking for the ice deposits on the moon so do you agree or disagree with what student said alright perfect so if class could take a moment to just think about this question again and maybe answer in the format of like before our conversation i thought that the answer was this or i didn't know the answer or i was still confused or just before our conversation this is what i thought and then after the conversation that we just had now i think ,okay i think i'm ready i'm before our conversation i thought a microscope was thought right answer um and after our conversation i see that it's the lunar orbiter 
120.4,Jazmin,,what did class else write ,i said before a conversation i said nasa send a small machine but now i see that 
120.4,Jazmin,,you're off to a great start so you said they found a small machine and now you think what was the second half of your sentence ,they sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
130.2,Farrah,,okay so does class else have a different response for the second half of their sentencing saying now what do i think after the conversation So something different than the Lunar orbiter yeah yeah. ,i was gonna before conversation i thought it was a microscope oh cuz it was looking at water but now i know it's a lunar orbiter because it was looking for what 
310.1,Oliver,,yeah student yeah so thank you for offering the different functions of different tools so that was a great revision ,our teacher i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say that i i appreciate how you kept asking us questions you know to like think about the words in the question and on the words in the story so so now i'm thinking about my strategy for thinking if that makes sense 
150.1,Luis,,yeah thank you for sharing that yeah okay hi class thanks for joining me here today so we just read a short passage about water on the moon and i got to read all of your responses and i just wanted to see if we could go around the classroom and have class repeat their responses and see if we can maybe engage in some sort of discussion about it before we do that i believe student has a question for us yes even ,um yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
140.1,Luis,,oh wow that's really interesting are you really passionate about space ,oh yeah i lot of space and i really want to be an astronaut when i grow up 
140.1,Luis,,how does that sound that seems like it would be a very cool job well since you know so much about space and space exploration maybe you can after we have our small class discussion tell us some interesting facts oh ,that's right i would love to share some of my space 
120.4,Farrah,,okay cool i think we are all really excited to hear what you have to say so i'm going to go ahead and start with student i know you have your paper in front of you student would you mind reading aloud what answer you gave to that question we had ,yeah okay so um i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Farrah,,okay great so you talked about a scientific tool called a microscope can you tell me a little bit about what they use the microscope to look at ,okay so because when they found the water it was really small they have to see it on they have to use the microscope to look at it they can't see it without the microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah great response they use a microscope to look at the small small specks of water exactly have you ever used a microscope before ,oh yeah we have them in the science lab we use them in science 
120.4,Jazmin,,oh great can you class raise your hand if any of you have used a microscope dub student student or student oh wow okay perfect so you class are all familiar with that scientific tool thank you for your answer student let's see who would like to read the response next do we have any volunteers yeah perfect go ahead student ,ok so my answer is nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,well your answer is not wrong you're actually really correct nasa did send a small machine i just wanted to ask you if you could share a little bit about what this machine with this machine was used for ,um okay so it says they sent it to investigate in craters to find that water 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah exactly they sent these machines into or onto the moon to see if they could investigate and actually look for the water perfect answer student do you happen to remember what the small machine was called or do you want to look back into the text see if you can find some evidence ,can i look back 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah definitely ,okay it says nasa send a small machine oh oh it's right here and a lunar orbiter 
110.1,Oliver,,alright so we have had student and student share their answers so far and we have student student and they've left with either one of you like to volunteer to go next yep exactly student a lunar orbiter good job yeah go for it student ,um okay so i circled the fame of student about the microscope and i'm a little unclear about why the microscope is that the wrong answer because you said that jazmin's answer was a right answer 
230.3,Oliver,,that is a very good question so jazmin's answer was correct but your answer is also correct because this question has multiple answers to it so remember our question is asking about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and we learned a bit about how this is a really big endeavor so there wasn't just one piece of equipment that scientists use there's actually many pieces of equipment and tools so student student pointed out one and then you also pointed out another one similar to student which was a microscope correct ,yeah yeah we pick that same one 
120.4,Chris,,okay perfect sounds good let's see we have student and student left would either of you like to go okay go for it student ,okay well so two things one for my answer i said well that scientists be found creators full of water on the moon and so actually i went to nasa and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.1,Chris,,yeah you're right they use tons of equipment like the ones that you mentioned and you kind of talked about how um they found craters full of water on the moon can i ask you what makes you say that ,okay so when part one they say that the scientists found evidence that water can be found in the moon's polar creators so i know that craters are these big score so sort of like holes but above ground and so i'm picturing these critters full of water like lakes of water because craters are so big 
210.4,Chris,,yeah they are really been a you're correct so you had mentioned that you visit a nasa before correct and so out of all that you got to see there which one of those has been mentioned in this passionate in this passage in which one of those do you believe help the scientists get to these craters and actually find the water ,oh like pick one of the ones in the story 
210.4,Chris,,yeah exactly ,oh okay um well i think student sounds really good about the lunar orbiter i don't know if i saw that one but i definitely saw other small machines that they launched into space 
140.1,Chris,,oh wow did you get a chance to take any pictures maybe you could bring them to class and show us one day ,oh yeah my dad took so many pictures it was actually kind of embarrassing 
120.4,Luis,,i definitely feel you there my parents used to take a lot of pictures whenever we went anywhere when i was a kid so i can definitely relate to that embarrassment but thank you so much for your answer student and i think it is now time to move on to student are you ready to share your answer student ,yeah i am so my answer i said well if kind of like kara since actually cuz i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
230.1,Luis,,okay and what makes you say that they use oxygen tanks ,yeah well if there's astronauts up there on the moon i know 100 they have oxygen tanks 
230.1,Luis,,sorry can you repeat that one more time student ,oh yeah i said if there's astronauts on the moon i know for sure without a doubt that they have oxygen tanks 
230.1,Luis,,exactly and where have you seen that information before ,oh it's like and anything that space you say the astronauts with their oxygen tanks 
210.3,Luis,,okay so oxygen tanks is a really important tool like you had mentioned earlier obviously they would not be able to breathe give me one second okay i'm just gonna ask student a quick question student so can you tell me what other tools or equipment may have been used to discover water so oxygen tanks are used to help the scientists breathe it if they go out to space but what do you think they use to discover water ,and um well i'm i gotta admit i didn't really read this but i listened to the conversation and i heard myself and i heard lunar orbiter 
150.1,Luis,,okay sounds good was there a reason you were unable to read this passage or anything that i can assist you with ,i'm now i think i was probably just thinking about my own space and watching videos on youtube 
150.1,Luis,,okay sounds good well maybe next time we can try and read our passage first and then see if we can come back and spend some time on those extra tasks without sound okay so that we can make sure that we're fully in the conversation right ,uh huh okay 
150.1,Oliver,,thank you even yes there is there you had to raise your hand for so long ,oh that's okay um i just actually needed to say that i looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to each one of us i felt like you really gave each one of us attention and helped us understand our answers and the text even better so thank you so much 
150.1,Luis,,thank you class for all of your responses i hope to see you class soon friends how are you doing today okay yes student ,i don't think i should be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,oh yeah i remember our conversation from last time when you were talking about how much you know about space definitely well i'm going to go ahead and share the game plan with you for today and then maybe we can talk about why i felt like we should all be talking together in a small class to learn from each other does that sound okay ,yeah okay 
150.1,Luis,,thank you student for being such a class player alright so our plan for today is that i am going to give each of you class some time to read over your responses to the question that i had originally asked which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon after you class get some time to think about your responses individually i am going to either pair you up with a partner or speak to you individually about your response and we'll kind of talk about why you wrote that response and maybe some ways that we could improve your response after that we are going to give each of you some time maybe two or three minutes to revise your response and then we will share with our small class does that sound like a good plan can i get a thumbs up yeah yeah okay ,that's a good plan yeah 
120.4,Chris,,okay sounds good alright so right now i am going to give each of you individually 30 seconds to read over your response and think about what made you write that response alright so our question is why did you choose to write that response so starting now i'm going to give you about 30 seconds to think about that alright perfect now i am going to have dave and student partner up and talk to each other about what you were just thinking about okay does that sound good student and student i want you to partner up and do the same and student you and i are going to spend some time together and be partners for today all right perfect so student can you go ahead and read your response to me ,yeah okay um so i wrote down that all scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
230.1,Chris,,great and what made you write that answer can you tell me a little bit little bit about that ,yeah our teacher told us to look for kind of the keyword so it's looking for scientists and finding and water on the moon and so that's how i found it in the first paragraph 
120.2,Chris,,oh i really like that strategy of looking for keywords i think that that can be really helpful i'm i'm actually really happy that you chose to use that strategy do you think you can rephrase that question and put it in your own words so let's look at the question again it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon ,all okay oh wow oh what scientists used to find water 
210.2,Chris,,great so what what is the question asking for are they asking for um what was found on the moon or are they asking for what tools or equipment was used to find water on the moon what do you think ,what tools or equipment was us 
410.2,Chris,,yeah i agree so i think that that's exactly what the question is asking it says what equipment did they use so let's think back to your answer because your answer says that they found craters full of water on the moon and one thing that i'm concerned about is that maybe your response doesn't exactly answer the question ,well i mean i went to nasa so i know that um scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
120.4,Jazmin,,"yeah you're absolutely correct they do use all that equipment that sound good i'll give you about a few minutes to do that, while I go talk to another okay. all right great all right student and student let's hear what you class have been talking about yes ",i you don't understand why my answers wrong 
120.4,Farrah,,okay can you give me just one second while i talked to student and student maybe you and student can talk about why you chose your answers and what you think is different between your answers all right i'll be right here all right student and student how is it going what have you class been discussing ,well i was talking about that i i picked up a microscope because it had all the keywords and not section of all story and i was saying that um they had equipment and this was the only place where they were really talking about equipment and water 
310.1,Oliver,,what are some keywords okay well i think that it's great that you class have been looking for keywords when i was speaking with student he also he also mentioned the same thing and i think that that's a really great strategy that you picked out from the question itself did you class think about that ,oh well we both said equipment um well i said equipment to discover water on the moon umpretty much all of them 
230.3,Oliver,,but i'm going to pick the one that student mentioned about equipment yeah i agree it seems like all of the all of the words in the question are really important so it looks like you class have come to the understanding that the question is asking what equipment did scientists use which is a microscope correct. yeah ,yeah yeah yeah we talked about the microscope 
210.2,Oliver,,so the question is also asking um what equipment do they use to discover water on the moon and i'm concerned that the responses that you class chose which is a microscope isn't necessarily used to discover water on the moon can either you class tell me what discover means yes this ,i'm okay i know what discover means um i mean like when you're looking for something and on you will find it on but i also i just saw the clock and i just heard that it's time for us to go 
210.2,Oliver,,okay ,bye 
150.1,Luis,,bye thank you okay start simulation all right class thank you for sharing your responses with our small class we are going to run one by one i'm going to ask each of you a question which is what made you say that and after you have shared your answer with me i am going to have you listened to our other friends responses all right and i want you to think about their thinking as well as you're thinking yes student ,excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,yes i remember you talking about how much you know about nasa and space and you think you've shared some interesting facts with us last time well we are going to learn today after our conversation about ways in which all of us can improve our responses so even though we may know a lot about space there's still room for improvement for all of us and so that's why we've all been working together on the side all right student ,okay 
230.1,Luis,,thank you for sharing though and thanks for being a class player all right student actually why don't we have you start off first so your response to our question was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen things can you tell me what made you say that ,well they may say yes well i know they use a lot of equipment like in order to go to space they gotta breathe in breathe out oxygen tank so that's like good equipment 
420.3,Luis,,i agree oxygen tanks are an important piece of equipment for astronauts so i really like that you included that in your response but one thing that i'm concerned about a bit is that i don't remember oxygen tanks being talked about in the passage alright so while i go ahead and talk to my other friends i want you to look back into the passage and see if you can underline what equipment you read in the passage all right ,okay okay 
230.1,Jazmin,,okay perfect thank you alright student let's go on to you so you said that nasa sent a small machine so why did you choose to write about small machine can you tell me a little bit about that ,yeah i was looking for the answer and well in the second paragraph and when i saw machine i know that's like equipment and this one's talking about finding are looking for ice deposit so i figured that was it yeah i don't understand why my answers wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,yes well i really value that you talked about a small machine and that you went back into the passage to look for evidence that supports your answer second paragraph does talk about a small machine that nasa used but i want you to think about a little bit about how you can make your answer more detailed and specific okay so while you work on that i'm going to go ahead and move to our other friends does that sound good student or do you have any questions alright so think about adding some more details to your response based off what else is mentioned in passage to ,um so you're saying i just gotta find more details and then add them to my answer 
120.4,Chris,,yes in response to the question about what equipment was used to discover water okay thank you student alright student can you go ahead and read your response to me student ,yeah sure i said um scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
230.2,Chris,,great and what makes you say that where did you find that information ,in the first paragraph um yeah it's i took it right out of the text says all water can be found deep within the bones bone craters great and then i kind of put it in my own words 
310.1,Chris,,can you look back at the question and tell me what do you think the question is asking you for if you can tell me in maybe just two or three words what is the question asking all right i appreciate you paraphrasing that and putting it into your own words ,for equipment the scientists use equipment that scientists use for water 
150.1,Chris,,"All right, so equipment and discover now you talked in your response about scientists finding craters on the moon, which is absolutely correct, but I am concerned that your answer doesn't completely align with what the question is asking. so given that we've talked about the two words equipment and discover and we've talked about your answer i want you to see how you can revise your answer to align with what the question is asking does that make sense ",okay okay so you know as for for well for equipment i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
420.2,Oliver,,you're right they do use all of those pieces of equipment i want you to not let's not answer out loud but i just want you to think about are those pieces of equipment that you saw nasa used to discover water on the moon or they used for a different purpose so i want you to think about that a little bit okay and see if you can use the answer to that question revise your answer thank you student alright if student and student i see that you class had a similar answer right student you said that you i'm in your answer you talked about a microscope as a scientific tool to look really closely and they've used to that you circled the same thing for your response so i want you that can you tell me i know that in your answer you said you circle the same as student but can you put the answer to the question in your own words ,okay sure um so i say the answer is okay well i circle this part of the text on the answer is on the equipment you need as a microscope to look closely at the water 
230.1,Oliver,,okay great thank you so they've been student what made you class really focus on the microscope can you tell me a little bit about what you were thinking when you really highlighted or underline the word microscope and included it in your response either one of you class can share yeah ,well i can share um okay so i was thinking you know um first off we have to find a piece of equipment and so i know when we're in science class the teacher is always like okay we're going to use some science department to base or remember what you have to do and what sometimes we have goggles and sometimes we use the microscope so when i saw that one i was like okay max definitely equipment and then um i was looking for a place on the story where they're talking about scientists using it and on them discovering water and ballpark right before it says the water they found is microscopic and finding is like discovering and so that's how i came up with i don't know if i sing for you student 
120.4,Farrah,,what do you think student do you want to share a little bit about your thoughts ,um well i guess yeah that's that's similar for me because i was looking for equipment and i saw the microscope and arm and i was looking for kind of the water on the moon part of it and i saw that in um in that paragraph three 
310.1,Chris,,because that's what the question is asking for it's asking for a piece of equipment student did you have a question great well i really appreciate how you class chose to look for a piece of equipment ,wasn't a question teacher i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch on what i wanted to say thank you for asking me those questions about my answer and taking some time to kind of explain how my ideas were connected and how they were connected so now i have some ideas on how to make my answer better 
310.1,Chris,,thank you student thanks for sharing that i hope you class have a good lunch bye ,bye teacher 
310.1,Luis,,hi students i think you just finish answering a really important question about the moon do you have a question student ,oh yeah well actually i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,oh maybe you can help us a little bit as we think about the question i'm so glad that you already know a lot about space um do you want to share one thing with us ,what 
110.3,Luis,,do you want to share one thing with us that you know about space ,oh oh yes i do okay my favorite thing about space is how pluto it used to be a planet and then then they like kicked it out of being a planet because it was too small it's like poor pluto too small company 
120.3,Oliver,,that's funny i have heard about that i heard about that on the news so that's great that you know something about pluto i think today we'll talk a little bit about water on the moon because that's what we read about in our article so maybe um i wonder if student could you repeat the question back to us if you have it handy ,yeah okay right here on the question as what equipment that scientists use or discover water on the moon 
210.4,Jazmin,,great and so if we think about what we read in the text and we try to consider this word equipment that might give us a little clue for what we're looking for and so student i really like how you found the word machine in the text because i find that that word machine is kind of similar to the word equipment so student maybe you can look at the text and tell us um what's the machine called that you were looking for i think it was in the maybe the second paragraph ,oh let me check okay so nasa such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
110.4,Farrah,,that's perfect thank you student so i think part of a great answer for us when we're thinking about what's the equipment that the scientists use is exactly what student just said she called it a lunar orbiter do you have a question student or maybe something you want to add ,yeah well um i said i said that the answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answers wrong 
210.4,Luis,,oh i don't think that that's wrong i think that you bring up a really good point because you found information in a different paragraph so what student just said was in the third paragraph and she's talking about the tool called a microscope so i think if we consider what student said and we add what student said we might get a more complete picture of what scientists need to find water on the moon does class want to tell me what they think the word microscopic means like what comes to your mind when you hear the word microscopic ,i got this one i got this one 
210.4,Luis,,thanks student go for it ,yeah okay microscopic means so so so small 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah that's awesome so if we think about what we already know from the text we've got this thing called a lunar orbiter and then we've got what student said which was the microscope so these might be different pieces of equipment or tools that scientists are using to find water on the moon and so has class here ever seen or used a microscope before ,oh yeah we all use them in science class 
210.4,Chris,,awesome student do you want to tell me like what can you do when you use a microscope ,well you can you can see things that you couldn't really see without it you can see bacteria and cells 
210.4,Chris,,yeah that's awesome thanks student i always think it's kind of fun to consider the fact that like we use our eyes to see everything around us but there's so much more in this universe that we can't see without a microscope it's pretty incredible to think about so ,also oh can i add one thing 
210.4,Chris,,yeah please go ahead student ,well okay well it's just that i i went to nasa actually and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like the oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.1,Luis,,yeah um i think that you mentioned that someone mentioned oxygen tanks in their answer ,that was me that was me i also had that same idea 
230.1,Luis,,yeah so why do you think that scientists at nasa might want to use something like an oxygen tank when they're going to do their work on the moon ,well without oxygen tanks they wouldn't be able to breathe out in space they couldn't do anything without the oxygen tanks they'd just die 
130.1,Jazmin,,yeah so i think based on what class has shared we realize the scientists need lots of different tools to do their work right so i think the three that we've identified so far all together will will lead us to a great answer and i think specifically when we look at the text two have those specific pieces of equipment are mentioned explicitly in the text student do you want to say something ,yeah well that was that was gonna be my question because i mean i picked the small machine and and i understand also microscope is in there but i don't think i would have thought to put oxygen tanks because it's not really in the story so am i wrong if i don't say that 
420.2,Oliver,,"no that's a great point student i don't think you're wrong if you don't say that because like you said it's not mentioned in the text Because by looking at what you found in the text, you have answered the question correctly, so we can always update our answers, and we can add more information that we hear our classmates sharing. ",well i'm i'm i'm really sorry about this i just looked at the clock i'm actually we are we have to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for letting us know how important our our knowledge is and the things we know and how there's more than one right answer to this question it was really great to learn that with you today 
420.2,Luis,,thanks that it was really nice spending time with you all enjoy your lunch okay hi class how are you ,i'm good excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
120.2,Jazmin,,oh i'm so excited you know a lot about space student you know i noticed that in one of your answers for a question we're going to talk about it did seem like you have some great background knowledge of space so i think that's really going to help the class when we go through these questions together so maybe you can share some of that with us in a minute student okay um so yeah i think the one thing i noticed when i was looking at our answers to today's questions is that i think we've got a little bit of room to expand our understanding of the text so i think if we chat together and put some of these pieces together we're all going to end up with really improved answers so i think for this first question and so you all had answers that i'd like to draw on and i think i want to start with student student can you tell us what you said for this first question the first question i saw was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,yeah i said nasa sent a small machine 
120.4,Farrah,,because i think of machines and equipment and in us in the same way i think that those words are synonyms um awesome and so what i really like about what you said student is this word machine that you mentioned yeah and then i also noticed that student and student you class took a similar approach when you are looking at the text because i i think you class used a different word maybe student do you mind telling us what you mentioned for your answer ,yeah i said microscope was the equipment 
120.4,Oliver,,student you said the same thing ,yeah i think the microscope was the equipment they used 
120.4,Luis,,great student when i read your answer you use the word tool to describe the microscope and so i think that that's another great word when we're thinking of different types of equipment mentioned and so let's just keep those words in our heads as we talk through this so we've got what type of equipment and student you mentioned a machine And then Farrah you use that word tool student i want to come back to you hun because you mentioned um some other things that you know that scientists might use on the moon do you want to tell us about what you think scientists may use on the moon ,yeah yeah so an important piece of equipment as an oxygen tank like they need those so they can breathe 
120.4,Chris,,yeah of course and that's going to come back again later when we talk about our next question student you mentioned what the scientists were doing on the moon do you want to tell us what the scientists were doing on the moon ,um so they're looking for water right and then they find water deep in these craters so like they found a whole bunch of craters with a whole lot of water 
120.4,Jazmin,,yeah student do you have something to add ,but i guess i don't understand why my answers wrong 
120.3,Jazmin,,yeah let's take a look at that um i think if you all have your text in front of you it might be a great time to take a look at jazmin's answer and see how we can pull out a specific name of a piece of equipment if you class can all look at that second paragraph that starts with the word nasa student do you mind reading that first sentence out loud ,nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
230.3,Chris,,can you tell us now that you just read that sentence again what was the name of that machine yeah great and so um I think of work to put all of these pieces together into a full answer. student tells us what the scientists were doing on the moon student knows all these different types of equipment that scientists use that maybe aren't mentioned in the text and then student you just identified for us a specific piece of equipment that the article mentions is us on the moon when scientists are looking for water so that's called our lunar orbiter so we can include that in our answer and then i also liked what student and student mentioned about the microscope as another piece of equipment another tool that the scientists use so go ahead student ,to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks 
230.2,Oliver,,absolutely i think that we could probably come up with a really long list if we used our brains and thought about every single little thing that they might need a might need they might need tools from a traditional toolbox as well i'm sure they need lots of different things as they do their exploration on the moon i think it's nice though when we read a text if we can scan the text for specific pieces of equipment then that way when we write our answers out if i ever asked you can you tell me what paragraph you found that in you'd be able to point to that exact part of the text so i think student you did just that when you just re read that beginning of paragraph two student maybe you can tell us can you tell us where in the text you found that word microscope ,yeah that was in paragraph three 
120.3,Luis,,okay great um student do you want to read that paragraph three for us maybe just focusing on the last sentence there ,you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Oliver,,yeah and so when we're talking about this specific article in what the scientists need to find water on the moon it looks like we've got these two different components here the microscope because those water molecules are super duper tiny and then we've got that lunar orbiter as another piece of equipment what do you think that they were using that lunar orbiter for it says this lunar orbiter will land on the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in the large polar crater student that sounds like a little bit of your answer what do you class think that lunar orbiter was doing on the moon ,looks like it's looking for deposit yeah i'm sorry teacher but it's time for us to go. 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay okay thanks class great work ,bye 
150.1,Luis,,let's start simulation well thanks for sharing your responses to the second question class i think again we have a great opportunity to take a look at the text to share with each other how we're thinking about this question and how we found our responses using the text so we've got a new question that's is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be invaluable and so i think that we've got two folks who said no one person who said yes and then two people answered by talking through some of the evidence so maybe if we kind of glue all of this together we can come up with a clear answer so can you raise your hand if you said no that the water on the moon is not valuable ,teacher okay i think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good 
110.1,Luis,,because i was wondering if we could raise our hand if we said that no the water was not valuable oh okay um so maybe could you hold off for one sec student ,okay 
120.4,Luis,,"Luis let's come back to you because you mentioned something from the text that's so interesting and I hadn't thought of this before, why do you think that water. well first of all can you tell us what you said what can we do with that water ",i said that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
230.3,Luis,,and that was in the tax student can you tell me where in the text you found those words hydrogen and oxygen yeah and so i think that if we consider that this this water might not be ready yet like student and student said what might happen in the future is what student just said ,yeah it's in paragraph five 
210.4,Luis,,yeah great and so i saw that as well what student do you think that according to the text astronauts might be able to do with the hydrogen and the oxygen ,okay well i know that we can breathe oxygen and so they could breathe it oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel yeah so rocket fuel 
110.4,Farrah,,yeah that's great and so that fuel is really necessary student i know you know a ton about outer space and so you probably know that we need to fuel these rockets to get around outer space and so i think that student just identified one of the reasons why water on the moon might be a valuable resource in the future ,yeah well i'm still kind of confused 
230.1,Farrah,,student do you have a question still kind of confused okay well let's keep thinking through this um is there anything in particular that's confusing you right now student ,well because if luis's right then that will mean that i'm wrong but i think that i think that i i came up with a good answer based on the text too 
230.1,Farrah,,yeah and so maybe you can clarify your thinking for us a little bit why do you think that maybe they're not ready to use the water yet ,okay because they talked about how like it costs a lot of money and it'll take a lot of time which means that it's going to be a long time before you can do anything with it 
230.3,Chris,,yeah absolutely i agree with you and you know what you just said student made me think a little bit about like there's deposits of minerals and oil underneath the earth's surface and so the oil just sitting underneath your surface itself might not be valuable and like you mentioned we need time and we need money to extract those valuable things and so i think you bring up this good point that even though it might not be ready now the value might be there in the future does that make sense student okay cool and then i also saw that student you raise a totally different point that's also really important and so i wonder can you tell us where he where did you find that part in the text he student yeah about how heavy water is and the need to carry water on the ships to to the moon and other locations in our universe ,own oh yeah okay in paragraph four it says for example was this it could be useful lots of ways for example future astronauts could drink this water water is heavy it takes up a lot of romana spacecraft having water available in the moment me more room on the spacecraft thing 
120.2,Chris,,yeah and so kind of tying what student read back to what student was asking like why isn't that answer correct that it's not ready to be used yet student part of what you read said future astronauts could drink this water so i think right now we're still in this like hypothetical state where we're thinking maybe in the future might this be valuable and so i think if we kind of know yeah maybe we can glue all of these ideas together and come back to this question is there convincing evidence that water could be water on the moon could be valuable ,"When you were talking about the future, I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024. "
150.1,Oliver,,yeah i mean it's really incredible to think about the progress we could make and all the discoveries we can make and so in our first question we were talking about different types of equipment scientists use you all seem to know a little bit about that now and now thinking about like if we do make it back to the moon and we're looking for water might it be valuable for our future scientists student go ahead yeah ,i see that it's almost time for us to go but i am thinking now okay so like it's not ready yet but i'm like student said like maybe by 2024 if they build a base on the moon then they could not have to carry the water there by 2024 and then it would be valuable 
110.1,Oliver,,yeah that's exactly right that's what i'm thinking to face is pretty incredible so we'll have to wait and find out what these scientists come up with ,well i want to say teacher thank you for when you you asked us all so many questions to try and find out what what we're thinking and i tell you like you know when you were telling me that my idea was still a good idea so thank you for that 
120.3,Luis,,thank you class okay so class had such great ideas and responses to the question and i loved hearing everybody's ideas about the articles and about water on the moon i want us to take a look though back at the question that was being asked and i want us to think about oh yes student ,um yeah excuse me um i shouldn't be in this class already know all about space 
120.3,Jazmin,,oh well that's great so you can actually help our class and share everything that you know so that that's a great um you are a great addition to the class now we're going to look at back at the question to think about what is this question asking so can class read for me the question that we need to answer student ,okay so the question is what equipment that scientists to use to discover water on the moon 
420.1,Farrah,,what's a specific part of that question that we need to look at and think about student ,i think an important part of the question is the part about equipment 
230.2,Oliver,,oh ok so the part about equipment i agree i think that is a key part of the question that we might need to dig into to figure out the answers we need to go back to the article um so thinking about equipment that scientists use discover water on the moon um does class have an idea of maybe which paragraph we might look to student ,um yeah um i found my answer in paragraph three 
230.2,Oliver,,okay can you explain that a little bit and why you looked at paragraph three ,um yeah so paragraph three they were talking about a scientific tool it says that mo story and that's on microscope 
210.4,Oliver,,okay what did they use what did they say you need a microscope for can you find that in the text ,um yeah that says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
210.4,Oliver,,oh ok so to look really closely at what ,i thought tiny teeny tiny water 
110.1,Jazmin,,does class have any other ideas on where we might okay okay so we have a microscope that we can look at to see the teeny tiny water look to paragraph two or to another paragraph student ,i found some way different def i found my answer from paragraph two and i said nasa send a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
130.2,Chris,,okay so you're actually on the right track um i would not i wouldn't say your answer is wrong want to build off of either what Jazmin or Oliver said about the equipment remember there when but that scientists use Chris. ,well so for my answer i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon but it doesn't new equipment and my answer but that's how i answered the question 
110.1,Jazmin,,so i want to go back to what student said so student can you read actually the first sentence of paragraph to read the whole sentence where you found the answer okay okay thank you thank you for sharing ,it says nasa such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
120.3,Jazmin,,oh okay so can you keep going and read the next sentence ,is lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater 
210.4,Oliver,,oh okay these ice has a very small so what did we think what did we what do we think of of what student just read so she said nasa send a small machine and what was the machine can class tell me student ,okay so she found a machine was called the lunar orbiter 
120.4,Chris,,ah ok so lunar orbiter do we think that might be the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon student what do you think ,well so i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.3,Farrah,,"yeah that's actually i love that you brought that background knowledge with you and we can definitely add that into our answer Paragraph two, which Jazmin mentioned the Lunar orbiter because that's right there that we just read right. ",but what about the microscope 
120.3,Farrah,,ah ok that's a great point so let's go back to the microscope so what does it say what does it say on paragraph three about the microscope um can class start reading with the sentence that says the second sentence and paragraph three student ,can i read it okay the second sentence mm hmm the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it 
210.4,Farrah,,oh ok so the water they found is microscopic so you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it okay so yeah they use that i guess choose so that is also evidence of the text that we can use to answer this question um so i guess they were investigating right with the equipment and they help the microscope the microscope also help them look closely ,oh umso like they're both the answer 
130.2,Oliver,,um what do you what do you all think def ,um well actually i was just gonna say that i just looked at the clock and it's actually time for us to go and i'll watch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us find that important part of the question because that helps our discussion really help us get to the answer so thank you so much 
130.2,Chris,,you're welcome thank you all for a great discussion hello ,hi teacher 
150.1,Luis,,now that all of you have shared your responses i'd like for you to sit face to face and have a class discussion of your responses to see whether or not you class can figure out like which yeah of course student ,excuse me teacher but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space i guess so ok class i'll be the reporter 
220.1,Farrah,,that's pretty cool then you can you can be the reporter slash facilitator discussion leader for your small class discussion is that all right okay thank you so much then as i've said you class can do a small class discussion for one and a half minutes to figure out whether you you'd like to change your response after the discussion all right and the timing starts now ,okay so student do you want to change your answer or student you want to change your answer now i think my answer is great because i i talked about some equipment so i don't even know why i'm in this class i think my answers okay oh let me see yeah i talked about the craters full of water oh so and that's in the story and we were supposed to pull stuff out of the text so oh i think it's fine well i mean i think the mine is right i got my mind was right and we can't all be right because your answer it's very different student and then even we had equipment but you were talking about oxygen tanks and and i'm just talking about the that small machine that they put on the moon okay so uh we have the same answer so i guess i'm not sure why our answer will be wrong cuz it is equipment ya ya it is equipment let me see cuz when i looked in the story yeah we're talking about equipment that's on the moon uh used to find the water and they used a microscope to look at the water so i mean that sounds like the same thing i mean i don't know let me ask the teacher um teacher student and i don't know why our answer is wrong because we think that we we are right 
110.1,Jazmin,,cool and you class are just on time ,good yeah i don't know why my answers wrong too 
230.1,Farrah,,of course so as student has pointed out you class have very different answers but um um how about we start with your response student and student so you class circled To look really closely is connected to discovering water. ,oh well okay so when you're like looking for water you know and then you gotta look at it once you find it and what how is looking okay well i guess looking at the water is looking for the water oh uh huh oh yeah okay student i see what you're saying um okay oh so if you're looking at the water you're looking for okay yeah okay nevermind those are two different things i i i didn't think about that 
210.2,Oliver,,yeah that's very good student so as you just said you class are looking for the water so if you go into the text and find the similar word to looking for or discover it's going to be investigate ,Okay. 
150.1,Chris,,you class have any more questions ,yeah i had that equipment i said on oxygen tanks in my answer um well okay my question because we were talking about equipment right because student and student had equipment but i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
150.1,Luis,,"I think you're absolutely right that scientists use a lot of equipment to go into the space, but um can you re-read the question to see what it's looking for. ",um okay it's asking us what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon well i mean like they need oxygen tanks to breathe on the moon so ah why is that wrong 
150.1,Jazmin,,well you cannot use oxygen tanks to find the water so basically the oxygen tanks are not leading you to the water so um a fantastic job framing the space. ,"okay i guess i didn't really read it before because i felt like i already knew the answer Okay well so me and Luis have different types of equipment, and so I feel like when you were telling them to look it over I looked at over again, and I still feel like my answer is the right one. "
150.1,Jazmin,,"um Jazmin this think Oh, I think your answer is absolutely on the right track, but. could you be more specific about the small machine because if you just say small machine you could be a lot of different things ",oh okay well let's see nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter okay um yeah i could say nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
510.1,Oliver,,yeah exactly you could specify the small machine and that's a strategy you can use in response questions student ,oh okay well that's easy i can just add that um yeah teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but i just looked at the clock and it's actually time for us to go to lunch um so thanks for everything will see you later okay 
520.1,Luis,,bye bye class hi welcome back from lunch so we'll just pick up from where we left it student as we talked about earlier in the day maybe in the future you can use specifying techniques in your responses ,um okay so i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good 
110.3,Luis,,um how about you just maybe stay with us as a mentor or a specialist ,specialist okay okay i guess i could do that 
110.3,Jazmin,,yeah student ,okay so i added this specific word to my answer so now is it right the nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter yeah 
110.4,Jazmin,,yeah absolutely you're right um nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to discover water and that's your answer right there good job ,oh wait i have to add that part to this to discover water 
150.1,Jazmin,,um naturally yes because well well that makes the response more complete i guess in a way ,oh well cuz you told me that at the name of it so i just added the name of it i didn't add anymore after that 
510.1,Jazmin,,I think you're absolutely right. well in this case adding a name would be sufficient but i i'm talking more about a strategy of specifying your responses instead of just like adding a name into it ,So I guess cuz I was thinking when you say. to specify i'm doesn't that mean just saying what the name of the equipment is so how come you added okay i guess what i don't understand is how come you added more you added the discover discover water part to the answer 
150.1,Jazmin,,um you you you could always just jot down the information in the text to support a full response so that's how you do that but if you have any more questions about this maybe we can talk this talk about this after the session because we should really move on to chris's response ,okay yeah cuz i'm still kind of confused so i guess i'll just ask you after okay 
110.1,Chris,,so student how do you feel about your response at this point yeah thank you so much student ,so i know that jazmin's answer was the right one um that you um nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter uh to discover water um so i guess i'm trying to think about why where i went wrong in mine um because i didn't put any of that stuff in my in my answer 
310.1,Chris,,and i want to go to why do you think the craters are full of water on the moon um i really appreciate your active reflection and self regulation ,well because it says it in the story it says that um let me see where was that scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters so um so if something is found deep that means that it has to be like you know like in the pool when you go and you swim in the pool and you go in the deep end and there's like a lot more water on the deep side of the pool then on the shallow side 
210.4,Chris,,huh oh wow that's a that's a really interesting interesting interpretation of the word deep but the way we can think about this is that the surface of the moon is not like the pool it's maybe more like the soil or a farmland so when you buried the water deep under under the surface it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a huge amount of water yeah then that's pretty cool it's a some solid individual independent thinking and then how do you think you could locate that the textual evidence that student found in the text ,oh okay yeah i was trying to figure out why student tools out when because i was using the words from the from the question in my answer you know like i was looking for discover and i didn't see discover in the text so then i was thinking okay what's like discover like finding something so then i was looking for to find in the text and i only saw it in two parts in the first part and in the third part on that's where class came from and i knew it wasn't the one that i'm no offense student and student but i knew it wasn't the third part cuz um it was supposed to be like a lot of water in order to find it and that they said you couldn't even see that water so i guess i don't see like discover or find a in the second part where student got her answer so i don't know i don't know how you got that answer student 
210.2,Chris,,oh that's interesting um do you think you understand the word investigate ,oh investigate oh yeah i guess so like like on um on the tv show sometimes they have like a like an investigator who goes to get some information 
210.2,Chris,,that's right so investigate can be somewhat equivalent to discovery right ,oh yeah yeah okay yeah 
420.2,Oliver,,but your strategy is absolutely right you locate the keywords in the question and you find them in the text so i think you're on a good track but if you look at the passage too you can find the word investigate ,um you know what teacher i i had read that there will be a base on the moon by 2024 
420.2,Oliver,,mm hmm ,so maybe we'd be able to drink water then by 2024 that's pretty close 
140.1,Oliver,,by 2024 yeah that is but i think it's totally possible but you'd have to be a scientist to figure out how to do that student ,oh yeah and i'm not a scientist i'm i'm just a student 
140.1,Chris,,well you could be ,oh oh man yeah maybe i could be when i when i'm old i just looked at the clock and it's actually time for us to go to our next class but i wanted to say i'm all thank you for helping us to think about what strategy that we use to get to our answer because um i guess listening to how you were talking to student and and student yeah actually i appreciated that too because i i thought i use the a good strategy but you kind of explained on how i need to think about what some of the words mean and so i think that might give me some ideas on improving my answer 
140.1,Farrah,,thank you so much thank you see you soon ,we'll we'll see you next time teacher bye hi hello can you can you see us or hear us 
150.1,Luis,,oh yeah now i can see you sorry my internet was lagging hello hello hi student high student hi student hi student hi student so do you class want to talk about the feedback um know your responses for the question ,um yeah this is student i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,well student if that's the case um you can stay and help the rest of us to understand better about this space is that all right ,yeah yeah i'd love to hear that 
110.3,Farrah,,thank you ,would you like us to to share our responses 
120.4,Oliver,,yeah absolutely do you want to start ,yeah yeah okay i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely um yeah i circled the same the same as student 
110.1,Chris,,mm hmm ,my answer is that i'm okay it's 
110.1,Jazmin,,mm hmm ,that scientists found craters full of water on the moon i said that nasa sent a small machine 
110.1,Luis,,they did yeah ,okay my answer as that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
130.3,Chris,,interesting okay so um for student and student you class located the information in the text very very well for student do you understand what i'm saying you're absolutely right that there's water on the moon inside of the craters but if you look closely in the text you could see that um these are very small pieces of water instead of full of water ,well craters craters are really big 
130.3,Chris,,that word means that the water is small and you cannot just directly see it so the craters are not full of water they contains water yeah um it's true that create crater is a big but the water molecules they found is microscopic ,okay 
130.3,Jazmin,,okay um um for student ,yeah 
130.3,Farrah,,"you're right that nasa a small machine but so basicallyNASA sent this small piece of machine called lunar orbiter to find the water, so the part of finding the water is actually quite important to the to the text. ",um excuse me this is student i i don't understand why my answers are wrong 
150.1,Farrah,,so for you to well it's true that you need a scientific tool card to to look into the water but the scientific tool is not the microscope it's actually called the lunar orbiter so if you look at the second the second piece of the text they said nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so basically the machine they sent is the lunar orbiter does that answer questions the one ,um how can how can you find something that's too small to see don't need a microscope 
120.2,Chris,,well it's true that you need microscope to look really closely but um so that the machine necessary is the lunar orbiter but the scientific tool that they want to use is a microscope so these are two parts of the answer to the question we are but we are investigating what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ,well hi this is student i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.2,Chris,,"I believe in NASA they use a lot of tools, but um in this particular response, where we're looking for evidences from the text so you would need to circle, the evidences in the text for, for example, if you. so student do you see oxygen tanks in this text if you decided that they need oxygen tanks to discover the water you have to find it and located in the text ",huh oh no no they don't talk about that in the story 
150.1,Luis,,yeah absolutely so that's why in this particular response you don't have to include oxygen tanks and student that i believe that kind of answers your question right ,um yeah but if there are scientists like astronauts on the moon they are definitely 100 using oxygen tanks 
150.1,Luis,,is that all right. the real life scenario of the astronauts but rather to comprehend the text and in and try to analyze the information we need within the text ,yeah yeah okay yeah so it's sounding like that aorbiter thing is the answer 
130.1,Oliver,,well it's true that the lunar orbiter could be a part of your answer but um if we're looking at the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon i'm sure in the text you can find more than the lunar orbiter right you have to use the microscope too so um yeah if you if you include both of them in your answer that would be better ,um this is student um i just i just looked at the clock and unfortunately it's it's time for us to go to lunch right now but thank you so much for really helping us use evidence from the text and our answers that's going to be really helpful next time 
230.1,Luis,,thank you so much and i hope class can use this information in your next assignment thank you hi student i think your answer is quite interesting can you explain a little bit ,oh excuse me excuse me 
230.2,Luis,,student i just heard that you said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i'm wondering why did you give us this answer where do you find it in the text ,yeah i think i think i think student has something to say though um and and i'll answer maybe after him um yeah okay um i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,oh student you know a lot of our space and so that's a great thing and it's a class work so i think you might be an expert so give us suggestions in our class work ,yep that sounds great 
110.3,Farrah,,thank you ,okay okay student i guess that's my turn now okay so i found my answer um in part three that's where i found it and it says you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so that's where i found it in the text 
120.3,Farrah,,yes and this is actually showing the text but student i want you to read the question more closely so what does the question ask us ,okay it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
120.1,Farrah,,yeah right so here is a keywords is the the equipment is used to discover water right so and so i think you can get a better answer to something related to discover water ,okay 
120.1,Farrah,,okay so ,what should i do next 
120.3,Jazmin,,and at the same time i want i'm wondering is there any one else have different answers i want you to read closely about the paragraphs the second paragraph ,yes i had a different answer 
120.3,Jazmin,,hi student go ahead ,yes and so i said that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.2,Jazmin,,oh your answer is nasa sent a small machine actually i think it's partially right and let's look at the question the question is what equipment is scientists used to discover water on the moon right so i'm wondering why you say why you locate your answer at the second paragraph what evidence do you use to your answer ,okay yeah so i think my evidence is the first sentence in paragraph two where it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and i would say that that's my evidence 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay good so um can you tell me like what is lunar orbiter and and what it's for ,yes i can okay a lunar orbiter it sounds like so it sounds like it investigates so that means it kind of looks for and locates where is the water on the moon 
230.2,Jazmin,,okay very good very good so actually and where did you find this answer ,in part two 
230.2,Jazmin,,yeah yeah just in the following sentence right ,yeah exactly 
420.2,Chris,,"yeah i think this and very good strategy like we can use the next time when we found something we just can't quite understand The following sentence just explain what was the what is lunar orbiter and what is for. So yeah Jamines, I think your answer and if your answer can be more specific to the name of the machine and your answer qould be perfect. Yes, Chris. ",yeah so i wanted to say um i i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they actually use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
520.1,Chris,,"oh yeah it's so great you've been to nasa and it's true that this nasa scientists will use a lot of tools to find the things that you they want So the next time when you answer this questions so be sure to look for your information, your answers in the text. so i think that ",ok 
520.1,Chris,,yeah so can you look at this go ahead ,oh i was just gonna say that makes a lot of sense i understand i need to find equipment in the story right 
110.1,Oliver,,yeah yeah right ,um excuse me i'm i'm really sorry i don't want to interrupt but actually i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us look really specifically in the text and making sure that we had evidence for our answers i know that that's going to be really helpful for questions like this next time 
150.1,Luis,,oh sure thank you thank you so much hi class so i'm mr z and you class are going to work with me today to work with the text about a moon is a desert and we're going to go through the reading together and all here to answer any questions yes ,um yeah mr see i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
210.4,Farrah,,well even then then you can sit with us to help the other students help understand the text a bit more can you do that for me student all right thank you alright so again we have that question about what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon and i loved your responses and i just want to know a little bit more about it because i'm looking at the text and i'm a little confused too so student you mentioned that there's a microscope what is a microscope and what does it do for us ,okay so a microscope it's something you look through and when you look through it it makes really tiny things on so you can see that 
210.4,Farrah,,and oliveron when adept when we were using the microscope what the scientists want to fight ,oh so they wanted to find the water which was really actually like really tiny pieces of ice 
210.4,Chris,,good good and harry can you tell me what was that machine that small machine that they used to find the water ,oh 
210.4,Jazmin,,Anyone raise their hand to try and Jason. ,and so that was actually my answer to nasa send a small machine and i found it in paragraph two and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,oh you're so well what does that small machine do can class look at paragraph two and tell me what is that small machine do i guess even okay ,well i'm paragraph to it says it looks for ice in the polar craters 
210.4,Oliver,,hmm very good and why can't the machine just see the ice because what what was what was a what was what do they need more so just to ask her jazmin's question yes there ,oh wait so you said why couldn't they see the ice i was gonna say because it was too small that's why they need a microscope 
210.4,Chris,,yes that's why they need the microscope very good all right and unless add on a little bit more about this water that they found on the moon so where is this water that they what kind of place do you find this water is in in a very like right place yes hairs ,on the crators and i think it says the really dark like the sun never shines there 
210.4,Jazmin,,yes very good why is it important that is in a dark place what would happen if it was in a place where the sun is shining what could happen go ahead yes ,well if the sun was shining maybe the ice would not kind of like kind of like global warming 
210.4,Jazmin,,yes very good and in the ice kind of melted you think the scientists that see can find the water ,probably not because i think it would melt and then probably a very 
110.2,Farrah,,"Very good, so again just I think your answer was right, but we just we were just trying to see if the if the scientists could see it so again it wasn't that your answer is wrong ",week so it's the right answer the lunar orbiter or it's the right answer microscope 
130.3,Farrah,,and then what do you need to see the the water itself well it could be both because you need the lunar orbiter to investigate ,oh well the microscope 
110.1,Farrah,,yes very good so again it would be but ,oh oh i thought you could only have one answer 
120.4,Chris,,yeah yes student you want to add to that ,yeah so um well actually i know that scientists they actually use a lot of equipment on like oxygen tanks and masks and suits because i went to nasa so i know they use a lot of equipment 
110.2,Chris,,very good yes scientists do use a lot of equipment so again this is why it doesn't have to be one answer it says what kind of equipment that they use so if you feel that all of these kind of equipment is a part of discovering water and it's all are the answer ,oh whoo so we so my answer could be on that the scientists to use the masks and the oxygen tanks and this be suits and the lunar orbiter and the microscope 
210.4,Chris,,yeah if that's what how the scientist goes and discovers water yes but again with the mask and the endless space suit in in the reading do we see that there are some slots on the moon and they're investigating it ,oh i guess it doesn't really talk about astronauts in the story 
210.4,Luis,,um yeah i don't think there's astronauts in the story so far yeah ,oh yeah so i think it's a custom lunar orbiter it's actually like a type of a robot and it doesn't even need people to go on it and so there weren't even really people like a string that's on the moon they just like sent the lunar orbiter and it went around and and it found the water 
110.4,Oliver,,yes very good that's a good answer the lunar orbiter is a little robot they used to investigate but if there was people in and they needed to to drive the orbit or maybe they would be an astronaut yes ,well actually i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but before we go i wanted to say thank you so much for being so welcoming of all of our answers and helping us see that we didn't have to just pick one that there was room for more than one idea thank you so much 
150.1,Luis,,yes you're welcome and enjoy lunch class bye all right so i think you all you all just shared your responses and you all have sparked some thoughts just from hearing just from hearing your responses i've i've been enlightened and i've been thinking about this question and what it's really asking okay um so i've heard so i'm going to review your responses out loud this is what i've heard ,excuse me 
150.1,Luis,,yeah hey student ,hi yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
150.1,Luis,,oh okay wait so sorry you said you shouldn't be in this class because you know all about space ,sure do 
110.1,Luis,,okay but what if i guess what if you could use some of what you know about space and maybe share that with the class you i bet you could definitely add a lot of a lot of strengths this class a lot of knowledge to this class and who knows maybe we could also teach you something as well right because really what we're what we're kind of focusing on here at during this time is about how to also understand what the questions are asking you class right so let's say we are taking a test right and you write down everything you know about space but what if it doesn't answer the questions they're asking right so we're all here we're going to focus more on making sure that we understand the question that's being asked of us okay so we're going to practice these skills okay thank you student um okay so let's start student you said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely right okay student i think you said you had circled the same as student right okay student you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon great and student you said nasa sent a small machine and student you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks ,yep definitely true 
210.3,Farrah,,all right that is true now these are all true right because you all circled things that were right from the text right now i just want to discuss what made you circle the answer that you did okay i'm going to give you a few seconds to kind of think about that all right and then we're going to go around and talk about it student i see your hand up student i see yours up i'll just give you a few more seconds for class who's thinking about it okay okay i'll go ahead and start with student because i saw yours first then student i'll hear from you okay all right student go ahead ,so the reason that i picked the microscope is because it says it there in part three it says the water they found is microscopic so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so it's right there in the story so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.2,Farrah,,okay well i think that's i and this is the thing about the question that we're going to get into which is what is the wrong or right answer in this question because the question just kind of asked us about equipment right what equipment is used right and so if we're thinking about equipment what piece of equipment is used based on the answer that you gave ,a microscope 
310.1,Jazmin,,"mm hmm right so that's partially right it's not a wrong answer but it's a we could get close we could get an answer that's more specific right okay so i wouldn't say it's wrong all right i think you're on the right track for sure great job student And you looked at the sentence that said microscopic and thought , oh microscope. Ok? Great job. um student let's hear from you ",yeah so my answer is nasa sent a small machine and that also it's right in the text at the beginning of part two 
210.2,Jazmin,,that is true right so it's similar to kind of farrah's thinking as well right so and which equipment did they use ,a machine 
110.1,Chris,,right and we know that a machine is the type of equipment okay right and so that's also getting to part of the answer right okay good job student awesome student let's hear from you ,ok well so actually i went to nasa so i know that astronauts and scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
230.2,Chris,,oh that's all true right so you used your personal experience right to know and you saw with your own eyes what they're using right um can i ask did they did you see the ma any of what you saw mentioned in the text ,no they aren't in the story 
210.2,Chris,,okay they're not in the story okay so this is a good this is a really good point too um so whenever they ask a question right let's go back to the question which is what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question right so what part of those instructions kind of help you remember oh i got to use the text or useful knowledge ,oh so the part the circle part because i guess i don't have anything to circle when i talk about the oxygen tanks 
110.3,Farrah,,yeah yes that's yes that's right so you've got it student so that's now if the question had asked about your personal experience then you could mention what you had seen at nasa that would be very interesting for sure ok student you have a question and student i'll come back to you ,um yeah well actually it's not really a question but i just looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say thank you very much for helping us see oh yeah you really helped us see how our answers were part of the way there instead of all of the way there and that really got me thinking about how to use the story to make my answer even better so thank you so much 
110.3,Farrah,,great well thank you all i enjoyed getting to work with you all thank you enjoy your lunch okay thank you ,hi how are you 
110.3,Farrah,,hi i'm doing good how's the day ,oh it's great we're really excited to work with you 
150.1,Luis,,need to have you class read the test i did you ,um yeah so we read it we read about the water on the moon and i'm thinking i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
140.1,Luis,,wow fantastic how do you get that knowledge or how do you know about space ,oh i watch a lot of videos on youtube and sometimes i read articles like in magazines and i have this book with all these pictures of space oh i really like space 
150.1,Luis,,really like space i'm also big fan of space to well so do own to talk about the question i give you since you were a lot about space right ,yeah so about the equipment i was thinking that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
230.2,Luis,,oxygen tank how do you get that from text ,on say well sorry yeah so i was thinking if there's scientists on the moon they are going to need oxygen tanks if they're gonna be looking around for a water 
130.2,Farrah,,yeah does class has some different ideas to add them ,um yes i i thought something different so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
230.1,Farrah,,a microscope interesting can you talk more about why to send it to use microscope to look at what ,so it said that the water well actually it's ice it's really really small and you can't see it if you don't have a microscope 
130.2,Jazmin,,yeah that's great yeah we can see in the third paragraph to see the eyes is very small so we need the microscope to look at it does class have more to add on to this question ,yeah 
130.2,Jazmin,,go ahead ,so i said that nasa sent a small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,a small machine washing machine with that machine called ,let me check okay it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter oh no i think you're frozen i can't see and hear you anymore oh you're back okay thank you so i just said it's called the lunar orbiter i found that in the second paragraph 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah you do really great job so the second paragraph is there's no standard small machine on lunar orbiter to investigate and what does the lunar orbiter fine ,well i guess it finds and that i in the craters 
230.2,Chris,,yeah great the lunar orbiter buying the eyes departed in apollo crater right and someone mentioned is that scientist need an oxygen tanks can you find the oxygen tank in zoos test can class tell me about please ,yeah well okay so i know student talked about the oxygen tanks before and i was thinking something similar of actually because i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and also masks and suits 
230.3,Jazmin,,wow you are awesome you know a lot about the stage and equipment yeah so you think the side is the need also need oxygen tank mask and suit right ,i'm 
230.3,Jazmin,,sure go ahead ,so harris and i know you like when nasa but it doesn't even say anything about oxygen tanks in the story so is that really a right answer 
230.2,Chris,,yeah you did a really great job this this assignment is to lead is to help us to understand this test so we are going to get an answer based on this test so does this mention tank or mosque or suit ,can i guess not so so you're saying that the answer it has to be in the story 
120.3,Oliver,,yeah i say we we we can get it on the answer in from your previous knowledge but let's focus on this test but you class did a really really good job because you have their fantastic knowledge about space and about moon can we look at test again and ,excuse me on i'm so sorry i really don't want to interrupt but i just looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say thank you so much because you really listened to everything we had to say but you also reminded us that we really needed to use that text and our answer and that is really really helpful so thank you so much 
120.3,Farrah,,thank you you class are awesome okey dokey hello student dells student student student how are you today ,oh we're good we're so excited to work with you 
120.2,Luis,,awesome so i noticed that we answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and all of you had great responses yes student ,um yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,awesome i'm so excited that you know about space therefore you can share your knowledge with the class and help us grow ,awesome alright 
210.2,Jazmin,,great so i want us to take in consideration the context of the question and we're all going to analyze our responses and think about how we can improve them or make them stronger or maintain the quality of our responses so y equals did scientists use to discover water on the moon when you hear the word equipment what comes to mind student ,i would say when you hear the word equipment it makes me think of a tool 
110.1,Farrah,,what about you student a tool ,i'm like something something you use to do something 
210.2,Oliver,,something you used to do something so let's use our understanding what student and student gave us a tour something we used to do something to help us understand the context of the question so now i'm going to read the question again and then we're going to keep what student and student gave us um for us to understand the context of equipment and i noticed in student knows i'm explanation she said a scientific so what equipment is sciences us to discover water on the moon so what does that mean in terms of what scientists are using to get water what does the equipment mean def tool and jazmin's explanation she said some type of machine question ,can you 
310.1,Oliver,,so when we think about equipment and we know that scientists used equipment to get water off the moon what does that mean to you of course i love that you advocated for yourself in that way ,oh okay that means that the astronauts they couldn't do it like just with themselves they needed something like a machine or a tool to help them do it 
210.4,Chris,,yeah so how did i get the water student ,on me i'm not sure how but i know that they found it in the craters 
210.3,Chris,,i'm in the craters so let's go back to the context of the question how what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon so this finding equator are saying that they found the quakers answer the contexts are connects back to the context of the question student ,i guess because we have to talk about equipment right 
230.1,Chris,,why do you say that ,well because we've been talking about equipment 
210.4,Jazmin,,so we know that the scientists used equipment so now i want us to think about our responses yet but student ,and i was just gonna ask about my response actually so my response was nasa said just small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.3,Jazmin,,okay what we're going to do we know that so thinking back to the context of the problem it says what equipment does a small machine connect back to the context of the problem does it tell us exactly what type of machine they use ,i got it right from the text in part two it says nasa send a small machine 
120.4,Luis,,"that's beautiful I love, how you use that context you use evidence from the reading so right now i want student deaf and student to turn and talk to your partner and student and student will turn and talk with each other and you're going to answer does your response connect to the context of the question go ahead and do that for 10 seconds awesome we're gonna come back together student what did you learn from jazmin's response ",um so student it does connect to the context of that question because while she talks about nasa and she found my machine and last door 
120.4,Chris,,awesome okay student what did you talk about ,okay well i was just telling student and of how i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
130.2,Farrah,,beautiful i love that you have that background knowledge now we're going to try and take that back now rock background knowledge and connected to the text so student gave us a really really awesome response and said that nasa use the small machine student do you agree that nasa use a small machine ,well yeah i mean student showed it to us and told us it was in the story but i still don't know why i should pick that and not the microscope 
230.1,Farrah,,okay what do you think about that why do you say the microscope share your knowledge with the class ,okay well in part three it says that the water they found was microscopic and you can't see it without a microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,you have full so that takes us to the understanding what does microscopic actually mean it is it's all so you're onto something but what does microscopic mean ,i think it means really really small 
210.3,Oliver,,you are correct student it does mean really really small so with that being said they need the you say you need a scientific to call a microscope to look really closely but then does that help us yep does ,um i'm so sorry i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch i wish we could stay i'm really having a rough time um but i wanted to say before we go to lunch thank you so much for reminding us to think about the context of the question that is a really really helpful reminder for this question but also for other questions next time so thank you so much 
210.3,Farrah,,you are welcome and you all have beautiful responses remember to think about if your response connects back to the context of the question see you later ,hello hi 
110.1,Farrah,,i have a question about your response oh you said that that you thought that they need a scientific tool called microscopes look really closely ,yeah yeah that's what i said 
210.3,Farrah,,okay so for that how would they get the microscope to the moon ,oh oh i'm not sure i guess on the spaceship probably 
210.3,Luis,,okay student ,um yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
230.1,Luis,,so can you tell me a little bit more about your response ,um yeah okay so i said scientists use a lot of equipment like i'm oxygen tanks because if there's astronauts on the moon and are looking for this water they definitely are using oxygen tanks 
120.1,Luis,,so they might be using oxygen things but at the same time in the reading i didn't see anything that said anything about oxygen tanks do you want to try to think about what else they could use ,um i saw something that's in the story 
120.1,Luis,,yep ,oh i probably need to look at that again 
120.1,Luis,,okay ,okay so they say small machine and they say microscope and those are both the equipment 
210.3,Luis,,yep so what is the small machine called ,lunar orbiter yep 
210.3,Luis,,do you think that's what they used to discover water on the moon ,um i mean it sounds like something that could be kind of useful because it says loner and i know that that means moon 
210.3,Jazmin,,student ,so that was my answer my answer was nasa sent a small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,your answers not wrong it's just there's multiple parts to it so you had the right answer about a small machine but then after they find the they found the ice deposits they had to use something else to like look at it more closely ,oh is that what student was talking about 
130.1,Farrah,,yep so you both had part of the answer you said to put it together student ,um so i'm wondering i the reason i picked a microscope instead of the machine is because how can you discover something if it's too small to see 
210.4,Farrah,,so that's why they use the microscope so they found ice deposits in lunar craters but if it's too small to see with the eyes they have to go in with that microscope to try to find ,oh so i'm the machine it can do the finding even if it can't see it 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah that's what the microscopes for ,okay so um for the answer we just say both 
130.1,Chris,,yeah it would be both because you would need the two parts like the small machine when i began to investigate and i noticed ice deposits but since they were so small or to look at them they needed that needed a microscope look at it more closely student ,yeah i have a comment so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.3,Chris,,yeah they do ,so could we put that in our answer too 
130.3,Chris,,not for this one only because it's about the equipment they used to discover the water they would use that equipment and other scenarios but this time it was just the mission and the microscope that we were looking for ,oh okay um why 
410.2,Jazmin,,but our answer has to use evidence from the text sure they might use that other equipment but in the text it didn't have anything about that ,okay okay that makes sense i have a question about the story so the story it doesn't say anything about astronauts going in the lunar orbiter so we're astronauts or do they just do the machine and it does all the work for them 
210.4,Jazmin,,yeah they actually send up the machine on its own to do the investigation so there's still on earth looking at what they're doing so the machine will go up there and discover the ice deposits and then they also have the microscope up there to help them look at it more closely ,so cool machine can do it all without any astronauts 
210.4,Luis,,so there's still people controlling it it's just from earth so they use computers and stuff to get it to do what it needs to do ,um yeah student it's like it's kind of like a robot right 
110.1,Chris,,yeah kind of ,my answer my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon is that ok 
130.3,Oliver,,so that's what they found but we were looking for what equipment that they used to discover that on the moon so you just had what they found um so the equipment would be that small machine the lunar orbiter and then the microscope to look at it more closely student ,on i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for helping us today i really appreciate how you helped us use evidence from the text in our answers and reminded us to really use the story and start off just what we knew thank you so much 
150.1,Luis,,you're welcome so student i know your answer was that they had small mush oh yes student so i put us to sit in this small class because i really liked you guys's answer but i wanted us to think more and think about what we read and try to reflect on our answers ,um yeah so i shouldn't be and that's class i already know all about space 
110.3,Luis,,i know but we're just talking about it and i would love to hear what you think about space ,okay yeah let me know when you want me to share 
210.3,Jazmin,,okay well thank you student so student i know your answer was that they sent small machines but you know what those machines are called do you remember ,oh i think was in there okay it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter 
210.3,Jazmin,,exactly and do you remember what they do what do they look for ,they look for the water on the moon 
120.4,Chris,,exactly and they were like the small ice deposits in the large polar crater thank you student what was your answer again ,okay so i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
140.1,Chris,,they did and so those craters um do you remember where they were do you remember a cool fact that they mentioned ,i think they said the really dark 
140.1,Chris,,it's the part of the moon where the sun never shines they they were yes that was mentioned it's where the sun never shines the ,ya there's no sun 
140.1,Chris,,yeah isn't that cool ,it's so cool 
120.4,Oliver,,i thought that was an interesting thing to student so you said that you circle the same answer so vana what answer was that ,oh yeah we both said for the appointment we both said i'm microscope 
210.3,Oliver,,yeah do you remember what a microscope is used for ,yeah um a microscope it lets you look up things that are really really small like you can't see them um just in real life you have to look through the microscope to see them because they're so small 
210.4,Oliver,,exactly and do you remember in the article why they needed to use the microscope ,um yeah because well um because the water it's so small 
110.1,Farrah,,exactly yes student ,um i don't understand why our answer is wrong why is microscope wrong 
210.1,Farrah,,um it's it's not a wrong answer but it was one of the tools that they use they use the tool to look at the water on the moon um and that's how they discovered the war that's how they were able to see the water so your answer wasn't wrong you class had similar answers but i just wanted to know what you're thinking was when you came up with those answers ,oh oh okay yeah 
230.1,Farrah,,so why did you choose that ,i picked it because well i found it in part three in part three they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
150.1,Farrah,,exactly so that's how you know it was a good answer cuz you answered it ,okay so we're both right both me and student 
130.1,Farrah,,ya you class are both right you and student ,oh yeah but i mean also student because she said something different 
230.1,Jazmin,,yeah student had the small machines student is that where you were referring to ,i was referring to the lunar orbiter yeah 
230.3,Jazmin,,yeah so student was her answer was a little different ,yeah you said they're both right 
130.3,Jazmin,,oh actually student that wasn't an equipment that they used that was just something that was on the moon ,oh okay i don't know if i would have known that if you didn't tell me how 
110.1,Jazmin,,you know i sorry i made a mistake it was it no it was used to investigate me her answer was right was correct as well so they use a few small machines of course they use a few different small machines and ,thank you 
130.1,Chris,,one second student i will get right back to you and they use a microscope they use the lunar orbiter to investigate so there was a couple of different things yes student ,yeah well sort of about that i went to nasa so i know that scientists date to really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
210.3,Chris,,yeah they do so student student i know that you said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon do you remember how they found them ,how they found them 
210.3,Chris,,yeah do you remember what they used to find them ,well i mean i'm student just said the machine and student set the microscope 
120.4,Luis,,exactly they use those to find them on the moon student what was your answer ,oh um mine was kind of like what student just said i said scientists they use oxygen tanks 
230.2,Luis,,they did was that in the reading or was that just something you knew ,i i i don't yeah they didn't say oxygen tanks like in that story but i just know ever there are astronauts on the moon or anywhere in space they need oxygen tanks they definitely need that 
120.1,Luis,,yeah they do need oxygen takes but do you remember something else that was in the reading because we want to know what good scientists used to discover water on the moon so from the reading do you remember something else ,ah i am i wasn't really paying attention 
130.3,Oliver,,oh you wasn't well now we can learn from my friends because student said there was a lunar orbiter student and cab both student sorry both agreed on the microscope so now you know two machines that they used in that they mentioned in the article yes student ,that was easy um yeah i just looked up a clock and we have to go to lunch right now but i really appreciate that you took the time to listen to all of our answers on a really made it feel like you really care what each one of us has to say about the question thank you so much 
130.3,Luis,,you're welcome thank you that i did i did i did care about what you class had to say and thank you for participating and giving me your answers and student thank you for being honest i hope next time we can pay attention hello class ,hi 
130.3,Luis,,yes ,so i was just gonna say cuz i know that this class is to is to help people who are having some trouble with their answers but i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know about space 
120.4,Farrah,,people don't either so even if you don't need help you can still okay tell us some facts about maybe help your friends oh ok ok so first let's start with student student can you tell me what your answer was again ,yeah so basically what i said was that you need a scientific to have a microscope to look really close right 
210.4,Farrah,,so in the third paragraph it explains that you would need a microscope to look at the water that's um ,that's in the craters 
210.4,Farrah,,but is there another tool yeah find maybe in the second paragraph that um that explains more of what what ,the last glass of water last measure 
210.4,Farrah,,right okay so that's assumption is that the amount of water that is basically the amount of water that a person drinks a day ,so it's not a lot at all two ounces which 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah so in paragraph two it says that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so the microscope was a really good answer but the microscope is just looking at the water at the bottom of the crater just that little bit whereas the lunar orbiter was sent to the moon to look at it all and investigate everything does that make sense yes ,so they're both the answers but 
210.4,Jazmin,,instead of just the water at the bottom yes ,i just had a quick question is i think my answer was pretty close to that and i know that again we're working together because our answers right i guess it was a little confused on what my answer was wrong 
420.2,Jazmin,,what was your answer again and you were right with that you weren't wrong but if you could go into more detail about it so in the reading it does explain what that machine was so just to make sure that you give more detail instead of just saying small machine ,explain what the small machine was called yeah so is this small machine is it yes it is good job i have to say the whole thing like i can't just say the small machine 
410.2,Jazmin,,right you need to be a little more specific so that they understand what you're talking about because i was looking at it and you said small machine and i might think you're talking about the microscope because the microscope isn't big it's small ,so you just want to really be specific about what you're what you're saying 
410.2,Chris,,thank you yes ,so i i went to nasa with my dad i mean we go a couple times a year to this dentist space center and i i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoot i was wondering like i didn't see that in the video and so i thought like isn't that may be an answer for the equipment that they use 
410.2,Oliver,,gotcha. yeah ,then i wanted to thank you so much for working with us in with you can see thank you 
410.2,Luis,,start simulation hi yes ,i'm yet so basically i think i finally got this all figured out so good now 
120.4,Luis,,okay do you want to go first ,yeah absolutely okay so my answer is that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen 
210.2,Luis,,you're right no very good job and having it split how can that help how is that valuable ,you remember if you look oh well it's yeah it's valuable well okay so it's valuable if you look back in the end they have all this stuff about how okay so you can use hydrogen and oxygen you can use let's see in paragraph five they say you can read the oxygen and oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket so that's really useful because you have rocket fuel that you can make like on the moon you don't have to take it with 
210.4,Farrah,,you fuel do you class know what that is rocket fuel is how you would how you would move the spaceship so it's like it's like how i'm gas as for our car it's the same thing ,oh yeah so okay here's what i will see so i said no that would not be valuable time yeah i had basically i'm very similar answer but mine was mostly that it wasn't ready yet that you have to do stuff to the water to make it or first you have to find out how to get it like out of the craters and you got to figure out how to know and like all that you can't use it because it's not ready to use yet 
130.2,Chris,,into your own little you put your little twist on it which was good but it does say in the text that you can use the water so would be valuable and actually student had a good point and his answer student if you want to share ,my answer was water is heavyy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships which i think would be a really good like the if they didn't they don't need to have any more water they can just get it on the moon 
210.4,Jazmin,,right so once they can get the water they won't have to bring water bottles on to their spacecraft which will be nice because it takes up a lot of room and it's heavy so without that they can bring more things and they'll already have water provided student ,yeah i think you and i guess what i'm wondering is like student mustang like the water is heavy so they don't have they don't have to take it on the spaceship but if they don't have it on the spaceship what will they drink 
210.4,Jazmin,,well once they get to the moon they would drink the water on the moon so i mean i guess bringing water in the spaceship ,how did they survive like when they're they're flying to the moon so 
210.4,Jazmin,,i'm sure that they bring maybe a water bottle each a little bit of water each but i think this is more saying they don't have to bring a whole thing of water because that's really happy but you do still need to drink water so i'm sure they bring ,a little bit each once they get to the moon there'll be enough provided for them to drink where they 
210.4,Jazmin,,won't have to bring say a whole case ,that makes a lot of sense 
210.4,Oliver,,good student ,oh actually yeah i was just thinking to myself like well i read that they were going to make up my moon base by maybe on the moon and it made me think that maybe they can use the water to make the moon base possible like they could make oxygen and fuel for the moon 
130.3,Jazmin,,good that's um i haven't heard that so that's really interesting and that was that was good that you were like using what you found in this text along with what you already heard before so very interesting i didn't i didn't know okay does class else have any questions no so the final conclusion is that water is valuable right because it'll help with the fuel for the spacecraft and also help them make room in the spacecraft ,we just wanted to thank you for working with us and like one of the things that i really wanted to thank you for working with us is like how you helped us to verify what we were like saying like you helped us understand why did we come up with the answer and you also listen to ideas which really made me feel valued and i think that class had a really good time working with you class yeah i think class really enjoyed it so thank you so much it was really fun working with you thank you 
130.3,Oliver,,hi class ,oh hello 
120.2,Luis,,okay so okay so we're going to go through and i'm going to ask you class a little bit more about what you said for your answers so once again the question is what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon yes student ,yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space 
230.1,Luis,,you do okay well you know what that's good because i don't know all about space and i'm sure some of your friends don't either so you can be here to help us so we can start with you to say you said that um scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right okay so how did you find that out because i didn't see that in the text so how to use that ,okay well if there are astronauts on the moon looking for water i know that they would have to have oxygen tanks 100 
230.2,Farrah,,"um okay also Farrah so, you said that. we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely right so what would we be looking at in the text what did it say that we would have to be looking at ",okay well we would be looking at the tiny oh what did they call them ice deposits 
230.2,Oliver,,john uh huh and using oh yeah so student know oliveron oliveron is it ,okay yeah 
110.1,Oliver,,okay so you said that you circled the same thing as student ,yeah we bought picked a microscope for the appointment 
230.1,Oliver,,okay and can you tell me a little bit more why you ,circle on yeah so while a microscope lots to see really tiny things on and if you see something you can discover it so that's why i picked a microscope because being able to see tiny particles but overall 
210.4,Oliver,,mm hmm right right and we would need a microscope to look at something we can't see with our own eyes right ,yeah yeah exactly 
210.4,Jazmin,,okay yes student ,um i have a different answer i said nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
210.4,Jazmin,,well yours is correct but do you remember what the small machine was called in the text ,okay it says nasa centers for machine called a lunar orbiter 
430.2,Jazmin,,"I mean it's not really specific so you don't really know exactly what machine, it is, but by saying what is the Lunar orbiter it just makes it more specific so, then you know what exactly it is. ",oh okay yeah 
120.4,Chris,,and then student do you remember what you said ,yeah i said that scientists found creators full of water on the moon 
410.3,Chris,,And the paragraph. okay i'm gonna have to look further after but i'm in the paragraph it doesn't say was filled it just said that it was found in the craters okay i'm gonna have to look further after but i'm in the paragraph it doesn't say was filled it just said that it was found in the craters so just to make sure you understand it wasn't like filled to the top it was just at the bottom they found some water and some of them so that's how they found out there that there was water on the moon ,oh okay i guess because we just kind of picture that wrong in my brain 
150.1,Farrah,,that's okay i mean it happens so not a problem um does class have any other questions about it ,i'm i'm still kind of confused 
230.1,Farrah,,on what ,oh well so you said that jazmin's answer was right but what about the microscope 
210.4,Farrah,,yeah so they didn't just use one thing they used a few different things so they were both right both of your both of your answers in the beginning that they use a small machine called a lunar orbiter and then towards the end they were saying that they used a microscope to really look at the look at the water integrators yes ,oh ok so we were both right 
110.2,Chris,,yes yep you are student ,oh well i just wanted to share that i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.3,Chris,,yeah no exactly and that was really good that student brought up that they use on oxygen tanks because it didn't say it in the text but in order to be out in space you would need an oxygen tank ,so i could put that for my answer 
110.3,Chris,,"Talk about what's in the text, and then you can also elaborate on what you know for a fact. ",oh so i'm like equipment that was in the story 
230.3,Chris,,yeah yeah so like how he said i'm phase microscopes they use the lunar orbiter and then student said that he knew using his background knowledge that you also need an oxygen tank out there so that's why yeah ,yeah okay okay so you just want to say one thing from the story and then you could say some stuff you know too 
230.3,Oliver,,yeah like an oxygen. tank yeah definitely yeah ,um so i just looked at the clock and actually um we have to go to lunch now what i just wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to each one of our answers and helping us understand how they have different machines worked in space that was a really really helpful thank you 
230.3,Oliver,,know of course thank you class did very good thank you hello class all right how's it going class how we doing ,we are excited to work with you 
120.3,Luis,,thanks alright just so for today just for some introductions you class can call me mr tillman or mr t whichever you prefer how does that sound good cool all right so we just read this short excerpt about discovering water on the moon and so our first question can i was wondering if someone can remind me student you look really excited to answer so if you could please reread the question for us ,oh yeah i can but i just wanted to say before i read anything that i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know like everything there is to know about space 
110.3,Luis,,well that's actually really good that you say that student so since you actually know a lot about space hopefully you can help us in our peers get to the final answer how does that sound ,yeah i guess i can i can do that 
120.3,Luis,,alright cool that sounds good alright so let's jump back into that first part do you mind repeating the question for us ,um okay so the question was um what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon 
420.1,Jazmin,,"great so i know you class had a good mix of answers which is really good because it actually helps us get down to the root of the actual answer that we're looking for right so i see from based off of our answers student student and student you class all did a great job of understanding that you know from our question you know where we're looking for equipment we're looking for specific equipment that will help us find one on the water right and student and student i also noticed that you class did that to So what i'm suggesting that we should do in order to get to the answer is that we look for some keywords keywords or some context clues that will help us find find it in the question. Jazmin, you have a question? ",i was just wondering why my answer was wrong 
420.1,Chris,,yeah so that's what we're going to find out right now so based off of your answer it's just it's not that it's wrong it's just that we have pieces missing from the answer so we got part of it right but we want to get the whole thing ok what are some keywords or some context clues that will help us get to the answer so what's the main part of the question what are we looking for in the question student what do you think ,so we're looking for we're looking for equipment what did they use 
130.2,Farrah,,good good student you want to build off that ,reach every reader oh i just got the same thing to say that also it was easy to find water 
130.2,Luis,,Luis. ,um is it like tools you know like it's kind of like a tool that you use 
210.3,Jazmin,,good yep so that's one word tool that's one that we could use student you have a different one ,i'm just thinking that anytime that you're like making something or or taking in something like i will look for words like making or building or taking like you have to use equipment if you are doing those things 
210.2,Oliver,,right good so using those keywords like using building alright so we got two parts of their so student said tools is another way that we can help us find the word and then student said that we're also going to look for clues like digging and building so that we know that we're using the equipment right class else anything else okay so how about i build off that again so what are we looking for with the equipment that we're using let's go to student first since i haven't heard from you yet ,so what we're looking for is we're looking for the the water so that we know that there's water and we're trying to find it 
130.2,Chris,,right good good class have a different answer go student what do you got ,um i guess the only difference that i would add to the answer is i would add that you might be looking more for ice than actual water because it's ice on the 
210.4,Chris,,so what i'm going to do now so you class can help build on that answer more oh before we get started to student you have another question right yeah because it's cold so good good so these are all great clues that we all help on fighting together ,well i was just it was going through my head because we were talking about the different tools and what news define things and i i know cuz i've been to nasa like data few times that you know like astronauts have to wear spacesuits and like they have oxygen tanks and stuff so i was wondering if like well i guess i was wondering are those tools also 
210.4,Farrah,,there are all different types of tools like equipment gear all those other things but for right now the question is asking for the ones that will help us find the water that was actually good using background knowledge to make connections good job student good job all right so in order to so we already have our background information we know that we're looking for equipment or tools that's going to help us find water on the moon so what i want to do now is split you class into two small groups so i'm just going to do student and death i mean excuse me i'm gonna do student and death and then student student eat less or two groups so youtube and then the other three and what i want you class to do is using what we just discovered from the question reread paragraph two and see if we can find an answer okay so let's take about one to two minutes to do that and so student have a question before we get started ,you have to go to our next class but thank you so much it was really interesting to meet you mr t and to talk to you thank you so much 
120.3,Luis,,no problem alright class so let's jump back into where we left off and have you class in your groups you class can continue talking and just reread paragraph two okay ,all right okay so let's take a look at their craft and see if there's anything that are like clues that we can use okay so um alright so let's read it together okay nasa send a small machine called lunar orbiter just a very small so what do you think student is there anything in there that you think could be that cool um yeah i think there's a couple options actually up i think one of the options could be because i can see some questions because i can see that one machine is the lunar orbiter but like it's possible that that's the answer but you could also say that the cup that they used to measure the water that's the answer too oh i didn't think about that so it could be the lunar orbiter or it could be the cup or maybe both like maybe they use both of those kinds of equipment you know what i mean yeah that's possible okay class so let's talk about what we what we saw okay so when we were reading the character and looking at this stuff like i guess what i like to be with the stuff about like is what jumped out to me was the lunar orbiter like that's what i thought what you see what i'm still a bit confused about why my answer was wrong because i always thought that it was the lunar orbiter do you class agree he basically well i kind of agree i could see that it's an orbiter but i also think that there's other equipment that is be left out of the meeting i think that they use like you know i know that they have to use this other stuff even if it's not like satellites at radar and all that stuff to find like were even on the phone to look so i think that's confusing right way like i feel the same way cuz i'm thinking to myself like probably they use other stuff as well i'm not really sure 
150.1,Luis,,all right let's come back in 321 all right how many activity for us was a good student you got some first reaction ,yes i got it all figured out good i think i'm ready to go back to my desk 
120.4,Jazmin,,alright so before we go back to her desk and just a moment let's make sure that we all come to agreement on a on a class answer okay okay so how about somebody else in your class tell me what you got to the final answer either student and student student i saw your hand first what do you got ,okay so the first time that we were getting answers i thought the answer was the lunar orbiter and i still think that's the answer because that's the small machine that that the scientists set and they're the ones that it says in the reading there the one it says they investigate with the lunar orbiter so that seems like the right answer because that tells me that they were finding finding something stuff so that tells me that they found all about the ice 
130.2,Jazmin,,great job Chris and you want to build on that? ,one nice thing to say just just as part of my answer was that i was like why my answer wasn't wasn't right to begin with you know i said it was a small machine like i guess i just wanted like what was missing from my answer 
130.1,Jazmin,,we want to make sure that you can combine the park so you class can all get the full answer does that make sense right so in the same way like how i spoke to eastern before it's not necessarily that your answer was completely wrong you class just all had parts of the answer correct ,yeah that makes sense 
120.4,Chris,,okay cool and student go ahead ,so i thought when we were discussing up like i think student as a really good theory and i i could see how it could be the lunar orbiter i can i can see that now since she explained it but i still think that the question is saying like you know like what equipment could it be and it saying like it could be even more than one piece so student and i thought that the fact that they don't mention like satellite radar and even the oxygen tanks and stuff like i think we're still the class that that would be something that they have forgetting to say 
130.3,Chris,,"right that's also a good point student I think, in this specific context and just finding the water at this time, they think the Lunar orbiter is what the main equipped piece of equipment that they use so that's a good that's a good point as well. yeah ",okay gotcha 
130.2,Farrah,,cool and before we wrap up just to make sure that we're on the same page so then and then did you have a similar answers to student or something different ,so i'm student do you want to talk first so we kind of had a slightly different answer after focusing on the second paragraph we guess that probably you wanted us to see that the lunar orbiter was one of the things but even then we were still thinking that maybe it was the glass of water that they measured the 32 ounces with because that's equivalent to so we thought maybe we keep seeing lots of different like it seems like for other folks that they're able to see that there's other like they're able to guess like what kind of us we keep seeing like different pieces like the microscope and the glass and the lunar orbiter and we keep thinking they're using all right yeah i keep thinking that they're probably using all those states to do the measurements 
210.3,Oliver,,so also build enough that remember the tool that we're looking for specifically it's supposed to find the water you know it's supposed to help us collect the water search for the water and so you class mentioned the cups right those are good those are good points both both of you class but they do they do what exactly what did you class say that will help you do ,a couple of men are at right 
210.3,Oliver,,yeah ,so you class 
130.3,Farrah,,yeah yeah definitely on the right track hoping to get it to measure it but helping us find it it's the lunar orbiter all right student question ,well i just wanted to say actually we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i really wanted to just say how much we enjoyed working with you and like in particular you really helped us to clarify our thinking about what we were trying to you know think about in our answers and try to like you know find the best answer that could and you also help this use evidence from the text so we knew that we needed to really prove our weight and i realized that most of us really except for except for student we didn't really prove our point because we weren't i guess we brought the microscope in but it wasn't the right answer so you helped us find both like what was the answer that we were looking for and also how to how to prove it so that was pretty cool thank you so much 
130.3,Farrah,,no problem thank you class for participating bye ,hello hi how are you 
130.3,Farrah,,good morning class how's it going how's class doing today ,oh we're great we're so excited to work with you that's great that's great 
150.1,Luis,,so i know that we had just recently read a short exit water on the moon right luis's on that i see you have a question ,yeah yeah um so um i shouldn't be and that's already know a lot about that space 
150.1,Luis,,that's great you know it's at times it's actually good that you say that the more that you have knowledge on space you know i think it's better to help us with oh how's that sound this problem so even if you know you might feel like you don't think you need to be in this class then maybe we can help some of our peers ,sure yeah i'd love to do that 
120.3,Farrah,,alright so the main question i wanted to help you class answer today is the first question that we answered some remind me of that question student ,okay the question is what equipment at scientists to us to discover water on the moon 
120.4,Chris,,great all right now let's get some more quiet hands what did we get what do we have an answer on that first question let's go to student and then student you can jump in now ,okay so i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
120.1,Jazmin,,but um let's let's keep building on that right good student ,Okay. i said nasa sent a small machine 
130.2,Jazmin,,good alright so we see we have different pieces of the context of what we're trying to find here so the main part of the question is what equipment did they use to find the water and so as student pointed out they with the equipment that they use they made the craters to find the water and then student also gave us some context saying that they use the small machine so let's build on that how can we build on that a little bit more ,well it's kind of wondering that because i don't understand why my answer is wrong 
120.3,Oliver,,well let's take a look back at the passage okay um can i get a volunteer to read a paragraph to just for some context we haven't heard much from you student go ahead ,okay how about you it's not so simple small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar quite a few years these ice are very small 
120.1,Jazmin,,good job so based on the context of that on that paragraph student do you think you want to try it again and tell us the answer ,well it sounds like the small machine 
210.4,Jazmin,,right so there's more there's more to that what else does it say about the small machine ,okay a small machine called a lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposits 
130.3,Jazmin,,there we go yeah good job so the small machine on that you actually mentioned it's called a lunar orbit ,and so i just had to say lunar orbiter 
130.3,Farrah,,and um i also noticed you know student like how you said that they find the crater so understanding that the lunar orbiter is what we use to find get into those craters the prime the water student ,um well i i had a different answer i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so um well you just said student is right but what about the microscope 
130.3,Farrah,,right so the microscope is actually great because that is a tool that we do use in science and to help us see things but specifically for this part and finding water on the moon that is the tool that we use the lunar orbiter not a microscope ,But I guess I don't understand why. 
130.3,Farrah,,why the question is wrong or why ,why why it's not the microscope oh 
130.3,Farrah,,well i mean they just pause simulation ,oh no you're doing really well i just just i just wanted to know why it's the lunar orbiter it's okay it's okay if you want to talk to someone else that's okay i can work on 
130.3,Chris,,okay student you have a question ,yeah well actually it's a comment on yes i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
110.3,Luis,,yeah definitely that's good that you actually went to nasa you actually get to see it in person and that's really cool ,yeah it was so cool they had so many things like machines and tools and space suits yeah it was amazing to watch student that was kind of like my answer to for the question and my answer was that scientists use oxygen tanks so i was just that connection i just wanted to make that connection that to discover the water on the moon they use oxygen tanks 
110.3,Oliver,,for sure yeah that's great that's great that's a great connection yeah student what do you got for it ,um well i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for for being so patient with us and giving all of us the chance to share it was really nice to work with you today thank you 
150.1,Luis,,thank you class have a good lunch hello good afternoon we've all read the article we've all read this article water on the moon from the new york times and now we're trying to answer this this question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and it seems like there's almost two parts to this question right what tool was used and how was it used what did it do each of you have an answer that hits one of those two parts and so for pretty much class in this class i'd like to offer some suggestions of how you might get both of those two parts in your answers are we good to start student do you have a question ,um yeah so i already know all about space i don't think i need to be in this class because i know all this stuff 
230.1,Luis,,sure when and remember this is not really a class for who knows about space and who doesn't this is more just have we written an answer that completely answers this question and so maybe your answer has one of these two parts but let's see if we can make it even stronger so actually we can start with you student and i'm curious what made you say that scientists need oxygen tanks that was really smart edition ,yeah so i was thinking when i was reading when i was like you're not talking about all the materials that they need like when i watched like space shows on tv they always have oxygen tanks and like suits and stuff like that so it seems weird that they left that out 
420.3,Luis,,i see how you're answering this question by using your own knowledge rate your own experiences from watching movies and seeing the equipment that's being used and i'm concerned though that the question is asking specifically for how the water was found so my suggestion is that you look back at paragraph two to see if you can name and describe the tool that was used to find the water okay ,like just for the water 
420.3,Farrah,,just for finding that water right and now i see student you have a question so take a look at paragraph two and see if you can find that tool ,yeah i i was just wondering i was confused about like why my answer was wrong 
420.3,Farrah,,so again it's not that your answers necessarily right or wrong there's always a way to make something better though right so let's take a look actually your is end of i'm concerned that the question is asking for what was used to discover water right and we've only mentioned the tool that's used to see it once you have discovered it. does that make sense so my suggestion for both of you is that you reread paragraph two and maybe some of three and really understand what tool is being used to find the water before they use the microscope student ,um i think it makes sense but i think that what's confusing to me is that like how could they find the water if they can't see the water like you know what i mean like they said that the water was like what did they say like microscopic so that means like really small right so like how did they find it if they couldn't see it 
420.3,Farrah,,that's a fantastic question and that's why there's another tool that had to be used in order to find it so go ahead and take a look at paragraph two there and see if you can name that tool and describe a little bit of how it works ,okay i'll check it out 
420.3,Chris,,um how about we talk to student next do you have a question before i start ,um ya so my question is that like ok so like student said that which i think was good was that like the scientists use lots of equipment and i've been to nasa so i know that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so i guess i was like isn't that the answer for like how they found the water 
120.4,Jazmin,,hmm i think that might answer another question of how can they see the water You started to explain how machine was being sent. my suggestion again is that we take a look at this paragraph two because there is another tool that was used in order to find the water even before they could see it but you didn't specify exactly what that machine was called is there class who thinks they might have found the tool mentioned in paragraph two student ,yes my idea was that it was this small machine and i was wondering i wasn't sure like what my answer was wrong because it seems like this small machine was probably the thing that they used to find the water 
210.4,Jazmin,,to be honest i'm not a space astronauts so i'm truthfully not sure we'd have to look again at this article to see if there's a name for that small machine did you happen to notice if it was called something ,oh yeah like it's the lunar orbiter is that the answer 
230.1,Oliver,,let's all take a look at that part of paragraph two there right at the beginning nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater who thinks that this is answering the question being asked raise your hand i see two hands went up student seems unsure student why did you say that this this does answer the question ,so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but this was really exciting thank you so much 
230.1,Reach Every Reader,,alright good afternoon ,hi 
210.4,Luis,,so we've just read the article water on the moon by the new york times and now we're analyzing this second question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable so i'm curious to hear some of the ideas that we've come up with to help explain why water might be valuable there on the moon you might have even noticed in the article there's a title of a section called water is a valuable resource and let's start with oh sorry can't see my zoom screen there student do you have a question ,um yeah so i i was just gonna say i think i got this all figured out so i think i'm good 
420.3,Farrah,,all right well i'm going to start with student and then we'll come to your answer and we'll take a minute to take a look at it and so i noticed for student and student actually remembering that any answer can be made better but it's not that you have a wrong answer that maybe it's just answering a different question right so let's try and strengthen our answers here i see how you've answered the question is water valuable because right now there isn't any water there so you said no not yet i'm concerned though that there is evidence in paragraph four does that sound good my suggestion is that you go back to the paragraph for both of you and take a look to see if there's some reason maybe even two reasons why water could be helpful ,yeah we can do that 
420.3,Chris,,great while you class are working on that student and student you both came up with great answers for why water so student you had said waters is heavy so it's hard to bring it up in ships right it's a lot of weight for the spaceship to bring is relevant to being on the moon right so let's think about how does this answer the question about is it valuable is it helpful right um and student you had said that water is something they can drink to stay hydrated right my suggestion is similar to student and student take a look at paragraph four and to see why it would be helpful to have it on the moon there student you also spoke about paragraph five so why don't you read both paragraphs to see if you can find why it wouldn't be helpful to have it in a spaceship student and student reread paragraph four to find out why water would be better on the moon ,well cuz i was thinking you don't even need to take it anymore cuz if it's on the moon you don't even need to bring it with you 
230.3,Jazmin,,which ties into what you said before about it being really heavy so it sounds like you're saying it could be valuable to have it on the moon just so that you can save on the rocket fuel to bring it there Jazmin you have a question. ,yes i was just going to say i'm still kind of confused 
420.2,Jazmin,,with your response you had mentioned that astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated that seems really helpful you can't survive without water that's definitely true right why would it be helpful though to have it on the moon rather than to bring it with them on a space shuttle right student was just telling us that it's very heavy so maybe you could add to your answer a bit about how it would be helpful to have it there on the moon ready to go since astronauts need to drink it ,oh that makes a lot of sense okay let me change my answer 
420.3,Luis,,great student you've included some great past knowledge about how water is composed of these two parts hydrogen and oxygen it's a great time to chemistry that makes sense with why we need water we need these perks i am concerned though that the question is asking why you would want water on the moon does that makes sense right and we haven't mentioned the moon in our answer so my suggestion is that you take a look at either paragraph four or paragraph five to find at least two reasons why you would want water on the moon ,yeah so like you're saying like i should have some reason like like okay yeah like the water does this they can do that like why is it is that right 
420.2,Luis,,exactly similar to student you've told us why it's really helpful we just want to add a little bit about why it's helpful to have it on the moon ,i can do that 
120.4,Oliver,,Does anyone have an answer that they want to share with their group when they've improved. student ,yeah so i read that there was going to be a base on the moon by 2024 
230.1,Oliver,,is that something you read in the article is that some knowledge that you're bringing to the conversation ,oh that's a good question um i read it online 
410.1,Oliver,,"so my suggestion is that you make sure to mention in addition to the base being built how it would be really helpful to have water there i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically about water ",okay 
120.4,Farrah,,any other questions as we're updating our answers does someone to have a response they might want to share with the class student i saw your hand first ,on okay so i thought about some of the ways that it could be valuable and at still like okay so i think i might still make the argument that it might not be valuable yet but maybe it will be valuable once we have the like i think the word is infrastructure infrastructure and you like once we have that like the equipment and stuff on the we could use it a lot i still think it's probably in the future but i did look at what you said in the paragraph and i could see that there was stuff that would be really valuable like you can use it to drink you can make rocket fuel from it like there's a lot of stuff where certainly eventually it would be really valuable 
230.3,Oliver,,"and you might have also noticed that in paragraph five, it starts with moon water could be useful so you're not wrong that saying. for drinking and like student had mentioned it can be used to make rocket fuel that's those are great reasons to include in your answer it's not useful yet and it's being olivereloped ya student ",so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to say that you really helped us and like i think what was really interesting and really cool was how you explain like what we needed to work on and then you gave us ideas for like not like what the answer was but like how we could make our answers better i'd like more complete like you agree class like i think that was really fun so thank you so much because that was really cool bye 
230.3,Oliver,,my pleasure nice to meet you hi class how are you ,um we're good just excited to work with you 
150.1,Luis,,great fantastic so you just read water on the moon oh yes student ,um so i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know all about space 
120.4,Oliver,,fantastic then you'll be able to contribute in ways that will move the rest of the class thinking forward i'm glad you're here right fantastic okay so you read the article water on the moon and you answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon you circled evidence in the text you can use to answer the question so i'm just interested in hearing hearing from you what your answers were student ,um yeah so i circled the same thing as student 
230.1,Oliver,,can you give me a little more detail about what that was what evidence was that ,yeah so okay so survey and i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i think that that class because they talk about different sort of equipment which is a word that i circled and i saw that the equipment that i noticed was the microscope 
230.3,Farrah,,"okay so i see that what you did is when you were looking at the article you identified words that remind you of equipment right and one piece of equipment is a microscope Other pieces of equipment right you identified the microscope, which is in paragraph three. i think you might have overlooked some other pieces of evidence so here's what i'm going to suggest for you student and student is that right that that's what you had as well ",yeah i had the same answer 
150.1,Farrah,,"okay so this this might work for you to this next suggestion so what i might do is do a little bit of rereading So there's more than one piece of equipment, I might look and see like which ones are most important and rank and sort to identify the most important pieces of equipment that the scientists use. can you try to do a little rereading and find some more evidence ",yeah that sounds like an interesting like ranking all of the equipment i think just i'm still a little about why my answer is wrong 
420.2,Farrah,,i didn't say that your answer was wrong i think that you found a piece of evidence from from the article but i wonder if you could have a stronger answer if you did a little ranking and sorting of other pieces of evidence ,that makes sense okay i'm gonna try that 
150.1,Chris,,perfect thank you student can you tell me what your response was so student and student i'm going to ask you to try that suggestion first ,yeah yeah so basically what i said is that scientists found craters full of water on the moon 
110.1,Chris,,student can you show me where you found that in the article interesting can you tell me where you found that in the article student i see you i'm going to come back to you once i'm done with student ,ya so it says that in the first paragraph up top scientists have evidence that water can be deep within the moon's polar craters and these craters are dark places where the sun never shines so that makes me think that they're probably full off water 
410.2,Chris,,"okay One of the, a concern that I have is When you're reading nonfiction often they'll give you a little bit of information in the beginning, and then they'll keep elaborating on it later in the article that will give you a fuller picture of what they're talking about. so i'm concerned student that you took your answer only from the first paragraph but there's more information about how much water there is on the moon later in the article I guess check your answer to see if you can't make it stronger and more detailed. because there's more details later in the article ",because i i went to so with like that so i know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits at that's not in the reading that i saw so i understand like maybe the reading doesn't have everything but also maybe i need to read a little more closely 
210.4,Chris,,yeah and i think i love that you're coming to this with some background information from your own life and that's great and i also wonder if some equipment is used for some jobs in space and some different equipment is used for different jobs so i wonder if looking for water on the moon requires some different different equipment than some of the things that you're talking about ,that's a really good point 
420.2,Chris,,so why don't you try to do a little bit of rereading and maybe adding on maybe elaborating on your answer a little bit after you reread ,okay 
110.1,Farrah,,student you've been waiting so patiently can you go first what do you need student and student i'm going to get to you in just a second i see that student and student have their hands up ,yeah thank you so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just want to say that i know that our time was really short but i really appreciate it how you have to clarify what we were so that we could address like what to our answers because you really thought about like what you were concerned about and even a question about how we could work on what we were and that was really helpful and i know that student knew and student knew exactly what to do to try to improve our answers so thank you so much it was really fun bye  
550.1,Farrah,,how has student thinking changed i want you to write in student reflection journal how has student thinking changed from when we started this activity can somebody tell me and i want to see student hands raised what does it mean to find evidence when we're talking about evidence we're thinking about what words do i see in this text or reading that help me answer this question we might look for cue words or leading words like called like you notice how called is before that so that's a great example of a word that we might that we might use alright student can you explain to me what evidence is but when we're looking for evidence we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help us you want to look in the story for where you can find these answers alright so can somebody tell me how maybe they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation yes so the next time student reading a tough question it can help you to look for that action words in the question because that's going to help you know specifically what student looking for yes student exactly student so how's student thinking changed since the very beginning so how can we approach that question a little differently now that student looked at it when you read something it's a three step process when student trying to answer a question and then you go look at student question and you look at what it's really asking you and then student read it again right so it's three steps skim it read it fast go look at the question and then you read to find the answer to that question does that make sense when we read the text and we read the question we need to correlate or we need to put them together to see what they're actually asking you the strategy i talked about if you want to be good at something you keep doing it over and over and over thank you okay so student do you feel like student changed student student process for working through text and questions about our keyword discover and you were thinking about how that was changing student thinking can you go back to that what i want to challenge you with is the next time that you are posed with a question i want you to first think about student question and then dig into the passage and really circle and find the evidence remember when we looked at our question we found a keyword keyword to help us and to answer the question always find and identify a keyword so you really understand what student looking for and go back in the text she used the passage that we provided to find her answer she didn't just use her background knowledge she made sure to go back and find something in the text and how did you find that instead of small machine it was the lunar orbiter what did you do to make that change i think what we all need to take away is that when we're answering reading comprehension questions we really need to focus on going back and reading the article in detail and maybe highlighting the text or annotating the text so that we can really understand in detail what we're learning and why we're learning it make sure when student reading the passage you take a holiday you highlight important facts when you go to student question so you see how if you did remember that it was a small machine and i like how you went back and reread student text to figure out what that machine was actually called sometimes we can read things but not quite absorb everything so it's always a good idea to go back and reread student text underline important information and details that can help you answer questions about it afterwards and keep that knowledge with you now one of the strategies that we were going to use today is to look at some keywords that we have in our question okay so from reading the text today and using our tools by going back and rereading the text and circling important information how can this broaden student understanding in the future of any topic that we discuss whether it's space or farming for restating a question you listen carefully for the words being used such as in our question to answer the question using the race method you restate the question how can you use student knowledge of restating the question in our next lesson okay so who can tell me what they did to correct their answer so how did you go about correcting student answer we look really closely at those keywords in our question so remember when we are reading our question we have to look really closely at those keywords those words that we need to look for in our text so remember when we are looking at our question we always have to look for those important words and then we have to look in our text for the same words so that we can try to find our answer often when we read it will tell us a sequence it will tell us what happened first and then what happens next so it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story well what i do agree what can you we don't want to just say we agree and it's good to agree with people but it's also good to know why we we think something when we're given questions we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are the more sense that they make later on so yeah you were partially right you want to look for that name student i think we've all kind of learned a lesson when we're reading the information we have to pay attention to it and not just assume does that make sense we know we all know different things about space but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being givendis so when we're answering questions like this again what's something that we need to make sure we do when we're answering the question we looked very closely at our text we looked for those keywordstext but what we need to do is definitely go through student passage and then highlight important details you always want to highlight student headings or student sub headings because those are a lot of key details in there that could give you some really good text evidence so that's what you need to do you want to find details that go along with student question and could possibly support student answer maybe like a chronological timeline of events in a text so if you broke down the text and circled like what happened first and then what happened and then what happened you might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question you built off student answer i appreciate how you build student answer we got more specific we narrowed down to that core of knowledge we're looking for and then we said okay this is this is what that machine was and this is what it was doing okay again so and much like with student earlier we're just we're trying to look at that question and we're specifically boiling it down to just its core components that that is a um sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together and it's called summarizing so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer so i really like to do is the race format so we're going to restate the question we're going to answer the question we're going to cite evidence and then we're going to explain that evidence so for example when i read what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon i try to think to myself i try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking so for example i might say the equipment that the scientist used to discover on the moon would be and then leave that answer blank and then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment but i think next time we need to use the strategy of looking at keywords and be really specific so next time you have a question you can underline student keywords to help you be more specific so that is why it's very important to highlight those keywords so you can give the best answer see sometimes it's okay to go back and reread to find the answer so now that student figured out the full answer what will you do next time to when student looking back in the text so now that we have talked about this how has this changed student think alright so next time go back and look in the story to find student answer yes that is exactly what i would like and that goes for all not just student so when student answering these questions try to use what you already know as well as specific information from what we're reading how did student thinking change there what did you do differently great job that's a good strategy finding those key clues and keywords to help you find student answer so next time you are answering a question like this how do you think you can make student answer better ok so now that i have given you all some feedback i want you to think about how you started out thinking then how that changed and how you will apply what you learned in student next task so i'm gonna give you all a couple minutes to think about it and then we will go around in the circle answering so we can start with student and just to repeat i want you to state how you started out thinking how the strategy you used changed based on the feedback i gave and what you will do next time to make sure you are fully answering the question what do you think you can include after using a background knowledge to answer student question so after you use student background knowledge what do you think what strategy do you think you can use to help promote learning and answering the question we're just going to go around student what do you think first student going to say what strategy you used and how you will build on to it for student next assignment or task and last but not least student what about you what do you think what strategy did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future you told me before that what you did was you read you noticed that the word water was in the question so you scanned through and you looked for things that related with water great so i really liked that response because you explained studentself really well you said that you read the question you saw what the question was asking for and then you found it and explained why so that was a really great response so can you tell me how student answer changed from the beginning so what would you with our discussion today what would you say student answer would be and how would it change so next time you answer a question like that what i want to hear is the actual equipment they were using definitely use student imagination i really like how you visualize the situation before giving student answer that's a really good strategy to answering questions student has that change student thinking a little bit right so next time you get a question on a text are you going to use student background knowledge and not read the text at all or are you going to read the text and then use student background knowledge right so what are a few things we can do next time when student not quite sure if student answers are all the way there yet right so you went back and read so what do you want to do next time a teacher asks you for a little bit more information yes that was a perfect response you used direct language from the text used specific vocab and you provided reasoning it was very specific that was a perfect response good job so to find evidence we need to use those quotes from the text and i like that student quoted and she said paragraph three so we could all look at our texts and find where she was reading do you see any ways that student mind is kind of changing are you thinking differently now that student hearing from student other friends and student i like that student connecting student background knowledge to help you it's great that student using student notes to help you further understand this text that's an excellent strategy that good readers use then you provided reasoning which is you can't survive without water it's very important to backup student answers with reasoning i'm wondering what you'll do next time you get a question like this to arrive at an answer like this what's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this i'm hearing that you read the text for details and evidence to help support student thinking and i'm hearing that you have an idea of how you can repeat this answer in the future i think it might be great if you write down this process in a notebook student connecting the details to another part of the text to explain how it could be valuable student you are using student background knowledge of a definition of orbiter to be able to apply student answerspace so when we're answering comprehension questions like this we really need to dig into the text and make sure we're using all the information that's right that's excellent so now when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions you can use dev's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use all of the evidence from the text i am going to give you some sentence starters and this is going to help us really solidify our learning and reading strategies alright so for example i can start out saying i started out thinking and you would say student prior response and now i think this way because and then you can tell me so next time you see a question asking about a text i will do what so you think about the thinking and thinking strategy that you use when you are reading a text and answering a question yo yo you started out thinking a certain way and now you think so why did you change student answer to what student also wrote what were you thinking okay so next time that you see a question like this that's asking about a text what are you going to do she's going back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used to discover water on the moon so we're gonna take a minute to turn around to student partner next to you and student going to talk about what are student takeaway from the revision process and so the next time i see a question like this where i have to look at the text again i'm going to talk about a strategy can you do you remember can you restate what their strategy is does class else want to share maybe they're thinking on what they thought that was the right answer but now what they know is the right answer great does class else want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed does class else want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading so this is a really good thing that you were just able to do so when you were rereading student able to see where you found student answer and you were able to find another part that you could add to it that's an excellent strategy to be looking at the text and pulling out those keywords and i think that that's an excellent strategy for all to think about when we're reading a text is to think next time you see this kind of question please be as specific as you can to answer the question okay specific name and of the things that you described okay when student trying to answer this question just to try to locate these keywords in the paragraph when we read we want to make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text so every single time that we're using information from a text in order to answer a discussion question we want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text even though we might know a lot about the subject reading already so that's great that's a great segue so what i wanted to ask you all next because you just gave specific evidence of what the question said and you analyze that and picked an answer based off that specifically so that's a great process or even thinking beyond today some tools that we can use for future texts like these okay um so when student thinking about student original answer and student new answer what do you think the difference is between those answers yes so when we're thinking about answering questions like these later in the future i think that what you said about details is very important yes so that use the lunar orbiter so student what on what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer that you have so when we're not drawing on our prior knowledge these things can be complex in reviewing them a couple times is important student you have something to add and what about that and when you all are thinking about that what parts can we use in the future when we're reading a question like this do you think that there's any of the words that we understand better now or anything about this about space that we under or about the moon that we understand better now or water it's important for you to look back at the passage to try and determine what the best answer to the question is it's always helpful to circle keywords in the question awesome so how would that how would you need to revise student answer to include those two ideas so what do you think you would do next time you get a question like this okay so what was different about that answer versus student first responsedis what do you think will stick with you for the next time student answering a similar question student what about you how did student answer change when you were able to revise it i mean student 100 right and using that background knowledge but when we answer questions especially questions about a text we always want to make sure that our answers on have evidence that are found directly from the text mm hmm so let's just think about as a all like what did we do together what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called student so as we proceed with this discussion i would want you to observe how student thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay and moon so i want to make sure that my answers to those questions incorporate all of those components ok so student do you want to share student new thinking what has changed in student thinking what i'm going to suggest to all of you is when you start the first thing you do before you start reading is to actually look closely at the question so i guess the other strategy that student going to want to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking and then student trying to make some connections between the concepts that student reading how what did you learn right what did you take away from this process of making inferences and making connections what did you learn about that you might be able to apply the next time you encounter a question like this that can help you make some inferences you want to read a little bit more closely for the meaning of the the material before it yeah so this is a really important skill for scientists we need to be able to look at a text and use quotes or information from the text to support our answers great so student now that student participating already would you mind telling me what student thinking was when you went back to try to revise student response okay so looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a great strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely is there anything else did class do anything different when they were revising their answerdis so we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies the next time we come across a question like this so first student going to answer i started out thinking blank then student going to answer and now i think blank because blank go ahead and take 30 seconds to answer those questions so next time you see a question asking about a text what will you do what made you change student thinking on that i love that you are looking for keywords that's a really strong reading technique and then after student finished i'm curious if you could share about how student thinking has changed from student original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote so i suggest that the next time you have a question like this you read through the text and look for those key specific words that might help you have a more rounded out answer now that we figured out the full answer what could you do next time so that you don't have to revise and revise and revise i think that a little bit of specificity and putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times what was different about student first answer and student second you saiddis i sort of noticed that through talking with student i mean that you also added some specificity to student answer do you think that helped you get a more full response okay what could you do next time you get a question like this what do you think you could do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking i think that's totally a great strategy for you i think if you see the question provide student answer just look over student answer one more time and then make sure it answers matches the question and you'll be good to go so how can i ask you a question how did you get from student first answer to student second answer how did student thinking change how can you know to look or how can you how can you see what the question is asking so that you understand what answer to give other than just putting more words down fantastic so i really appreciate something student just did he took little parts of the world to lunar orbit to draw a conclusion from that so we're really looking for small details here the question when we're looking for an answer it's important to think about those keywords and it can also be helpful to create our sentence but i wouldn't say that it necessarily has to be in student response before our conversation i thought that the answer was this or i didn't know the answer or i was still confused or just before our conversation this is what i thought and then after the conversation that we just had now i think i think it's nice though when we read a text if we can scan the text for specific pieces of equipment then that way when we write our answers out if i ever asked you can you tell me what paragraph you found that in student be able to point to that exact part of the text so i think student you did just that when you just re read that beginning of paragraph two has our thinking kind of changed at all since we started talking through this student sorry i saw student hand was up yeah exactly you could specify the small machine and that's a strategy you can use in response questions hi welcome back from lunch so we'll just pick up from where we left it student as we talked about earlier in the day maybe in the future you can use specifying techniques in student responses well in this case adding a name would be sufficient but i i'm talking more about a strategy of specifying student responses instead of just like adding into adding a name into it so but student strategy is absolutely right you you locate the keywords in the question and you find them in the text so the next time when student answering these kinds of questions be sure to look for student information or student answer in the text tell me how your thinking has changed what does it means to find evidencequestion what i mean about evidence is we're thinking about what words do i see what help me answer this question lookimg for cue words or leading words is a great example of a word that we might that we might use can you explain to me what evidence is question when looking for evidence we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help look in the story to find these answers how has they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation next time student reading a tough question it can help you to look for that action words to know specifically so how's student thinking changed since the very beginning let's approach that question adifferently now student looked question it's a three step process when student trying to answer a question look at student question what is it really asking studentquestion it is three steps skim read fast and look at the questionthen you read to find the answer to that question we read the question we need to correlate we need to put them together to see what they're actually asking this is the strategy i mean to be good at something keep doing it over and over and over do you feel like student changed student student process for working through text and questions about keyword discovery were you were thinking about how that was changing student thinking next timeyou are posed with a question first think about student question and then dig into the passage and really circle and find the evidence we looked at the question and found a keyword keywords help us to answer questions find and identify a keyword to understand what student looking for use the passage provided to find answer dont use her background knowledge make sure to go back and find something in text how did you find that instead of small machine it was the lunar orbiterquestion what did you do to make that change when answering reading comprehension questions we focus on going back and reading the article in detail and highlight or annotate the text or annotating the text so we canunderstand in detail what we're learning and why we're learning it when student reading the passage highlight important facts i like how you went back and reread student text to figure out what that machine was actually called we can read things but not quite absorb everything go back and reread student text underline important information and details that can help you answer questions about it afterwards and keep that knowledge with you one of the strategies we use is to look at some keywords that we have in our question okay so from reading the text today and using our tools by going back and rereading the text and circling important informationevidence how can this broaden student understanding in the future of any topic that we discuss whether listen carefully for the words being used to restate question you answer the question using the same method you restated the question use student knowledge of restating the question in next lesson how did studentgo about correcting student answer examine the keywords in question when reading question look really closely at keywords we always have to look for those important words we can find our answer by lookin in our text for the same words it will tell us what happened first and then what happens next so it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story we don't want to just say we agree and it's good to agree with people but it's also good to know why we we think something we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are the more sense that they make later on so yeah you were partially right you want to look for that name student we've learned a lesson when we're reading the information we have to pay attention to it and not just assume weknow different things about space but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being givendis we need to make sure when we're answering the question we're answering questions like this looked for those keywords when we looked very closely at texttext go through passage and highlight important details you always want to highlight student headings or student sub headings because those are key details that could give you some good evidence that's what you need to do you want to find details that go along with student question and could possibly support student answer a chronological timeline of events in a text break down the text and circled hat happened first and what happened next you might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question you built off student answer got more specific we narrowed down to that core of knowledge we're looking for ook at that question and specifically boil it down to its core components that that is a um sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together and it's called summarizing so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer swe're going to restate the question to answer the question we cite evidence and then explain that evidence try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking leave that answer blank and then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment use the strategy of looking at keywords and be specific you can underline student keywords to help you be more specific it's very important to highlight those keywords to get the best answer it's okay to go back and reread to find the answer now that student figured out the full answer what will you do next time when looking at the text now has this changed student thinking now that we have talked about this next time go back and look in the story to find answer when student answering these questions use what you already know as well as specific information from what we're reading what did student do differently and how did student thinking change there that's a good strategy finding those clues and keywords how do you think you can make student answer better next time you are answering a question like this i want you to think about how student started out thinking then how that changed how you will apply what you learned in student next task i want you to state how you started out thinking how the strategy you used changed based on the feedback i gave and what you will do next time to make sure you are fully answering the question what do you think you can include after using a background knowledge to answer student question so after you use student background knowledge what do you think what strategy do you think you can use to help promote learning and answering the question what do you think first student going to say what strategy you used and how you will build on to it for student next assignment or task and last but not least student what about you what do you think what strategy did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future what you did was you read you noticed that the word water was in the question so you scanned through and you looked for things that related with water you explained studentself really well you said that you read the question you saw what the question was asking for tell me how has student answer changed from the beginning what would you say student answer would be and how would it change next time i want to hear is the actual equipment they were using imagination is a really good strategy to answering questions visualization is a really good strategy to answering questions changed student thinking a little bit next time you get a question on a text don't use student background knowledge next time when if student not quite sure if student answers are all the way there yet you used direct language from the text used specific vocab and you provided reasoning it was very specific that was a perfect response we need to use those quotes from the textt o find evidence do you see that student mind is kind of changing are you thinking differently that's an excellent strategy that good readers use student provided reasoning it's very important to backup student answers with reasoning next time you get a question like this to arrive at an answer like this what's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this you read the text for details and evidence to help support student thinking you have an idea of how you can repeat this answer it would be great if you write down this process in a notebook it could be valuable to connect the details to another part of the text to explain how student you are using student background knowledge of a definition of orbiter to be able to apply student answerspace when answering comprehension questions we need to dig into the text and make sure we're using the information when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions you can use student's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use all of the evidence from the text here are some sentence starters to help us solidify our learning and reading strategies you would say student prior response and now i think this way because and then you can tell me so nex,
" time you see a question asking about a text i will do what when you are reading a text and answering a question think about the thinking and thinking strategy that you use student started out thinking a certain way and now you think why did you change student answer to what student also wrote next time that you see a question like this what are you going to do go back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used what are student takeaway from the revision process next time student see a question like this where have to look at the text again talk about a strategy can you restate what their strategy is does class want to share their on what they thought that was the right answer but now what they know is the right answer does class want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed does class want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading you were rereading student able to see where you found student answer and you were able to find another part that you could add to it pulling out those keywords is an excellent strategy that's an excellent strategy for class to think about be as specific as you can to answer the questionnext time you see this kind of question locate these keywords in the paragraph make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text we're need to use information from a text in order to answer a discussion question we want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text even though we might know a lot about the subject reading already you just gave specific evidence of what the question said and you analyze that and picked an answer based off that specifically so that's a great process thinking beyond today some tools that we can use for future texts student thinking about student original answer and student new answer what do you think the difference is between those answers in the future i think that what you said about details is very important what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer reviewing them a couple times is important student you have something to add think about that what parts to use in the future are there any words that we understand better now or anything about this about that we understand better now look back at the passage and determine what the best answer to the question is it's always helpful to circle keywords in the question awesome so how would that how would you need to revise student answer to include those two ideas when student get a question like this what student would do next time what was different about that answer versus student first response next time student answering samewhatwill stick with you student what about you how did student answer change when you were able to revise it we always want to make sure that our answers on have evidence that are found directly from the text what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called student so as we proceed with this discussion i would want you to observe how student thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay make sure that student answers to those questions incorporate all of those components do you want to share student new thinking what has changed in student thinking when you start the first thing you do before you start reading is to actually look closely at the question anither strategy to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking and then student trying to make some connections between the concepts that student reading how what did you learn right what did you take away from this process of making inferences and making connections what did you learn about that you might be able to apply the next time you encounter a question like this allow student to make some inferences you want to read closely for the meaning of the the material before it we need to be able to look at a text and use quotes or information from the text to support our answers would you mind telling me what student thinking was when you went back to try to revise student response looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a good strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely would student do anything different to were revise answer we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies the next time we come across a question like this so what will student do when you see a question asking about a text next time what made you change student thinking on that looking for keywords is a strong reading technique could you could share about how student thinking has changed from student original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote so i suggest that the next time you have a question like this you read through the text and look for those key specific words that might help you have a more rounded out answer what could you do next time so that you don't have to revise and revise and revise putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times tell me what was different about student first answer and studentdis you also added some specificity to student answer do you think that helped you get a key full response if you get a question like this what could you do next time what mightstudent do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking that's totally a great strategy for student look over student answer one more time and then make sure it answers matches the question and you'll be good to go how did you get from student first answer to student second answer how did student thinking change how can you how can you see what the question is asking so that you understand what answer to give other than just putting more words down studenttook little parts of the world to lunar orbit to draw a conclusion from that so we're really looking for small details here it's important to think about those keywords and it can also be helpful to create our sentence but i wouldn't say that it necessarily has to be in student response before our conversation i thought that the answer was this or i didn't know the answer or i was still confused or just before our conversation this is what i thought and then after the conversation that we just had now i think we can read the text for specific pieces of equipment then that way when we write our answers out tell me what paragraph you found that in student be able to point to that exact part of the text we can read the text for specific pieces of equipment then that way when we write our answers out if i ever asked you can you tell me what paragraph you found that in student be able to point to that exact part of the text so i think student you did just that when you just re read that beginning of paragraph two has our thinking kind of changed at all since we started talking through this student sorry i saw student hand was up that's a strategy you can use in response questions hi welcome back from lunch so we'll just pick up from where we left it student as we talked about earlier in the day maybe in the future you can use specifying techniques in student responses this strategy is correct to locate the keywords in the question and you find them in the text next time be sure to look for student information or student answer in the text """, ,,,
