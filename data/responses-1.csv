Adapted from the New York Times, by Kenneth Chang
The Moon is a Desert
(1) Scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon’s
polar craters. These craters are dark places where the sun never shines.
(2) NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter
looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small.
(3) That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth. The water they
found is microscopic, meaning you wouldn’t be able to see it if you were looking straight
at it! You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,,,,,,
