    - want class after student talked student partners student class members circled underline terms text student questions class think could reconstruct student answer just little more detailed :: expand, action, ask, tagconcern
    - student remember uses microscope humans look through microscope right scientist look through microscope :: tool, search, science, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - student remember what called machine science sorts wacky names machine that's what looking looking find name what small machine :: tool, search, question, tag500, tagconcern
    - student totally yeah look text look back think close same line about small machine sure know :: tool, search, agree, tagmeta
    - student yeah totally microscope look three sentences here three paragraph :: text, tool, search, agree, tagconcern
    - student paragraph three says water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able looking straight would need scientific cool tool called microscope look really closely there's part microscope before then :: text, tool, search, science, agree, tagconcern
    - student where found called lunar orbiter paragraph right :: space, text, search, agree, tagconcern
    - student yeah what machine call :: tool, question, agree, tagconcern
    - student tiny water well love lunar orbiter going into polar crater looking small water where's small water located :: space, search, science, tagconcern
    - student what form like :: question, tagconcern
    - student looking giant lake looking what yeah well what form water what same text part don't :: search, question, science, agree, tagconcern
    - student what equipment okay looking name what's name small machine came :: tool, search, question, agree, tagconcern
    - student yeah think there even very short text different pieces equipment mentioned right :: tool, agree, disagree, tag400, tagconcern
    - student third paragraph tell scientist used microscope find water :: text, tool, search, science, tagconcern
    - awesome student which piece equipment think most important here :: tool, question, tagconcern
    - student awesome little machine lands moon :: space, tool, tagconcern
    - student yeah that's right doesn't really scientist using :: science, agree, tagconcern
    - yeah that's awesome text both found text question what small machine student what machine :: tool, search, ask, question, agree, tagconcern
    - student could yeah look something discover :: search, agree, tagconcern
    - talking about what equipment maybe equipment name right what small machine name class class circle what small machine called :: tool, action, question, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - student microscope great example piece equipment also thing called lunar orbiter investigate things work together :: space, tool, search, agree, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - looking both sentences class want look student sheet paper student looking word lunar orbiter microscope there word kind signal what equipment :: space, text, tool, search, question, evidence, tagconcern
    - student there second part sentence tells maybe what called like name equipment :: text, tool, question, tagconcern
    - going paragraph going read while reading looking student :: text, search, action, tagconcern
    - student going look paragraph okay just want listen while reading find particular equipment might stop talk about okay :: text, tool, search, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - student means moon still drier driest desert earth water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able looking straight :: space, search, science, tagconcern
    - need scientific toll called microscope look really closely what microscope helping class :: tool, search, question, science, tagconcern
    - student because passage look back find says nasa sent small machine called looper lunar orbiter investigate lunar orbiter look deposit large polar crater what name machine called :: space, text, tool, search, question, science, tagconcern
    - student small machine look back what that's called read sentence okay number nasa sent small machine called lunar orbiter investigate :: space, text, tool, search, action, question, agree, tagconcern
    - student what microscope what microscope text :: tool, question, tagconcern
    - find water before look right class know what discover means :: search, question, science, agree

    - student back text specific answers from text what equipment :: tool, question, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - student need back into text find specifically where states what equipment used discover water moon :: space, tool, search, question, science, evidence, tagconcern
    - student back into text look :: search, tagconcern
    - student says text back look :: search, tagconcern
    - back look what's another word student :: text, search, expand, question, tagconcern
    - student small machine right what name machine :: tool, question, agree, tagconcern
    - student look what what says astronaut :: search, question, science, tagconcern
    - student what astronaut water :: question, science, tagconcern
    - student what text about astronaut water should under bottle water valuable source valid valuable resource what :: question, science, tagmeta
    - student right hydrogen oxygen :: science, agree, tagconcern
    - student back think second paragraph you'll nasa sent small machine called lunar orbiter investigate lunar orbiter look deposit large polar crater :: space, text, tool, search, science, tagconcern
    - student that's where found think right :: search, agree, tagconcern
    - student landed moon south pole that's where found looked deposit since wasn't necessarily water frozen water look large polar crater guess really cold :: space, search, science, tagconcern
    - underlined equipment discover great tell just reading passage student tell what word equipment might refer passage what kind equipment scientist discover water moon :: space, text, tool, search, question, science, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - student deposits what tell what says deposit very small :: question, science, tagconcern
    - very small they're looking something very small they're take lunar orbiter there also read paragraph three student :: space, text, search, action, tag500, tagconcern
    - student word could that's second sentence circle word could student pencil will second sentence paragraph four says could useful lots ways :: text, action, tagconcern
    - student would think word useful also same maybe valuable look back paragraph telling could useful :: text, search, agree, tagconcern
    - student stop second what first paragraph tells know :: text, question, tagconcern
    - student okay someone paraphrase paragraph :: text, agree, tagconcern
    - student yeah what would deposit what think would look like :: search, question, science, agree, tagconcern
    - student tool because deposit small can't student eyes tool microscope able :: tool, science, tagconcern
    - student okay moisture that's still bigger moisture found moon frost naked what found moon would even able tell there without lunar orbiter microscope being able :: space, tool, search, question, agree, tagconcern
    - student okay think water moon look same glass water would drink :: space, search, science, agree, tagconcern
    - student paragraph three what about :: text, question, tagmeta
    - student when when says able :: question, tagconcern
    - student what right after :: question, agree, tagconcern
