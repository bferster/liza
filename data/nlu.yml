    - getting little topic here [student](student) said [astronaut](role) [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) [space](space) shuttles types [equipment](tool)  right about
    - would would really useful [student](student) what about
    -  right will take time money might worked [student](student)
    - [student](student) think well [water](space) because [look](search) ng what what [equipment](tool) used [find](search) [water](space) there other important [word](text)
    - [student](student) didn't  answer isn't wrong just wanting [find](search) kind even [more](expand) about [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) correct
    - good that's right that's right sorry missed   answer [student](student) sent mall [machine](tool) that's very good  exactly right that's [tool](tool) [look](search) ng
    - [student](student) correct
    - [student](student) using [microscope](tool) [find](search) [water](space) just [look](search) [water](space) found
    - microscope everybody where [student](student) [found](search) [paragraph](text) three
    - good  everybody hear while [student](student) reading
    - wonderful answer anyone else want answer
    - [student](student)  answer correct because [microscope](tool) [tool](tool) [equipment](tool) very broad when comes [machine](tool) [tool](tool) what refer
    - [student](student) yeah  answer wouldn't wrong
    - [student](student) cute yeah don't think wrong
    -  answer wrong [student](student)
    - [student](student) small [machine](tool) well don't think  wrong
    - [student](student)  answer incorrect

    - [student](student)  answer correct
    - correct [equipment](tool) [student](student) both correct [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) that's specifically what hadn't used [find](search) [water](space) [crater](space)
    - [student](student) going  response wrong means okay
    - [student](student) maybe  answer right answer [nasa](space) send small [machine](tool) [look](search) what written actually [look](search) number there
    - [student](student) didn't  answer wrong
    - [student](student) said small [machine](tool) [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) type [machine](tool)  answer right
    - [student](student)  answers wrong
    - right different types [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) guys right [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) [space](space) [suits](space) [equipment](tool) equipment help [discover](search) water
    - [student](student) really good stating [scientist](role) [found](search) [crater](space) full [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) could something drink could something could stay clean good
    - [student](student)  right great understanding what [water](space) even valuable moon
    - yeah drink bake great guys thank
    - [student](student) great answer
    - [student](student) mean small [machine](tool)   still correct
    - [student](student) well would definitely know really come handy know [scientist](role) astrologers might perhaps moon
    - [student](student) would definitely know perhaps provide sort know sort some greenhouses might able construct [moon](space) perhaps [scientist](role) could even perhaps grow vegetables something grow moon
    - just like  brought about [space](space) he's [look](search) ng into knows just about [equipment](tool) about [space](space) [student](student)
    - [student](student) when [look](search) d over  answer there some great points brought about wasn't wasn't wrong what
    - great that's good connection loved  response about [word](text) used [word](text) hydrate hydrate [student](student) said
    - [student](student) like response because that's something  proving whenever asked about garden what makes think could  telling
    - [student](student) thought great idea [look](search) glad [look](search) d detail about hearing shoes because heavy
    - [student](student) great there's dealing [article](text) because that's like [equipment](tool) right like read about [equipment](tool) passage
    - [student](student) okay good response
    - okay know what [student](student) sounds like good point maybe there there's probably [more](expand) just thing used [find](search) water
    - [student](student) gave really good answers
    - [student](student)   answer wrong [paragraph](text) three talks about [water](space) [found](search) microscopic meaning wouldn't able think that's where thinking would need [tool](tool) walk [microscope](tool) types things [moon](space) help understand more
    - [student](student) nothing's wrong  paragraph
    - [student](student) pretty good definitely [lunar](space) orbiter
    - [student](student) that's absolutely true
    - [student](student) right  answer seems pretty solid
    - [student](student)  answer's don't think  answer incorrect  answer's  answer correct
    - yeah that's great point [student](student) would [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) stuff actually [explore](search) [moon](space) yeah would need equipment
    - [student](student)  answer necessarily wrong
    - [student](student)   answers necessarily wrong
    - [student](student) that's definitely true [scientist](role) [find](search) [crater](space) full [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) okay glad  no [ice](space)
    - [student](student) went right into said [scientist](role) want [crater](space) some [water](space) [moon](space) true
    - think guys
    - exactly right [equipment](tool) [tool](tool) guys correct stating both things microscope
    - [student](student) small [machine](tool) both [equipment](tool) [tool](tool)
    - [student](student) absolutely correct appreciate sharing fact [article](text) today discusses importance oxygen
    - [student](student)  answer drink [water](space) stay hydrated very good answer mentioned here text
    - [student](student) extremely extremely close
    - [student](student) saying saying wrong didn't [machine](tool) y think whenever talked about question [find](search)  actually went wrong
    - [student](student) weren't wrong after
    - [student](student) wrong
    - very good like [student](student) said [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) [moon](space) able survive moon
    - [student](student) didn't wrong  answer isn't wrong
    - okay well going second right  wrong just going there different answer okay right [student](student) share what [underline](action) paragraph
    - [student](student) said needed [tool](tool) called [microscope](tool) [look](search) really closely true
    - [student](student) exactly exactly need special [tool](tool) called [microscope](tool) little microscopic whatever ends being case microscopic amounts water
    - [student](student) essence kind both correct
    - [student](student) reality sure teacher would count wrong included every
    - [student](student) know [lunar](space) order [microscope](tool) just about anything don't think counted wrong because technically correct
    - [student](student) every little [moon](space) [find](search) [water](space) technically correct
    - [student](student) yeah would based [text](text) here they've used different [equipment](tool) [discover](search) there [water](space) moon
    - good [student](student) exactly right [look](search) [paragraph](text) three will fact says need microscope

    - right [student](student) you'll able share some [information](text) maybe learn from  friends okay
    -  right [student](student) said same thing right  what something said [scientist](role)
    - [student](student) okay well glad know about space
    -  [student](student) think both great using  outside [resource](space) different things  experienced  life related think that's awesome wrong
    - [student](student) maybe even help others learn [more](expand) about science sort [explore](search) strengths within type knowledge
    - [student](student) well that's that's that's really cool know sort idea sort special inroads know  know first hand knowledge some might actually come know sort handy help somebody goes kind understand material
    - [student](student) glad know about [space](space) because need knowledge help especially questions today glad brought about [space](space) because that's here today
    - okay [student](student) brought about [space](space) glad that's good point
    - different some things different school right learning differently guys done great [look](search) ng [more](expand) into because some  knowledge  read about [nasa](space) help things like help partners alright back question
    - [student](student) that's awesome [information](text) because know what help today about learning about importance
    - thank [student](student) because know make some great connections about  because know shared [information](text) about things done work
    - [student](student) could confirm about probably told right 
    - that's great [student](student) know what gave great idea want each little piece paper
    - [student](student) okay some some good [found](search) tion [space](space) when cover [more](expand) about [space](space) seems like you'll able help some  classmates right
    - okay maybe maybe forward maybe i'll group leaders okay
    - think means probably could share rest group about some  experience [nasa](space) maybe could talk about here little could tell some [more](expand) interesting facts
    - okay maybe [student](student) could leaders when comes some little [more](expand) knowledge about [space](space) okay
    - think know know about [space](space) don't think would make even better group help rest maybe could learn from each other
    - [student](student) know much about [space](space) maybe share some  classmates
    - [student](student) obviously shows  understanding [space](space) that's really cool
    - [student](student) i've never [nasa](space) that's really cool experience
    - [student](student) okay read aloud right read because know everything about [space](space) already
    - [student](student) love wish could [nasa](space) very away
    - [student](student) think that's really cool love experience about [space](space) know there's different types [equipment](tool) work together
    - [student](student) know could tell  answer really enjoy [space](space) know [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) [space](space) [explore](search) there
    - [student](student) yeah [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) like talking about that's super cool
    - would like  knowledge already know share other students group okay
    - [student](student) response know quite maybe actually help teach other students here
    - [student](student) think think  help learn some stuff
    - well thank letting know [student](student)
    - [student](student) hopefully kevin unless tell little about experience there well
    - [student](student)  very enthusiastic about [space](space) enjoy
    - [student](student) well definitely think would help stuck around maybe help encourage  classmates learn little [more](expand) even learn little [more](expand)  self
    - [student](student) maybe understand everything help some  classmates
    - [student](student) like said think planning building base moon
    - [student](student) that's referencing [text](text) believe right about
    - whoo that's fabulous maybe help understand even [more](expand) about [space](space) stay group might able help
    - [student](student) maybe help some other students because some students might first time learning about space
    - [student](student) could actually help next question
    - needs things  being [astronaut](role) okay we'll start over here [student](student)
    - [student](student) well awesome glad know about [space](space) maybe should share some other things  friends today while talking okay
    - [student](student) that's pretty soon that's very away
    - [student](student) classmates said don't know  background knowledge really help
    - [student](student) okay thank using  outside knowledge contribute conversation
    - thank thank  answer thank explaining case anyone didn't know
    - worries even though know guys know lots about [space](space)  know [more](expand) about [space](space) everyone else group
    - awesome well that's really cool fact guys know much about [space](space) already means definitely some good background knowledge connect
    - [student](student) would need [moon](space) know said know about [space](space) very good response
    - yeah definitely [equipment](tool) great answer  also just want make sure similar  know guys lots knowledge about space
    - [student](student) yeah that's awesome glad background knowledge what [astronaut](role)
    - [student](student) yeah really cool that's good example some background knowledge about topic
    - yeah that's really cool experience everyone definitely haven't really cool thing share [student](student)
    -  [ice](space) [student](student)
    - [student](student) absolutely good think outside text
    - right awesome [student](student) like didn't
    - [student](student) text there's other [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) used
    - [student](student) thought about using  knowledge nasa
    - [student](student) that's super cool wish wish went [nasa](space) maybe might there soon awesome yeah
    - [student](student) because we'd love here  expertise could help well okay okay we'll start
    - [student](student) know about [space](space) think  answer good know
    - [student](student) some final [word](text) like [oxygen](space) know what [oxygen](space) tank know equipment
    - [student](student) already some background knowledge
    - [student](student) know about what [scientist](role) [space](space) what actually
    - guys some background knowledge really good like what guys came
    - that's really cool [student](student) want thank sharing  personal experience really helps build what learning
    - [student](student) also great answer [scientist](role) things like said know about [space](space)  seen things
    - also continue readings outside [student](student) learn little [more](expand) like said know about [space](space) [more](expand) continue reading about [more](expand) learn about okay
    - [student](student) that's really good connection note news  hearing outside [text](text) yeah [equipment](tool) will definitely help there thank [add](expand) ng
    - [student](student) yeah that's great background knowledge bring table
    - [student](student) that's awesome that's great really good knowledge about [nasa](space) which come handy future
    - [student](student) looking something [find](search) good point thank sharing
    - [student](student) then probably could teach something about space
    - [student](student) okay well told going teach something about [space](space) didn't know there nice
    - [student](student) that's really cool appreciate telling teaching rest students fact that's really cool fact
    - [student](student) probably know about space
    - that's really good know things [student](student) really good things know really interesting
    - [student](student) yeah that's awesome hopefully bring some knowledge into today's lesson excited about
    - [student](student) know know about [space](space) sure know about space
    - [student](student) well that's awesome help rest  friends learn about [space](space) think should stay
    - [student](student) okay glad know much about already think should stay help assignment  classmates sound okay
    - [student](student) well glad already know much about [space](space) think could stay help answer questions  other classmates
    - [student](student) describe  intro which awesome because could tell know much about [scientist](role) space
    - right seems like everyone group background [information](text) about [space](space) which great probably when reading [article](text) connected which really great when [look](search) d [text](text) said
    - right love some background [information](text) [student](student) that's great
    - [student](student) great background knowledge though
    - [student](student) right actually like second question great know background knowledge
    - [student](student) maybe tell share what know also know about what think
    - [student](student) that's good thank saying exact names well that's exactly what [look](search) ng because  [nasa](space) know about haven't love hearing what  experienced yeah
    - well then know questions might know answers questions some might need help some classmates might need help think  going pretty vital part group
    - [student](student) that's really cool thank sharing maybe when bigger writing assignment about unit include some details already learned from other places like maybe 's read other [book](text) about [space](space)  [nasa](space) that's really cool love chance share maybe during show-and-tell
    - [student](student) that's sometimes need know little deeper maybe just help other classmates understand just what talking about maybe minds going little
    - [student](student)  really great [resource](space) don't hang tight
    - glad know about [space](space) think staying group would really benefit other classmates because maybe could share some [information](text) already know about [space](space) sounds good
    - [student](student) yeah that's hopes right [scientist](role) works really hard
    - [student](student) know what since know much about [space](space) when talk  partners tell little [more](expand) what know need
    - well honestly think could great [resource](space)  group members could help maybe like come answers maybe tell what think
    - [student](student) that's cool yeah
    - [student](student) well love bringing  background knowledge saying  [nasa](space) before that's really cool
    - [student](student) okay going work really great know about [space](space) that's going really helpful answer questions
    - [student](student) would really cool maybe would some stuff reading about actually taking place knowledge about because read about
    - [student](student)  right different equipment
    - [student](student) really enjoyed like  background knowledge help [support](search) because like said know about space
    - think [student](student) being here  friends  classmates [resource](space) questions future about readings assignments because seems like really understand understand assignment
    - [student](student) yeah think  right like because went [nasa](space)  able  background knowledge  able build what already know
    - [student](student) that's really really cool that's really interesting wonder will happen maybe won't
    - [student](student) well glad know about [space](space) already because know background knowledge very important maybe there's things could share know other students might know
    - [student](student) could help understand better
    - [student](student) yeah great glad brought  background knowledge
    - that's very good like [information](text)  head feel like well don't know about rest [student](student) maybe would better better answer
    - [student](student) yeah mean that's great that's great background knowledge really appreciate [add](expand) ng conversation think that's really really important

    - that's great [student](student) know what gave great idea want each little piece paper
    - [student](student) okay some some good [found](search) tion [space](space) when cover [more](expand) about [space](space) seems like you'll able help some  classmates right
    - okay maybe maybe forward maybe i'll group leaders okay
    - think means probably could share rest group about some  experience [nasa](space) maybe could talk about here little could tell some [more](expand) interesting facts
    - okay maybe [student](student) could leaders when comes some little [more](expand) knowledge about [space](space) okay
    - think know know about [space](space) don't think would make even better group help rest maybe could learn from each other
    - [student](student) know much about [space](space) maybe share some  classmates
    - [student](student) obviously shows  understanding [space](space) that's really cool
    - [student](student) i've never [nasa](space) that's really cool experience
    - [student](student) okay read aloud right read because know everything about [space](space) already

    - [student](student) maybe understand everything help some  classmates
    - [student](student) like said think planning building base moon
    - [student](student) that's referencing [text](text) believe right about
    - whoo that's fabulous maybe help understand even [more](expand) about [space](space) stay group might able help
    - [student](student) maybe help some other students because some students might first time learning about space
    - [student](student) could actually help next question
    - needs things  being [astronaut](role) okay we'll start over here [student](student)
    - [student](student) well awesome glad know about [space](space) maybe should share some other things  friends today while talking okay
    - [student](student) that's pretty soon that's very away
    - [student](student) classmates said don't know  background knowledge really help
    - [student](student) okay thank using  outside knowledge contribute conversation
    - thank thank  answer thank explaining case anyone didn't know
    - worries even though know guys know lots about [space](space)  know [more](expand) about [space](space) everyone else group
    - awesome well that's really cool fact guys know much about [space](space) already means definitely some good background knowledge connect
    - [student](student) would need [moon](space) know said know about [space](space) very good response
    - yeah definitely [equipment](tool) great answer  also just want make sure similar  know guys lots knowledge about space

    - [student](student) yeah really cool that's good example some background knowledge about topic
    - yeah that's really cool experience everyone definitely haven't really cool thing share [student](student)
    -  [ice](space) [student](student)
    - [student](student) absolutely good think outside text
    - right awesome [student](student) like didn't
    - [student](student) text there's other [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) used
    - [student](student) thought about using  knowledge nasa
    - [student](student) that's super cool wish wish went [nasa](space) maybe might there soon awesome yeah
    - [student](student) because we'd love here  expertise could help well okay okay we'll start
    - [student](student) know about [space](space) think  answer good know
    - [student](student) some final [word](text) like [oxygen](space) know what [oxygen](space) tank know equipment
    - [student](student) already some background knowledge
    - [student](student) know about what [scientist](role) [space](space) what actually
    - guys some background knowledge really good like what guys came
    - that's really cool [student](student) want thank sharing  personal experience really helps build what learning
    - [student](student) also great answer [scientist](role) things like said know about [space](space)  seen things
    - also continue readings outside [student](student) learn little [more](expand) like said know about [space](space) [more](expand) continue reading about [more](expand) learn about okay
    - [student](student) that's really good connection note news  hearing outside [text](text) yeah [equipment](tool) will definitely help there thank [add](expand) ng
    - [student](student) yeah that's great background knowledge bring table
    - [student](student) that's awesome that's great really good knowledge about [nasa](space) which come handy future
    - [student](student) looking something [find](search) good point thank sharing
    - [student](student) then probably could teach something about space
    - [student](student) okay well told going teach something about [space](space) didn't know there nice
    - [student](student) that's really cool appreciate telling teaching rest students fact that's really cool fact
    - [student](student) probably know about space
    - that's really good know things [student](student) really good things know really interesting
    - [student](student) yeah that's awesome hopefully bring some knowledge into today's lesson excited about
    - [student](student) know know about [space](space) sure know about space
    - [student](student) well that's awesome help rest  friends learn about [space](space) think should stay
    - [student](student) okay glad know much about already think should stay help assignment  classmates sound okay
    - [student](student) well glad already know much about [space](space) think could stay help answer questions  other classmates
    - [student](student) describe  intro which awesome because could tell know much about [scientist](role) space
    - right seems like everyone group background [information](text) about [space](space) which great probably when reading [article](text) connected which really great when [look](search) d [text](text) said
    - right love some background [information](text) [student](student) that's great
    - [student](student) great background knowledge though
    - [student](student) right actually like second question great know background knowledge
    - [student](student) maybe tell share what know also know about what think
    - [student](student) that's good thank saying exact names well that's exactly what [look](search) ng because  [nasa](space) know about haven't love hearing what  experienced yeah
    - well then know questions might know answers questions some might need help some classmates might need help think  going pretty vital part group
    - [student](student) that's really cool thank sharing maybe when bigger writing assignment about unit include some details already learned from other places like maybe 's read other [book](text) about [space](space)  [nasa](space) that's really cool love chance share maybe during show-and-tell
    - [student](student) that's sometimes need know little deeper maybe just help other classmates understand just what talking about maybe minds going little
    - [student](student)  really great [resource](space) don't hang tight

    - [student](student) going call first what when answer question
    - [student](student) tell what responded question
    - [student](student) tell what answered what  answer
    - today [student](student) could tell what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [moon](space) could read  answer
    - alright [student](student) tell what answered what said
    - [student](student) tell what said
    - guys tell little about what think [equipment](tool) [look](search) like [student](student)
    - [student](student) sounds great want start
     - [student](student) that's that's totally correct think we'd agree [microscope](tool) would [look](search) [water](space) really closely although think about what happens before point right
    - [student](student) know exactly [equipment](tool) used [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) right think each like piece then just just needed microscope
    - [student](student) like couple people just circle [microscope](tool) that's great example there multiple [tool](tool) like just pointed come from things
    - [student](student) need [microscope](tool) [look](search) really closely things what [scientist](role) used [find](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) semi right could went into [more](expand) detail small [machine](tool) small [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) orbiter
    - [student](student) very close
    - [student](student) exactly like  thinking what keeps [water](space) together passage
    - [student](student) partially correct need [microscope](tool) however that's didn't just send [microscope](tool) moon
    - [student](student) well partially correct [equipment](tool) sent [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) able across ground surface [moon](space) surface check [deposit](space)
    - [student](student) then once figured there
    - [student](student) deposits very small [water](space) then [microscope](tool) make sure what thought there okay [microscope](tool) actually gave evidence
    - [student](student) there [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) then [tool](tool) used microscope
    - [student](student) completely wrong will send small [machine](tool) really doesn't
    - [student](student) that's said   right track
    - [student](student) okay said  meet [scientific](space) [tool](tool) called [microscope](tool) [look](search) really closely right [microscope](tool) piece equipment
    - yeah sure okay [student](student) also right [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) tanks
    - valuable okay agree valuable [word](text) that's right going [look](search) [more](expand) thing [more](expand) other [word](text) question [student](student) could tell what [word](text) another [word](text) circled
    - [student](student) [scientist](role) [found](search) [crater](space) full [water](space) [moon](space) absolutely true that's absolutely something reading
    - [student](student) okay there's pieces [equipment](tool) actually [look](search) ng here
    - [student](student) kind version other slits think about
    - [student](student) wouldn't needed pieces [equipment](tool) actually figure there [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) equipment [microscope](tool) piece [scientific](space) [equipment](tool) correct
    - [student](student) yeah that's right
    - [student](student) awesome okay yeah would used [equipment](tool) would [oxygen](space) they're [moon](space) [astronaut](role) [moon](space) right
    - [student](student) well enough that's right [astronaut](role) correct
    - [student](student) well okay pieces [equipment](tool) correct
    - okay read  answers think very good points everyone think little [more](expand) about what question about example question what question
    - [student](student) says [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) right enough question sent small [machine](tool) [look](search) better [word](text) answer question
    - [student](student) okay said [nasa](space) send small [machine](tool) right think read little
    - [student](student) think even better think that's great response think make amazing response question asking what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - that's right  what kind learn from [student](student) here learn [look](search) ng middle ground between both both pretty much gave good answer gave
    - [student](student) really really good almost exactly where want still make couple improvements there close thank 
    - [student](student) that's right piece puzzle right that's what talking earlier mentioned microscope
    - [student](student) know what that's correct statement wrote down need microsoft skype [look](search) something that's really small when back [look](search) question
    - [student](student) look  answer [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) tanks
    - [student](student) that's very knowledgeable point
    - that's very critical [tool](tool) when learning together group that's awesome dead
    - [student](student) okay track [find](search) right answer going deeper
    - [student](student) right small [machine](tool) that's what using [discover](search) where water
    - okay  [student](student) think [scientist](role) used [microscope](tool) [look](search) very very closely
    - [student](student)  answer wrong totally right either
    - would almost there [student](student) would because question very specific meaning what piece [equipment](tool) said small machine
    - [student](student) examples [equipment](tool) just particular moment
    - [student](student) okay [nasa](space) good point question
    - [student](student) sort right send machine
    - [student](student) said [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) tanks
    - [student](student) really close sure
    - [student](student) obviously true statement right can't live without water
    - [student](student) well [microscope](tool) definitely [equipment](tool) used [space](space) like because
    - [student](student) okay getting there
    - okay great okay reread over [text](text) because  [student](student) really close answer
    - [student](student) well yeah that's what just there
    - [student](student) that's true couldn't crystals [investigate](search) without small [machine](tool) right
    - [student](student) tools used some observation some research
    - [student](student) maybe there's something back [text](text) could [find](search) some [more](expand) 's [information](text)  [information](text) work together come full [more](expand) complete answer
    - [student](student) okay that's that's part answer could [more](expand) [space](space) [more](expand) room
    - [student](student) okay good that's good start  answer
    - [student](student) good start
    - [student](student) well completely wrong
    - [student](student) okay yeah understand really close
    - [student](student) yeah [look](search) d really close [microscope](tool) weren't exactly wrong there just [more](expand) specific answer yeah good
    - [student](student) that's very interesting take actually first read through answering question thought same thing
    - [student](student) because would
    - [student](student) wrong okay just need [elaborate](expand) little [more](expand) okay
    - [student](student) right things question about what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) they're [moon](space) know they're using [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) stuff like what need [find](search) about [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) nasa sent small [machine](tool) didn't sent [astronaut](role) [space](space) make sense
    -  really like what said [nasa](space) send small [machine](tool) right direction want everybody [look](search) text
    - [student](student) polar [crater](space)  part answer right
    - [student](student)  piece
    - [student](student) yeah sound like agree [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) when they're [space](space) [moon](space) think what trying figure
    - [student](student) well  right need [microscope](tool) [look](search) water
    - [student](student)  answer necessarily wrong just little deeper make  answer [more](expand) detailed just little better what right what great start
    - [student](student) said [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) correct send  small [machine](tool) order [discover](search) water
    - [student](student) that's good need
    - [student](student) oxygen tank maybe used breathe
    - [student](student) okay find
    - [student](student) craters [water](space) moon
    - [student](student)  answer incredibly wrong headed right direction would definitely need [microscope](tool) because water
    - [student](student)  answer [scientist](role) [found](search) [crater](space) full [water](space) [moon](space) [article](text) [found](search) [crater](space) some [water](space) [moon](space) didn't full water
    - [student](student) mhmm good  answer just needed little [more](expand) whole small piece answer
    - because [student](student) just responded thinks knows just about everything about  want tell really enjoyed reading  answer because talked about [water](space) split said split into parts hydrogen [oxygen](space) correct
    - [student](student) okay yeah  right [scientist](role) would [oxygen](space) tank breathe space
    - [student](student) yeah maybe just little [more](expand) attention exact question correct  response just didn't specifically answer question
    - astronauts didn't [oxygen](space) oxygen [tanks](space) like [student](student) said
    - yeah okay [look](search) ng  responses will [student](student) probably closest getting correct answer  response
    - [student](student) sounds filming [crater](space) full [water](space) [moon](space) okay [find](search) [crater](space) water
    - [student](student) necessarily
    - right [student](student) [nasa](space) send small [machine](tool)  almost 100% right
    - [student](student) right okay good maybe [microscope](tool) isn't what used discover
    - because [look](search) listen [look](search)  answers [student](student) said [scientist](role) [found](search) [crater](space) full [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) that's entirely true [find](search) [water](space) some places
    - microscopes [discover](search) things just like guys said [tool](tool) help [discover](search) things
    - [student](student) what [tool](tool) [scientist](role) used microscope
    - [student](student) think both right fact [scientific](space) [tool](tool) just need clarify what tool
    - right small [machine](tool) great [student](student)
    - [student](student) moon isn't ready live  absolutely right
    - [student](student) tools [scientist](role) just make sure  reading question what specific [equipment](tool) used [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) okay
    - [student](student) okay would would correct there's definitely [oxygen](space) space
    - [student](student) well part part answer
    - [student](student) okay well  able [find](search) there used small [machine](tool) know very good able [discover](search) sort what answer
    - [student](student) know correct  able [find](search) where able [find](search) water
    - [student](student) well would definitely [equipment](tool) especially know breathe sort operate within [space](space) around [moon](space) moon good yeah yeah
    - [student](student) totally sure could like maybe entire [moon](space) being covered garden
    - [student](student) wrong answer could better ch [ice](space) going talk about [more](expand) about when talking just like brought [discover](search) before when [look](search) question [look](search) discover
    - [student](student) both right track here [equipment](tool) they're using [microscope](tool) water
    - [student](student) might made observation about [scientist](role) [find](search) ng [crater](space) which very good  noticing [crater](space) that's where water
    - [student](student) partially correct  right sense [nasa](space) send small machine
    - [student](student) correct [nasa](space) types [equipment](tool) boots special special [article](text) clothing some some things like [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) different things things might like when they're exploring [space](space) around [space](space) missions they're talking about [machine](tool) [find](search) about [find](search) about [deposit](space)
    - [student](student) yeah that's really good question [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) wouldn't need microscope
    - [student](student)  partially right when kind
    - [student](student) that's really interesting don't know that's truth mean don't know like that's like truthful like
    - talk about [student](student)  answer [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) true
    - [student](student) that's true tell read part [text](text) that's true  talking about [water](space) which questions asking talk about water
    - [student](student) right  definitely right
    -   on said need [scientific](space) [tool](tool) called [microscope](tool) [look](search) really closely [water](space) [moon](space) guys both right track guys really thinking like where  headed
    - [student](student) absolutely absolutely some great observations yeah absolutely would [equipment](tool) [nasa](space) would refer back question what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) scientific [tool](tool) think right track
    - perfect [student](student) absolutely right track
    - [student](student) absolutely  absolutely right [equipment](tool) huge what
    - think guys great right track
    - [student](student) absolutely fact true focus what question actually asking
    - [student](student) yeah said would [look](search) closely [discover](search) d [found](search) there [water](space) there
    - [student](student) microscope
    - [student](student) correct [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) tanks
    - [student](student) think answers getting right track
    - [student](student) getting right answer
    - [student](student) know what mean [microscope](tool) [look](search) closely water
    - [student](student) equipment while [moon](space) stuff like
    - well that's very good [microscope](tool) would part answer [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) would also part answer right [student](student)
    - okay [student](student) [look](search)  answer said [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) oxygen [tanks](space) very true know when [space](space) need [oxygen](space) able breathe
    - [student](student) scientists need other other [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) when into [space](space) help
    - [student](student) small actually smaller small microscopic really [word](text) means very very small small enough where can't actually without special tool
    - [student](student) that's great question  partially right entirely there  very right when actually [microscope](tool) [water](space) absolutely
    - [student](student) that's absolutely right only halfway right know foot door rest
    - [student](student) halfway
    -  [student](student) absolutely [microscope](tool) actually water
    - [student](student) sure absolutely some [equipment](tool) [moon](space) can't imagine just know stroll [moon](space) absolutely [equipment](tool) there  wrong regard
    - [student](student) essence yeah should probably [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) when [space](space) need breathe right
    - [student](student)  right whenever into [space](space) there's [equipment](tool) into [space](space) [moon](space) land moon
    - [student](student) absolutely  initial answer correct need [water](space) able drink able survive
    - what miss  just read what's advantages told makes think there might full [water](space) what guys think
    - [student](student) oxygen [tanks](space) [find](search) [water](space) know exactly purpose [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) designed
    - [student](student) right even though wasn't even though didn't [oxygen](space) takes help mission [find](search) samples
    - [student](student) okay [look](search) ng wouldn't need [space](space) exploration
    - [student](student) tools like
    - [student](student) well right thing then [find](search) other [tool](tool) [scientist](role) used almost right just [more](expand) tool
    - [student](student) helped saying there matter [microscope](tool) still trying figure what other [tool](tool) even audio
    - [student](student) microscope wrong we've answered part question want says what other what [tool](tool) [found](search) [tool](tool) want [find](search) other [tool](tool) [microscope](tool) correct want [find](search) other [tool](tool) also story even said
    - [student](student) items needed [find](search) [water](space) [moon](space) [find](search) other item needed moon
    - [student](student) think helped each other come conclusion bunch answers might thought after read first time [ice](space) talk other people ideas right
    - [student](student) okay  answer wasn't completely wrong mention [nasa](space) send small machine
    - [student](student) would love actual   answer completely wrong
    - [student](student) yeah pretty good response because [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) definitely small [machine](tool) what sent moon
    - [student](student) really awesome response because definitely true [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) tanks
    - [student](student) yeah definitely like used [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) equipment
    - [student](student) okay really good thing bring on appreciate  response isn't wrong just focus different [section](text) [text](text) kind focused [microscope](tool) very right
    - [student](student) that's great that's great answer small [machine](tool) that's what [microscope](tool) real [word](text) want [find](search) here last paragraph
    - [student](student) would wouldn't thing [found](search) water
    - [student](student) okay well after asked question  answer maybe didn't include what question [look](search) ng
    -  [student](student) also [found](search) different [paragraph](text) there multiple answers
    - yeah there's multiple pieces [equipment](tool) that's guys answering
    - [student](student) lunar [orbiter](space) another [equipment](tool) then fellow classmate also mentioned [sentences](text) shall getting sort said [microscope](tool) yeah
    - [student](student) just maybe [add](expand) ng couple [more](expand) [equipment](tool) sentence help just bulk give [more](expand) understanding follow reader reading sentence
    - correct [student](student) answer exactly [look](search) ng
    - [student](student) true fully insured
    - [student](student) moon equipment
    - said everyone else  answer correct exactly answer [look](search) ng
    - [student](student) know  background knowledge correct he's answer would where answer
    - [student](student) because  intro wasn't exactly what [look](search) ng
    - wide range could multiple answers like  said [machine](tool) there well couldn't [find](search) [water](space) didn't there right [machine](tool) [microscope](tool) excuse [student](student)
    - alright [student](student) saying there's multiple [tool](tool) used [find](search) [water](space) because there order [find](search) [water](space) right that's really good answer
    - [student](student) started  response really well
    - [student](student) said [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool)  correct [nasa](space) mentioned part
    - [student](student)  answer okay  wrong  just fully there okay
    - [student](student)   answer [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool)  right about like small [machine](tool) piece equipment
    - [student](student) there some [more](expand) [evidence](search) used also said can't survive without water
    - [student](student) which right know that's known fact
    - [student](student) didn't answer question
    - [student](student) doesn't really explain [water](space) being [moon](space) would valuable
    - [student](student) well wrong sense going moment
    - [student](student) that's good point focusing [equipment](tool) used [find](search) water
    - [student](student) what wear
    - [student](student)  right path just need [more](expand) makes sense
    -  part [student](student) other part need together
    - [student](student) right track mention microscope
    - [student](student) yeah [microscope](tool) part
    - [student](student) yeah just getting closer closer answer
    - [student](student) answers little just -they're right direction they're exactly meeting expectations
    - [student](student) yeah what's   response i'll read [nasa](space) send small [machine](tool) which true [nasa](space) send small machine
    - [student](student)  right need [scientific](space) [tool](tool) called [microscope](tool) that's right  right also need
    - right [student](student) talked about need [scientific](space) [tool](tool) called [microscope](tool) [look](search) really closely that's great sentence great start
    - [student](student) very true [equipment](tool) many times many different things actually what used [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) answer question because often chicks definitely
    - [student](student) just think could little [more](expand) room improvement
    - well [student](student) background knowledge  science [equipment](tool) think what question asking doesn't mean necessarily background knowledge [more](expand) [look](search) [evidence](search) from text
    - [student](student) question didn't necessarily background knowledge what said probably would used potentially [find](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) question [look](search) [text](text) [evidence](search) don't think [text](text) talks about [oxygen](space) tanks
    - [student](student)  answer wasn't wrong think really great start response there said [nasa](space) uses small [machine](tool) sent small [machine](tool) that's true that's correct
    - [student](student) there both right because [text](text) actually talks about both things used [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - need just like telling [student](student) well  right about
    - [student](student) also sometimes might answer  answer wrong answering question asked want also [look](search) question because sometimes might [find](search) something that's [text](text) might very true nothing question asked
    - [student](student) yeah other [tool](tool) [scientist](role)
    - next time good okay chose same answer shows guys highlighting right answers passage
    - [student](student)  absolutely right [found](search) [water](space) [moon](space) that's what [passage](text) told
    - [student](student)  absolutely right while  answer right [scientist](role) [oxygen](space) tank sometimes when talking about [water](space) being [found](search) moon
    - [student](student) don't think answers specific question understand
    - [student](student) exactly there's possibility [lunar](space) there's [microscope](tool) [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) helps [look](search) ashes moon
    - [student](student) part
    - [student](student)  answer great start okay
    - [student](student) yeah really really important
    - [student](student) just because didn't talk about reading doesn't mean important
    - [student](student) weren't wrong just think could build upon  answer [more](expand) make even stronger
    - don't think  answer like saying  answers necessarily wrong  sitting group think  answers work could some improvement
    - give same note gave [student](student) although answer correct think could build deeper meaning build build upon  answer elop even [more](expand) make even stronger already
    - [student](student)  answer correct just when [look](search) ng answers know there [more](expand) parts answer make stronger answer doesn't doesn't mean right wrong just stronger
    - [student](student) part what think  answer although stated used microscope
    - [student](student)  answer although come straight from [article](text) reading
    - [student](student) well there couple answers
    - then [student](student) going [look](search)  answer really great think really understood [text](text) sure quite understood question asking
    - tell what [equipment](tool)  [student](student)  completely wrong [microscope](tool) piece [equipment](tool) that's full answer
    - right then [student](student) also know [microscope](tool) well once [discover](search) d [water](space) remember reading
    - [student](student) that's good thought through wasn't answer just wasn't correct question
    - [student](student)  answer correct
    - [student](student) right might used different [equipment](tool) [moon](space) survive [moon](space) field walk around breathe  right
    - [student](student) spaceship there talking specifically about [discover](search) [water](space) just like says from reading
    - want take [look](search) even closer [student](student) there's another [scientific](space) [equipment](tool) used specifically [find](search) [water](space) because [microscope](tool) going help maybe [look](search) [water](space) closer [look](search) other things maybe just magnified didn't specifically [find](search) water
    - equipment [look](search) ng [equipment](tool) into creators wouldn't exactly [microscope](tool) into [crater](space) [find](search) [student](student) just something  like
    - [student](student) what just only thing  answer great because right from [text](text) saying [water](space) there important
    - [student](student) some [equipment](tool) [moon](space) focus other what [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) find anything specifically related think  really good path quite there
    - [student](student) part part answer
    - [student](student) okay there another [tool](tool) there
    - [student](student) totally totally completely understand love answered question because  question
    - [student](student)  question wrong  question right  question spectacular plus going  question right
    - [student](student) that's like okay know want  question  answer spectacular
    - [student](student) microscope [tool](tool) think there's [more](expand) more important piece equipment
    - thank answer [student](student) used [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) [discover](search) [water](space) then used [microscope](tool) order able closer since small
    - [student](student) teacher almost there nice
    - [student](student)  answer wasn't totally wasn't completely incorrect
    - missing step number [student](student) great explaining step number great explaining step number need together
    - [student](student) right sure that's absolutely right into [space](space) need tons [equipment](tool) don't down here right
    - need there's parts answer need combine what  answer what [student](student) said answer there's parts
    - that's great start [student](student)
    - [student](student) right probably would need [microscope](tool) anything that's tiny can't  naked
    - [student](student)  right wouldn't need [microscope](tool) order [look](search) [water](space) order [find](search) water
    - [student](student) don't think would [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) think would helpful don't think exactly what [scientist](role) used [discover](search) water
    - [student](student) investigate little [more](expand) into [text](text) might there something used before microscope
    - [student](student) yeah  exactly right [water](space) water grow things sure would work moon
    - [student](student) don't think could don't think could grow plants [water](space) other uses moon
    - [student](student) yeah think  right think might take [scientist](role) long time [water](space) doesn't mean less valuable because think there lots different
    - [student](student) true [water](space) [moon](space) microscopic first first step reviewing question
    - [student](student) about [water](space) know asked what [discover](search) [water](space) true [water](space) small need [microscope](tool) that's what's really being asked
    - equipment gone [moon](space) process that's exact [equipment](tool) used [discover](search) [water](space) [student](student)
    - [student](student) that's quite really answering question like
    - [student](student) getting closer answer sent small machine
    - [student](student) microscope part [equipment](tool) used [discover](search) [water](space) right  right there there part equipment
    - [student](student)  right [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) [equipment](tool) sometimes need [moon](space) that's when
    - [student](student) when need [astronaut](role) need human beings because human beings human beings needs [oxygen](space) over there
    - [student](student)  answer isn't wrong because answers question want there's maybe better answer sometimes there's answers them's little [more](expand) specific
    - [student](student) actually like moment that's exactly what object called
    - [student](student) said [nasa](space) sense small [machine](tool) okay know  actually correct
    - [student](student) that's great place start thank
    - [student](student) even though like  answer think even better answering question
    - [student](student) think included [microscope](tool)   answer [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) would like best answer ever
    - [student](student) important both things want microscope
    - [student](student) right track [find](search) ng right answer
    - [student](student) well  answer actually wrong just half piece  [more](expand) smaller picture
    - exactly right know what onto something  [microscope](tool) response because really essential part analyzing dirt [moon](space) however [microscope](tool) dirt analyze [student](student) what's
    - [student](student) unfortunately don't think [oxygen](space) tank time
    -  right [student](student) when said need [find](search) would need [microscope](tool) because [water](space) microscopic probably [microscope](tool) that's necessarily what using [find](search) [discover](search) [water](space) right
    - yeah exactly okay what hearing from guys different [tool](tool) really important
    - what really want focus right what's important [water](space) right because true like said when [student](student) need [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) right need breathe
    - would kind pair little [more](expand) [student](student) saying  right track
    - [student](student) find [paragraph](text) tech [scientist](role) like sentence where corresponds because answer [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) didn't from [paragraph](text)  [find](search) paragraph
    - pieces [equipment](tool) right [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) [student](student) talked about response [microscope](tool) talked about  response
    - talked about [microscope](tool) didn't talk about [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) [student](student) talked about [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) [microscope](tool) used pieces [equipment](tool) because takes things [find](search) [water](space) [moon](space) [discover](search)
    - question [equipment](tool) just talked about [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) [microscope](tool)   [student](student) talked about [discover](search) water
    - [student](student) okay [scientist](role) better
    - [student](student) yeah that's part there's also right small [machine](tool) thinking about right right
    - [student](student) know think  think  right track there [look](search) [article](text) article
    - [student](student) think  right track
    - [student](student) okay possible pieces [equipment](tool) thank sharing  thinking
    - [student](student) yeah that's really great point each what noticing like spoken about piece [equipment](tool) maybe other
    - [student](student) think about could know circle both civic [equipment](tool) only also think about what each piece equipment
    - [student](student) think great response know could even step
    - [student](student) okay okay well that's good there's [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) [discover](search) [water](space) they're going need [more](expand) [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) right probably going need more
    - [student](student) okay great that's almost there think circled whole sentence [investigate](search) [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) then together savannas answer
    - awesome awesome okay  [student](student) will pair [find](search) answer question thank folks
    - [student](student) board
    - [student](student) someone else build samantha's answer someone else talk about
    - microscope would allow [discover](search) [water](space) then first part question right [equipment](tool) someone think about connects [discover](search) ng [water](space) ark [student](student)
    - [student](student) awesome [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) someone else answer allow [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) moon

    -   answer [nasa](space) send small [machine](tool) [student](student) think [machine](tool) [look](search) because couldn't eyes
    - anyone know
    - anyone agree disagree [student](student)
    - believe don't need help well going work through together we'll actually what learn along anyone else questions before begin
    - entirely there just [student](student) what
    - well absolutely right track [student](student) what
    - okay think right what discuss  neighbor even group kind talk about where guys  answers from what  like know [more](expand) about
    - okay well what  [student](student) thought well
    - okay that's really good thought  want hear from  classmates then going come back together what everyone thinks about  terms okay [student](student) would like next
    - hear from  what we'll come together group response okay
    - want guys break into small groups    then maybe   guys will work together just little questions while  discussing what want guys focus
    - sure well know couple guys  hand raised  would like share   reconstructed maybe will help  [word](text) since guys similar answers
    - split [water](space) into elements like said [student](student) said [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) come what [astronaut](role) could [water](space) main
    - using what   talk [student](student) good  response  just wanted work together help [astronaut](role)
    - [student](student) think takes someone find
    - guys guys close  history [student](student) death
    - what other kinds [equipment](tool) would guys would need [find](search) [water](space) [moon](space) other microscope
    - anybody ideas [student](student)
    - right anybody else anything else [text](text) might [microscope](tool) [student](student)
    - know [student](student) remember what [tool](tool) [scientist](role) used
    - there somebody [student](student) would like help
    - alright [student](student) tell other item needed
    - okay continue [look](search) maybe [student](student) help
    - [student](student) want help
    - anybody know what either hydrogen [oxygen](space) within water
    - really good answer well brought guys together because guys varying answers hoping when guys hear  responses like  classmates responses
    - ideas well because even smartest people world work other people make things better because collaborate then guys learn same time
    - [student](student) maybe from listening  classmates might [text](text) things learn from what really happening along what [found](search) prior knowledge okay then listen classmates right
    - maybe keep listening heard from  might hear from on [student](student)
    - [student](student) okay well that's great don't asked about cars we'll come back there's anything [more](expand) afterwards okay
    - [student](student) there anything  like we've [look](search) d through [text](text) want review there's anything else
    -  we've heard everyone else's responses anything reflect about what  heard [equipment](tool) used [find](search) [water](space) moon

    - sounds very good would anyone like open what thought response first discussion question
    - [student](student) anything would like share
    - what called guys     guys other [information](text) about [lunar](space) orbiter
    - [student](student) what small [machine](tool) called
    - [student](student) well then ahead
    - [student](student) even ahead start
    - someone else talk second anyone hand raised
    - [student](student) what know about [equipment](tool) used space
    - what thinking [student](student) haven't heard much from
    - [student](student) what thinking
    - [student](student) what thinking number
    - actually anyone want start share opinion allowed
    - glad haven't figured  remind [student](student)  answer
    - [student](student) share  answer
    - alright [student](student) [find](search) where
    - [student](student) found [oxygen](space) tank
    - [student](student) question
    - [student](student) finished
    - more seconds 987654321 right actually start [student](student) we'll move around circle  what [word](text) circle 
    - [student](student) what circle
    - what [student](student)
    - [student](student) what
    - [student](student) what
    - what  [student](student) tell about [microscope](tool) there
    - anybody want to--
    - [student](student) that's that's totally correct think we'd agree [microscope](tool) would [look](search) [water](space) really closely although think about what happens before point right
    - [student](student) know exactly [equipment](tool) used [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) right think each like piece then just just needed microscope
    - [student](student) like couple people just circle [microscope](tool) that's great example there multiple [tool](tool) like just pointed come from things
    - [student](student) need [microscope](tool) [look](search) really closely things what [scientist](role) used [find](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) semi right could went into [more](expand) detail small [machine](tool) small [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) orbiter
    - [student](student) very close
    - [student](student) exactly like  thinking what keeps [water](space) together passage
    - [student](student) partially correct need [microscope](tool) however that's didn't just send [microscope](tool) moon
    - [student](student) well partially correct [equipment](tool) sent [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) able across ground surface [moon](space) surface check [deposit](space)
    - [student](student) then once figured there
    - [student](student) deposits very small [water](space) then [microscope](tool) make sure what thought there okay [microscope](tool) actually gave evidence
    - [student](student) there [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) then [tool](tool) used microscope
    - [student](student) completely wrong will send small [machine](tool) really doesn't
    - [student](student) that's said   right track
    - [student](student) okay said  meet [scientific](space) [tool](tool) called [microscope](tool) [look](search) really closely right [microscope](tool) piece equipment
    - yeah sure okay [student](student) also right [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) tanks
    - valuable okay agree valuable [word](text) that's right going [look](search) [more](expand) thing [more](expand) other [word](text) question [student](student) could tell what [word](text) another [word](text) circled
    - [student](student) [scientist](role) [found](search) [crater](space) full [water](space) [moon](space) absolutely true that's absolutely something reading
    - [student](student) okay there's pieces [equipment](tool) actually [look](search) ng here
    - [student](student) kind version other slits think about
    - [student](student) wouldn't needed pieces [equipment](tool) actually figure there [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) equipment [microscope](tool) piece [scientific](space) [equipment](tool) correct
    - [student](student) yeah that's right
    - [student](student) awesome okay yeah would used [equipment](tool) would [oxygen](space) they're [moon](space) [astronaut](role) [moon](space) right
    - [student](student) well enough that's right [astronaut](role) correct
    - [student](student) well okay pieces [equipment](tool) correct
    - okay read  answers think very good points everyone think little [more](expand) about what question about example question what question
    - [student](student) says [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) right enough question sent small [machine](tool) [look](search) better [word](text) answer question
    - [student](student) okay said [nasa](space) send small [machine](tool) right think read little
    - [student](student) think even better think that's great response think make amazing response question asking what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - that's right  what kind learn from [student](student) here learn [look](search) ng middle ground between both both pretty much gave good answer gave
    - [student](student) really really good almost exactly where want still make couple improvements there close thank 
    - [student](student) that's right piece puzzle right that's what talking earlier mentioned microscope
    - [student](student) know what that's correct statement wrote down need microsoft skype [look](search) something that's really small when back [look](search) question
    - [student](student) look  answer [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) tanks
    - [student](student) that's very knowledgeable point
    - that's very critical [tool](tool) when learning together group that's awesome dead
    - [student](student) okay track [find](search) right answer going deeper
    - [student](student) right small [machine](tool) that's what using [discover](search) where water
    - okay  [student](student) think [scientist](role) used [microscope](tool) [look](search) very very closely
    - [student](student)  answer wrong totally right either
    - would almost there [student](student) would because question very specific meaning what piece [equipment](tool) said small machine
    - [student](student) examples [equipment](tool) just particular moment
    - [student](student) okay [nasa](space) good point question
    - [student](student) sort right send machine
    - [student](student) said [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) tanks
    - [student](student) really close sure
    - [student](student) obviously true statement right can't live without water
    - [student](student) well [microscope](tool) definitely [equipment](tool) used [space](space) like because
    - [student](student) okay getting there
    - okay great okay reread over [text](text) because  [student](student) really close answer
    - [student](student) well yeah that's what just there
    - [student](student) that's true couldn't crystals [investigate](search) without small [machine](tool) right
    - [student](student) tools used some observation some research
    - [student](student) maybe there's something back [text](text) could [find](search) some [more](expand) 's [information](text)  [information](text) work together come full [more](expand) complete answer
    - [student](student) okay that's that's part answer could [more](expand) [space](space) [more](expand) room
    - [student](student) okay good that's good start  answer
    - [student](student) good start
    - [student](student) well completely wrong
    - [student](student) okay yeah understand really close
    - [student](student) yeah [look](search) d really close [microscope](tool) weren't exactly wrong there just [more](expand) specific answer yeah good
    - [student](student) that's very interesting take actually first read through answering question thought same thing
    - [student](student) because would
    - [student](student) wrong okay just need [elaborate](expand) little [more](expand) okay
    - [student](student) right things question about what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) they're [moon](space) know they're using [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) stuff like what need [find](search) about [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) nasa sent small [machine](tool) didn't sent [astronaut](role) [space](space) make sense
    -  really like what said [nasa](space) send small [machine](tool) right direction want everybody [look](search) text
    - [student](student) polar [crater](space)  part answer right
    - [student](student)  piece
    - [student](student) yeah sound like agree [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) when they're [space](space) [moon](space) think what trying figure
    - [student](student) well  right need [microscope](tool) [look](search) water
    - [student](student)  answer necessarily wrong just little deeper make  answer [more](expand) detailed just little better what right what great start
    - [student](student) said [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) correct send  small [machine](tool) order [discover](search) water
    - [student](student) that's good need
    - [student](student) oxygen tank maybe used breathe
    - [student](student) okay find
    - [student](student) craters [water](space) moon
    - [student](student)  answer incredibly wrong headed right direction would definitely need [microscope](tool) because water
    - [student](student)  answer [scientist](role) [found](search) [crater](space) full [water](space) [moon](space) [article](text) [found](search) [crater](space) some [water](space) [moon](space) didn't full water
    - [student](student) mhmm good  answer just needed little [more](expand) whole small piece answer
    - because [student](student) just responded thinks knows just about everything about  want tell really enjoyed reading  answer because talked about [water](space) split said split into parts hydrogen [oxygen](space) correct
    - [student](student) okay yeah  right [scientist](role) would [oxygen](space) tank breathe space
    - [student](student) yeah maybe just little [more](expand) attention exact question correct  response just didn't specifically answer question
    - astronauts didn't [oxygen](space) oxygen [tanks](space) like [student](student) said
    - yeah okay [look](search) ng  responses will [student](student) probably closest getting correct answer  response
    - [student](student) sounds filming [crater](space) full [water](space) [moon](space) okay [find](search) [crater](space) water
    - [student](student) necessarily
    - right [student](student) [nasa](space) send small [machine](tool)  almost 100% right
    - [student](student) right okay good maybe [microscope](tool) isn't what used discover
    - because [look](search) listen [look](search)  answers [student](student) said [scientist](role) [found](search) [crater](space) full [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) that's entirely true [find](search) [water](space) some places
    - microscopes [discover](search) things just like guys said [tool](tool) help [discover](search) things
    - [student](student) what [tool](tool) [scientist](role) used microscope
    - [student](student) think both right fact [scientific](space) [tool](tool) just need clarify what tool
    - right small [machine](tool) great [student](student)
    - [student](student) moon isn't ready live  absolutely right
    - [student](student) tools [scientist](role) just make sure  reading question what specific [equipment](tool) used [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) okay
    - [student](student) okay would would correct there's definitely [oxygen](space) space
    - [student](student) well part part answer
    - [student](student) okay well  able [find](search) there used small [machine](tool) know very good able [discover](search) sort what answer
    - [student](student) know correct  able [find](search) where able [find](search) water
    - [student](student) well would definitely [equipment](tool) especially know breathe sort operate within [space](space) around [moon](space) moon good yeah yeah
    - [student](student) totally sure could like maybe entire [moon](space) being covered garden
    - [student](student) wrong answer could better ch [ice](space) going talk about [more](expand) about when talking just like brought [discover](search) before when [look](search) question [look](search) discover
    - [student](student) both right track here [equipment](tool) they're using [microscope](tool) water
    - [student](student) might made observation about [scientist](role) [find](search) ng [crater](space) which very good  noticing [crater](space) that's where water
    - [student](student) partially correct  right sense [nasa](space) send small machine
    - [student](student) correct [nasa](space) types [equipment](tool) boots special special [article](text) clothing some some things like [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) different things things might like when they're exploring [space](space) around [space](space) missions they're talking about [machine](tool) [find](search) about [find](search) about [deposit](space)
    - [student](student) yeah that's really good question [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) wouldn't need microscope
    - [student](student)  partially right when kind
    - [student](student) that's really interesting don't know that's truth mean don't know like that's like truthful like
    - talk about [student](student)  answer [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) true
    - [student](student) that's true tell read part [text](text) that's true  talking about [water](space) which questions asking talk about water
    - [student](student) right  definitely right
    -   on said need [scientific](space) [tool](tool) called [microscope](tool) [look](search) really closely [water](space) [moon](space) guys both right track guys really thinking like where  headed
    - [student](student) absolutely absolutely some great observations yeah absolutely would [equipment](tool) [nasa](space) would refer back question what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) scientific [tool](tool) think right track
    - perfect [student](student) absolutely right track
    - [student](student) absolutely  absolutely right [equipment](tool) huge what
    - think guys great right track
    - [student](student) absolutely fact true focus what question actually asking
    - [student](student) yeah said would [look](search) closely [discover](search) d [found](search) there [water](space) there
    - [student](student) microscope
    - [student](student) correct [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) tanks
    - [student](student) think answers getting right track
    - [student](student) getting right answer
    - [student](student) know what mean [microscope](tool) [look](search) closely water
    - [student](student) equipment while [moon](space) stuff like
    - well that's very good [microscope](tool) would part answer [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) would also part answer right [student](student)
    - okay [student](student) [look](search)  answer said [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) oxygen [tanks](space) very true know when [space](space) need [oxygen](space) able breathe
    - [student](student) scientists need other other [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) when into [space](space) help
    - [student](student) small actually smaller small microscopic really [word](text) means very very small small enough where can't actually without special tool
    - [student](student) that's great question  partially right entirely there  very right when actually [microscope](tool) [water](space) absolutely
    - [student](student) that's absolutely right only halfway right know foot door rest
    - [student](student) halfway
    -  [student](student) absolutely [microscope](tool) actually water
    - [student](student) sure absolutely some [equipment](tool) [moon](space) can't imagine just know stroll [moon](space) absolutely [equipment](tool) there  wrong regard
    - [student](student) essence yeah should probably [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) when [space](space) need breathe right
    - [student](student)  right whenever into [space](space) there's [equipment](tool) into [space](space) [moon](space) land moon
    - [student](student) absolutely  initial answer correct need [water](space) able drink able survive
    - what miss  just read what's advantages told makes think there might full [water](space) what guys think
    - [student](student) oxygen [tanks](space) [find](search) [water](space) know exactly purpose [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) designed
    - [student](student) right even though wasn't even though didn't [oxygen](space) takes help mission [find](search) samples
    - [student](student) okay [look](search) ng wouldn't need [space](space) exploration
    - [student](student) tools like
    - [student](student) well right thing then [find](search) other [tool](tool) [scientist](role) used almost right just [more](expand) tool
    - [student](student) helped saying there matter [microscope](tool) still trying figure what other [tool](tool) even audio
    - [student](student) microscope wrong we've answered part question want says what other what [tool](tool) [found](search) [tool](tool) want [find](search) other [tool](tool) [microscope](tool) correct want [find](search) other [tool](tool) also story even said
    - [student](student) items needed [find](search) [water](space) [moon](space) [find](search) other item needed moon

    - rest talk [student](student) about because he's trying [find](search) which [discover](search) [microscope](tool) [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) think answer talk  help [discover](search) which
    - good  what [student](student) about water
    - then [student](student) would valuable [water](space) [space](space) don't from [earth](space) moon
    - [student](student) want answer 's question
    - [student](student) okay well  other classmates
    - break into groups   will group then   [student](student)
    - [student](student) take about seconds each person going share
    - group members while first person sharing
    - just listening going start [student](student) will first person share
    - debbie will second  you'll third  forth then  last each person  going about seconds share  answer  will first then [student](student) i'll tell when when start

    - [student](student) talk rest classmates what thought then maybe
    - okay [student](student) agree also something else
    - right anybody anything else thanks important everybody else agree convincing [evidence](search) valuable role very important [word](text)
    - want guys turn talk share pair about seconds [look](search) through there [find](search) some places show through [text](text) [water](space) valuable resource
    - just [paragraph](text) four five okay on  guys  work together  [student](student) work together
    - anybody answer
    - about  [student](student) show another [water](space) could useful tell [paragraph](text)  start read sentence comes from well okay
    - very good that's claim [student](student) said right 
    - well  question  mentioned [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) what kind [machine](tool) [nasa](space) send maybe help [student](student)
    - okay [student](student) know about [space](space) tell what [lunar](space) orbiter
    - that's great guys think [microscope](tool) [find](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) what [scientist](role) fine
    - okay yeah what small [machine](tool) [student](student) [look](search) [paragraph](text) tell what small machine
    - okay [student](student) help tell what [lunar](space) orbiter
    - guys come name want call collective don't like boys girls don't like guys school mascot want eyes eagles ketchup packets what call group
    - [student](student) awesome told about kind thing
    - [student](student) okay when [deposit](space) something much what [deposit](space) deposit really large piece something smaller pieces
    - [student](student) well when think paycheck every week would smaller amount what would make entire month make sense
    - [student](student) yeah seen frost wintertime fall
    - [student](student) seen  mom's windows grass
    - [student](student) what what when he's [investigating](search) crimes just leave unsolved
    - [student](student) could tell some [equipment](tool) took there used general while space
    - [student](student) ever seen something through microscope
    - [student](student) what thing
    - [student](student) that's really good well sounds exciting enjoy  self nasa
    - good [information](text) anybody else anything about input what think about space
    - [student](student) would-- think would need [oxygen](space) tanks
    - about  tell something know about [space](space) also what  [student](student) telling
    - good point because atmosphere which breathe which [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) talking about going into [space](space) messed then won't here [earth](space) would [look](search) some other place possibly live about [student](student) anything input
    - well that's people aren't into [space](space) some people [more](expand) into environment like  talking about some people into oceans stuff which very interesting learn about about  input group
    - [student](student) what would consider fiction nonfiction story
    - [student](student) laughs
    - [student](student) didn't phones back then cell phones like didn't anything like wind wall
    - [student](student) gasps
    - [student](student) there cartoons [book](text) about phones
    - [student](student) people thought just going be-- science fiction realistic today
    - [student](student) right right used science fiction would able into [space](space) which what we've studying about [space](space) going [moon](space) being able different explorations like seen latest results stuff from titan [moon](space) saturn
    - [student](student) saturn [moon](space) floating around there's actually [moon](space) that's called titan think [found](search) life
    - [student](student) gasps
    - [student](student) well they're microscopic aliens live very very cold because really really cold [moon](space) moon like below zero really cold there think [equipment](tool) like what [moon](space) was-- used [find](search) [water](space) [moon](space) think [found](search) some lifeforms existed titan
    - [student](student) that's pretty good stuff what think about audio know there outer [space](space) stuff
    - [student](student) we'll into [more](expand) study about outer [space](space) different [equipment](tool) they're using rockets satellites stuff they're using there
    - anything else interest [student](student) about aliens [moon](space) saturn
    - [student](student)  answer wasn't wrong talking about atmosphere which something exploring [space](space) [find](search) different atmospheres would hold life from [earth](space) which very good said
    - [student](student) would make what would need order able really good garden moon
    - [student](student) would bring artificial greenhouse something like possibly maybe
    - everybody like reading
    - [student](student) like martian
    - [student](student) yeah good movie
    - [student](student) where [find](search) water
    - [student](student) polar [crater](space) what mean around [earth](space) bottom
    - [student](student) well science videos family love watch science videos documentaries great places learn
    - [student](student) great place learn [more](expand) about what talking about
    - [student](student) kind think about like refrigerator
    - [student](student) somebody asked what keeps  food cold would like refrigerator wouldn't plug plugs into outlet supplies power
    - [student](student) well fact when first grade wanted [astronaut](role) obviously didn't live know goal
    - [student](student) texas florida john kennedy center or--
    - [student](student) think that's named after president kennedy
    - while  [look](search) ng back [student](student) because pretty excited [astronaut](role)
    - [student](student) mean know everything about what [scientist](role) using [space](space) [oxygen](space) tank work
    - anyone ever [microscope](tool) before
    - [student](student) what some thoughts  [text](text) prior answering questions
    - [student](student) next time invite
    - [student](student) convince people  best minecraft what
    - [student](student) well actually show beating game right  using actions instead [word](text) convince
    - [student](student) know name facility  works
    - [student](student) well that's that's unfortunate able speak regular basis perhaps some online activity hearing stories
    - [student](student) right because [look](search) ng what [equipment](tool) just like today sitting front okay  sitting there school
    - scientist [astronaut](role) there's some things know right every  student school right what's [equipment](tool) right thats helping  work [student](student)
    - [student](student) glad brought about [nasa](space) because know what today when learning  tablets
    - [student](student) pencil front things changing just like when research
    - [student](student) enjoy reading passage
    - [student](student) want each little piece paper don't want write down what know about [space](space) okay
    - alright over want share partner first group going    three work together   work share what know about [space](space) okay each other quietly okay y'all turn each other show each other what know about space
    - [student](student) okay what's something today  ever used want [look](search) something very close really small what's something could
    - [student](student) yeah like magnifying glass many ever seen microscope
    - right [student](student) where microscope
    - already know about [space](space) good what want tell about [space](space) [student](student)
    - [student](student) correct went [nasa](space) well when younger different times kinds really cool equipment
    - [student](student) great time there well
    - [student](student) question asked about [equipment](tool) [article](text) talking about [moon](space) like desert anything about [moon](space) being like desert when 
    - well that's great seems like learned something today anyone else know [moon](space) like desert
    - [student](student) isn't tell what know about space
    - [student](student) there's interesting stuff like gravity others
    - [student](student) like don't know necessarily possible read that's super cool where read
    - [student](student) possibly mean point time year anything could happen honestly wouldn't surprised next year something crazy everything happening
    - [student](student) tool give some examples [tool](tool) debbie  hand raised give example tool
    - yeah absolutely that's absolutely right there anybody else wanted share tool
    - [student](student) wouldn't stranded right think about like station drive very need fill station station what allow fill  halfway through trip
    - [student](student) won't like  going beach halfway there's station turn back around right
    - [student](student) we'll just [more](expand) keep going
    - [student](student) know least growing always most confident when came answering questions even knew know knew answer easy plus four maybe actually wouldn't
    - [student](student) answer fear ridicule from friends even teacher
    - [student](student) like
    - [student](student) look something that's smaller because didn't eyes
    - [student](student) like organisms
    - [student](student) knows what periodic element oxygen
    - [student](student) periodic element table there owed stands [oxygen](space) [water](space) on
    - [student](student) okay where left talking about elements [water](space) element periodic table
    - [student](student) know anywhere else might microscope
    - what [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) usually designed anybody know
    - [student](student) know what [oxygen](space) [suits](space)  classmates might
    - that's really cool fact [student](student) where read
    - [student](student) okay what about [equipment](tool) that's talked about text
    - [student](student) moon
    - [student](student) awesome well since  gone there could think like things there
    - [student](student) yeah think something eggs something military both might something like that's really cool that's really cool yeah
    - everybody here knowledge [space](space) just couple
    - there an [more](expand) knowledge guys [student](student)
    - [student](student) went [nasa](space) really
    - yeah anyone else seen anything from [nasa](space) reach
    - [student](student) well yeah yeah
    - would anyone ever want space
    - [student](student) experience
    - [student](student) what about would want would
    - [student](student) water hiding [crater](space)
    - [student](student) maybe maybe we'll read about next time
    - [student](student) like read
    - that's love answer like garden  self [student](student)
    - [student](student) know about [space](space) really where learn about [space](space) from [book](text) museum
    - [student](student) person passionate about [space](space) want [astronaut](role) when  older
    - good afternoon everyone everyone please raise  hand
    - thank  would anybody else like tell about before move forward [student](student)
    - that's pretty amazing [student](student) wonder  ever seen [lunar](space) escape [lunar](space) orbiter
    - [student](student) okay well maybe don't know tell what what know about space
    - [student](student) would love wonder hope they're selling tickets soon [moon](space) base
    - [student](student) ahead like shirt same shirt actually that's really cool shirt
    - [student](student) agree think [moon](space) something away hear certain things about pictures know round objects [crater](space)
    - [student](student) never think about would actually exist there walk around [moon](space) agree think that's really cool thing
    - surprised [student](student) [scientist](role) [found](search) [water](space) moon
    - about [student](student) surprised
    - [student](student) yeah either think that's what [scientist](role) thought
    - about [student](student) surprised
    - [student](student) yeah [article](text) made think about something that's that's really good reason reading current news
    - about [student](student)
    - [student](student) yeah thought great really liked [space](space) like seeing [moon](space) there night fact there's [water](space) really intriguing
    - know there's there [information](text) [article](text) wasn't there [student](student) someone who's experienced about [space](space) wasn't there [information](text) about article
    - [student](student) like reading over [paragraph](text) know [find](search) interesting thoughts
    - yeah [student](student) like spark interest
    - [student](student) that's [more](expand) like know mean i've i've like [crater](space) like swimming well that's different
    - awesome thanks [student](student) okay first briefly before know tackle  guys's responses wanted know just raise hands would love [moon](space) someday
    - [student](student) want moon
    - absolutely know some didn't raise  hand wouldn't want [moon](space) anyone wants share
    - kind unpack [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) minute minute there anyone chance group speak spanish raise hands anyone
    - [student](student) each okay well know [word](text) what [word](text) [moon](space) french know
    - [student](student) yeah spanish luna
    -  absolutely right [student](student) need [oxygen](space) going [space](space) [moon](space) matter
    - [student](student) know anything that's super about [space](space) what's  favorite [space](space) fact
    - yeah [student](student) know anything else about moon
    - what about anybody else anybody else group know anything specific about [moon](space) didn't read activity
    -  that's cool would guys like moon
    - alright first wondering what everyone think about [passage](text) read about [water](space) [moon](space) anyone thoughts ideas about what read [student](student)
    - [student](student) that's amazing really hope maybe [astronaut](role) actually [moon](space) would amazing know what students visit [moon](space) would incredible
    - what's  favorite thing about [space](space) [student](student)
    - would guys excited live [moon](space) could
    - [student](student) what think would want live moon
    - [student](student) what kind stuff
    - [student](student) since went there make want join [nasa](space) moon
    - [student](student) right think could just talking about life [moon](space) maybe need [more](expand) [earth](space) protect planet think could work into  answer
    - [student](student) what know about space
    - [student](student) could tell little about atmosphere
    - [student](student) well what's something could bring [moon](space) might
    - [student](student) think would moon
    - [student](student) before begin question speak spanish
    - [student](student) speak spanish
    - okay [student](student) speak spanish
    - great [student](student) teach spanish [word](text) moon
    - [student](student) really place could tell about
    - space something  interested [student](student)
    - [student](student) last thing what armstrong neil armstrong what when landed moon
    - [student](student) well that's fantastic tell something know about space
    - [student](student) okay ever used microscope
    - when guys reading feel feel really easy kind middle really difficult read

    - [student](student) investigate
    - [student](student) used well what [machine](tool) what piece equipment
    - [student](student) trying trying [find](search) find [water](space) because what [look](search) d know where water
    - also talk about [crater](space) story which  brought everybody little part story want talk about what [found](search) [find](search) [water](space) [moon](space) don't [student](student)
    - [student](student) before even [look](search) into [text](text) want [look](search) question question specifically asking what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) water
    - right there know want [look](search) some sort [equipment](tool) based around [water](space) [text](text) [evidence](search) something wanted talk guys about
    - [student](student) text [evidence](search) going [support](search)  answers [pull](search) straight from [text](text) always know  answers close semi correct
    - [student](student) evidence really important [word](text) because means there's going proof [passage](text) want [find](search) proof question what [equipment](tool) [discover](search) water
    - [student](student) right [equipment](tool) such question specifically wants know what [equipment](tool) [discover](search) water
    - [student](student) about [word](text) [evidence](search) [word](text) value
    - [student](student) evidence means going prove answer [passage](text) tells answer question will there convincing [evidence](search) will there we'll find
    -  [student](student) ready come back answer want [investigate](search) some other answers first
    - [student](student) know sure [paragraph](text) tell [scientist](role) used
    - awesome [student](student) could rewrite  answer include piece information
    - okay question what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) sentence mentioned [scientist](role) actually [microscope](tool) [student](student)
    - scientists yeah thinking about [equipment](tool) [student](student)   answer mentioned equipment
    - trying [text](text) text mention [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) [student](student)
    - [student](student) question both [scientist](role) actually [equipment](tool) when working moon
    - absolutely [student](student) asked what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) would answer using [text](text) al evidence
    - [student](student)  right talk about [water](space) [look](search) discussion question
    - [student](student) anything about [equipment](tool) used
    - [student](student) need narrow down  answer [more](expand) specific
    - okay [student](student) which what what where circle [word](text)
    - [student](student) what important [word](text) [words](text) circle question
    - just like [student](student) asked [discover](search) water
    - [student](student) when read deeper into [passage](text) answer gave else could [found](search) what other olive [ice](space) could used [find](search) [water](space) [moon](space) [crater](space)
    - [student](student) think could important express [water](space) valuable future
    - [student](student) equipment [find](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) yeah which really isn't telling
    - [student](student) what [machine](tool) right
    - [student](student) [find](search) anything talking about oxygen
    - [student](student) scientists [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - think [student](student) told about [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) something else
    - [student](student) okay know know much still don't know what used [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) [find](search) [evidence](search) when [look](search) ng answer different question
    - think [student](student) asking about [equipment](tool) that's used [water](space) would need different [equipment](tool) only just parts would help [discover](search) water
    - [student](student) think--
    - [student](student) right that's [look](search) ng 's answer said [nasa](space) send small [machine](tool) what else could instead just small machine
    - [student](student) well yeah what else could  answer instead just saying small [machine](tool) could made [more](expand) depth answered [more](expand) depth
    - [student](student) small [machine](tool) could anything couldn't
    - [student](student) what else could  answer
    - [student](student) know what small [machine](tool) called
    - teacher know want  self position little when response like hard know what meant because maybe what grade  paper before grade [student](student)
    - [student](student) okay there's definitely some room improvement there gave some good information
    - [student](student) improvement tell what changes make
    - [student](student) depending size could [lunar](space) order maybe also small machine
    - just kind circle back little think  we've kind talked some other people [student](student) there feel about  answer giving another shot what might instead
    - [student](student) perfect what [microscope](tool) attached
    - [student](student) didn't didn't actually name [machine](tool) right
    - [student](student) look into  statement answer question
    - [student](student) that's going very valuable what else valuable there talks about there
    - [student](student) going [information](text) just part
    - [student](student) that's right what else what other purposes takes point answer
    - [student](student) right used what else
    - [student](student) right what know there's [more](expand) think
    - very much [student](student) there's more
    - [student](student) right what would being able split hydrogen [oxygen](space) apart what benefit would give [astronaut](role)
    - that's good answer [student](student) just need little [more](expand) detail
    - [student](student) would would work atmosphere right
    - [student](student) like discussing last session about what thought science fiction long time like wrinkle time actually happen possibly lifetime where they're able
    - [student](student) need into little [more](expand) detail
    - [student](student) right [water](space) being [moon](space) future continue [space](space) journeys explorations then possibly [water](space) will very very valuable moon
    - [student](student) according think people actually [moon](space) time just send [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) lunar orbiter
    -  [student](student) other ke [word](text)
    - [student](student) there could would great another reason [look](search) back people base don't need [oxygen](space) breathe
    - [student](student) would [oxygen](space) breathing what about hydrogen part would hydrogen useful
    -  [student](student)  answers changed after discussing 's 's 's
    - [student](student) what what into little [more](expand) detail
    - [student](student) yeah since they're small amounts going able like amount [water](space) earth
    - [student](student) good okay [found](search) piece [equipment](tool) [found](search) [tool](tool) used [microscope](tool) used [find](search) [water](space) begin first [machine](tool) [find](search) water
    - [student](student) think  answer wrong
    -  same answer [student](student) follow along what just went
    - [student](student) okay [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) allows breathe better when they're moon
    - [student](student) well take [microscope](tool) moon
    - [student](student) just want little clarification
    - [student](student) well yeah think about like what uses talks about [microscope](tool) right [microscope](tool) small right could talking about know [oxygen](space) tank wanted know specifically knew what [equipment](tool) used know what mean
    - [student](student) needs clarified
    - [student](student) what
    - [student](student) okay could valuable [astronaut](role)
    - [student](student) right what think  answer
    - [student](student) okay think think take [space](space) hip could easier without weight water
    - [student](student) hold just said haven't moon
    - [student](student) yeah would valuable resource
    - [student](student) okay what mean what [water](space) essential
    - [student](student) right well yeah take literally essentially central take bath right essential drink water
    - [student](student) okay well read [article](text) question
    - [student](student) okay what question asking
    -  question said circled same [student](student) actually read article
    - [student](student) mean already [find](search) water
    - there okay [student](student) where [find](search) ng water
    - [student](student) microscope actually [find](search) water
    - [student](student) okay reasons could valuable
    - [student](student) okay read [paragraph](text) listen hear somewhere else
    - there other [word](text) important [student](student)
    - [student](student) okay need [look](search) closely means already [found](search) right
    - [student](student) okay [nasa](space) send small [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) [investigate](search) [look](search) question answers what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) says good good don't carry ships an [more](expand) that's some good [information](text) convince [water](space) [moon](space) valuable
    - [student](student) what think think that's partially convincing [evidence](search) [water](space) [moon](space) could valuable
    - [student](student) okay well just because can't right moment mean future wouldn't valuable what think
    - [student](student) maybe instead using [word](text) [tool](tool) could different [word](text) what would another word
    - [student](student) expanding thinking want learn [more](expand) okay important read discuss learn little [more](expand) about [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) improve response what could improve response
    - anybody else answer question though need [microscope](tool) [water](space) there [water](space) [crater](space) there just little [water](space) [crater](space)
    - [student](student) what [discover](search) before microscope
    - [student](student) yeah before [microscope](tool) what discover
    - [student](student) microscopes [moon](space) would maybe collect samples then we'll back earth
    - [student](student) type [equipment](tool) used [discover](search) [investigate](search) water
    - [student](student) there better answer
    - [student](student) there type [equipment](tool) might used [investigate](search) water
    - anyone know
    - [student](student) however best piece [evidence](search) grab from article
    - [student](student) okay just told [water](space) split into parts hydrogen [oxygen](space) tell [information](text) about [moon](space) about [astronaut](role)
    - [student](student) right after reading last [paragraph](text) just read
    - just like [student](student) mentioned some well [equipment](tool) while that's true what used
    - sorry guys says would need [scientific](space) [tool](tool) called [microscope](tool) [look](search) really closely okay that's what [nasa](space) sent though [student](student)
    - [student](student) that's what sent
    - [student](student) used
    - [student](student) could restate question
    - [student](student) restate question answer know when  reciting
    - [student](student) question
    - [student](student) what will know number like somebody didn't know what what [passage](text) even about could read answer question know taught what talking about could restate question
    - [student](student) little deeper tell really valuable right
    - [student](student) think about feel valuable while little deeper tell going valuable while
    - [student](student) like things time money wasn't problem could know think about
    - know trying think about issues could important think about next time okay [student](student)
    - [student](student) fact [water](space) split telling anything about good [space](space) tell
    - [student](student) just says [found](search) [evidence](search) there [water](space) [found](search) [water](space) just [evidence](search) meaning seen [water](space) there mean there's
    - [student](student) whole whole thing [article](text) about about [water](space) [moon](space) think [space](space) uit could help [find](search) [water](space) just [tool](tool) [astronaut](role) protect
    - [student](student)  answer talked about [microscope](tool) being [tool](tool) what [microscope](tool) [discover](search) [water](space) used [look](search) water
    - [student](student) that's right [examine](search) [water](space) they're using [microscope](tool) [examine](search) [water](space) [equipment](tool) used discover
    - [student](student) okay [water](space) could other [word](text) could important
    - already telling valuable  [student](student) know here weren't quite sure valuable [resource](space) heading first line already start identifying valuable resource
    - [student](student) says what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) used [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) small [machine](tool) could mean anything
    - [student](student) understand what  saying same time  able [find](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) moving forward could very valuable
    - right what [oxygen](space) tank [student](student)
    - [student](student) astronauts could what water
    - [student](student) there [water](space) [moon](space) help
    - [student](student) mean example small [machine](tool) could sort mean could anything know from maybe even remote even clock wall can't sort [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) example need need [water](space) live earth
    - [student](student) able know perhaps [expand](expand) know [space](space) traveling capabilities able actually [water](space) [moon](space) might little [more](expand) inexpensive inexpensive actually transport
    - anybody might know another reason might actually sort beneficial [water](space) [moon](space) might actually help [astronaut](role)
    - [student](student) think perhaps like said perhaps future there enough [evidence](search) know know least going forward some type know human habitation there surface [moon](space) [water](space) become [more](expand) valuable live there
    - [student](student) okay when answer something think sometimes maybe little [more](expand) specific there's confusion
    - [student](student) think took  answer send small [machine](tool) which  correctly what else could make little [more](expand) clear somebody idea what  talking about
    - [student](student) okay could what [machine](tool) what what [machine](tool) here being used
    - [student](student) need [expand](expand) upon some answers
    - [student](student) scientific [tool](tool) called [microscope](tool) microscope what show
    - [student](student) when [look](search)  answer [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) [equipment](tool) used [discover](search) water
    - yeah then also when talking [student](student)
    - [student](student) just need support
    - absolutely [look](search) back some answers [look](search) d question what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) used [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) answers [microscope](tool) small [machine](tool) then some other [equipment](tool) which answer makes most sense what would [found](search) [moon](space) [student](student)
    - [student](student)  time [look](search) back what [equipment](tool) passage
    - [student](student) said [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) what [word](text) [find](search) what [word](text) what pieces [equipment](tool) find
    - [student](student) microscope wasn't best choice
    - [student](student) because [microscope](tool) [tool](tool) fact
    - [student](student) makes sense able they're saying [look](search) really closely [water](space) would need [tool](tool) [discover](search) another [word](text) [find](search) [water](space) only other piece [equipment](tool) [text](text) small [machine](tool) called
    - [student](student) right [microscope](tool) help [water](space) what's thing helps [water](space) first place
    - [student](student) point [nasa](space) small [machine](tool) [microscope](tool) small [machine](tool) right
    - [student](student) question would know [water](space) valuable even split what parts would question
    - [student](student) there other ways which [water](space) that's [found](search) moon
    - [student](student) think other reasons [water](space) would valuable [resource](space) because based what we've talked about today
    - [student](student) would change  answer want keep same what  already down
    - [student](student) okay [water](space) important many since [article](text) about [water](space) says whole time throughout article
    - [student](student) need [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) moon
    - [student](student) that's true very true people [moon](space) though
    - [student](student) people [moon](space) [article](text) what just read anything about people being [moon](space) article
    - [student](student) true there title [machine](tool) there name [machine](tool) number
    - [student](student) yeah after number where  answer read rest response rest article
    - [student](student) yeah talk about using [microscope](tool) [equipment](tool) what used [moon](space) there [microscope](tool) there [moon](space) [look](search) need something else before could microscope
    - [student](student) used [microscope](tool) what name [machine](tool) needed [space](space) remember
    - [student](student) what
    - [student](student) underline
    -  time share person beside would like person each group share answers group  want view give what [word](text) guys underlying question
    - [student](student) question wondering  answer wasn't best answer correct
    - [student](student) yeah okay know  answer could wasn't best answer
    - [student](student) what [word](text) could [underline](action) question help answer best answer
    - [student](student) okay like [underline](action) [equipment](tool) good [word](text) [underline](action) correct there another [word](text) question help under help answer question
    - depth tell what [word](text) guys underline
    - [student](student) could [more](expand) specific answering   answer 
    - [student](student) could [more](expand) specific  answer
    - [student](student) teacherr could [look](search) back
    - [student](student) find answer
    - [student](student) no [ice](space) anything could [more](expand) specific  answer
    - [student](student) talking about [equipment](tool) anything from [microscope](tool) giant rocket anything
    - yeah guess [student](student) also soften  answer [water](space) microscopic  just from [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) above above [moon](space) special kind equipment
    - [student](student) after after reading [paragraph](text) three think able [water](space) eyes
    - anyone want share what circled
    - okay [student](student) [find](search) anything helps change  answer circling [word](text) question
    -   [student](student) able [find](search) [paragraph](text) where talking about answers
    - think  answer answers question [student](student)
    - [student](student) think there's another part  answer other small microscope
    - [student](student)  [text](text) doesn't there [astronaut](role)
    - [student](student) there able observe said water
    - [student](student) used order [find](search) [water](space) don't think quite
    - [student](student) yeah maybe [look](search) back down  answer which there full [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) completely accurate
    - want guys after  talked  partners  group members circled [underline](action) terms [text](text)  questions guys think could reconstruct  answer just little [more](expand) detailed
    - [student](student) remember uses [microscope](tool) humans [look](search) through [microscope](tool) right [scientist](role) [look](search) through microscope
    - [student](student) remember what called [machine](tool) science sorts wacky names [machine](tool) that's what [look](search) ng [look](search) ng [find](search) name what small machine
    - [student](student) totally yeah [look](search) [text](text) [look](search) back think close same line about small [machine](tool) sure know
    - [student](student) yeah totally [microscope](tool) [look](search) three [sentences](text) here three [paragraph](text)
    - [student](student) paragraph three says [water](space) [found](search) microscopic meaning wouldn't able [look](search) ng straight would need [scientific](space) cool [tool](tool) called [microscope](tool) [look](search) really closely there's part [microscope](tool) before then
    - [student](student) where [found](search) called [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) [paragraph](text) right
    - [student](student) yeah what [machine](tool) call
    - [student](student) tiny [water](space) well love [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) going into polar [crater](space) [look](search) ng small [water](space) where's small [water](space) located
    - [student](student) what form like
    - [student](student) looking giant lake [look](search) ng what yeah well what form [water](space) what same [text](text) part don't
    - [student](student) what [equipment](tool) okay [look](search) ng name what's name small [machine](tool) came
    - [student](student) yeah think there even very short [text](text) different pieces [equipment](tool) mentioned right
    - [student](student) third [paragraph](text) tell [scientist](role) used [microscope](tool) [find](search) water
    - awesome [student](student) which piece [equipment](tool) think most important here
    - [student](student) awesome little [machine](tool) lands moon
    - [student](student) yeah that's right doesn't really [scientist](role) using
    - yeah that's awesome [text](text) both [found](search) [text](text) question what small [machine](tool) [student](student) what machine
    - [student](student) alright sound
    - [student](student) could yeah [look](search) something discover
    - talking about what [equipment](tool) maybe [equipment](tool) name right what small [machine](tool) name anybody anybody circle what small [machine](tool) called
    - [student](student) microscope great example piece [equipment](tool) also thing called [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) [investigate](search) things work together
    - looking both [sentences](text) guys want [look](search)  sheet paper  [look](search) ng [word](text) [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) [microscope](tool) there [word](text) kind signal what equipment
    - [student](student) there second part sentence tells maybe what called like name equipment
    - going [paragraph](text) going read while reading [look](search) ng [student](student)
    - [student](student) going [look](search) [paragraph](text) okay just want listen while reading [find](search) particular [equipment](tool) might stop talk about okay
    - [student](student) means [moon](space) still drier driest desert [earth](space) [water](space) [found](search) microscopic meaning wouldn't able [look](search) ng straight
    - need [scientific](space) toll called [microscope](tool) [look](search) really closely what [microscope](tool) helping guys
    - [student](student) because [passage](text) [look](search) back [find](search) says [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) called looper [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) [investigate](search) [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) [look](search) [deposit](space) large polar [crater](space) what name [machine](tool) called
    - [student](student) small [machine](tool) [look](search) back what that's called read sentence okay number [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) investigate
    - [student](student) what [microscope](tool) what [microscope](tool) text
    - find [water](space) before [look](search) right anyone know what [discover](search) means
    - [student](student) right [discover](search) when [find](search) find first going [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) [find](search) before look
    - [student](student) okay [microscope](tool) [discover](search) water
    - [student](student) need [scientific](space) [tool](tool) called [microscope](tool) [look](search) very closely
    - [student](student) look back  [passage](text) what [equipment](tool) [find](search) water
    - [student](student) look number
    - [student](student) lunar [orbiter](space) [look](search) [deposit](space) large polar [crater](space) [deposit](space) very small what what
    - [student](student) back [text](text) specific answers from [text](text) what equipment
    - [student](student) need back into [text](text) [find](search) specifically where states what [equipment](tool) used [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) back into [text](text) look
    - [student](student) says [text](text) back look
    - [student](student) text
    - back [look](search) what's another [word](text) [student](student)
    - [student](student) small [machine](tool) right what name machine
    - [student](student) look what what says [astronaut](role)
    - [student](student) water main
    - [student](student) what [astronaut](role) water
    - [student](student) what [text](text) about [astronaut](role) [water](space) should under bottle [water](space) valuable source valid valuable [resource](space) what
    - [student](student) right hydrogen oxygen
    - [student](student) back think second [paragraph](text) you'll [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) [investigate](search) [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) [look](search) [deposit](space) large polar crater
    - [student](student) that's where [found](search) think right
    - [student](student) landed [moon](space) south [pole](space) that's where [found](search) [look](search) d [deposit](space) since wasn't necessarily [water](space) frozen [water](space) [look](search) large polar [crater](space) guess really cold
    - underlined [equipment](tool) [discover](search) great tell just reading [passage](text) [student](student) tell what [word](text) [equipment](tool) might refer [passage](text) what kind [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) deposits what tell what says [deposit](space) very small
    - very small they're [look](search) ng something very small they're take [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) there also read [paragraph](text) three [student](student)
    - [student](student) word could that's second sentence circle [word](text) could  pencil will second sentence [paragraph](text) four says could useful lots ways
    - [student](student) would think [word](text) useful also same maybe valuable [look](search) back [paragraph](text) telling could useful
    - [student](student) stop second what first [paragraph](text) tells know
    - [student](student) okay someone paraphrase paragraph
    - [student](student) yeah what would [deposit](space) what think would [look](search) like
    - [student](student) tool because [deposit](space) small can't  eyes [tool](tool) [microscope](tool) able
    - [student](student) okay moisture that's still bigger moisture [found](search) [moon](space) frost naked what [found](search) [moon](space) would even able tell there without [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) [microscope](tool) being able
    - [student](student) okay think [water](space) [moon](space) [look](search) same glass [water](space) would drink
    - [student](student) paragraph three what about
    - [student](student) when when says able
    - [student](student) what right after
    - [student](student) good glass [water](space) lunch can't wait there's something glass
    - [student](student) what tell [water](space) [moon](space) what compared [water](space) here
    - [student](student) well might because [found](search) [crater](space) there might lots there small can't naked know turned before naked yeah
    - [student](student) think [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) being able
    - [student](student) because remember [paragraph](text) three says wouldn't able water
    - [student](student) found there
    - [student](student) right [passage](text) only talking about
    - [student](student) what [found](search) [moon](space) there anything [passage](text) talks about oxygen
    - [student](student) lunar [orbiter](space) helped [find](search) [water](space) want [look](search) [paragraph](text) three
    - [student](student) what about [water](space) [paragraph](text) three
    - [student](student) what need [find](search) can't
    - [student](student) look paragraph
    - [student](student) fourth sentence [look](search) down four sentence
    - [student](student) right here ounces
    - [student](student) would though [word](text) [water](space) take surface which
    - [student](student) couldn't even describe would trucks trucks loads topsoil okay upload [moon](space) still would only fill glass
    - [student](student) would like [look](search) back  [paragraph](text) find
    - [student](student) answer
    - okay [student](student) correct [nasa](space) sand small [machine](tool) [look](search) back  [paragraph](text) [find](search) name machine
    - okay anybody [paragraph](text) four [word](text) valuable actually beginning paragraph
    - [student](student) lunar [orbiter](space) different called [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) what
    - [student](student) discover [water](space) microscope
    - [student](student) look back [paragraph](text) second
    - sent [orbiter](space) [look](search) clues didn't talk anyone [moon](space) sent [lunar](space) [look](search) clues what [find](search) [lunar](space) orbiter
    - [student](student) lunar [orbiter](space) [discover](search) ng orbiting [look](search) ng around used investigate
    - [student](student) remind what [investigating](search) means
    - [student](student) good [look](search) clues order figure there [water](space) moon
    - also [water](space) firsthand what [water](space) [student](student)
    -  able relate what [student](student) saying where [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) what actually [discover](search) [water](space) [microscope](tool) what study water
    - [student](student) right [discover](search) [water](space) [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) okay someone raise  hand tell some other [equipment](tool) we've talked about reading
    - [student](student) what we've talked about [lunar](space) lunar [orbiter](space) we've talked about [microscope](tool) there other [equipment](tool) they've talked about
    - [student](student) what read what read [paragraph](text) there other [equipment](tool) discussed [paragraph](text) read
    - [student](student) exactly right send small [machine](tool) know what small [machine](tool) called
    - [student](student) okay want [look](search) back [passage](text) figure what small [machine](tool) called
    - okay many guys [look](search) ng [word](text) [water](space) passage
    - [student](student) whenever [look](search) ng [passage](text) able read understand [moon](space) same thing water
    - lunar [orbiter](space) [paragraph](text) says [look](search) [deposit](space) large polar [crater](space) [deposit](space) very small answer help [student](student)
    - [student](student) look back [text](text) where [text](text) [find](search) [word](text) [look](search) [word](text) [machine](tool) machine there
    - [student](student) exactly exactly back [look](search) text
    - [student](student) what [look](search) ng
    - [student](student) asking [text](text) field like back [text](text) there's piece [equipment](tool) used [look](search) ng [water](space) right
    - [student](student) right exactly think [microscope](tool) help [look](search) [water](space) while they're physically moon
    - [student](student) right [look](search) [text](text) [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) right
    - microscopes both there when talking specifically about [find](search) ng [water](space) [look](search) back [text](text) [find](search) where says film [equipment](tool) used [find](search) [water](space) [moon](space) yeah [student](student)
    - [student](student) back [text](text) [look](search) first part where they're talking about piece equipment
    - [student](student) they've talked about [moon](space) being desert right think there's water
    - [student](student) then [look](search) ng what
    - [student](student) well [look](search) ng [water](space) [moon](space) right
    - [student](student) what about [lunar](space) orbiter
    - [student](student) okay think little [more](expand) about questions because says [word](text) essential  answer [word](text) [equipment](tool) [word](text) [water](space) think about [word](text) before make answer
    - read said [student](student) said [scientist](role) used [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) question asking about what using [moon](space) something savanah
    - [student](student) what think [microscope](tool) [look](search) really closely what think need [look](search) things really closely
    - [student](student) that's amazing really know what something [microscope](tool) something really really really small right
    - [student](student) example think microscope
    - [student](student) read text
    - [student](student) even little [more](expand) basic there what [equipment](tool) talk about [text](text) what what what's getting used
    - very good very good glad  seeing take [look](search) back [student](student) no [ice](space) [paragraph](text) could some insight take back what sort [equipment](tool) mentioned specifically paragraph
    - [student](student) also part getting [moon](space) about [search](search) ng there we've whole [elaborate](expand) backstory right what makes very interesting read
    - [student](student) while there some [water](space) there might whole might buckets buckets buckets oceans water
    - [student](student) make sure speaking [nasa](space) they're ones sent [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) right
    - [student](student) they're ones [microscope](tool) [look](search) small small know [article](text) [water](space) when [find](search) [moon](space) know they're kind subject they're kind [article](text) talking about right
    - [student](student) that's part actually goes down [look](search) very closely need figure [found](search) [water](space) [crater](space) correct
    - [student](student) once take quick glance
    - [student](student) what find
    - [student](student) right what [text](text) tell about
    - [student](student) correct what's small [machine](tool) called
    - [student](student) what [nasa](space) sent will [look](search) going help read okay [nasa](space) send small [machine](tool) what just first little [text](text) tell
    - [student](student) right what called
    - [student](student) what about [water](space) split into
    - [student](student) what could possibly [water](space) used
    - nasa said small [machine](tool) [pull](search) d from second [paragraph](text) everyone will [look](search) back second paragraph
    - discovered [student](student) later they're going other [equipment](tool) right they've [discover](search) d [water](space) later study deeper
    - [student](student) into [water](space) right want [look](search) closely that's what [passage](text) says tell want [look](search) really closely [paragraph](text) three going need another [tool](tool) called
    - [student](student) microscope [microscope](tool) [scientist](role) using equipment
    - [student](student) scientists using equipment
    - [student](student) using [microscope](tool) what [microscope](tool) helping [scientist](role)
    - [student](student) right correct using [microscope](tool) study [look](search) deeper into [water](space) first [find](search) [water](space) [equipment](tool) small [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) that's what [passage](text) about
    - [student](student) then later [passage](text) learned used other [equipment](tool) study [water](space) deeper
    - [student](student) where [find](search) passage
    - [student](student) well [microscope](tool) able [look](search) microscopic things [moon](space) [find](search) [water](space) digging equipment
    - [student](student) right important thing separated [oxygen](space) [astronaut](role) could breathe also fuel hydrogen [oxygen](space) separate into atoms make fuel
    - [student](student) remember atmosphere what breathe [oxygen](space) and--
    - [student](student) moon doesn't oxygen
    - [student](student) well rockets hydrogen will break into-- breaks down able make rocket fuel which help [space](space) rafts move like story like cars know
    - [student](student) helps  without  won't just like rocket fuel which made different strands hydrogen also some [oxygen](space) would fill tank move throughout space
    - [student](student) water heavy there [water](space) [moon](space) then wouldn't carry which would drain fuel supply would also take [space](space) spacecraft being able stop somewhere [pick](search) [water](space) better carry around time [water](space) heavy
    - [student](student) okay [look](search) [look](search) back reading says [nasa](space) send small [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) investigate
    - [student](student) there isn't said didn't clearly there people there would assume well would just [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) orbiter
    - [student](student) look back [paragraph](text) take moment [look](search) back paragraph
    - [student](student) then [paragraph](text) threee says [found](search) [water](space) [found](search) microscopic meaning super small [microscope](tool) look
    - okay [water](space) [paragraph](text) okay what different form [water](space) there's different forms [water](space) there's frozen form what called [student](student)
    - [student](student) just different form just [water](space) different form frozen solid
    - [student](student) okay [look](search) back [text](text) real quick
    - [student](student) when [discover](search) something  correct doesn't doesn't discover
    - [student](student) right know people [earth](space) [water](space) live [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) don't worry about bringing [water](space) could just drink [water](space) [moon](space) stay hydrated
    - [student](student) second sentence correct right [water](space) broken down into parts hydrogen oxygen
    - [student](student) important what's reason would want break down what reason wanted break down [water](space) into hydrogen [oxygen](space) what could hydrogen oxygen
    - [student](student) look [paragraph](text) five
    - [student](student) could split [water](space) hydrogen [oxygen](space) rocket fuel that's could [moon](space) leave from [moon](space) right that's another reason [water](space) could such valuable commodity
    - [student](student) nope because we've more
    - [student](student) perfect okay want start [look](search) ng over question [paragraph](text) okay [look](search) [paragraph](text) passage

    - going group learn together discuss what read
    - just group discussion we've read
    - okay well group help each other learn
    - [student](student) seems like some understanding what trying [find](search) quite there just what like like around read little little person time then going work through question together sound like plan
    - [student](student) fantastic love amount enthusiasm real quick before begin would like just [address](search) thing tell students whenever walk into classroom first time
    - [student](student) thing like mention students like mention well philosophy answering questions might weird thing hear like mistakes
    - that's weird thing hear teacher save right like mistakes  probably going hear many make mistakes [student](student)
    - guys bring back together group answers changed based  group discussion
    - want make sure everybody really good understanding [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) helped [discover](search) microscopic water
    - [student](student) okay well want focus  attention [article](text) just read going [examine](search) [article](text) determine [scientist](role) gone about [find](search) ng [water](space) [crater](space) moon
    - [student](student) well guess what going learn some things today might [find](search) something didn't know
    - point group just [elaborate](expand) [more](expand) guys
    - just wanted talk about answers kind where guys  answers from
    - well collectively talk each other wanted aspect another persons answer well guys could totally about getting different parts
    - [student](student) what kind hoping from [search](search) [text](text) kind show what learned from text
    - group just going focus some things read change answers better reading sound good [student](student)
    - tweak little improve adjust  [sentences](text) just show understand what [text](text) saying just wanted guys examples exactly from [text](text) know guys easy time reading
    - okay well today going experiment different kinds groups know about [space](space) then maybe help  table mates probably don't know much sounds good [student](student)
    - good hear today group because going focus today's lesson which about [scientific](space) [tool](tool) used moon
    - [student](student) other going talk about whether [moon](space) valuable [resource](space) people able live moon
    - there short reading gave guys questions just remind what questions i'll read loud guys first question what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) [student](student)
    - okay we'll just work question number thank letting know guys will time write down  answers questions
    - class [pull](search) d into small group because think really good answering discussion question about [water](space) [moon](space) [text](text) want work each little [more](expand) just make  responses [more](expand) academic little longer [student](student)
    - going discussing trying [expand](expand) [more](expand) upon [sentences](text) would like just other [passage](text) [student](student)
    - think guys really great thinking while using [text](text) going around room give little feedback each [student](student) start
    - [student](student) know know about [space](space) isn't about learning about [space](space) about going work creating better responses when read [text](text) makes sense
    - [student](student) there's just things need work order create better responses better understanding text
    - here because concerns about each  guys's responses [water](space) [moon](space) [passage](text) going work improving [student](student)
    - [student](student) know about [space](space) doesn't really anything learning about [space](space) going about improving responses questions when read [passage](text)
    - reason five today because some concerns about  responses would like [address](search) improve guys better understand
    - -[student](student) have better understanding answer questions given after reading [passage](text) awesome
    - everyone today heard read [water](space) [moon](space) correct anyone everyone read want revise answers because understanding didn't deep deep understanding going today want one-- [student](student)
    - everyone today going revising answers from question what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - everyone good understanding reading want work answers just little because think getting little confused between aspects first before share answers [student](student) want independently minute [look](search) question
    - [student](student) well really want work because want hear what  answer want know what make even better
    - think maybe guys good understanding [text](text) think little deeper relate [text](text)  answers [pull](search) [evidence](search) from text
    - [student](student) from reading
    - [student](student) however think important sometimes even know material think good work [word](text) things just really working answering questions skills really helpful
    - [student](student) true however today using science
    - [student](student) drive reading skills actually going using science reading about science about
    - guys done going using reading
    - [student](student) going reviewing responses questions
    - [student](student) actually going using reading work reading skills going learning also- about science
    - [student](student) also going learning work reading writing skills
    - [student](student) work break down questions such
    - [student](student) think [more](expand) work answers make little [more](expand) expectation using specific language
    - text uses well just working writing skills like said [student](student) earlier just working science skills also working reading writing skills
    - yeah also using today only reading help know little [more](expand) about [space](space) like [student](student) knows about
    - [student](student) also going using reading learn prac [ice](space) reading writing skills understanding break down
    - [student](student) information might even know about stuff
    - just want make sure everybody using right language everybody understands [find](search) find [evidence](search) answer such [student](student)  hand well
    - [student](student) about right wrong here right about building response strengthening [text](text) al [evidence](search) [look](search) ng ideas question
    - like where where [found](search) answer [text](text) [student](student)
    - [student](student) read line where [found](search) story what
    - yeah [student](student) [more](expand) about where [found](search) [text](text) said
    - [student](student) read [article](text) because sure really need answer because circled same
    - [student](student) chance back [look](search) [find](search) same answer [find](search) something different
    - [student](student) maybe other [equipment](tool) might used just [find](search) [oxygen](space) excuse just [find](search) [water](space) [moon](space) what some other points made [passage](text) read what some other points made
    - what makes think [student](student) based [passage](text) what makes think [evidence](search) convincing
    - [student](student) tell read [paragraph](text) where says
    - [student](student) scientists [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) where [find](search) evidence

    - [student](student) water [scientist](role) need come plan extracting getting polar [crater](space) making planet tickle don't even know water
    - [student](student) found somewhere because thought [underline](action)
    - [student](student) yeah guess
    - [student](student) okay
    - [student](student) still kind confused
    - [student](student) yeah also really picture because went [nasa](space) [found](search) [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like like [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) [masks](space) suits
    - [student](student) yeah read there could base [moon](space) 2024
    - [student](student) yeah okay what [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) really guess caught circle [word](text) [scientist](role) because there [scientist](role) [moon](space) [oxygen](space) tanks
    - well just wanted share went [nasa](space) know [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like like [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) like [student](student) said also [masks](space) suits
    - shouldn't group already know about space
    - [student](student) okay
    - [student](student) teacher  frozen hear
    - [student](student) sorry just [look](search) d clock
    - [student](student) yeah
    - [student](student) yeah yeah wanted know answer okay [water](space) [scientist](role) [found](search) [moon](space) microscopic
    - [student](student) circled [water](space) [moon](space) also discover
    - [student](student) sent small [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) investigate
    - [student](student) teacher [look](search) ng clock time lunch want appreciate kept asking questions know like think about
    - [student](student) wasn't question teacher just [look](search) ng clock [look](search) like time lunch what wanted thank
    - [student](student) [ice](space) thing just just part answer
- intent: r400
  examples: |
    - [student](student) didn't exactly answer question about [equipment](tool) what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) little concerned connect question [text](text) [look](search) ng back question what's question [look](search) ng tell able tell what question
    - [student](student) water [found](search) would [microscope](tool) study doesn't explain [found](search) water
    - [student](student) wasn't exact answer question  answer would there [scientific](space) [tool](tool) called [microscope](tool) [look](search) really closely water
    - [student](student) well  answer wasn't necessarily incorrect some really good [vocabulary](text) terms weren't completely answering question question sorry [pull](search) back
    - [student](student) however think point doesn't answer directly main question next step after [discover](search) d [water](space) [moon](space) part [equipment](tool) [discover](search) d what
    - [student](student) correct need [microscope](tool) [look](search) really closely they're asking what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) discover
    - [student](student) correct need [microscope](tool) [look](search) really closely they're asking what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [microscope](tool) [equipment](tool) [look](search) d really closely [water](space) [discover](search) [water](space) microscope
    - [student](student) alright student when [look](search) back question says what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) while true [scientist](role) [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) probably very often [equipment](tool) [find](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) specific [tool](tool) used [water](space) samples that's what question asking
    -  [student](student)  response [scientist](role) [found](search) [crater](space) full [water](space) [moon](space) although correct answer wasn't necessarily answering question understand
    - [student](student) because asking about [equipment](tool) what found
    - [student](student) that's actually really good know about [space](space) thing going noticing some responses really pinpointing answering question asked
    - [student](student) that's what that's what question what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) said things what used [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) [lunar](space) orbiter
    - [student](student) looking used [discover](search) [find](search) think another [equipment](tool) mentioned [passage](text) apart from microscope
    - [student](student) question actually wanting know what [equipment](tool) used [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student)  true that's true doesn't answer question while [equipment](tool) that's what [look](search) ng question
    - [student](student) yeah absolutely kind part [moon](space) something caught [water](space) doesn't quite answer question about being piece [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) using
    - [student](student) specific question wants know what specifically used [find](search) [water](space) wouldn't necessarily like [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) things like
    - [student](student) doesn't truly answer question
    - guys getting there  almost there main concern three didn't fully answer question stated
    - [student](student) however knowledge help overall topic specific question makes sense
    - [student](student) question want make sure  answering what questions asking about [equipment](tool) [expand](expand) specifically
    - [student](student) really focused trying [find](search) [evidence](search) [text](text) answer question
    - [student](student) help understand question question specifically asking what what [equipment](tool) [discover](search) [water](space) [equipment](tool) help [discover](search) [water](space) actual [equipment](tool) [discover](search) ng water
    - [student](student) mentioned [microscope](tool) which mentioned [passage](text) which good just need reread question take step farther because concerned didn't fully understand what question asking
    - [student](student) that's what [found](search) [look](search) ng what [equipment](tool) used [discover](search) moon
    - [student](student) very good correct [tool](tool) [equipment](tool) [word](text) hand hand together then back question figure what asking specifically
    - [student](student) didn't talk about equipment
    - [student](student) while [oxygen](space) tank mask [suits](space) part [equipment](tool) question only focusing what [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) question asked talk about equipment
    - [student](student) also student  question  answer [equipment](tool) well talked about [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) trying figure which [equipment](tool) used [discover](search) ng [water](space) [oxygen](space) moon
    - [student](student) what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) pieces [equipment](tool) don't really [water](space) moon
    - good [find](search) ng know what [machine](tool) [equipment](tool) using then [student](student) recognizing know small [machine](tool) still missing concept what action will seen right
    - [student](student) another really important part question action
    - [student](student) right like said know that's [look](search) question actually specifically pointing toward what's potential value
    - [student](student) read [water](space) [moon](space) valuable right question actually says could valuable some point future
    - concern guys want make sure really focusing [equipment](tool) used [scientist](role) [find](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) yeah correct that's what wear [look](search) ng what used [find](search) water
    - [student](student) water overload along [passage](text) concern other students circle [word](text) like [equipment](tool) agree
    - [student](student) question asking right
    - [student](student) concerned though question asking would want [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) really what [look](search) ng [evidence](search) [water](space) [moon](space) could valuable
    - [student](student) when [look](search)  don't necessarily answer question tell what  getting reading  [evidence](search) don't actually specifically answer question then provide [evidence](search) then just explain
    - [student](student) concerned though question asking specifically about water
    - [student](student)  definitely right about [nasa](space) uses much [equipment](tool) many different things question only asking specific [machine](tool) [equipment](tool) used [find](search) water
    - [student](student) true basically just what told student [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) much [equipment](tool) many different things question only asking specific piece [equipment](tool) used [find](search) water
    - [student](student) think that's answering question
    - [student](student) when [look](search) back question only asking specifically what [machine](tool) used [find](search) [water](space) other [machine](tool)
    - [student](student) what
    - [student](student) part question think  missing
    - [student](student) like said because going take time money question answered think would good investment question [water](space) valuable
    - [student](student) really want reiterate important question really reading asking enough [evidence](search) would valuable they're ready
    - [student](student) because answered whether good investment don't think answer actual question [water](space) being valuable think
    - [student](student) great yeah think that's really solid concern would like make sure understanding what question asking
    - [student](student) question what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [crater](space) full [water](space) type equipment
    - right guys want right [look](search) question want [underline](action) question what think most important [word](text) word question
    - [student](student) mind reading question [find](search) ng [word](text) think really important
    - [student](student) want [look](search) back question just read want [find](search) most important [word](text) word think most important question
    - [student](student) question which most important [word](text) pick
    - [student](student) want [look](search) question want [find](search) action [word](text) because we've [underline](action) [equipment](tool) we've [underline](action) [water](space) haven't [underline](action) action word
    - right everybody [find](search) action [word](text) underline
    - [student](student) look back question [find](search) [word](text) question synonym investigate
    - [student](student) when answering questions need make sure answering question that's being asked okay
    - [student](student) look back question take  pencil maybe circle important [word](text) question
    - [student](student) concern  answer doesn't really [address](search) question given
    - [student](student) what's really important [word](text) question could help [find](search) answer take  pencil just [underline](action) really important [word](text) could help [find](search) answer
    - [student](student) ahead [look](search) back question want circle [underline](action) [word](text) think important question
    - [student](student) look back question [look](search) [word](text) will help understand what [look](search) ng reading passage
    - [student](student) ahead [look](search) [word](text) past question
    - look  answer [look](search) question  answer actually answered question [word](text) same  answer actually answering question while  [look](search) ng going over [student](student)
    - what want just minute want guys [look](search) question number
    - want guys figure [underline](action) [pick](search) [word](text) question think [word](text) important [word](text) might help answer question little [more](expand) depth
    - [student](student) want [look](search) question number [find](search) ke [word](text) [words](text) important might help answer question
    - [student](student) read [text](text) read question what [word](text) kind synonyms each other
    - [student](student) what specifically remember post [look](search) what questions asking what text
    - [student](student) saying what specifically
    - [student](student) that's right [look](search) question once reread question remember  posts [look](search) question what specific [information](text) [look](search) ng
    - [student](student)  reading test [information](text)  question trying answer scam [look](search) question then read answer question
    - [student](student) want start using scale after circle  [evidence](search) want back think deeper about question what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) what might [word](text) question help answer question what's word
    - anybody [word](text) want look
    - [student](student) what's another [word](text) could list
    - [student](student) then told  need [scientific](space) [tool](tool) called [microscope](tool) [look](search) closely could [find](search) [nasa](space) [found](search) moon
    - [student](student) because what just described moon
    - [student](student) right back reread question take  highlighters slowly  [look](search) ng [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) want [look](search) question [more](expand) time there [word](text) don't understand circle
    - [student](student) ahead circle [word](text)  sure know meaning
    - [student](student) look [word](text) share  ideas what think [word](text) mean
    - [student](student) okay what [word](text) [find](search) [text](text) helped answer question
    - [student](student) there [word](text) circled [underline](action) text
    - [student](student) yeah suggestion when reading [prompt](text) answering questions would read questions first then read passage
    - [student](student) could little [more](expand) specific question answering
    - [student](student) think about [word](text) question think about  then will discuss what [word](text)
    - [student](student) there's [word](text) very important question name [word](text) question might important
    - [student](student) okay want [look](search)  paper want circle [word](text) question circle maybe [word](text) from question i'll give about seconds
    - [student](student) will just [look](search) when  finished when  circled  [word](text)
    - [student](student) that's right okay which which most most important [word](text) question [word](text) what think
    - [student](student) i'll give seconds think some synonyms [word](text) similar each [word](text) what's another [word](text) [equipment](tool) what's another [word](text) discover
    - right [look](search) like finished what guys think what another [word](text) equipment
    - [student](student) close think might need [look](search) question little maybe rephrase sometimes feel like helpful question [word](text) understand what really asking
    - [student](student) what want want circle action [word](text) question main action [word](text) verbs question
    - [student](student) verbs question i'll give about
    - [student](student) seconds want take  pencil just circle action [word](text) question
    - [student](student) right what think should after [look](search) ng answers kind [look](search) question kind determine some ke [word](text) question
    - pull highlight [look](search) [evidence](search) back [text](text) y'all [look](search) d question first question answered where think what think [word](text) question
    - [student](student) okay within question just like talked about first session what think some [word](text) there need [pull](search) before even worry about answering question
    - [student](student) what want just couple minutes [look](search) back question want take  pencil circle highlight some important [word](text) feel important something stands
    - [student](student) even questoin like sure miss teacher what about [word](text) confusing minute stop just minute take some time [look](search) back question circle okay
    - [student](student) talk about question because wanting first [look](search) about what they're asking then we'll talk about [text](text) make connections about first want [look](search) about question what's about question something about
    - think when circle helps bring back because went even deeper because just asked [word](text) [student](student) used went deeper explained little [more](expand) connection [text](text) helps when circled
    - [student](student) what going break into even smaller groups because liked [look](search) d some s savannas answers want work together right [look](search) [more](expand) into what circled what connects [text](text) questions
    - [student](student) okay what going right going same strategy we've taught before about important make connections [find](search) what question's asking help back [text](text) first what want  pencil highlighter [look](search) back over [find](search) important [word](text) [words](text) feel don't understand okay
    - okay question want there anyone here question [found](search) there's [word](text)  sure about what means there anyone here because want make sure understand question
    - need [water](space) survive right there anything here right right [student](student) also raise  hand about there concerned about question there some [word](text) weren't sure about same [word](text) [evidence](search) different

    - [student](student) what think most important [word](text) question what [word](text) kind giving clues answer want
    - other [word](text) question gives clue going help figure what [look](search) ng what other [word](text) think going help figure exactly what question asking [student](student)
    - [student](student) will describe particular question order make sure fully answered want make sure  answering specific question that's being asked
    - [student](student) look little clues [text](text) question
    - [student](student) strategy just question [pick](search) [word](text) question tell what should [look](search) ng
    - [student](student) right question sort what know when when analyze things read [look](search) specifically what question asking
    - [student](student) like treasure [hunt](search) right what could take second circle [word](text) question  [look](search) ng
    - [student](student) want reread [prompt](text) want circle most important [word](text) [prompt](text) just take minute ahead
    - [student](student)  right small need [microscope](tool) concern  response need piece [equipment](tool) made initial [discover](search) right
    - [student](student) what exactly question asking maybe some what already know about [space](space) answer question
    - right back question hand everyone want when unpacking question [look](search) specific details what [look](search) ng
    - [student](student) want focus action [word](text) question
    - [student](student) cells ahead [look](search) back first question what want like really like would super helpful could later
    - [student](student) what want first [find](search) most important [word](text) question [look](search) back question then want read [pick](search) most important [word](text) will help answer question take seconds then we'll come back
    - [student](student) look back question then want read [pick](search) most important [word](text) will help answer question take seconds then we'll come back
    - [student](student) what want circle [more](expand) three [word](text) phrases think most important question remember should something leads  response take minutes
    - everyone circle [word](text) question think most important [word](text) focus when answering
    - [student](student) look [water](space) [discover](search) d  totally right [article](text) think little [more](expand) deeply about question
    - [student](student) what's important [word](text) question
    - [student](student) actually like take moment take [look](search) question just independently  self read over question maybe circle some [word](text) phrases think might help answering what question asking i'll give minute
    - [student](student) look back question tell what think question asking tell maybe just three [word](text) what question asking
    - [student](student) great completely correct want focus pieces question want focus first [word](text) which [equipment](tool) second which discover
    - [student](student) what's specific part question need [look](search) think about
    - [student](student) follow thread correct response
     - [student](student) what suggesting should order answer [look](search) some ke [word](text) ke [word](text) some co [text](text) clues will help [find](search) find question
    - [student](student) what some [word](text) some co [text](text) clues will help answer what's main part question what [look](search) ng question
    - [student](student) ]ce](space) cool cool good good know what [look](search) ng [equipment](tool) break down little [more](expand) what some [word](text) some [word](text) relate [equipment](tool) will help find
    - [student](student) focus really building answer identifying [scientific](space) equipment
    - [student](student) then explain [equipment](tool) used [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) then once  gotten  answer
    - [student](student) work [text](text) [find](search) something that's going give even [more](expand) specific [information](text) about small machine
    - [student](student) excellent would [add](expand) d  answer would make [ice](space) specific
    - [student](student) mentioned small [machine](tool) better answer would tell what machine
    - [student](student) asking question where asking like what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) then telling circle  answer  answer needs come from what just read
    - take second write answer [student](student)
    - instead  answer being circled same [student](student) could said instead just saying circled same
    - [student](student)   pretty much right could went little [more](expand) into detail small machine
    - [student](student) more specific [look](search) back [paragraph](text) [find](search) rest [more](expand) detailed part answer
    - [student](student) just need [find](search) little [more](expand) evidence
    - [student](student) would like ahead start [look](search) ng back through [passage](text) [word](text) discover
    - know said same answer [student](student) could [find](search) [text](text) circle know where  answer came from would awesome
    - [student](student) just want little [more](expand) specific what tell
    - [student](student) hear gave little [more](expand) specific name instead just saying small [machine](tool) called microscope
    - [student](student) looking into [find](search) ng first time that's would change  answer just little make little [more](expand) clear
    - [student](student) look
    - [student](student) change think about  answer change answers question
    - [student](student) just needed just little [more](expand) depth right
    - [student](student) able come same sort answer give [more](expand) details might able better inform  reader who's teacher
    - [student](student) smaller amount able kind rephrase answer think  know interesting perspective there
    - [student](student) think little [more](expand) specific  response said [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) yeah absolutely they're [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) there could tell maybe another piece [equipment](tool) [nasa](space) used [article](text) help [discover](search) [water](space) moon
    - [student](student) help [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) right because that's ends
    - [student](student) very specific when writing
    - [student](student) words seem tough making sure  reader knows exactly what saying long don't confusion know  just smart know
    - [student](student) think kind change sets
    - [student](student) right kind want readers know talking about [scientist](role) specifically could [nasa](space) could [scientist](role) used want either think would convey  meeting
    - [student](student) yeah remember that's what trying [information](text) what ring correct
    - [student](student) maybe next time when  could could [more](expand) specific said [nasa](space) sent small machine
    - [student](student) could clarify  statement little [more](expand) right well that'd good strategy
    - [student](student) however also specific [text](text) [evidence](search) just like student learned can't just stop [nasa](space) said small [machine](tool) right
    - [student](student) keep reading what small [machine](tool) very specific  answer sure answer every single part question using [evidence](search) from [text](text) student
    - [student](student) would help into little [more](expand) detail about
    - [student](student) pull things together
    - [student](student) just need because drink water
    - [student](student) waters [moon](space) that's convincing [evidence](search) valuable just rework  answer
    - [student](student) long answer what  answer
    - [student](student) just [water](space) split into parts hydrogen [oxygen](space) because allows people breathe make rocket fuel
    - [student](student) just need just hydrogen used rocket fuel [oxygen](space) help people breathe just need little  answer
    - [student](student) just need little [more](expand) just idea
    - [student](student) lost train thought just explain little [more](expand) think going able useful just because they're smaller amounts okay
    - [student](student) look [tool](tool) inside [text](text) because every time story reading questions about answers always going [passage](text) okay
    - [student](student) there place [text](text) mentions what hydrogen [oxygen](space) used
    - [student](student) exactly exactly [more](expand) detail better  answer
    - [student](student) lunar [orbiter](space) right [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) think could clarified  answer
    - [student](student) take little answer make great answer make make [more](expand) sense make concrete
    - [student](student) about restate question form answer
    - answer grows yeah really short [word](text) answer created whole sentence where anybody reading answer identify what talking about what learning about
    - [student](student) make  answer very clear clarify
    - [student](student) misconceptions
    - [student](student) just write down questions then [word](text)  paper  ipad just rearrange restate question
    - [student](student) when answering questions probably should refer back reading given [find](search) answers need
    - [student](student) would answer convince [water](space) valuable could valuable moon
    - [student](student) perhaps could [word](text) d saying [water](space) valuable could valuable
    - [student](student) very specific answer because specific name text
    - [student](student) student wrote [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) that's very good maybe need [investigate](search) [look](search) little [further](expand) what [machine](tool) called
    - [student](student) strategy could work together student help figure what could okay what strategy [look](search) back [text](text) know where [look](search) text
    - [student](student) good  right broken down into hydrogen [oxygen](space) little [further](expand) answer also [find](search) what broken down [oxygen](space) hydrogen along  evidence
    - [student](student) right maybe include  answer microscope
    - [student](student) looking [more](expand) specifically want [find](search) exact name [machine](tool) kind able explain what [machine](tool)  answer right just wanted some [more](expand) detail
    - [student](student) when [look](search) ng answer want [look](search) details will tell [water](space) going valuable
    - [student](student) want give like question think valuable  details together valuable because surviving
    - [student](student) rocket fuel split apart
    - [student](student) maybe also [passage](text) remember  reading [passage](text) help figure would valuable
    - [student](student) yeah that's what student said said could useful because broken down could extended answer little [more](expand) said what valuable about breaking down
    - [student](student) said what valuable about breaking down
    - [student](student) that's only thing would done
    - [student](student) suggest write even though almost same 
    - [student](student) friends would like know understanding what  reading write down  [word](text) thank
    - [student](student) important make sure read [information](text) before answer question
    - [student](student) look [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) what small [machine](tool) called want turn somebody next
    - [student](student) really important when answering questions even though [found](search) part question stem  answer  [look](search) around make sure that's total
    - [student](student)  answer [nasa](space) send small [machine](tool)  right small [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) [orbiter](space)  answer almost there just need little [more](expand) [information](text) okay
    - [student](student) yeah sometimes works sometimes [look](search) around small [machine](tool) small [machine](tool) answer question because also small [machine](tool) what
    - exactly because whenever explanation whatever [evidence](search) from [article](text) sentence [evidence](search) [sentences](text) explanation describe [student](student)
    - [student](student) right name [machine](tool) give specific details
    - [student](student) name
    - [student](student) always [look](search) back [text](text) refer when trying [find](search) answers
    - okay [look](search) ke [word](text) [equipment](tool) [find](search) [text](text) where talks about type [equipment](tool) could [machine](tool) [word](text) like [machine](tool) [tool](tool) anybody [find](search) where says [machine](tool) [tool](tool) anyone [find](search) [text](text) [student](student)
    - [student](student)  teacher people know like fewer
    - [student](student) need restate question answers
    - [student](student)  right [equipment](tool) that's reason need very specific answer isn't
    - [student](student) when restate question kind take some some some [word](text) from question  answer
    - [student](student) equipment [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) gives reader [more](expand) [information](text) know nothing about topic helps learn [more](expand) about doesn't
    - quite details yeah yeah guys want some [more](expand) details others definitely make sure details
    - [student](student) whenever [look](search) ng [passage](text) really want focus [text](text) al [evidence](search) [text](text) al [evidence](search) when question refer back  [passage](text) [find](search) exact answer close possible
    - [student](student)  right [nasa](space) [equipment](tool) just very specific identifying which [equipment](tool) make sense
    - [student](student) always want prove  answer always know right
    - possibly guys understand important [text](text) [evidence](search) help answer  questions [more](expand) importantly justify  answers
    - [student](student) want detailed possible when answer questions [information](text) need response
    - [student](student) well answers kind what just went over some [text](text) [support](search) ng details prove answer what
    - [student](student) when talked about could break down into hydrogen [oxygen](space) talked about makes  [water](space) valuable
    - [student](student) another when talked about being heavy carry also makes very valuable [moon](space) don't carry
    - want make sure answering question fully descriptively possible help better explain [student](student)
    - [student](student) correct make sure answer question when answer  question make sure  details
    - [student](student) should [look](search) ng something [more](expand) specific what small [machine](tool) called would [more](expand) solid answer just small [machine](tool) when  reading says what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) should name machine
    - [student](student) looking specific question says what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) could should name machine
    - [student](student) correct response like just just conversation someone like super excited about [moon](space) asked what kind [machine](tool) [discover](search) [water](space) then  answer should [more](expand) specific answer  conversation like would name [machine](tool) tell used that's kind answer should [look](search) ng answering
    - [student](student) answer  conversation like would name [machine](tool) tell used that's kind answer should [look](search) ng answering attacks
    - [student](student) text informative [text](text) list some [machine](tool) says names [machine](tool) right before talk about [discover](search) okay would [more](expand) solid answer
    - [student](student) answers question better okay
    - [student](student) know  [found](search) piece [equipment](tool) used little [more](expand) specific here
    - [student](student) next time when asked question instead saying answered like student neighbor make sure write answer instead saying [found](search) same thing friend want hear what found
    - [student](student) well always good detail answers [more](expand) detail provide answer better stronger answer
    - [student](student) think could wrote answer differently include question
    - [student](student)  answer incorrect because third [paragraph](text) states exactly what said maybe [add](expand) ng exactly what they're [look](search) ng also help  other friends maybe  working partners
    - [student](student) that's only thing would  what correct  teacher want little [more](expand) specific could just name actual [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) [orbiter](space)  very just little [more](expand) specific
    - [student](student) yeah want specific [evidence](search) from reading want [pull](search) straight shows [found](search) answer question student thing think will help really [pull](search) answer what  reading
    - [student](student) thing think will help really [pull](search) answer what  reading
    - [student](student) instead just agreeing student maybe think about agree student what [pick](search) d agree could still agree student then tell reason agree
    - yeah okay rewrote answers might minute ahead think about might agree [student](student)
    - [student](student) need help getting started could [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) used [discover](search) [water](space) what then write  response
    - [student](student) little [more](expand) spits specific naming what machine
    - alright [student](student) want make sure going back [text](text) [find](search) answer
    - [student](student) what sort wondering could little [more](expand) specific perhaps identifying what small [machine](tool) could possibly little [more](expand) specific would then know want choose perhaps [lunar](space) orbiter
    - [student](student) little [more](expand) specific would then know want choose perhaps [lunar](space) orbiter
    - [student](student) able [look](search) idea answer [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) would little [more](expand) specific
    - [student](student) think back into [text](text) [look](search) mention [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) used [underline](action) could then build  answer we'd complete full answer question
    - [student](student) usually best when answer question just stick question save extra [information](text) discussions like when right
    - [student](student) think could little [more](expand) specific response because there lots small [machine](tool) world right
    - [student](student) back into [text](text) type small [machine](tool) sent give name when respond question being specific answer
    - [student](student)  answer said [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) would like tell little [more](expand) about small [machine](tool) [look](search) ng [text](text) what could [expand](expand) give [more](expand) details what small machine
    - [student](student) expand
    - [student](student) give [more](expand) details what small machine
    - [student](student) just would like build [more](expand) upon  answer
    - [student](student) don't starting know agree [lunar](space) orbiter
    - [student](student) whenever  opinion  opinion  opinion just what think always best face what think facts read
    - don't want opinion most time just something make because necessarily true [student](student)
    - [student](student) alright talk about what [found](search) what student [found](search) just maybe read just [look](search) ng what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [find](search) [water](space) talk about  self another student clue i've never read [text](text) i'll read  question know exactly what  talking about when answer
    - [student](student) talk about  self another student
    - [student](student) clue i've never read [text](text) i'll read  question know exactly what  talking about when answer
    - [student](student) what would helpful
    - [student](student) yeah tell something about what else what identifies machine
    - [student](student) yeah  name probably [machine](tool) name well
    - [student](student) just need make specific you'll ahead just make sure  bringing from text
    - [student](student) love when students make question alright [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) then into  answer
    - [student](student) what you'll example going restate question there convincing [evidence](search) [water](space) [moon](space) could valuable
    - [student](student) would there convinced  answering question  reciting question there convincing evidence
    - [student](student) sorry there convincing [evidence](search) [water](space) [moon](space) valuable there restated question answered question
    - [student](student) then would [text](text) what says [water](space) split into parts hydrogen [oxygen](space) then would explain that's important
    - [student](student) only thing would like just restate question
    - right could there enough [evidence](search) [water](space) [moon](space) guys then   saying  just also bringing question into
    - [student](student) then need [evidence](search) [support](search)  answer then [found](search) [evidence](search) from number that's perfect just provide [evidence](search) then explain
    - [student](student) found [evidence](search) from number that's perfect just provide [evidence](search) then explain
    - [student](student) yeah that's good train thought we'll just restate question answer question
    - [student](student) would need [more](expand) [evidence](search)  [evidence](search) bringing [water](space) [moon](space) hard would also talk about [water](space) [moon](space) would good
    - [student](student) find
    - [student](student) best place start [word](text) question then going back [headings](text) [look](search) underneath heading answer
    - yeah  y'all figure going [oxygen](space) going hydrogen okay y'all talk about minute know just second okay
    - okay heard think about [text](text) though okay  [student](student)  question  hand just second
    - [student](student) correct want [more](expand) specific good answer could said [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) student right track
    - [student](student) then [more](expand) specific answer could name what [machine](tool) called
    - [student](student) talk about  answers could improved answers [more](expand) specific
    - question using [word](text) guys [underline](action) ke [word](text)
    - [student](student) student said [scientist](role) [equipment](tool) like [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) could [more](expand) specific passage
    - [student](student) okay need [more](expand) specific when answering questions
    - want guys [look](search) answer question want read over  answer want think  self could [more](expand) specific when answering question
    - [student](student)  right [nasa](space) send small [machine](tool) give [more](expand) specific best answer could [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) gave name
    - [student](student) looking something specific that's when would want refer back [text](text) when says what [equipment](tool) [scientist](role) [discover](search) [water](space) [moon](space) when would want [look](search) back into [text](text) [find](search)  answer because already know various [tool](tool) like said mask
    - [student](student) when would want [look](search) back into [text](text) [find](search)  answer because already know various [tool](tool) like said mask
    - [student](student) microscope stuff like then there's specific [tool](tool) states [text](text) would want [look](search) back [text](text) [find](search)  answer
    - [student](student) just want little deeper into [text](text) maybe help  fellow students figure some [more](expand) details about what [nasa](space) [find](search) [water](space) moon
    - want help each other understand [text](text) know [word](text) everybody thinks want guys reconstruct  answer give little [more](expand) detail about [equipment](tool) specifically helped [discover](search) water
    - thing help future answer question teaching about question somebody reading [passage](text) just like guys would best explain would full picture what guys reading
    - [student](student) sure also remind teaching even from  perspective student answer question then give little [more](expand) detail  answer will help [more](expand) concrete answer
    - [student](student) because must always refer text
    - [student](student) detail just [add](expand) d critical that's valuable fact when break down [oxygen](space) hydrogen [astronaut](role) breathe [oxygen](space) oxygen hydrogen fuel second part just gave that's valuable that's great answer
    - [student](student) second part just gave that's valuable that's great answer
    - [student](student)  first answer correct [add](expand) d detail kind gets even [more](expand) valuable what mentioned
    - [student](student) well question asked according [text](text) what [text](text) answer questions [find](search) [evidence](search) might right from what know from  going [nasa](space) [text](text) order answer question
    - [student](student) yeah want [look](search) back story make sure  answering whole question stories like  friend want keep [look](search) ng back  answers
    - then [student](student) really liked  answer also thinking about [microscope](tool) would loved give another example maybe [add](expand) d mars venus thought definitely like  answer
    - [student](student) understand maybe next time same idea someone could just little [more](expand) felt like didn't wanted bring
    - [student](student) could like bring example
    - they're using [microscope](tool) like when  reading [text](text) think they're using [microscope](tool) think helped [find](search) [crater](space) think made easier [look](search) [water](space) [moon](space) just  thought process [student](student)
    - [student](student) would loved just said what [machine](tool) just talked [more](expand) about what machine
    - [student](student) just said what [machine](tool) just talked [more](expand) about what machine
    - [student](student) what could saying [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) called [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) just like said previously then kind
    - [student](student) what's going moon
    - [student](student) might slip through cracks just very keep simple like [nasa](space) said [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) investigate
    - [student](student) yeah like should fill blanks just make sentence little meteor
    - [student](student) okay always rephrase  sentence [nasa](space) sent little over there know  using [information](text) that's [text](text) sound good
    - [student](student) always write even [scientist](role) microscope
    - [student](student) sometimes there still things small cannot better
    - [student](student) just want little [further](expand)  explanation some [evidence](search) from what read about
    - [student](student) just want  answer little [more](expand) specific sometimes mean writing [more](expand) stuff
    - [student](student) when  answering discussion questions [text](text) read just incorporate something specifically from [text](text) text mentions [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) would good thing include  response [add](expand) tion what said about [find](search) ng [crater](space) [water](space) they're like [suits](space) [masks](space) [oxygen](space) tanks
    - [student](student) something specifically from [text](text) text mentions [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) would good thing include  response [add](expand) tion what said about [find](search) ng [crater](space) [water](space) they're like [suits](space) [masks](space) [oxygen](space) [tanks](space) make sense
    - [student](student) yeah really good answer  definitely correct want [elaborate](expand) little [more](expand) [nasa](space) sent small [machine](tool) what small [machine](tool) called
    - [student](student) right when term [lunar](space) [orbiter](space) using [evidence](search) [support](search) response that's something want make sure  because shows
    - [student](student) also want make sure when  answering question  specifically using [evidence](search) examples [text](text) gives
    - [student](student) awesome make connections  background knowledge order answer question want make sure comes from text
    - [student](student) however when [look](search) question asks what [equipment](tool) [found](search) [crater](space) [water](space) would similar student where just want make sure  using specific piece [evidence](search) [support](search) what said when said there's [crater](space) water
    - [student](student) what could  response could [add](expand) d something like another [article](text) read said there could base [moon](space) then connect [article](text) reading idea could
    - [student](student) pretty good would maybe just little about like said they're carrying [water](space) ships an [more](expand) because they're keeping base they're going build moon
