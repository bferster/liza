1,Teacher,110.1,"Okay, let me let me talk with STUDENT for just a moment and I'll come back to you.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,"Okay, STUDENT. Let's hold on just a second. Keep your thoughts, just for a moment. Let's, STUDENT, let's go back to each for just a minute. Tell me about your answer.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,There you go.,,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,Gotcha. Okay. Thank you for clarifying that.,,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,"Okay, that is the name of the small machine.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,There you go. Very good. That is correct. So that is the answer that we're looking for. STUDENT. Thank you.,,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,"There you go. There's something small that they're looking at, it is the water. Good job.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,"Correct. I would, I would agree with that. ",,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,That's a good answer. ,,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,I think you're correct. Absolutely. Great job.,,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,Absolutely. Thank you for sharing now,,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,Phenomenal. That's good. That's good. I'm proud of you,,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,"You're close, but not quite there.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,You're almost there.,,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,"Oh good. Good job. Great job. All of you guys, I appreciate all of you guys volunteered to read, and you've all done a very good job. ",,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,"STUDENT, you said.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.1,"Teacher: Okay so STUDENT, you said in one of your responses that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.2,"Well, it definitely helped them because you know in space there's not a lot of oxygen. So, you have to have those tanks to help you breathe. So that was one equipment that they did use. [Text does not discuss tanks or humans going to the moon.]",,,,
1,Teacher,110.2,"You guys said they use a scientific tool called a microscope, which answers the question. Right? [The lunar orbiter is the correct answer.]",,,,
1,Teacher,110.2,"Okay, so that could be one use of water.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.2,I didn't say your answer was wrong.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.2,"Your answer is not wrong, it's right, and there's another piece of equipment too.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.2,Yeah", they looked at it really close with the microscope. So, you weren't exactly wrong. Um, so yeah, good job.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.3,So always remember that you have a lot of experience.,,,,
1,Teacher,110.3,"Yeah, that's great. That's a great connection. How neat that you've been to NASA before I love that.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.3,"Yeah, well, we always have a good background knowledge of space. And that's really cool that you're interested in it.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.3,"I bet STUDENT could confirm that about his dad probably has told him too, right STUDENT?",,,,
1,Teacher,110.3,"Well, that's awesome. So maybe you can help us teach others since you know.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.3,"I'm sure they do, and I bet that STUDENT could probably tell you more and you can share that information together.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.3,"Well you know what, because you do know a lot and that means you can help the rest of us out that don't know as much as you.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.3,"Good. So sometimes if you already know something, I think we can always learn more about it. Or maybe you could see if your classmates, maybe they don't know it, and they need your help.",,,,
1,Teacher,110.4,So the machine was the Lunar Orbiter. So why don't you go ahead and circle that and then I'm going to come back to you in just a moment.,,,,
1,Teacher,110.4,Mhmm. It's the lunar orbiter that they sent to look for the water.,,,,
1,Teacher,110.4,It is very heavy. Going back to your first statement so transporting it would be something that we would have to do.,,,,
1,Teacher,120.1,Is that all they used?,,,,
1,Teacher,120.1,Does that seem right to everyone?,,,,
1,Teacher,120.1,Good. Okay. So I want you to read over that for a minute and see if anything sticks out that is believable is it convincing that water is a valuable resource. Okay. So take a minute to do that.,,,,
1,Teacher,120.1,"Teacher: Yeah, and STUDENT, you also hit on that to do you have a question or a comment you wanted to add",,,,
1,Teacher,120.2,"All right, so STUDENT , the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?",,,,
1,Teacher,120.2,We're trying to figure out what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon?,,,,
1,Teacher,120.2,Does it say anything about the equipment that they used?,,,,
1,Teacher,120.2," Oh, no, no, it talks about the craters not the equipment",,,,
1,Teacher,120.2,So we need to find the equipment that they used,,,,
1,Teacher,120.3,"So, can one of you, would one of you like to volunteer to read the first paragraph?",,,,
1,Teacher,120.3,"Okay. Would you like STUDENT , would you like to read the second paragraph?",,,,
1,Teacher,120.3,"So, if you all would look at paragraph two, it has a two labeled.",,,,
1,Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so everybody look at your paper. Let's look at paragraph two. STUDENT, can you just read that for me again?",,,,
1,Teacher,120.3,Will you read it one more time for me?,,,,
1,Teacher,120.3,"So um, STUDENT  or STUDENT, are any of you ready to dig deeper in the text and tell me another answer?",,,,
1,Teacher,120.3,Look again at the text and see if you can find a better answer.,,,,
1,Teacher,120.3,"And STUDENT , can you please read the question again?",,,,
1,Teacher,120.3,"And again, STUDENT, what was the question?",,,,
1,Teacher,120.3,"STUDENT, take a look at the question for me.",,,,
1,Teacher,120.3,"Paragraph two, I'm going to read and I want you to follow along. It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. OK, now I'm going to stop there.",,,,
1,Teacher,120.4,STUDENT . Would you remind me of your answer again?,,,,
1,Teacher,120.4,"STUDENT, what are you thinking about the question?",,,,
1,Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so what is your answer to the discussion question?",,,,
1,Teacher,120.4,Okay. Does anyone want to raise their hand and tell me what they think the action word is?,,,,
1,Teacher,130.1,So a scientific tool called the microscope is a correct answer for looking at the water. ,,,,
1,Teacher,130.1,You've got a piece of it. ,,,,
1,Teacher,130.1,They used the lunar orbiter and the microscope to find the craters full of water.,,,,
1,Teacher,130.1,You're both partially right.They used a small machine  to investigate craters and a microscopeto look closely at the water.,,,,
1,Teacher,130.2,"I wonder, maybe STUDENT can help us out because I sent him on this mission to find this answer.",,,,
1,Teacher,130.2,"STUDENT, I want you to find the name of the machine for us.",,,,
1,Teacher,130.2,"STUDENT , can you explain what discover means?",,,,
1,Teacher,130.2,"She said a microscope is used to see things that are really small. Why do you think the scientists would need to use the microscope to see the water? Yes, Dev?",,,,
1,Teacher,130.2,"Right, so that's why I was looking at STUDENT's answer. And she said, NASA sent a small machine. And what else could she have put instead of just a small machine?",,,,
1,Teacher,130.2,Would anyone else like to build on his response?,,,,
1,Teacher,130.2,"Right, you find something. Do you agree with that everybody?",,,,
1,Teacher,130.2,"Very good, STUDENT. Does everybody else agree with her answer?",,,,
1,Teacher,130.2,"STUDENT , would you agree with what STUDENT said?",,,,
1,Teacher,130.2,Or did anyone else find anything different?,,,,
1,Teacher,130.2,With a partner read the text again and see if you can find the answer.,,,,
1,Teacher,130.2,Work in small groups to compare your answers.,,,,
1,Teacher,130.3,"So, they wouldn't exactly be using their tanks and their masks to find the water on the moon. That's just part of their work uniform and protective clothing.",,,,
1,Teacher,130.3,"In the first sentence, it actually says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. So, this is the machine that actually went and explored.",,,,
1,Teacher,130.3,They didn't really use a microscope to find the water. The water was located underneath the ground.,,,,
1,Teacher,130.3,"So, to make our answer better, we could say NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
1,Teacher,130.3,"Discover is when we find it. So we have to find it first. And we're going to use the Lunar Orbiter to find it before we can look at it. So, do you understand how we could improve your answer?",,,,
1,Teacher,130.3,"Okay. Well, if we look back in the number three it says, that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic. So the water is very small.",,,,
1,Teacher,130.3,"But I do think based on paragraph five, whenever it talks about using the oxygen in the hydrogen and breaking it up to use it for a different things. I think that is very valuable.",,,,
1,Teacher,140.1,"STUDENT , you went to NASA? How was that?",,,,
1,Teacher,140.1,"That's really good. Well, it sounds exciting. Did you enjoy yourself and NASA?",,,,
1,Teacher,140.1,"STUDENT, so what do you know about space?",,,,
1,Teacher,140.1,Did you like using the microscope in science class?,,,,
1,Teacher,140.1,"Okay. When you deposit something, how much do you deposit? Do you have to deposit a really large piece of something or smaller pieces? [The conversation then leads to talking about deposits in a bank, but no explicit connection to ice deposits.]",,,,
1,Teacher,140.1,"Now we're not scientist and we're not astronauts and there's some things that we do know. But right now, you every one of your student at school, right. So what's an equipment you have right now. Thats helping you with your work, STUDENT .",,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,That make sense?,,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,Does anyone else have questions?,,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,You guys see that?,,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,Does that make a little bit more sense?,,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,Is there anything else I can do to clear this up for you guys?,,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,"Can you give me a thumbs up if you agree. A thumbs in the middle. If you're not quite sure, or thumbs down if you disagree.",,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,"STUDENT, what else do you think?",,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,That make sense?,,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,Does anyone else have questions?,,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,You guys see that?,,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,Does that make a little bit more sense?,,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,Is there anything else I can do to clear this up for you guys?,,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,"Can you give me a thumbs up if you agree. A thumbs in the middle. If you're not quite sure, or thumbs down if you disagree.",,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,"STUDENT, what else do you think?",,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,"Teacher: That'd be a great strategy to use Dev, do you agree with STUDENT  strategy. Is that something you could use too?",,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,So then that is why sometimes when we're looking at questions we got to be really careful because sometimes they'll try to trick you.,,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,"Right, it can be a little confusing if you don't read over it carefully. Huh.",,,,
1,Teacher,150.1," But can you look back in the reading and can you tell me what it says about that because I think if we use our brain just for a little bit and we read that reading, you're going to have all those same answers about the water too.",,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,"Okay, well, we're just going to work on making sure we have the best answer for the question.",,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,"Well, STUDENT. That's great. That's you feel like you know everything that there is to know about space, but there is always more that we can learn and maybe by listening to our friend'sfriends answer is we can learn even more.",,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,"Well, guess what we're going to learn some new things today. You might find something that you didn't know.",,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,"Yeah, well, we always have a good background knowledge of space. And that's really cool that you're interested in it, but we can always learn new names for machinery and things like that. So that's why we read this passage together in hopes that you would learn more.",,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,The small group purpose is to dig a little deeper and get a better understanding of the texts that we're reading.,,,,
1,Teacher,150.1,There are a couple other of your friends that are needing a little bit help with the guidance of where to find their answers.,,,,
1,Teacher,210.1,"Well, it's expensive to send people to the moon all of the time. So, sometimes NASA sends machines to do the exploring in space.",,,,
1,Teacher,210.1,"Part of the reason scientists are so interested in finding water on other planets is because we living things need water to survive. If we can find water on other planets, it could mean that life, like plants or animals, once lived there. It could even mean that humans have a chance of surviving there.",,,,
1,Teacher,210.2,"Yeah, that's a good point that you do need oxygen tanks whenever you're in outer space, but we're talking about the different pieces of equipment that you need to be able to see what's on the moon.",,,,
1,Teacher,210.2,Right. So the question is asking us what type of equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon. So what type of equipment did they have to have in order-- if it was there to find water?,,,,
1,Teacher,210.2,"What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?  That would be your question. So that question didn't ask anything about what they found, just what they used to find it.",,,,
1,Teacher,210.2,"Exactly right. So, was the question I asked you, what did they used to look at it, or what do they use to find it?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.2,"So, we need to find the equipment that they used.",,,,
1,Teacher,210.2,Do you know what the word convincing means?,,,,
1,Teacher,210.2,"You're right. Equipment and tools, the equipment is another word for a tool. So, when we have something that's the same word for a tool, we would call it a synonym. So, they're synonyms of each other.",,,,
1,Teacher,210.2,"Alright. Is there anybody who wants to share the answer with us? What is, what does the word equipment mean?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.2,"So, we are looking for the one that was used to discover, or to find. So, can you think of, can you see another equipment that was mentioned in the passage, apart from the microscope?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.2,"We're trying to discover it. We're not trying to look at it, STUDENT , did you have something to tell me [ does more than repeats the student response - adds explanation]",,,,
1,Teacher,210.2,So you have to find the water before you can look at it right. Does anyone know what discover means?,,,,
1,Teacher,210.3,"There's still something missing in your answer. Remember, that NASA can't always send astronauts to space and may need to send machines sometimes.",,,,
1,Teacher,210.3,"Well, yeah. What else could you have put in your answer instead of just saying a small machine?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.3,"How could you have made that more in depth, answered it more in depth?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.3,But a small machine--that could be anything. Couldn't it?,,,,
1,Teacher,210.3,"So I see that we have. Let's look at back at some of our answers. So I see that we looked at our question what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. So I see we have our answers are a microscope, A small machine, and then we have some other equipment. Which answer makes the most sense as to what would be found on the moon STUDENT ?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.3,"Oh, that would be interesting. But do they have. Do they have oxygen on the moon outside of what's in the water?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.3,"As a, as the teacher, you know, if you want to put yourself in my position a little bit when I see response like that. It's hard for me to know what you meant.",,,,
1,Teacher,210.3,"STUDENT, did you find any evidence when you were looking to answer that different question?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,"As it says in paragraph two, the machine was called a lunar orbiter. So a scientific tool called the microscope can be used to look at the water, but not for the scientists to actually discover water on the moon.",,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,This paragraph tells us that the moon is drier than a desert. That means that there's even less water on the moon than on deserts on Earth.,,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,"The text states that the deposits are microscopic, which tells us that the ice is so small you can't see it without special equipment like a microscope.",,,,
1,Teacher,210.4," So, STUDENT , can you go down to paragraph six and paragraph six. It talks about maybe the amount of time that it would take and kind of like what it would look like before we were able to get water on the moon or from the moon.",,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,Let's look back in the text and see if we can find the answer to our question.,,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,"Okay, that's what polar craters mean. Polar means the poles, the North and the South. So what is the main idea of this section? What is, for informational texts, what is the main idea? What is the target they want you to know?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,So according to that. Do we think that people were actually on the moon at that time? Or did they just send that machine called the lunar Lunar Orbiter?,,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,So where did they find the water?,,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,"There you go. Okay, so Dev, where were they finding this water?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,Why do you think a scientist would need a microscope to see the water?,,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,And we were looking at paragraph two moments ago to specifically answer that question. So what was the name of the small machine that NASA sent to investigate?,,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,That's right. What  word that starts with an lunar what?,,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,So do you think the Lunar Orbiter was able to see the ice deposits or how do you think the lunar orbiter was able to find the ice deposits?,,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,"Yes, that is what they sent. And STUDENT , what did they investigate when they got there?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,"Um, so does anybody remember what the name of that machine was called?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,"STUDENT, do you remember the name?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,"Well, let's think about it this way, STUDENT, could you look very closely at the water molecules without the microscope?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,Let's stop for a second. And what did that first paragraph tell us? Do you know?,,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,Okay. Can someone paraphrase that paragraph for me?,,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,"Let's go back to paragraph two, once more. It does say NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. What do you think the word investigate means?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,"If you're going to investigate something what-- STUDENT, what do you think?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,Do you think that the moon is wet? Or did the text say that the moon is very dry?,,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,Can you find the paragraph where the microscope is used?,,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,"Um, so, STUDENT, can you give me another example of equipment, maybe something from that article that we just read that you know that NASA is using in space?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,"And I noticed STUDENT said that NASA sent a small machine. So STUDENT, can you look back in the text and recall what was the name of that small machine that NASA sent?",,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,Can you find any other kinds of equipment in the text?,,,,
1,Teacher,210.4,it's like -have you all seen frost in the wintertime or in the fall? Have you seen frost on your mom's car windows or the grass? Frost is a thin layer of ice - imagine particles similar to bits of frost. So the Lunar Orbiter found tiny ice deposits in craters on the moon. ,,,,
1,Teacher,220.1,We're just talking about how we found the answers and what we can use to help us find answers when we when we have questions like this,,,,
1,Teacher,220.1,Today we're going to think through how to use the text when we're responding to questions like this one - we can't just rely on our background knowledge. ,,,,
1,Teacher,220.1,I'm going to show you guys how to find important words in the question that will direct us to the answer we need.,,,,
1,Teacher,230.1,"So, you say a small machine. What specific small machine do you think you were talking about there?",,,,
1,Teacher,230.1,"All right, you mentioned oxygen tanks. Why did you mention oxygen tanks?",,,,
1,Teacher,230.1,Why do you say that?,,,,
1,Teacher,230.1,Can you tell me more?,,,,
1,Teacher,230.1,And how did you gather that information?,,,,
1,Teacher,230.1,"STUDENT, you mentioned a scientist likes to use a lot of equipment. Right?",,,,
1,Teacher,230.1,How did you know that water's heavy?,,,,
1,Teacher,230.1,"Okay, that's very interesting. So, you know, just like your answer said, and it said, water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. Is that something that your dad needs a lot of as an astronaut?",,,,
1,Teacher,230.1,Okay so water being able to be split into two parts. Do you think that that is part of what makes it valuable to NASA and people maybe like your father?,,,,
1,Teacher,230.2,All right. Where in the text did you see that?,,,,
1,Teacher,230.2,What did you read in the text that led you to that answer?,,,,
1,Teacher,230.2,What paragraph did you look at to find your answer?,,,,
1,Teacher,230.2,"Did you find that in paragraph two, the one we just read?",,,,
1,Teacher,230.2,"And what makes you think that way. STUDENT  based on our passage, what makes you think that the evidence is not convincing.",,,,
1,Teacher,230.3,"So, STUDENT , you're saying that the microscope discovered water on the moon? Is that right?",,,,
1,Teacher,230.3,"Dev, you think that the microscope was the tool that was used to discover water on the moon, but STUDENT, you say it was the small machine. Am I understanding this correctly?",,,,
1,Teacher,230.3,"Okay, STUDENT  and STUDENT both agree that it was the microscope. Right?",,,,
1,Teacher,230.3,"So what I'm hearing is, there were craters full of water on the moon?",,,,
1,Teacher,230.3,"Did you tell me that our plants need water to survive, is that correct?",,,,
1,Teacher,230.3,"Now, STUDENT , and STUDENT you guys mentioned that during our discussion that the technology might not be ready for that yet but however there are some possibilities that we can use water.",,,,
1,Teacher,230.3,"So I noticed that, um, several of you, STUDENT , Dev, and STUDENT you all answered the question by saying yes or no at the beginning.",,,,
1,Teacher,230.3,It is very heavy. Going back to your first statement so transporting it would be something that we would have to do.,,,,
1,Teacher,230.3,Also you pointed out that it would take them a while to make that plan.,,,,
1,Teacher,230.3,It is very heavy. Going back to your first statement so transporting it would be something that we would have to do.,,,,
1,Teacher,310.1,"I love that you cited where you found it in the text, paragraph 2.",,,,
1,Teacher,310.1,"That's very good. I like how STUDENT was able to tell me exactly where she found her answer and STUDENT  and STUDENT that's more of what I would be looking for when you try to respond. Again, I like how she's very specific. She used the passage that we provided to find her answer. She didn't just use her background knowledge, she made sure to go back and find something in the text.",,,,
1,Teacher,310.1,You used your background knowledge about buried treasures to answer my question,,,,
1,Teacher,310.1,"Yes, I agree. And I like how you told me specific things from the paragraph to help support your answer.",,,,
1,Teacher,310.1,That's a good question. [The question is actually a good question],,,,
1,Teacher,310.1,I see how you got to that answer. ,,,,
1,Teacher,310.1,I see what you're thinking! ,,,,
1,Teacher,410.1,"It seems that there is a misunderstanding about the question here. You are interpreting the question to mean that scientists went to the moon with equipment, but the question is only asking what equipment was used to discover water on the moon. It isn�t telling us that scientists went.",,,,
1,Teacher,410.1,"So your answer could be improved with a little bit of clarity. If we were more, a little more specific, I should say. So you say a small machine, what specific small machine do you think you were talking about there?",,,,
1,Teacher,410.2,"But for this one, the answer wasn't quite there because we needed to focus more on that equipment than what the equipment was finding.",,,,
1,Teacher,410.2,"Well, you didn't say the type of equipment that they used to discover water, you said that they sent a small machine and they did send a small machine, but there's a certain type of equipment that they use to find the water.",,,,
1,Teacher,410.3,"True, scientists found ice deposits, but there is a piece missing. The text does not say that the ice deposits were large. It uses a specific word to describe the size of the ice deposits",,,,
1,Teacher,420.1,"When we're answering these questions, we really read, and we really try to figure out what does this question want from me?",,,,
1,Teacher,420.1,"Before we reread the text, I want you to tell me what the key words are in the question because these keywords are going to be the focus of your reading.",,,,
1,Teacher,420.1,Find the verb or action word in the question and underline the action word,,,,
1,Teacher,420.2,"So, by saying the name of the machine instead of saying a small machine you allow whoever reads that response to know exactly what you're talking about. So, please add in the name of the machine to your response. [Strategy and action step]",,,,
1,Teacher,420.2,"As far as what type of equipment scientists used to discover the water on the moon, it has a specific name. So, it's always very important to read everything in the question and text before answering the question. [Thinking strategy]",,,,
1,Teacher,420.2,"A question relates to the passage. So, when it says equipment in the question, what we want to do is to find the equipment that was mentioned in the passage. [Strategy]",,,,
1,Teacher,420.2,So next time. How about we try. We'll start with either a strong either yes or no and then like you did just now will back it up with some evidence. Does that sound good?,,,,
1,Teacher,420.2,So the next time you're answering your question. What's something you can do when you're answering besides just saying no.,,,,
1,Teacher,420.3,"To use context clues, you look at the text around a word or phrase to understand what that word or phrase means. ",,,,
1,Teacher,420.3,"Okay, STUDENT , I would like you to look back over the passage, and I would like for you to underline where the word scientists appear and what they're using to find the water.",,,,
1,Teacher,420.3,"So, let's take a step back and see what sort of equipment we see mentioned specifically in paragraph two.",,,,
1,Teacher,420.3,"Look at paragraph two, to see if there was a special machine that they brought to investigate the water on the moon.",,,,
1,Teacher,420.3,Now let's let's go a little further back on our texts and see if we can maybe go a little deeper into how they originally discovered it. Okay. Would you like to maybe give it another go.,,,,
1,Teacher,430.1,"STUDENT , you successfully identified a type of equipment from the passage, but your answer does not match one of the key words in the question which is discover.",,,,
1,Teacher,430.1," By looking for words in the text similar to discover, such as 'investigate,' you could find a better answer that suits the whole question instead of just part of it.",,,,
1,Teacher,430.1,"I am concerned that the question is asking - What equipment -so, I would expect to hear the name of the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon in your response. ",,,,
1,Teacher,430.1,I would recommend rereading the text looking for the specific name of the equipment used to discover or find the water. ,,,,
1,Teacher,430.1,Can you tell me what you heard was my concern with your current response and suggestion for your next step?,,,,
1,Teacher,430.2,"STUDENT says that NASA sent a small machine. And that was right too. But that was not enough for that question. They sent a small machine, but you have to look for a better word to answer that question.",,,,
1,Teacher,430.2,"And, STUDENT, NASA sent out a small machine, but we need to be specific. I would love it if you could tell me a little bit more about what that machine is. I'm looking for the specific name and it starts with the letter L, if that's helpful. You can look back in your reading for that.",,,,
1,Teacher,430.2,"That's very good. That's very good. So right both a small machine and a lunar orbiter would be correct. But if I was only reading the answers to this specific question, I might not have the context and know that So by saying lunar orbiter instead of a small machine you allow whoever reads that response to know exactly what you're talking about.",,,,
1,Teacher,430.2,"So what you just did there where you explained it further and how you said yes it could be used for that. You just gave that to me verbally, but as far as your actual response to the question where you just told me about how it can be split into hydrogen and oxygen. Do you think that maybe next time, next time when we respond to a question like that, we can bake in some of what you just said. But we can put it on text in the response.",,,,
1,Teacher,430.3,"Scientists can use a microscope to look closely at water, but they had to use a more specific tool to look for the water first. To find what that tool was, let's go back to the text. I want you to highlight words that are equipment. Then read what it says about how scientists used that equipment.",,,,
1,Teacher,430.3,"Let's outline the sequence of events described in this text. First - what happened (student replies), Then ____. And then ______. So ___________. What was discovered on the moon? How was the water discovered? What was the name of the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon?",,,,
1,Teacher,510.1,A good strategy to help you find the best answer for comprehension questions is to look for the subject and the actions in the text that have the same meaning as those in the question. Let's try that by looking for synonyms for an action word - discover.,,,,
1,Teacher,510.1,"I heard you thinking in intellectually careful ways today. For example, when you checked for errors and looked for evidence. Can you remember a moment when your thinking was intellectually careful? (e.g. when you pointed out that the moon is a desert so craters were not full of water, or when you went back to the text to find out how much water was found)",,,,
1,Teacher,510.1,STUDENT  just identified the main idea by...,,,,
1,Teacher,510.1,"STUDENT just showed us how to use context clues. First, he",,,,
1,Teacher,520.1,Do you feel like you could try this strategy next time you encounter a tricky question like this?,,,,
1,Teacher,520.1,"Next time you have a similar question, what would you do first?",,,,
1,Teacher,520.1,If you are not sure what the question is asking or if you want to check your understanding of the question - then what can you do?,,,,
