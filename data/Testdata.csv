Teacher,110.2,"Your answer is not around, I think that there are multiple answers here right so we've identified one equipment you actually.",Your answer is not wrong. I think that there are multiple answers here. Right. so we've identified one equipment. you actually.,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Well that's The great thing this answer has multiple answers and sometimes you want to circle, as many as you can.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,I didn't say it was wrong.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,You're all right.,,,,
Oliver,110.2,"Okay, um, but, but, but, but, okay. So, but I read it and it does say it such that they talk about the water in paragraph three",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"It is. It is, I didn't say it was wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"The only person Jazmin is the only person that said yes, that it was valuable and kind of told why she thought it was valuable.",,,,
Farrah,110.2,"Well, it's not wrong.",,,,
Chris,110.2,"Yes, they do.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay. Um, we definitely need oxygen. When we go to space, don't we, because we don't have oxygen up there like we do here.",,,,
Luis,110.2,Yeah. Scientists can't breathe the astronauts can't breathe out oxygen tank.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Your, your answer is not wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,You need a microscope to be able,,,,
Teacher,110.2,To see it.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,That is true. You could if there's enough water.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Well, Jazmin, don't think that your answer is wrong, sweetheart.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Your answer is not wrong, honey, you're, you're right.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Scientists found craters full of water on the moon, you are absolutely correct.",,,,
Chris,110.2,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Farrah I want to go back to your answer. You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. And that is very, very true,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So we're looking for equipment they definitely found craters full of water,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,I like the connection you made there. All right.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,Yes. Thank you. That's great. I'm so glad that you could clarify.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,That's right. So you weren't wrong at all.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"They would probably need a microscope, if they're going to test the water",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,But then why is my answer wrong?,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Orbiter. Good job. Okay. So you said. They said, a small machine and you're exactly right here.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,I don't. Your answer isn't wrong.,,,,
Farrah,110.2,But the teacher said that we're all here because we we needed to have a more complete response to the text and have a deeper understanding,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"You guys said they use the scientific tool called a microscope, which that's answering the question. Right?",,,,
Farrah,110.2,"Yeah yeah cuz a microscope is a tool, a scientific tool. So that's equipment.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,They do they use a lot of equipment don't they?,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Uh huh. Yeah, but there's usually in in this passage that you guys read I didn't see a lot of equipment that they used, but you are very, very right. That's a good connection Chris. Good job.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, so I've got a microscope really closely.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Your answer is not wrong. So, you, you're right, they did say that they used a microscope to look very closely. Okay. You're right about that.",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"That was Farrah's answer, mine was about the small machine. I thought that that was be the right answer.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Oh, right. So, it is a small machine that is correct.","Oh, right. So, it is a small machine. that is correct.",,,
Teacher,110.2,"Right. So if we go back and look in that text is that, so they did have to use all that equipment to get to space. You are correct.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Exactly. And I did. And that's in the text, very good for looking at the text and pulling that out. Awesome job.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,And Jazmin once look at yours and NASA send a small machine which you are correct about that as well.,"And Jazmin, once look at yours and NASA send a small machine, which you are correct about that as well.",,,
Teacher,110.2,"Exactly, exactly. So I think you the three of you, you read this question and you understood the text.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Right. And that is correct.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,That is the text very good for finding that pulling out all the texts Chris.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,I think what Chris Jazmin and Luis I think you guys you read the text and you understood the text.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Your answer is not wrong. Your answer is right because you were talking, your answer was especially talking about the equipment and you said that they need some microscope to look for water on the moon. So, you are right.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Very good. That's a very good answer.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yes and yes and actually they use oxygen and all the things that you say to be there in the moon to discover water. So yes, that's something really good to add Chris. Thank you. Oliver?",,,,
Oliver,110.2,"Um, yeah. So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to take a moment and thank you so much for working with us.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"And I see it's the microscope. Very good, very good. Um, are there any other equipment you noticed in there, other than the microscope?",,,,
Oliver,110.2,"Um, I'm not sure. Um, I have to read it through again. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Absolutely, absolutely. You guys seem to be hitting a lot of this.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"And I think Chris did really well in the kind of identifying a part of it that we haven't talked too much about and that's that. Oh, you know, they found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Um, and that was an important part of this, so very good job in identifying kind of like the main idea of the article we're reading. It's just the question might have been not necessarily trying to hit there, so Chris talk",,,,
Chris,110.2,"Yeah. Well, I went to NASA. And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit stuff.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Now, they discovered the water. You got that right on the nose.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,I would say that a lot better answers the question. And if we wanted to make sure it was perfect. We might include how those,,,,
Teacher,110.2,You got a lot closer there. I like the growth and I see that we're definitely getting closer there. So we're starting your sort of response with you need right,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Right, good. That's what I was trying to get out of you really want to look and be specific about what you're trying to look for when you respond to something right","Right, good. That's what I was trying to get out of, you really want to look and be specific about what you're trying to look for when you respond to something right?",,,
Teacher,110.2,"A small machine, right, perfect. What is that small machine called",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"Well, I guess if I look at it, like, it says like the lunar orbiter, right, that they sent up in space",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So you're both right. So, which is a good thing. That's great about working in groups. We all participate and contribute",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"So, am I like more right because I was saying about the Orbiter and like Farrah is like sort of right? But you know, I'm like wondering.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Right here where you couldn't because you wouldn't have the ability to look closely and Farrah good couldn't get it up to the moon without yours. So you're both right. You just didn't have the--,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Well, good. I liked your answers. Scientists found craters full of water on the moon. So they did using what they,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,You are absolutely correct errors and you are that is very valuable when you're talking about spacecraft because it takes a lot of force to get stuff up in the air. Right. And if you don't have the heavy water.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, and Jazmin. Your answer is not wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yes, Jazmin. So, earlier you asked you didn't understand why you were why your answer was wrong. Your answer was never wrong Jazmin's original answer was that scientist.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"That's a very good point. You would need something to help you find what they were looking for when they were looking for the water,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"I would like to see if Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon. And they did",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"No. Your answer was correct it, you do need the microscope in order to see things that are very, very small that are smaller than what you can see with your human eyes",,,,
Farrah,110.2,"Oh, okay, great.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"That's good. That's correct, yes. Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"I guess my question is, like, so if Farrah's answer is right like is my answer wrong, just like the small machine like is that not like is that not the thing that like you used to discover the water like I'm confused. Like if my answers wrong",,,,
Teacher,110.2,That's correct. They wouldn't need all that in order to protect them while they're in outer space or on the moon.,,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"So did they send the astronauts with the machine or did they just send the machine, Chris?",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Both of you are correct. On what machinery is needed to to locate and find and to be able to see the particles from the moon.,,,,
Farrah,110.2,"Okay, that makes sense.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,They're not necessarily wrong.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"But you had a really good answer, Jazmin. All of you had really good answers.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,There's nothing wrong with your answer.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,There you go. They could.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,A small machine that is correct.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,That a small machine did collect the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Your answer is. So you said you think of the scientific tool is called a microscope to look really closely at it. Right, Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,110.2,Yeah yeah,,,,
Teacher,110.2,So Farrah you are. You are correct with the microscope.,,,,
Farrah,110.2,"Oh, okay, okay.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"No, ma'am. You can keep your answer the same.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Good. Good job. All right. Luis You have a question?,,,,
Luis,110.2,"Um, yeah, I guess this is kind of a question. Um, so here's the thing. Like, I know all about space, like, I don't think I should be in this group, because I don't really get answers about space like wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Well, that, that's correct. They have to have certain equipment to get to the moon.",,,,
Luis,110.2,"I didn't really read it so I can read it, I guess.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay Luis's answer was about how they got to the moon, okay so astronaut have to have things to fly around and have oxygen in order to get to the moon. That is correct.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Thank you. Jazmin and absolutely none of you were wrong. You were all correct to an extent, thank you for being here. Go on to lunch.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,It is,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"You're exactly right. And it also says in the second paragraph, um, that they do, they could not breathe oxygen. So they do use those suits and they do use oxygen tanks when they're up on the moon and when they're in space.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yeah, you're exactly right here. So thank you for that added comment.",,,,
Chris,110.2,"Okay, so I'm reading it now. And the other thing I guess is that I don't see them talking about water in the paragraph about the Lunar Orbiter. So how can that be the right one, because they don't have discover in this one. Oh, I do see look for ice.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Correct,,,,
Teacher,110.2,Scientists are a part of it.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,A microscope was used. There was other some other equipment also used so it's probably not just one piece of equipment,,,,
Chris,110.2,"Yes. So I was kind of thinking like, um, I was thinking that well, I went to NASA and I know that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and maybe they use know that when they were finding like all that water in the craters.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Farrah. OK, so maybe Farrah your answer is correct.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, thank you. So that's a great thing to circle.",,,,
Farrah,110.2,"Um, what equipment did telling us to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,The lunar orbiter?,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Right. And I'm not saying your, your answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,A garden. Okay. Yes.,,,,
Farrah,110.2,"I don't remember. The other thing it was the thing that you said Jazmin it's it's it if you if you can get water up there, then you don't have to take it with you, I guess.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"And Jazmin, you rightly said that it's a machine.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,A small machine. That's right.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Your answer wasn't wrong they did use this question,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,It's not wrong. You're still correct they you will need a microscope. If you want to see the water.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Oh, that would be awesome. That is very good thinking",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yes, that is correct.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,And no one's answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Very good. So, Farrah. Do you see now why your answer needs to go a little bit further.",,,,
Farrah,110.2,"Um, I think I began to see, but I'm still kind of confused because so if they use the Lunar Orbiter to to find it, they couldn't see it without the microscope, like they had to go out and look at the crystals, right?",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Well, it's not wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"but I do think that maybe a long, as we research and in the future, that could be a possibility that",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,I said that it definitely would be useful because the scientists can drink water and and people can't survive without water.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, so you're right, they do use equipment and that was part of the question.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"And they can use the water for other things like a garden, like you said, so yes.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,but you guys were right there at it so so,,,,
Chris,110.2,"What I say yes it's valuable cause it's heavy, and they don't have to carry it in ships.","What I say, yes, it's valuable, cause it's heavy, and they don't have to carry it in ships.",,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yeah a lot. I did notice that you you pointed out, the oxygen tanks. That was a really cool answer that you gave, but as you see there was more information that we always can learn that we didn't know before. Did you know the name of this orbiter?",,,,
Luis,110.2,"Well, I guess I didn't really like do the reading exactly. I kind of just like had my knowledge. But, um, so I guess no.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Well, it definitely helped them because you know in space. There's not a lot of oxygen. So you have to have those tanks to help you breathe. So that was one equipment that they did use",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Well, that was right too",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Because they did send a small machine called think I was a probe Or something.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"We could, and then I guess you would say that it would be a good investment because they would could grow things out side of the planet, but",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So I mean he's not wrong,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Perfect. Excellent. Okay, Chris.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, they use several types of of of equipment. Okay, thank you.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Exactly.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, I am sorry that you believe that your answer is wrong. Your everybody's answer is",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Your answer is very right they did use a microscope.,,,,
Farrah,110.2,"Oh yeah. Okay. So, in paragraph three, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. So you have to see it. You can't see it without microscope.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Let's figure answers Farrah, so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, you are correct Miss savanna, you need a microscope to look very closely",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"That is equipment, you're correct. They have to use all those things before they can start their explorations. That is right Chris.",,,,
Chris,110.2,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"We're getting a little bit off topic here, but Luis you said that astronauts have to use oxygen tanks in space shuttles, and those are types of equipment so you're right about that.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,It would and it would be really useful too. Luis What about you.,,,,
Luis,110.2,"Um, yeah. So I think for me like I was really interested in seeing like what kind of equipment they could use. And I was thinking about, like, you know that they have other equipment that they use. That's not necessarily in the reading but but I know we're supposed to focus on the so yeah",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"But you're right, it will take a lot of time and a lot of money. So it might not be worked at. Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,110.2,"Um, well, I actually read somewhere that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so maybe it would be useful faster than Farrah and I thought.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,I think so as well water too because we're looking at what was what equipment was used to to find water there any other important words.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Oh, I didn't say that. No. No. No, your answer isn't wrong. We're just wanting to find kind of even more. OK? About it. So NASA did sent a small machine, correct?","Oh, I didn't say that. No. No. No, your answer isn't wrong. We're just wanting to find kind of even more. OK? About it. So NASA did sent a small machine, correct?",,1,
Teacher,110.2,"Oh, good. That's right. That's right. I'm so sorry that I missed your, your answer. Jazmin. Yes. So they sent mall machine. That's very good. You're exactly right. That's the tool that we're looking for.","Oh, good. That's right. That's right. I'm so sorry that I missed your, your answer. Jazmin. Yes. So they sent small machine. That's very good. You're exactly right. That's the tool that we're looking for.",,,
Teacher,110.2,That is correct.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"And it does say that, um, does it. So are we using the microscope to find the water or to just look at the water that has been found?",,,,
Farrah,110.2,"Um, well okay so I I'm not really sure why my answer might be wrong, because I think the answer is that the microscope is what they use to to find the water you know what I mean? Tey had to look at the water to see it.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yes, it was the microscope. Does everybody see where Farrah found that in paragraph three?",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Good job, Jazmin. Did everybody hear that while Luis was reading",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to take a moment and I wanted to thank you for working with us today.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,That was a wonderful answer. Does anyone else want to add their answer to it.,That was a wonderful answer. Does anyone else want to add their answer to it?,,,
Teacher,110.2,Your answer is correct because the microscope is a tool. Now equipment is is very broad when comes two machines and tools and what you refer to them as,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yeah. Your answer is not, I wouldn't say that it's wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Cute. Um, yeah, I don't think that it's wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Your answer is not wrong, Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"A small machine. Well, I don't think that you're wrong.",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"So yeah, so well. Okay, so when I was reading. I saw that",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"And so it's not that your answer is incorrect,",,,,
Farrah,110.2,"Yeah, definitely. I think I know what you mean.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Right. So what you could also include is that scientists use a tool called a microscope to discover water on the moon,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Your answer is correct,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Correct they did have to use the equipment so Luis and you are both correct that they did have oxygen tanks, but that's not specifically what they hadn't used to find the water and the craters.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,I'm not going to say your response was wrong by any means. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Maybe your answer is right. So you answer that that NASA send a small machine. And so if we look at what was written, actually, you can look at number two on there.","Maybe your answer is right. So your answer that that NASA send a small machine. And so if we look at what was written, actually, you can look at number two on there.",,,
Teacher,110.2,I didn't say your answer was wrong.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,That they said that small machine a lunar orbiter is a type of machine. So your answer was right.,,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"Yeah, yeah. I thought we were all here because all of our answers are wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,It's not that your answers are wrong.,,,,
Jazmin,110.2,Yeah yeah,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Right, so they. Those are different types of equipment that scientists use. So you guys are right and that they use oxygen tanks and space suits do do those equipment does that equipment, help them discover water.",,,,
Luis,110.2,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,So Chris. You did a really good job at stating that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,It could be something that we drink it could be something that we could use to stay clean. Good job.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,You're right. You did a great job with with understanding what water is even. How can it be valuable for us on the moon.,,,,
Luis,110.2,Because we can while we can drink it and we can take a bath and I'm,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yeah, we can use it to drink, we can use it to bake. Those are great job, guys. Thank you.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,And that is a great answer.,,,,
Farrah,110.2,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, okay. So, in paragraph, paragraph three","Yeah, absolutely.",,,
Teacher,110.2,"I mean, it is a small machine it, you're, you're still correct",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"So yeah, I think it was a small machine. The lunar orbiter is what they sent because it was sent up and then they would like fly around the moon. And then I guess it lands on the moon, and then it would discover the water, I think",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Well, that would definitely you know really come in handy for any, you know, scientists or astrologers who might perhaps be on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"But it would definitely you know perhaps provide sort of, you know, sort of some greenhouses, that we might be able to construct on the moon. So that perhaps the scientists could even perhaps grow vegetables and have something to that that they can grow to eat on the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"Yeah, that's really cool.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"just like Luis brought up about space. He's looking into it. He knows this is not just about equipment but about space. Yes, Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,When I looked over your answer. There was some great points you brought about it. It wasn't that it wasn't wrong. It is what it is.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Great. And that's a good connection. So I loved your response, about the word you used, use the word hydrate, did you use hydrate Jazmin, you said it again?",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,You can stay hydrated.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"I like that response because that's something you're proving to me whenever I asked you about the garden. What makes you think you could, and you're telling me.",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"Yes. So if there was water, you could make a garden you could grow it using the water.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"I thought that was a great idea to be you. Look at that. I'm glad you looked at that detail about hearing the shoes, because it's heavy.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Great. And there's a lot dealing with article because that's like equipment right like you read about equipment in the passage that we had,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay. Yes, good response.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, you know what, Chris I. That sounds like a good point. So maybe there was there's probably more than just one thing used to find this water,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,And we all gave really good answers.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So your, your answer is not wrong. I'm in paragraph three, it talks about that the water they found us microscopic meaning that you wouldn't be able to see it. So I think that's where you were thinking that you would need a tool walk a microscope to see those types of things on the moon. Does that help you understand more.","So your, your answer is not wrong. I'm in paragraph three, it talks about that the water they found us, microscopic meaning that you wouldn't be able to see it. So I think that's where you were thinking that you would need a tool walk a microscope to see those types of things on the moon. Does that help you understand more?",,,
Farrah,110.2,"I think so, like, do I need to. I need them. They need the microscope to see the water or can they see it in another way.",,,,
Farrah,110.2,So no one's answer is wrong. It's just that some answers are,,,,
Teacher,110.2,But nothing's wrong with your paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"This pretty good, but that is definitely one of the lunar orbiter does",,,,
Teacher,110.2,That's absolutely true so far.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So right now, your answer seems pretty solid.",,,,
Farrah,110.2,"I'm wondering, though, because we had to work on it together, is my answer is my answer wrong?","I'm wondering, though, because we had to work on it together, is my answer, is my answer wrong?",,,
Teacher,110.2,"So, Farrah, your answer's, I don't think your answer is incorrect. Your answer's your answer is correct.",,,,
Farrah,110.2,"Oh, okay, great.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yeah, that's a great point. Chris. So, um, yes, they would have had to use these oxygen tanks and stuff to go out and actually explore the moon. So yeah, you would need that equipment.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Jazmin your answer is not necessarily wrong.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"You're in again your answers, not necessarily wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,And that's definitely true scientists did find craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, so I'm glad you you've noticed that.",,,,
Chris,110.2,"Like you said to Jazmin, the name of the equipment, The name of the equipment that they used. Oh, yeah. I didn't write the name of the equipment.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yes, you, you went right into you said scientists want crater some water on the moon. Again, true.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,So I think you guys,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Are exactly right. So, uh, equipment is a tool. You guys are correct in stating that both of those things, the microscope and","Are exactly right. So, uh, equipment is a tool. You guys are correct in stating that both of those things, the microscope and",,2,
Teacher,110.2,The small machine are both equipment they are tools.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"And that is absolutely correct. And I appreciate you sharing that with us. And in fact, our article today discusses the importance of oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,So Jazmin your answer That they can drink water and stay hydrated is a very good answer. And it is mentioned here in the text.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"You did, um.",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"Yeah, cuz I said that, yes, that there's convincing evidence and I said astronaut drink the water and stay hydrated and that you can't survive without water.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So you were extremely, extremely close.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,I'm not saying I'm not saying it's wrong. They didn't use machinery. I think whenever we talked about the question you get to find out that you're actually went wrong. You were,,,,
Teacher,110.2,You weren't wrong after all.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,It's not wrong.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,Very good. So like Luis said they do use equipment like oxygen and tanks to get to the moon and be able to survive on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,I didn't say it was wrong. Your answer isn't wrong.,,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"Oh, okay.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay well we're going to get to that in one second. All right, Farrah, and it's not wrong. We're just going to see if there was a different way to answer it. Okay. All right. Luis Can you share what you underlined in paragraph two,",,,,
Luis,110.2,"Um, yeah. So imperative to, well, I underline the same thing like small machine.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,So you said that they needed a tool called the microscope to look really closely and that is true,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Exactly, exactly. We need that special tool called a microscope to see these little microscopic, whatever it ends up being, in this case it's microscopic amounts of water.","Exactly, exactly. We need that special tool called a microscope to see these little microscopic, whatever it ends up being, in this case it's microscopic amounts of water.",,2,
Chris,110.2,"You. Yeah, I didn't actually so I didn't really see anything in here but I kind of, I did have a question that came up from reading and it was like",,,,
Teacher,110.2,So in essence kind of both of them are correct.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"In reality, I'm not sure any teacher would count it wrong, myself included, if you put  Every bit of it.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"You know, if you put the lunar order and the microscope and just about anything. I don't think I'd counted wrong because technically that is correct.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Every little bit that us to get to the moon and find the water is technically correct.,Every little bit that us to get to the moon and find the water is technically correct.,,1,
Teacher,110.2,"Yeah, so I would say based on our text here, they've used different equipment to discover that there was water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Good job, Farrah is exactly right. You look at paragraph three, you will in fact see that it says you need a microscope.",,,,
Farrah,110.2,But I know that we're here in the group to sort of help with our answers. But I am not really sure why my answer is wrong. It seems it is the microscope,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"In fact, it is the microscope and part of the answers is right, it is the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"I will say, Jazmin. And your answer is right.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Hmm, I suppose it's in a large polar crater, right? Okay now your answer is correct, they did use that equipment to see if there was ice deposit.",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"I guess not, I guess they must have used all of them like different, like the microscop and the lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, now in the test we did hear about how you might need a microscope to view this this these water molecules. Right?",,,,
Teacher,110.2,With your answer is not wrong.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, so that could be a one use of water. Luis?",,,,
Luis,110.2,"Um, yeah, like water can be split into two parts. It can be, you know, hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So I love how you found that a microscope was used to find water,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,You use those.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,It's not wrong.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,so you said you are 100% correct and it said NASA send a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,Everybody's answer was correct.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,I don't think your answer was necessarily wrong at all. It was a small machine.,,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"So, so how come I'm in this group.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,but you guys all gave answers that were very valid.,,,,
Oliver,110.2,"Okay, so you're saying I'm",,,,
Teacher,110.2,yeah it was a good answer.,"yeah, it was a good answer.",,,
Chris,110.2,I don't have to change mine either?,,,,
Teacher,110.2,yeah no that's a very well Olivereloped answer,"yeah, no, that's a very well Olivereloped answer.",,2,
Oliver,110.2,um well I I said it wasn't ready yet so I said no too.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"but as long as we gathered all of the information about the values of it then your answer is correct, whether or not you think it is or not.",,,,
Chris,110.2,You know I I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"I'm just going to go one by one. So, Farrah. I just want to start with you. I really did enjoy your answer. You really picked up from the text and",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"You really picked the object, which was a microscope and you basically kind of described what it's used for outside of the text and you were using language that I really appreciate it.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Yeah. Your answer was right that the scientists did find craters full water on the moon. You're right.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"I don't think your answer is wrong, we did read that you do need a Microscope to look closely at the moon, maybe we can rephrase that what do we use the microscope for? Do you remember?",,,,
Farrah,110.2,You yeah to look at really small thing.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,And Jazmin. I just want to tell you that your answer wasn't wrong.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"yeah yeah and you're definitely correct the scientists in the text, they did find craters of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, so your answer, I would not say that your answer is wrong, so you said yes water on the moon could be valuable because astronauts drink water.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So in the passage, it does say that there there's evidence that water can be found within the moon's polar craters which - that's a great piece of knowledge. That's something we always want to keep with us.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Alright awesome Farrah I like how you told me how they used the microscope for the water that they found on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,So how do you think they would use oxygen oxygen tanks and stuff like that to find water on the moon What are those use for.,,,,
Chris,110.2,"Use to like breathe or walk or you know, to protect themselves from from the elements because it's really cool.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"um well you're correct they do because they're on the moon, they need to be able to breathe to do their research to find the water correct yes.",,,,
Chris,110.2,yeah yeah.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"equipment that you find whether it's in the text, or you think of it in your head.",,,,
Farrah,110.2,"Okay, well, I added like a longer answer than Jazmin's one and I, and I said, the name of the equipment in mind so So why is mine wrong.","Okay, well, I added like a longer answer than Jazmin's one and I, and I said, the name of the equipment in mind, so So why is mine wrong?",,,
Teacher,110.2,"Not necessarily wrong, I think that you did a good job, identifying that the microscope was the equipment and a microscope does look at things closely, but I wanted you to.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,It is.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,yeah absolutely good job.,"yeah, absolutely, good job.",,,
Oliver,110.2,"Oh okay teacher, I just looked at the clock it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you for kind of.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So yeah, that's kind of how you could have done it. But yeah, this was a good start. Yeah, good foundation.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"You your applied to it was scientists found creators, full of water on the moon, so your sentence isn't wrong and you bring up a good point that.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"um the scientists found for creators, full of water on the moon on",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So yeah just kind of thinking about more like that, but you did great you know it was it was a good answer you did awesome i'm.","So, yeah, just kind of thinking about, more like that, but you did great. you know it was, it was a good answer. you did awesome.",,,
Teacher,110.2,"wow you're you're a super right and that was perfect timing, because your classmate Luis his his sentence was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank so two great minds think alike, am I right.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"i'm so Luis for your sentence, I have seen anything terrible wrong with it, but.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"yeah um but other than that I, I thank you guys, like all the guys, I think I understood the passages like Well, yes, that.",,,,
Oliver,110.2,i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but it's time for us to go so we'll see you later.,"i'm sorry to interrupt teacher, but it's time for us to go, so we'll see you later.",,,
Teacher,110.2,"yeah that's awesome I see it, right in the second paragraph NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that's a great answer.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Right. OK, now that is correct.",,,,
Oliver,110.2,"Well, I'm thinking because you're asking that maybe it does.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"All right, no one's wrong. I want to make that very clear. No one's wrong. We're just getting a deeper understanding of why your answers are right.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"That's right. You picked up wonderfully in the part where they asked what equipment, you would need. So you said, I know what equipment you need you need a microscope to look really closely, you had the what and the why.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,You're right on what you said.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,Answer is not wrong.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,So your answers not wrong,,,,
Teacher,110.2,microscope yep that's right,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yeah, you are correct. Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Actually, I think I agree with savannas answer.",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,The question asked what equipment that they used to discover water on the moon. And that's why I said I'm the small machine I that's why I picked the one from paragraph to because,,,,
Teacher,110.2,I don't necessarily think any one answer was.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Just outright wrong,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,So thank you for sharing Thank you,,,,
Jazmin,110.2,I can read the question,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"That is really, really cool information, and I know the text references oxygen tanks, too, so that is really awesome for you to bring up Thank you Chris",,,,
Teacher,110.2,yeah That is very true you both do use very specific evidence um.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Because, well your answer is not wrong. You're definitely. Well, you guys are all definitely right with your answers that you guys that they did use a microscope. They did send a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"That's really, really cool. So going off that, the equipment that they used to find water on the moon. You guys all had responses that were definitely",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"You guys were all mostly right in your responses. Yes, Oliver, you said you circled the same as Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"And that's right, Farrah did choose a correct objects,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"I understand that you read the reading because you know that they found craters full of water on the moon, but",,,,
Teacher,110.2,you're right they definitely do use a lot of equipment like awkward to use to find water that's right.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,you're right they definitely did send a small machine and that's great.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,Again that's the correct answer and you wouldn't need a microscope to look really clearly and the reading did say that.,"Again that's the correct answer, and you wouldn't need a microscope to look really clearly and the reading did say that.",,,
Teacher,110.2,"Alright, so I know this is a little smaller and I wanted to explain to you guys that before you get worried, I want you guys, to know that your responses were all great.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Your answer is totally correct everybody has correct answers in this group,,,,
Teacher,110.2,Chris your response was great you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon that's correct,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"And that is true. Chris, the scientists did find craters with ice in them.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"And in the question asked what machine discovered the water, so your answer is correct,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Oh so Jazmin I let's clarify. I don't think any of your answers are wrong. I think all of you answer the questions.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"I'm with a different type of answer, but I don't think any of your questions were wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"All right, Chris. How are we doing so your response was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon, which is completely true.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Instruments, they used to find the water, which was microscope. So that's really great.",,,,
Chris,110.2,You put it doesn't. I don't know. I don't know how,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So let's see your answer was NASA sent a small machine. That answer is not incorrect at all, and I think none of your answers are wrong in any of this case I just think",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"When we read the question, it asked for what specific type of equipment would be used and your answer was correct, but I think to answer the correct",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"um let's look at your you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated, you can't survive without water. That is perfectly correct Jazmin and I don't think your answers wrong I just think.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Right, you just did a really good job using textual evidence to support your answer.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Right. So that answers the question. What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. That's great. Nice work!,,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"Yeah, I can say was just wondering, since I was thinking like that. It seemed like the Lunar Orbiter, we see that they use to discover the water. So is it both the microscope and the lunar orbiter is it just one?",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So I don't think your answers wrong, I think you have a really, really great start to a strong response so in the text, it does actually say NASA sent a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,So I think that's a great start yeah awesome,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yes, that's exactly what's the word I was looking for. They needed a microscope to really, really see what the ice was like.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"backed up why you said, because if you had just said that you put creator down I probably would have marked it as a wrong answer, but now that you're saying to me that they used it is used to hold water, it is a very good.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,it's a very good thought.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yeah, they definitely use those.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,It's not wrong at all.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,So that's a tool that we that you can implement in your responses. Yes. Chris.,,,,
Chris,110.2,"Actually yeah I was gonna ask. So I, I noticed that","Actually, yeah, I was gonna ask. So I, I noticed that",,,
Teacher,110.2,"Your answer wasn't wrong. It had all the great all the good pieces in it,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Mm hmm. Um, let's see, I so your answer wasn't wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So Chris also that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, which is absolutely correct. They did.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,So the lunar orbiter the microscope and you said some masks and other oxygen tanks and equipment like that. So that's really good.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, so you're absolutely right about craters their work craters on the moon, and there was some water in there,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"And you're right to say that the scientists need a tool, called the microscope to look really closely",,,,
Teacher,110.2,That is a tool that astronauts use on the moon you're right.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Awesome. Well, I love this response that you have right now. That was amazing.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"No, I'm not saying your answers wrong.",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"Um, well, I mean, I just, I, I feel like I i put words down from from story and",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"No, I was just wondering like what, if you remember the name, because that is correct that they did send that to find like if the water was on the moon.","No, I was just wondering like what, if you remember the name, because that is correct, that they did send that to find like if the water was on the moon.",,2,
Jazmin,110.2,So it is right.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,savannas right.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Honestly, like you, all of you are right,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"And that is, that is a very true point um and I think this answer was a really good answer I just know.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Your answer is not wrong. So this is a two part question.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,Great job remembering that they found the water on the moon.,,,,
Chris,110.2,"Um, well Jazmin just said the Lunar Orbiter and the microscope and you told her that was right. So I'm figuring that's the right answer.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So I think your answers - none of your answers are wrong. I think sometimes they can use improvement. But Farrah, I do want to point out that your response.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,I don't necessarily - you're not all necessarily here because your answers were wrong or bad.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So like I said earlier, none of your answers are wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"There's - so as long as you're using evidence to support your answer, there is really there isn't technically a wrong answer.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"But the Lunar Orbiter. One second, Luis. The Lunar Orbiter and the microscope are both pieces of equipment that are used, so that the both of those answers, would be correct. It's not one is right and one is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"No, you weren't wrong I just think you were not wrong you did make a very clear point and the, you stated that the scientists they use microscopes to look closely",,,,
Teacher,110.2,mm hmm no you're not Oliver you're not I want I want you to understand that you're not wrong.,"mm hmm, no, you're not, Oliver, you're not, I want, I want you to understand that you're not wrong.",,2,
Teacher,110.2,And they do mention in the reading and then the story about.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"The different thing that they that they need, so they need.","The different thing that they, that they need, so they need.",,,
Teacher,110.2,"They have the oxygen tanks, because they need to be able to breathe.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"When I read your answer that like I want, I want to reinforce and I want you to know that your answer is correct you're you're you're not sitting at the table, because your answer is wrong, none of you are.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yeah, exactly. So they had to use the microscope to find it.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So you can think of a way that they use oxygen tanks to find water, they might need oxygen tanks to be on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Exactly, exactly.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,No. Your answer isn't wrong.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,There was nothing wrong with your answer. I like there. I like both of your answers. I just wanted everybody to be on the same page.,,,,
Farrah,110.2,Sounds good.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,Perfect. That is a very good answer. Farrah.,,,,
Oliver,110.2,"Um, well, I said, pretty much the same thing as Farrah, um, you know, like I thought it was the microscope.","Um, well, I said, pretty much the same thing as Farrah, um, you know, like I thought it was the microscope.",,2,
Teacher,110.2,"Perfect. And, you know, that was a very good answer. Thank you for sharing.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yeah. So, you are correct.",,,,
Chris,110.2,"Cool. And that's, that's like different from",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Mm hmm. And that's a very good way to do it. That's cool. Mm hmm.,,,,
Chris,110.2,We actually have to go to lunch.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,mm hmm yeah so you are completely correct NASA did send a small machine and that was used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,So Farrah was both they're both correct because it used to discover the water it doesn't have to do with.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So you both have very different responses, but they're both correct, so they didn't use a microscope and that was your answer so that would make yours correct.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Perfect. Luis you have a very, very good response with a lot of detail in it",,,,
Teacher,110.2,There's nothing wrong with any of your responses at all.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"It's not wrong,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"All right. Chris, first off, I really loved your response because you showed that you really, like, you read the reading, and you kind of took that in,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,All right. Awesome. I really liked how you said the specifics about the microscope and you said like you explained that they used the microscope to see water on Earth. That was really wonderful.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"It says your- the microscope is right it is very much right,",,,,
Oliver,110.2,well.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,They did find craters full of water.,,,,
Chris,110.2,No. Craters aren't equipment. So I guess no.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"You're right, but maybe you don't need the microscope to see it because water. Maybe there's enough of it that they could see it without Jazmin, you have something to add.",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,I don't understand why my answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,What we never said you guys answers were wrong.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Mm hmm. You're definitely right as a microscope is a scientific tool. And that's what the question was asking was asking which tools, specifically did they use to find this water, and I believe it did talk about a microscope in our reading right everybody read the reading?",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, it's not necessarily wrong at all. That's a great answer, because you're right. They did NASA did send a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,And you weren't wrong. That was a machine that a piece of equipment that NASA uses that the astronaut uses.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,You're not wrong and I didn't even think of it that way. So I'm glad you brought this point up,,,,
Teacher,110.2,This isn't necessarily every single person who ever had to sit down with the teacher again sometime's your answers not wrong. Absolutely completely right.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,So I think that you're right. Chris NASA does use a lot of different tools when it's exploring space.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,So Farrah after I read your answer. And your answer is wonderful. You answered part of the question you found the equipment that they used right that,,,,
Farrah,110.2,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,so severe that your answer isn't exactly wrong sometimes we just need help explaining.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So your answer is correct, and you did a great job with your thinking.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Your answer at the top is correct, you did find the equipment.",,,,
Farrah,110.2,"Okay, I'll work on that.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Oliver you did an amazing job with that sentence starter.,,,,
Oliver,110.2,Thanks.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Um, so your answer to your answer is correct, right.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Thank you both for adding those strong answers from the text.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yes, the scientists found craters full of water on the moon. That is the result. Right.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yes, I agree with you.",,,,
Luis,110.2,"Yeah, I, I also know that because I know a lot about space. So I know that they have to use oxygen tanks to yeah I know that",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yeah, so I think a lot is a good guessing.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Um, yes microscope is a kind of a scientist tool.","Um, yes. microscope is a kind of a scientist tool.",,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, I really appreciate that you give us a fact and exactly evidence for all the passage when you answer the question.",,,,
Chris,110.2,"Well, okay. Well, it kind of goes along with my",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Teacher : Okay, so you said NASA and the small machine which is absolutely right.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,With your answer is not completely wrong. It's more than it's just missing a little bit of information.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yeah, I love that you mentioned the microscope, because that was definitely necessary.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,That's very true. That's another tool that they used in order to find water and the moon.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Um, that's really interesting. Farrah, because you're right to look at something really closely, you would need a microscope. But let's think.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,You're right. You're so right. If there are astronauts on the moon. There needs to be oxygen tags.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,So Farrah. I would say that your answer wasn't wrong at all.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"You're right. Yes, scientists that work with NASA need a lot of equipment to be able to be able to safely do their",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Expeditions they need oxygen like Chris said they need the proper space equipment. If they're leaving our earth.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,These are all pieces of equipment that scientists might need if they're doing investigations. That's a great point. Chris,,,,
Luis,110.2,"Yeah, I actually, I do because I know but the word orbit means like vehicles around something. And so I'm thinking maybe that that there weren't asked astronaut spec has it doesn't even say the word astronaut anywhere in the story. So like if there weren't even astronauts, they wouldn't really need a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Great response.,,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"Thank you. Yeah, I don't understand why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,I wouldn't say that your answer is wrong. Right.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,Thank you for sharing and today is so important because No one's answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay. So you're absolutely right. And it's not your answer isn't wrong,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yeah, you're absolutely right here and thank you for making that connection and sharing those ideas with us.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Your answer isn't really wrong. It's not wrong, Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yes, can you tell me like what executive answer.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yeah, yeah. And you're right.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yes, you're right. Your answer is not wrong at all.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So even they are not the exact answer, they help us to view the main answer. Okay, so there is no wrong answer on here.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Is not wrong Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"That's a very great response and great observation, based on the text.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Your answer is not wrong. That's not, that's not why you're in this group. I just wanted to talk to you a little bit more about that machine.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"It's definitely your that's correct, that it was a small machine that they sent To find the ice deposits or just trying to look A little bit deeper into What the machine was doing in order to discover the water on the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"Oh, oh, okay. So, just add some more to my answer.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"That's actually a good answer, because it talks about the water they found on the, on the, on the moon was microscopic",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Hmm. Absolutely. They do. Those are all part of the process of going up to the moon and using the Lunar Orbiter to find the end the microphone and a microscope To find the small amounts of water in the crater.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"So that's actually, I'm glad you said that because that's part of the process. We didn't necessarily talk about in this text. Or in this section of the text.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,But that is exactly something that's a big part of it as well. So thank you for adding that,,,,
Teacher,110.2,Absolutely. Great job.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Great, so that's that's a good answer",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Full of water on the moon good observation. Yes, I remember that from the text as well. Good job.",,,,
Chris,110.2,"Oh well, okay. So in part one, they talk about",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Hmm. Good. Remembering yes it does say that. So that's a great piece of information that we can actually all use To help answer the question, even better,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Oh, well, what makes you think your answers wrong.",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,Since we're all in this small group.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"And you know what's been I was wrong i'm sorry about that I just realized that said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so the microscope was part of the equipment, so you are also right, so thank you for that as well.",,,,
Farrah,110.2,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,They both have the right answer they're both.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,um well your answer actually isn't wrong they're both right because the small machine the Lunar orbiter and also the microscope were both correct so that was just all the equipment they used.,"um, well, your answer actually isn't wrong. they're both right because the small machine, the Lunar orbiter and also the microscope were both correct, so that was just all the equipment they used.",,,
Jazmin,110.2,"Oh Okay, so if I just put NASA sent a small machine then i'm right.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,But OK so Farrah let's think about I like that you said microscope that was part of the equipment they use.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,I mean technically those would all be part of the like the equipment that the scientists use for this discovery of water let's think.,"I mean, technically, those would all be part of the like the equipment that the scientists use for this discovery of water. let's think.",,,
Teacher,110.2,"Oh okay so um you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon well, so your answer was true it wasn't wrong",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"but technically, your answer was right they did find -oh i'm sorry they",,,,
Teacher,110.2,So you said NASA centers small machine.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,You can look your answers are there you are correct  they had water,,,,
Teacher,110.2,And Luis that's totally right the scientists do use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,yeah you're right if scientists on the moon don't have oxygen tanks that's not any good ISM.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"yeah they That is exactly what the story said, and that was a really good observation",,,,
Farrah,110.2,"Well, I don't know because I thought it was the microscope, because how can you find something if it's too small to see.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Jazmin your answer is completely correct you're totally right when you said that NASA a small machine,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Awesome Jazmin Thank you so much so, you said that NASA sent a small machine which is very true and that's exactly what we were looking for",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"You know Jazmin when I read your answer, I actually thought that your answer completed the question correctly.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"I think that what you said, made perfect sense that the Lunar orbiter is what equipment with us to discover water on the moon,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,cool yeah because in this question we're really trying to address how they discovered the water on the moon.  right so that's where we're focusing on those tools in particular.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"it's a great answer scientists absolutely use microscopes all the time to look at really small things like, for example, water so that's a great idea that both of you had","it's a great answer. scientists absolutely use microscopes all the time to look at really small things like, for example, water, so that's a great idea that both of you had.",,,
Farrah,110.2,"Oh well, I mean, I guess, I thought they did on.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Well, your answers aren't wrong,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,that's a great answer um.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"they're both right, you need both things.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"you're not in this group, because your answers are necessarily wrong right",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Oh okay yeah so you're right you're so right about the craters there's definitely some craters.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Oh okay i'm happy to help you out there, so you are right in that you are definitely have to really get really small to figure out that this water because, like we were saying earlier there's not a whole lot of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Perfect Yes, you are so right they would absolutely need something to do with that so yeah the Lunar orbiter might do that as well, so we're going to take some different places, and I think that would go with it as well help help them dig down yeah, Oliver what do you think.",,,,
Oliver,110.2,"um yeah i'm so sorry um I just looked up a clock and we actually we have to put a lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand how.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"microscope Okay, so I do lot love the Oliveron and Farrah you guys are making the connections with microscope because Yes, you are correct because, in order to look at it closely, you need it, you that's the scientific tool that you need go ahead Oliveron.",,,,
Oliver,110.2,"um yeah so actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much, I feel like you gave each one of us a strategy to help make our answer better on, and that was really helpful, thank you.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Did everybody see that's the whole question okay so Luis if the question would have stopped where you were reading your answer would have been 100% right because you circled information in your brain.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Oh i'm not sure that your answer is wrong,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"that's that's exactly right Farrah The one thing that that you said that I want to clarify, as you mentioned.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Your answer is not wrong scientists used lots of different machines to discover the water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,110.2,yeah I yeah that's very true and the microscope is another piece of equipment that the scientists use.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,yeah so I see yeah that's perfect evidence in the text to support your statement that water can be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"yeah, so we need them both",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"I don't think your answer is wrong so much as it might be the way I was thinking about so here, so I actually just bought my own kids.",,,,
Chris,110.2,yeah,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Chris, when you said in your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon, I think you're totally right they did and that's so exciting right.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Right right Do you remember okay I love that you're talking about the water because that's ultimately what we're trying to get to right Do you remember,"Right, right. Do you remember, okay, I love that you're talking about the water. because that's ultimately what we're trying to get to right?",,,
Teacher,110.2,"Jazmin no one ever said, your answer was wrong and your answer, I would say right now, your answer is not wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,So you're right in that they did use they did use a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,So your answer is not wrong Jazmin.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,yeah so Oliver you're exactly right there's more than one right answer here so savannas answer about the microscope was correct and Jazmin's answer about the Lunar orbiter was correct.,,,,
Oliver,110.2,"Oh OK, so we could say either one.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,that's really great point,,,,
Teacher,110.2,awesome great love that detail that you're using,,,,
Teacher,110.2,it's not wrong they definitely did use a small machine,,,,
Jazmin,110.2,"And I can, I can tell you where I found it, I found it in part to the beginning of Part two",,,,
Teacher,110.2,And that definitely is part of the equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,,
Jazmin,110.2,Oh no I just circled small machine.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"awesome, thank you for sharing yeah they do say exactly in the text, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely gov would you want to share oh yeah Luis go for it.","awesome, thank you for sharing. Yeah, they do say exactly in the text, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,2,
Luis,110.2,yeah okay well my answer was actually that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,With what the text was about because it's true that scientists did find craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,hmm Farrah I love your thinking because you're totally right that the article  talk about using a microscope to look at the water.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,Thinking about discovery so you're right that they were using the microscope to look at the water they found,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"yeah right they do use a lot of equipment, I think my suggestion for you here because you're right that's that signed us and asked us a ton of different kinds of equipment.","yeah, right, they do use a lot of equipment. I think my suggestion for you here, because you're right that's that signed us and asked us a ton of different kinds of equipment.",,1,
Teacher,110.2,You are correct in that they found is using a small machine,,,,
Teacher,110.2,Very cool. I didn't know that there was water on the moon before I read the text so that was a very interesting fact to me as well.,,,,
Oliver,110.2,"yeah well, I thought i'm sorry um it was interesting how they said that the water is is really, really small it's actually like a really, really, really small pieces.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,I like that. That's a really good way of thinking about it. What does anyone else-,,,,
Oliver,110.2,i'm so sorry.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, I wouldn't say that your answer is wrong, I actually I don't think anybody's answers are right or wrong, I think that you you all circled a really important parts of the text that allow us to understand the different sorts of equipment that NASA uses to find water on space.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Well, your answer is not wrong you're actually really correct NASA did send a small machine",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"That is a very good question so Jazmin's answer was correct, but your answer is also correct because this question has multiple answers to it.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Oh, I don't think that that's wrong, I think that you bring up a really good point because you found information in a different paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"And then we've got what Farrah said, which was the microscope so these might be different pieces of equipment or tools that scientists are using to find water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"yeah, so I think, based on what everyone has shared we realize the scientists need lots of different tools to do their work right.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Okay, so you're actually on the right track um I would not, I wouldn't say your answer is wrong","Okay, so you're actually on the right track. Um, I would not, I wouldn't say your answer is wrong.",,,
Teacher,110.2,And it's true that this NASA scientists will use a lot of tools to,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Very good, so again just I think your answer was right, but we just we were just trying to see if the if the scientists could see it so again it wasn't that your answer is wrong",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Very good, yes, scientists do use a lot of equipment so again, this is why it doesn't have to be one answer it says what kind of equipment that they use So if you feel that all of these kind of equipment is a part of discovering water and it's all are the answer.","Very good, yes, scientists do use a lot of equipment. so again, this is why it doesn't have to be one answer. it says what kind of equipment that they use. So if you feel that all of these kind of equipment is a part of discovering water and it's all are the answer.",,,
Chris,110.2,Oh whoo so we so my answer could be on that the scientists to use the masks and the oxygen tanks and this be suits and the Lunar orbiter and the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Now, these are all true right because you all circled things that were right from the text right.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Right and we know that a machine is the type of equipment okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"your answers not wrong it's just there's multiple parts to it,",,,,
Jazmin,110.2,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,They did and so those craters.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,um it's.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,so they were both right both of your both of your answers.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Yes, yep you are.",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Right, those are good, those are good points, both both of you guys",,,,
Teacher,110.2,"Remembering that any answer can be made better but it's not that you have a wrong answer that maybe it's just answering a different question right so let's try and strengthen our answers here,",,,,
Teacher,110.2,Jazmin and Chris you both came up with great answers for why water.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,With your response you had mentioned that astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated that seems really helpful you can't survive without water that's definitely true right.,,,,
Teacher,110.2,"and you might have also noticed that in paragraph five, it starts with moon water could be useful so you're not wrong that saying.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"that's awesome if you're, then you can help us figure out these couple questions so.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"we're so glad to have you in this group, and you can you can kind of help us to follow the prompts of the, the question that we were that we were answering so i'm so glad you're here all right.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"You nailed it they absolutely do they use so much equipment in science and NASA and they get to play with like lasers all day and I am jealous of them, yes thumbs up.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,I love that you know you have so much prior knowledge about space yeah I appreciate that i'm you know I think you'll bring a lot to whatever group that you're in.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,i'm glad i'm glad to hear that I think you will have a lot to contribute with your knowledge,,,,
Teacher,110.3,yeah I did I am so happy to hear that you already.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"facilities and museums and I think you and Luis probably have a lot to talk about feed both share the interest in space, thank you for sharing",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Oh good, well, that means that you can help us, I think that your background knowledge is going to be very helpful for us in this group Luis",,,,
Luis,110.3,Reacher Every Reader: possible.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well i'm really glad that you feel like you have a good understanding of space, but we're just gonna we're just gonna talk really about that answer real quick i'm excited to hear what you have to share though at the at the end, whenever we get to your turn.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,um i'm glad you're really excited to learn about space um Luis,"um, i'm glad you're really excited to learn about space um Luis",,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, I completely understand that and I can tell from your answer that you do know a lot of things about space because you talked about oxygen tanks and so I can tell that you do know a lot about space, but I just want us to help drill in on this specific answer for this question. Okay.",,,,
Luis,110.3,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, that would be awesome. I didn't know that you taught me something.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"You don't think you should be in this group. Well, I'm glad you're in this group because maybe you can help us all out with some of our questions we have and how we answered. So I'm glad you're here with us.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,I really like the fact that you have a lot of knowledge about it because it tells me that you're probably really interested in space. So Luis Can you help me understand,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well you know what, because you do know a lot and that means you can help the rest of us out that don't know as much as you","Well you know what, because you do know a lot, and that means you can help the rest of us out that don't know as much as you.",,,
Luis,110.3,"Oh yeah, okay. Cool, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, that will really help us by you knowing some things because you might be able to teach us some things we don't know.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Even that's the nice thing about it because we all know different information and where, you know, in a little bit more, maybe you can teach us some things along the way. Okay.",,,,
Luis,110.3,That's cool.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,You know all about space?,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Luis, that is such awesome information and I'm so proud of you, that you go out and look for that information on your free time, and I can't wait to share all of that information with the rest of the class when we get back with them.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"For right now, I love that you know that there's oxygen tanks. Oh, nice. Thumbs up. That's awesome. I love that you know about oxygen",,,,
Teacher,110.3,I'm sure they do and I bet that Luis could probably tell you more and you can share that information together.,,,,
Luis,110.3,"Yeah, I can.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Luis, then you'll be able to help us as we as we explore a little bit more about what we what we've read about",,,,
Teacher,110.3,And I know that you know a lot about space. So I know that you can really help us out here.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"And that's awesome, and I love that you know that because it's very, very helpful and necessary for all those astronauts up there.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"You do. That's wonderful. Well, maybe you'll be able to help us answer our question a little bit differently. So do you think you could put your listening ears on and maybe you can help us answer this question better. Does that sound okay",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Oh yeah, yeah, I think I'd be great to help on this question.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,Wonderful how. What a fun experience.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Yeah, that's great. That's a great connection. How neat that you've been to NASA before I love that.",,,,
Chris,110.3,It's really cool.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Oh well, Luis, and that's exactly why we need you in here. We need you in here to help help us out.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Awesome. Luis Well, thanks so much for joining us, we, we really need you in this group today since you know a lot about space. Okay, thank you for that.",,,,
Chris,110.3,"Oh no, I was just",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Now, Luis, our science expert.",,,,
Luis,110.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay, but maybe there is something that you don't know and you would like to learn or you will be grateful after the class to learn that thing.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Oh, you were there.",,,,
Chris,110.3,"Yeah, I went with my dad and we saw the rocket ships and we saw with all kinds of cool stuff.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,That is really cool. Maybe you should tell us about in another class about everything that you did see there,,,,
Chris,110.3,"Okay. Okay. Cool. Yeah, I can tell you, all, all about how the space ships take off and like how you know it's a little bit hard",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Wow, that seems really awesome.",,,,
Chris,110.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,Luis your dad is an astronaut. That's why you know a lot about space.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"That's good. So maybe today or in another class, you can share something that you have learned from your dad.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Or maybe you can share something that, you know, with the class.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Good. Well, even. I'm happy to hear that. You sound confident in your knowledge there and a lot of us here do have a lot of good knowledge to share. So being in this group doesn't mean you don't necessarily know about it. Maybe you're going to be helping your classmates learn about",,,,
Luis,110.3,"How, okay.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"That's very exciting. It sounds like you have some first hand experience and I'm really glad we have you in our little circle here because that's great getting some more perspective, like that, um,",,,,
Teacher,110.3,That's incredibly exciting. I would hope that that's the case. And with water here that could help us in our future exploration. I'm glad to see you guys are listening to the topic and trying to expand on that knowledge. We know that Chris did visit NASA. We're very excited to see that.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,That's awesome. You can help me out with the other kids. How about that once you just chill out for a minute.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay so awesome. What you have Luis is a lot of background knowledge which is going to help you answer the question, because you have background knowledge and already understand the topic. That's great.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Awesome so Luis used his background knowledge and he was able to infer based off of information that is coming from our passage that yes, scientists do need lots of equipment so that's awesome. Luis","Awesome, so Luis used his background knowledge and he was able to infer based off of information that is coming from our passage that yes, scientists do need lots of equipment, so that's awesome. Luis",,2,
Teacher,110.3,"Awesome Chris, so you're also able to reference your background knowledge to help you dig deeper into this passage.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Awesome. Yes. So, and Luis was able to use his background knowledge to let us know and to infer from everything that tells us in our passage here that NASA and our scientists are using a lot of equipment. Can we all agree on that.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"OK. What all do you know about space? Let me know, and that way, you can help me with the rest of the group, OK? What do you know?",,,,
Luis,110.3,"I know that astronauts have to wear spacesuits, cause they can't breathe on the moon and in space. And then they also wear gravity boots, so that they can walk on the moon. And I know that they have boosters that get them up into space. And then they have to wait for a window in order to come back to Earth.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,Okay Mister Luis. And that's a good point. I'm glad you know a lot about space,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"And that's okay, maybe you can help me help someone else later. Let's wait off on that. Okay.",,,,
Luis,110.3,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, that is wonderful. I'm glad you know a lot about space, but maybe our friends don't. And maybe you can help me teach them Some new things about space.",,,,
Luis,110.3,Maybe I can teach you guys some stuff. Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,That would be a good thing.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, that is wonderful. Luis But we are still learning more information about space. So we're going to teach our friends. And so hopefully during the group if anybody else has questions, maybe you can help me, help them.",,,,
Luis,110.3,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,Very good. I like how you connected your experience of going to NASA to help you understand and reading the text better. That's a great experience you had a bet that was really cool.,Very good. I like how you connected your experience of going to NASA to help you understand and reading the text better.,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Thanks for sharing with us that your dad is an astronaut and I'm sure you do know a lot, but there's always more we can learn by reading and finding more details in the text we can always learn more",,,,
Teacher,110.3,But that's really cool that your dad is an astronaut about that's that's fun to talk about,,,,
Teacher,110.3,Great. That was a good question.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"That's good, but you can still remain in the group to help the others. If you know a lot about it. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Yeah, you, you. There's always a way for you to learn more. Right. I mean, we learn from each other has been going on. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"See, so that's where you find your answer. Okay. So always remember that you have a lot of experience.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, Luis I'm glad you are a part of this group, maybe you can share with us some of your",,,,
Teacher,110.3,Knowledge and help us expand our learning on space.,,,,
Luis,110.3,I can do that.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Oh, okay. So you have some prior knowledge of space travel, right.",,,,
Farrah,110.3,"Um, so my answer was that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look closely.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"And Chris, that's really cool. So what you learned there is that they're very scientific in their studies.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, maybe you can help the others.",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Okay, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"It ties, because sometimes our personal experience helps us  to understand what we're reading. And so Chris when you are reading, if you've seen these things at NASA, itt helps you to visualize them and to know more about them. And so that's a great thing to share with the class. Does anyone else have an experience that similar?",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Good. So sometimes if you if you already know something I think we can always learn more about it. Or maybe you could see if your classmates. Maybe they don't know it, and they need your help.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, maybe you can be a benefit to others by listening and offering some suggestions.",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Oh yeah, yeah, sure. I'll tell y'all what I know.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay, that would be great. Thanks for for helping us out.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,Or maybe you could help us out.,,,,
Luis,110.3,"Well, I was thinking that you know how I learned a lot about science is by I'm watching YouTube videos and and and watching the show on on on Nova show on PBS. So I was thinking that maybe Farrah needs to watch more more science videos.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, just like last time you had something to contribute to the group. So we're going to hang tight and maybe you can contribute some more. What do you think",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Oh,",,,,
Teacher,110.3,and you'll be able to share all your knowledge.,,,,
Luis,110.3,That sounds good.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Good. But every time we learn something we continue growing and learning. So we are going to listen to our friends. Okay, thank you for your input. And I'm glad that you know a lot about space and we can learn from you. Right?",,,,
Teacher,110.3,Luis You use very good background information. We know that you know about space,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay, we are going to use your",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Background knowledge. Okay, we've talked about background knowledge in you can help us.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,With more information about what we're learning. Okay.,,,,
Luis,110.3,"Yeah, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, I think that we don't know exactly everything quite yet. We can always learn more, but you can use some of your knowledge from what you know about space to help us.","Well, I think that we don't know exactly everything quite yet. We can always learn more, but you can use some of your knowledge from what you know about space to help us.",,2,
Luis,110.3,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,Do you really?,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Right, Chris and that's sort of what Luis said too, right? So that's great that you're using your background knowledge. Awesome.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"OK. Well, you can help me teach the others I really need you to still be in this group so that you can help me help us understand a little bit better.",,,,
Luis,110.3,OK.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Great. I bet that was-- I've seen some of this equipment. That's very neat. Thank you so much, Chris.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Oh, that's okay. Well, we can always learn new things about topics. So you can help me, you know, help us learn more about it.",,,,
Luis,110.3,All,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Oh well, I really need you to stay in our group and and you can help me with like information and things. Okay.",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Yeah. Okay, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,You can help you can be my helper.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Oh, that would be neat when it that that that's only four years away.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,That is awesome that you know all the extra stuff. And we're just trying to learn about the water so you know so much more you're going to add some equipment to your,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, you know, I liked your response, the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,","Well, you know, I liked your response, the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,",,2,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay, well, maybe you can help us. Have, help us with the other students understanding of space and we can pull from details from the text just to reaffirm your knowledge and what your prior knowledge is",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Okay, that sounds good.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay. Alright, well I'm glad you know all of that information.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,There's a lot of things that we need to have whenever we go into space. Now that's very fascinating that you were able to visit NASA,,,,
Teacher,110.3,That's a great cultural experience and it gives you a little insight into having some prior knowledge as you move forward in your science classes.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,Now astronauts and scientists have to use all kinds of equipment and certain materials that they have to wear when they go into space because it's such an unknown area and we want to be as safe as possible.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"So when you got to see all of those things that NASA you were able to see some of the space suits, some of the tools and equipment that they use.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Right, I'm super jealous that you had NASA but",,,,
Chris,110.3,Me and my dad went,,,,
Teacher,110.3,maybe you can help your partner's out Luis I think you would be a great addition to our group.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Oh, well that's really great. That's, that's awesome. That you know all about space. Maybe you can add to our conversation.",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Okay. Okay, so what I I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"But like you said, scientists do have to use oxygen up in space, so they can survive.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,I'm glad you do know stuff about oxygen tanks and things like that. And it will help you,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, maybe you can help some of us understand things better by being in this group then",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"That's awesome. Um, it's always good when we have that background knowledge that we can pull in",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"That's great that you know that stuff. But what I'd like you to do, you can help other students learn more to, would you like to do that?",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Yeah, that sounds like fun. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Yes, but you can help some of the other students. So let's, uh, we'll use your contribution to help help the other students as well.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,You know a lot about some of the equipment NASA uses.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Right, Luis, so you'll be able to share some information with us. And maybe you can learn from your friends to okay",,,,
Luis,110.3,Off. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Your right and so, Luis, said the same thing, right. Luis What was something that you said that scientists use",,,,
Luis,110.3,I said oxygen tanks too and spacesuit.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay, well I'm so glad that you know a lot about space",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Chris and Luis I think you both did a great job at may at using your outside resources. So different things that you've experienced in your life related to this. And I think that that's awesome. And no, you are not wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,and maybe even help others learn more about science and sort of explore their own strengths within that type of knowledge.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well that's that's that's really cool, you know, sort of idea that you have that sort of special inroads you know you're a you know first hand knowledge of some of this might actually come, you know, sort of in handy and help somebody goes to kind of understand this material.",,,,
Luis,110.3,Awesome.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"I'm so glad you know a lot about space because we need all the knowledge to help us, especially with these questions that we have today. I'm glad that you brought that up about space because that's why we're here today.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay, so, and Luis brought up about space and I'm glad that he did that. That's a good point.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"It's different. Some things are different. Now in school right and we're learning differently. And you guys have done a great job by looking more into this because you can use some of your knowledge that you have, or you've read about NASA to help you with things like this and help our partners. Alright, so let's go back to our question.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Oh wow, that's awesome information because you know what that can help us out today about learning about the importance",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Thank you, Luis, because I know that you can make some great connections about your dad because I know he has shared a lot of information about things that he has done it work.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"I bet Luis could confirm that about his dad probably has told him too, right Luis?",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Yeah. Yeah, true, very true. Very good.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"That's great, Luis. You know what you gave me a great idea. I want each one of you to get a little piece of paper.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay, so you do have some, some of a good foundation on space. So when we cover more about space. It seems like you'll be able to help some of your classmates. Right.",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Yeah, that sounds pretty good.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay, so maybe maybe we go forward. Maybe I'll have you been one of our group leaders. Okay.",,,,
Luis,110.3,All right.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"So I think that means you probably have a lot, you could share with the rest of the group about some of your experience with NASA and maybe we could talk about that here in a little bit and you could tell us some more interesting facts.",,,,
Chris,110.3,"Okay, yeah, that sounds great.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay, so maybe you and Luis could be our two leaders when it comes to some of the having a little more knowledge about space. Okay.",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Yeah, awesome.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"If you think you have a, you know, if you know a lot about space. Don't you think that would make it even better for you to be in this group to help the rest of us. And maybe we could learn from each other.",,,,
Luis,110.3,"That's a good point, okay I'll stick around.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Um, you know so much about space, let's let's maybe see if you can share some of that with your classmates.",,,,
Luis,110.3,"So, okay, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,And that obviously shows your understanding of space. That's really cool.,,,,
Luis,110.3,Uh huh.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,I've never been the NASA. So that's really cool that you have that experience.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay, so we read it aloud. Right. You read it for us because you know everything about space already",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"That I love that. I wish I could go to NASA, but I'm very far away.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,But I think that's really cool and and i love that you all have this experience about space and you all know that there's these different types of equipment that work together so,But I think that's really cool and and i love that you all have this experience about space and you all know that there's these different types of equipment that work together so,,1,
Teacher,110.3,I know I could tell by your answer that you really enjoy space that you know that they use oxygen tanks to be up in space and to explore up there.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,Yeah and this lunar orbiter like we are talking about. That's super cool.,,,,
Chris,110.3,"So yeah, I think I might have seen that at NASA, I just realized that, cool","So yeah, I think I might have seen that at NASA. I just realized that, cool.",,,
Teacher,110.3,"And if you I would like you to use your knowledge that you already know to share with the other students in the group. Okay, so",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Yeah, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,For me response. You do know quite a lot. So maybe you can actually help me teach the other students here.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"So I think, I think you're gonna help us learn some stuff too.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, thank you for letting us know Luis",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Hopefully one day, Kevin. Unless I'm tell us a little bit about his experience there as well.",,,,
Luis,110.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,So you're very enthusiastic about space you enjoy it.,,,,
Luis,110.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, I definitely think it would help if you stuck around and maybe you can help encourage your classmates to learn a little bit more, and even learn a little more yourself.",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Okay, yeah, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,And maybe if you do understand everything you can help out some of your classmates.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"And like you said, I think they are planning on building a base on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"that's not referencing the text, but I do believe you are right about that.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Whoo, that's fabulous. Maybe you can help us understand even more about space. So stay with this group, you might be able to help us.",,,,
Luis,110.3,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,And maybe you can help some of the other students because for some students. This might be their first time learning about space.,,,,
Luis,110.3,"Okay, yeah, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,Now that could actually help out with this next question.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"And needs and these can be things that you're dad can use being an astronaut. Okay, we'll start over here with Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,110.3,"Um, yeah. Okay. So I said no.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, awesome. I'm glad that you know all about space. Maybe you should can share some other things with your friends today while we're talking. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,wow that's pretty soon that's not very far away at all.,,,,
Chris,110.3,"Right it's all so maybe they if they have a base, then they could have water there.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,Classmates said don't know so your background knowledge really does help.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay, thank you for using your outside knowledge to contribute to the conversation.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Thank you, thank you for your answer, and thank you for explaining in case anyone didn't know.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,No worries. So even though I know you guys all know lots about space and Luis You may know more about space than everyone else in the group.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Awesome. Well, that's really cool. And the fact that you guys know so much about space already means you definitely have some good background knowledge that you can connect",,,,
Teacher,110.3,And they would need those on the moon. And I know you said you know a lot about space. So that is a very good response.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Yeah, they definitely do use all of that equipment and that is a great answer. Chris. I also just want to make sure, similar to Luis I know that you guys have lots of knowledge about space and",,,,
Teacher,110.3,yeah that's awesome i'm glad that you have that background knowledge of what astronauts use.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,yeah that is really cool um and again that's a good example of some background knowledge that you have about the topic.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Yeah, that's really cool that you got to experience that. I bet not everyone has. I definitely haven't, but that is a really cool thing to to share with the class.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Nice job, Chris.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,Absolutely good job way to think outside of the text.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,all right awesome job Luis I like that you didn't.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,have to use the text there's a ton of other equipment that scientists used.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,And this one you thought about using your knowledge of NASA,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"That's super cool. I wish, I wish. I went to NASA. Maybe I might have to go there soon. Awesome. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Because we'd love to have you here, your expertise could help us all as well okay okay so um we'll start off with.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"So you know a lot about space and you think that your answer was good, of how you know",,,,
Teacher,110.3,Some final words like oxygen. And you know what an oxygen tank is and you know all the equipment they use,,,,
Luis,110.3,Yeah I know all about it. My dad's an astronaut,,,,
Teacher,110.3,See you already have some background knowledge on this.,,,,
Chris,110.3,"Yo, yeah. Yeah, I love space.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,So you know a lot about what the scientists use on in space and what they actually use them for,,,,
Chris,110.3,"Oh yeah, I know. Like, all kinds of stuff about that and I LIKE I REALLY KNOW ABOUT",,,,
Teacher,110.3,but you guys have some background knowledge and it's really good. I like what you guys came up with.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"That's really cool. Chris, I want to thank you for sharing your personal experience with us. That really helps us build on what we're learning.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"So you also had a great answer, scientists can use a lot of things. And like you said you know a lot about space. So you've seen that they can use a lot of things.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"and also if we continue our readings outside of class, we can learn a little bit more like you said you know a lot about space. So the more we continue reading about it, the more we can learn about it. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"that's a really good connection, so the note the news that you're hearing outside of the text so yeah this equipment will definitely help them get there, thank you for adding that.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Yeah, that's great background knowledge to bring to the table.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"That's awesome. So I that's great that you have really good knowledge about NASA, which can come in handy in the future,",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"We're looking for something to find it, but that as a good point, thank you for sharing.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,and then by the end you probably could teach me something about space.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"No okay well see I told you we're going to teach me something about space that I didn't know and there, it is nice job.",,,,
Luis,110.3,"So, we could say, like all of the equipment for the answer.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,that's really cool I appreciate you telling us and teaching the rest of our students that fact that's a really cool fact.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,You probably do know a lot about space.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"That's really good that you know all those things, Chris. Those are really good things to know. It's really interesting.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,yeah that's awesome and um hopefully you can bring some of that knowledge into today's lesson i'm excited about that.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"I know you know all about space I'm, I'm sure you all know a lot about space.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, that's awesome. Now you can help the rest of your friends, learn about space too. So I think you should stay with us.",,,,
Luis,110.3,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay i'm glad that you know so much about this already, but I think you should stay, so you can help me with this assignment with your classmates. Does that sound okay?",,,,
Luis,110.3,"yeah yeah Okay, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well i'm so glad that you already know so much about space, but do you think you could stay and help me answer the questions for your other classmates too.",,,,
Luis,110.3,yeah I get I can stick around for that yeah for sure.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Describe your intro, which is awesome because I could tell that you know so much about scientists and space.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"right they do so you, it seems like everyone in this group has a lot of background information about space, which is great, so you probably, when reading this article, connected a lot to it which is really great, but when we looked at the text, it said",,,,
Teacher,110.3,Right I love that you have some background information on that Chris that's great,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"It's great that you have background knowledge, though.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Right, so that actually has to do with like the second question is great that you know that, and you can use that background knowledge.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Oh, maybe you can tell us and share what you know it does so we also can know about it. What do you think?",,,,
Luis,110.3,"OK, I'll do that.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"That's good. Thank you for saying the exact names. Well, that's exactly what I'm looking for, because you've been to NASA, you know all about it, but I haven't. And I love hearing what you've experienced. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, you can you can then if you know questions that you might know the answers to questions that some of I might need help with or some of our classmates might need help with. So I think you're going to be a pretty vital part of our group.",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Yeah, sounds really cool.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"That's really cool. Thank you for sharing. And maybe when we're doing a bigger writing assignment about this unit, we can include some of the details that we already learned from other places, like maybe Luis's read other books about space, and you've been to NASA. So that's really cool. And I'd love for us to get a chance for you to share that maybe during a show-and-tell.",,,,
Chris,110.3,"OK, OK. That sounds really cool.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"And that's OK, sometimes we need to know a little bit deeper. And maybe just help our other classmates to understand just what we're talking about and maybe get our minds going a little bit.",,,,
Luis,110.3,OK,,,,
Teacher,110.3,You'd be a really great resource for us. So why don't you hang tight.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"i'm so glad that you know a lot about space, but I think you staying in our group would really benefit our other classmates because maybe you could share some information that you already know about space that sounds good.",,,,
Luis,110.3,awesome yeah that sounds great i'm super into that.,"awesome, yeah. that sounds great. i'm super into that.",,,
Teacher,110.3,yeah that's our hopes right scientists works really hard,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Do you know what since you know so much about space when you talk to your partners, you can tell them a little bit more of what you know. But I need","Do you know what? since you know so much about space, when you talk to your partners, you can tell them a little bit more of what you know.",,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, honestly, I think that you could be a great resource for your group members and you could help them, maybe like come up with our own answers, or maybe tell them what you think to.",,,,
Oliver,110.3,"Okay, I found it so it was in the um third paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,uh huh oh that's cool yeah.,,,,
Chris,110.3,um well you didn't you didn't say anything about my answer is my answer right.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, I love you bringing in your background knowledge saying that you've been to NASA before. That's really cool.",,,,
Chris,110.3,"Yeah, me and my dad went.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay, so we're going to work on that. But it's really great that you know a lot about space that's going to be really helpful with how you answer the questions.","Okay, so we're going to work on that. But it's really great that you know a lot about space. that's going to be really helpful with how you answer the questions.",,,
Teacher,110.3,That would be really cool and maybe we would see some of the stuff that we're reading about actually taking place and we have all this knowledge about it now because we read about it.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"You're right, they do use a lot of different equipment.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,But - And I really enjoyed like how you use your background knowledge to help you support this. Because like you said you know a lot about space,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"But I think Farrah by you being here, you can use - your friends and your classmates can use you as a resource if they have questions in the future about the readings or assignments that we're doing, because it seems like you really understand understand this assignment.",,,,
Farrah,110.3,That's great. Thank you.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"yeah, so I think you're right like because you went to NASA you're able to use your background knowledge and you're able to build off of what you already know.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"that's a really, really cool that's really interesting, I wonder, if it will happen, maybe it won't..",,,,
Farrah,110.3,"yeah Okay, I only do what you were saying about Jazmin's answer because she didn't say the name of the machine but.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, I'm glad you know a lot about space already because we know background knowledge is very important. So maybe there's a few things that you could share with us that you know that may be myself or the other students might not know",,,,
Teacher,110.3,And you could help us to understand better,,,,
Luis,110.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Yeah, great. I'm glad you brought that up your background knowledge.",,,,
Chris,110.3,"Yeah, well, they had to like you had to use the suits to get off the spaceship and go walk around and look for water.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"that's very good that you have all this like information in your head, so I feel like well I don't know about the rest of the class, but maybe you would have a better and a better answer to go so.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Yeah. I mean, that's great. That's great that you have that background knowledge. I really appreciate you adding that to the conversation. I think that's really, really important.",,,,
Chris,110.3,OK. Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,So did you bring in that background knowledge that you already knew?,,,,
Teacher,110.3,Think it's good. So you can share your answers with the rest of the class because maybe someone might not know as well as you do.,,,,
Luis,110.3,"Cool. Yeah, yeah, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,and maybe you can help me help the students to figure out how we can get them to really dive into the text.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"I mean, obviously you need oxygen to survive. So that's a very good observation.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,That's awesome. Space is so cool and I'm so glad that it's a passion of yours.,,,,
Chris,110.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"They do. They use all of that. That's really great. So that's what we would call background knowledge. That's stuff that you know before even reading the article, and that's really awesome.",,,,
Luis,110.3,"OK. OK. OK, well it looks like it is time for us to go to lunch, but I did want to say, Mr. Dallas, thank you so much for explaining what each of us needs to specifically work on. So now I know that I should explain my ideas or say them in my own words, even if they're the same as what somebody else said. And then I also heard you tell Jazmin what she should work on, too. So thank you very much.","OK. OK.

Teacher,110.3,"You know all about space, Luis?",,,,
Teacher,110.3,Oh that's very cool Chris.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Right, so you really are thinking outside of the box. You're not just reading the article and just using what the article has given us, you're thinking outside of the box. And thinking about the other equipment that they might use. Yeah.",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Yeah, cuz I mean, I read a lot about space.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,Well that's great that you know so you can help us learn even more things about the space and then maybe you might even learn something new. You never know. Thank you for sharing that though.,,,,
Luis,110.3,Yeah okay perfect spot.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,That's awesome. That you know all about space. So you can definitely help add in different things that we may have not even known or not discussed in the article.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,You do know a lot about space.,,,,
Luis,110.3,"Yeah, I, I'm kind of space expert on which is why I picked oxygen tanks. That's my answer.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,I'm sure it is. I hope that you'll be able to use some of that knowledge that know to talk about this exciting discovery of finding water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,110.3,"Yeah, yeah. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,but you can certainly help even with your background knowledge.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,I can tell you have a lot of background information on space based on your answer.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"That's really awesome. Luis I hope that after today's discussion, you can go home and you can talk to him about some of the ideas that we come up with in our discussion about water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well i'm glad you have an interest in space and i'm glad that you know what but maybe you can contribute a little bit of your knowledge to the rest of the group, so you might find some use there.",,,,
Luis,110.3,Okay yeah that sounds great i'd love to do that.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Good I will, I am glad that you're able to think about another experience that helps you relate to the text.",,,,

Teacher,110.3,Luis You're totally right. You know so much in your brain about space.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"So, Luis. You definitely have knowledge on this subject.",,,,
Luis,110.3,Oh yeah I know everything about space I watch all the videos on YouTube all about space I pretty much know everything there is to know,,,,
Teacher,110.3,But I think that background knowledge that you have inside your brain is going to be a huge help.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"So Chris, it sounds like you know a lot about equipment that NASA uses.","So Chris, it sounds like you know a lot about equipment that NASA uses.",,1,
Teacher,110.3,"Yeah, that's great. Maybe you can help your other classmates in if they have any questions they may ask you.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,It's okay?,,,,
Luis,110.3,"Yeah, that sounds great.",,,,

Luis,110.3,"Oh yeah, that sounds awesome.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Wow, great you know a lot about space so you may be an expert in our group, so you can help our classmates to clarify their misunderstanding, or all the things they want to know, okay?",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Yeah, sounds great.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Teacher : Right, so I don't disagree that you can learn a lot from YouTube, have boats, the scientists and astronauts and rockets.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,Teacher : Right. So that's really cool that you've been to NASA and you have all this background knowledge.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,That's right. That's all really interesting information Chris.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,I know I'm sure you do. I know you have a lot of background information on that since you've read so many books. I'm sure see movies or tv shows,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Oh, awesome. Well, then you can help us in talking about space since you are ready and ready to go.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Right, so that's so cool that you have that extra information.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Oh wow, that's so cool Chris. Until then, you might be able to help me in telling me what the lunar orbiter does how it looks. How, what it does to look for the water",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Great. So, you, you, you're right. You do know so many different pieces of equipment that NASA uses",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, good, then you can help maybe our other friends understand some more about the water on the moon, like the text that we read, so I'm going to ask a quick question.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Oh wow, I'm so impressed that you know that that's awesome Chris,",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Wow, to know all about space, you must know a lot","Wow, to know all about space, you must know a lot.",,2,
Luis,110.3,I do,,,,
Teacher,110.3,Maybe that you can teach the rest of us about,,,,
Luis,110.3,"Oh, I know a lot about space because I watch all sorts of YouTube videos about rockets and all of the planets and stuff.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"So interesting, maybe you can use some of your background knowledge to add to your answer.",,,,
Luis,110.3,"Yeah, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Okay, I know it's awesome that you know so much about space and you do you really do know a lot about space.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Because those are things that we might not know, but because you have that experience with NASA you're able to share that with us and I really appreciate it.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Luis I think it's awesome that you know so much about space and I really appreciate you sharing that with me,",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Yeah, you're absolutely right. Chris. Thank you for sharing with us. We all seem to know a lot about space and about NASA um",,,,
Teacher,110.3,Wow that's so cool. I really appreciate you sharing that with me.,,,,

Luis,110.3,I thought so that's why I had to say it.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, that's actually awesome that you know about space because maybe you might you might know some things that you you your classmates don't even know. So you can help, help me teach them about space and you might even learn some new things too. So thanks again for work.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Well, you know, that's I'm glad you reiterate that, again, Luis, because since you're the expert, we may be coming back to you.",,,,

Teacher,110.3,"Luis you know I certainly welcome your input about space and i'm excited to learn about what you've learned about space, I think that we can all certainly learn from one another and.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"And you know i'm excited actually Luis to learn, you know from you and you learn from one another,",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Oh, then you can explain to your classmate then before you leave then.",,,,
Luis,110.3,Okay that sounds good.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,or at the same time or you can help other classmate who they may not have on,,,,
Luis,110.3,okay okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,yeah you do know a lot about space.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"but they definitely if there are astronauts on the moon they're definitely going to need things like those big helmets and their space suits and oxygen tanks, those are super important for people if they're going up in space.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Yes, that is, I love that you already know a lot about space Luis",,,,
Luis,110.3,yeah okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,Maybe you can help us with a couple things Luis,Maybe you can help us with a couple things Luis.,,,

Chris,110.3,yeah geology is like the study of rocks.,,,,
Teacher,110.3,"Oh well, Luis that's awesome because you know what I had to do a little bit of research myself to learn about space and so maybe since you're here in this group.",,,,
Teacher,110.3,And that's amazing because you know what if then i'm thinking that maybe because you know so much about space already you can kind of be almost like an expert for us today and for our lesson.,,,,

Teacher,110.4,Yes.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Right. Once they found it.,,,,
Farrah,110.4,"Okay, um, okay, y'all I so I get it because you you you told Oliver what it is, but, I guess I, I don't know like how how you got there. Like, I know I can say it, but I don't know how, how um",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Okay, Jazmin, Jazmin, you put NASA sent a small machine. Yes, they did. They did send a small machine. It was called the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Jazmin,110.4,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Exactly, yes. Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"Fortunate we have to go to our next class. But before we go, I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us. This was really interesting. It was really fun to work with. Thank you.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, it does. And I'm but yes you are. You two are correct. It is the Lunar Orbiter. So you are right there.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,It is,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Very good.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"So, in paragraph one, it does tell us, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Just those two pieces of equipment. Okay, wonderful.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Mm hmm.,Mm hmm.,,1,
Teacher,110.4,It is called a lunar orbiter isn't it.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,SO let's look there. They did find water on the moon. That is correct. Yeah you Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"I'm still looking. like, why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Right. That is exactly right.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Lunar Orbiter. That is the small machine. Okay. That's right.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,That's right.,,,,
Luis,110.4,"Yeah, right I see that too, I see that too.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Absolutely, absolutely. I think a lunar orbiter is really key here. Right. They can't get any of their equipment up to the moon. Without that sort of orbiter right","Absolutely, absolutely. I think a lunar orbiter is really key here. Right. They can't get any of their equipment up to the moon. Without that sort of orbiter right?",,,
Jazmin,110.4,"Well,",,,,
Teacher,110.4,That's absolutely one of the pieces of equipment that was used to send there and,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"All right, Farrah, you said that you use a microscope to look closely at what you found in the crater.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"That is correct. You did very well. It's the Lunar Orbiter. That's how they actually examine the water and the craters. Yes, Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,110.4,"Um, so what I'm confused though is, is my answer wrong, or is Jazmin's answer wrong? I said the microscope and Jazmin said the lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Very good.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"That is right. That is a good job, Chris. Thank you.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,That is the machine that collected the water,,,,
Farrah,110.4,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Correct. I would, I would agree with that.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Equipment I,,,,
Oliver,110.4,"Water, and water.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes. So that's our topic is water, for sure. Okay, now",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Good job, Jazmin. Thank you so much. Miss Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,110.4,"Um yeah I wondering like, I think I'm still confused. Like why my answer is wrong.","Um, yeah, I wondering like, I think I'm still confused. Like why my answer is wrong.",,,
Teacher,110.4,Words in paragraph three,Words in paragraph three,,2,
Teacher,110.4,Good a lunar orbiter and it said that that was a small machine.,Good. a lunar orbiter and it said that that was a small machine.,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Okay, so, Farrah agrees, Oliver and Chris agree. Luis agrees. Good job, guys. All right. You can put your hands down.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,but the Lunar Orbiter it's what they use to find water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Okay, so a microscopic okay, so the lunar orbiter is what you use to discover the water",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Oh, absolutely. That's how they would find it.",,,,
Farrah,110.4,"Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. So did they use the microscope. I'm like, it sounds like they used it. So I guess. Did they say they had to do something else before they used the microscope.","Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. So did they use the microscope. I'm like, it sounds like they used it. So I guess. Did they say they had to do something else before they used the microscope?",,,
Teacher,110.4,"That's right, they could drink the water in the future.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Oh, absolutely would be expensive. Yes, Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,110.4,"Um, so, unfortunately, unfortunately, we, we have to go to our next class. But before we go, I really wanted to thank you","Um, so, unfortunately, unfortunately, we, we have to go to our next class. But before we go, I really wanted to thank you.",,1,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, more details.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Wonderful. That is great.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,The Lunar Orbiter. Right.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Correct. It was a machine called a lunar orbiter and Jazmin did a good job, remembering that it was a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, there you go. There you go. Perfect.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,There you go. Yep.,,,,
Luis,110.4,Ok ok so scientists sent the Lunar Orbiter to the moon.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,There you go. Discover water right so,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Bring their own right?,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah. Alright, so there's that. That's a, that's a good valuable reason to have water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,There you go. And it's a lot easier to get out into space.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Very good.,,,,
Oliver,110.4,"Like, like, yeah, when you find it.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Very good, very good. Jazmin so investigate. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"All right, very good. So it's a Oliverice that is used right?",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Right, Jazmin means to look for, right, or to discover as as the question asked you,. Yes, Chris?",,,,
Chris,110.4,"Um, yeah, I was just kind of wondering like, so I went to NASA with my dad and we had a chance to like look at all the displays all the rockets and stuff.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"There you go, you got it. Okay, so",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Was that you. That is absolutely correct.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Mhmm. It's the lunar orbiter that they sent to look for the water.,Mhmm. It's the lunar orbiter that they sent to look for the water.,,,
Teacher,110.4,They could breathe it.,They could breathe it.,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"And I just, I'm still kind of confused about how to how to structure the answer so that it's a better answer.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, so when you find something for the very first time.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Yes. Awesome job.,,,,
Chris,110.4,"Well, I actually have a question.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Yes equipment is one of the terms equipment Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,I was thinking discover,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Discover. Okay, good. What else","Discover. Okay, good. What else?",,,
Chris,110.4,"Well for me, I was thinking about water seem to be an important word in the question.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Yes.,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,Great.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, you're right.",,,,
Chris,110.4,"So, I mean, that feels like that could be like some tools that they would use to somebody equipment, you know,",,,,
Teacher,110.4,So it is very valuable and you guys are all giving me good answers on that. Yeah.,,,,
Oliver,110.4,"I was in paragraph one, it says, water is heavy. And it says,",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, and you need water to survive. Yes, you're right.",,,,
Chris,110.4,"Yeah, I also know, like you said that water splits into oxygen and hydrogen.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Those are the tools that they are using to discover water on the moon,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Okay? NASA sent a small machine,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Mm hmm.,Mm hmm.,,,
Teacher,110.4,Good job.,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"That's what, that's what I think cuz is like investigate's like discover. So I think that's what they said discovered the water",,,,
Teacher,110.4,The lunar orbiter. That's right.,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"Which unfortunately we have to go to our next class. But before we go, I just wanted to thank you for working with us a lot of fun. Thank you so much.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Yes.,,,,
Chris,110.4,"I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, and masks, and suits.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, exactly.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,You are exactly right.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,And you're right we so we do need that.,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"Um, that future astronauts could drink the water",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, it's the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,The Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"Well, I guess, I'm not sure, I guess think about it.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Oh, and move. Yes, those are important as well.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Exactly right. Yes.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Correct.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"I agree. So moving forward, yeah that's that's very important. So",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Good, good, good. I know what I mean.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Good. It could be useful in a lot of ways. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,and you put it out perfectly. It could be useful in lots of ways. So it could be very important.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,That's correct.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,That's exactly right.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,A lunar orbiter. So that's what they used to investigate what were they investigating.,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,Ice deposits,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah. So what they use was the Moon, lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,What's right,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Your rights right so if there was water on the moon, it would be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Chris you did a good job for answering and you say to that water can be valuable because it's so heavy and then astronauts wouldn't have to carry it anymore. Correct.,,,,
Chris,110.4,I have. Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"You are correct. Yes, Jazmin",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Correct.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"OK, so the machine was the Lunar Orbiter. So why don't you go ahead and circle that and then I'm going to come back to you in just a moment. Let me hear from Chris Chris, what were you gonna say",,,,
Chris,110.4,"Okay, so basically, I was gonna say, kind of like, I guess, kind of like what Luis said before, like I went to NASA with my dad and like I know that scientists have to use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and all that kind of stuff. So like I guess I'm wondering, like, is that I guess that's not the answer, but didn't they have to use that stuff to find the water?",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Exactly. So they had to discover it first, before they could use the microphone.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, so that's that's the small machine. They sent",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Exactly. It's discovering water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,110.4,A lunar orbiter.,A lunar orbiter.,,,
Teacher,110.4,Excellent. So NASA see the machine and it's called a winner orbiter.,Excellent. So NASA see the machine and it's called a lunar orbiter.,,,
Teacher,110.4,Investigated.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Okay, so it looked for ice deposits in a large",,,,
Luis,110.4,Crater.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Polar crater. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,So they were really small.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, the lunar orbiter investigated microscopic us on the moon. That is excellent.",,,,
Oliver,110.4,"Oh wow, okay. Teacher, it's time for us to go to lunch, but wow I really, really appreciate how","Oh wow, okay. Teacher, it's time for us to go to lunch, but wow I really, really appreciate how",,,
Teacher,110.4,Absolutely Equipment they used to discover the water,,,,
Luis,110.4,"I'm okay. It's like when you got a space, you know and and or when you're looking for the telescope and then you see a new a new planet or no star, and you're like, oh wow you know like I discovered her new star, I discovered a new planet like that.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"A tool. That's exactly right. So,",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"That's right. Yeah, so that's a great example of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, a lunar orbiter. So you're absolutely right. So,","Yeah, a lunar orbiter. So you're absolutely right.",,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah. No, you're right. Farrah that",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"I think you, you're absolutely right. It is find water.","I think you, you're absolutely right. It is find water.",,,
Teacher,110.4,Absolutely. So we can use water as rocket fuel. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Very good.,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,Good split it in two parts.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Right, so we have water we have rocket fuel",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"That's wonderful. I do believe that that is a correct answer. So, good job there,",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, NASA used a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,that would also count as a piece of equipment. Right.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Very well. So they do use that kind of equipment on the moon to breathe, like you said",,,,
Teacher,110.4,So I heard a few of you guys say that you underlined a lunar orbiter and small machine.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,so Luis you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. That is true. They do need oxygen.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Very good, very good.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, there was a small amount of water that they found. Mm hmm.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Right,Right.,,,
Chris,110.4,"Okay, okay.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,They actually use that to find it. Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Exactly.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Exactly, exactly. So you're right. They do need a small machine and,",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Exactly and Chris, you got you got to that part. I just mentioned with Jazmin right that water is heavy. So",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Lunar Orbiter. Right. Correct. This is the. That's what we were looking for.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Correct.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Awesome. Alright, so, Jazmin was back in the story, and she found that the other tool is called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Awesome. So, so he's a lunar orbiter and a microscope in order to find water on the moon. Alright so next time.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,yeah that's right water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen.,"yeah, that's right. water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen.",,,
Teacher,110.4,Alright perfect awesome.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Right.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,right there you go Oliveron or Oliver.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,awesome job Jazmin,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, which you did, so awesome.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,amazing that is just what I was looking for.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,I like how you said that and is um and it's obviously super important there be able to breathe and then um.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"awesome that is so so good, that is what I wanted you to look for.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Which is good awesome which shows that you now the equipment that was used was the Lunar orbiter to help discover the water on the moon awesome. Oliver, yes.",,,,
Oliver,110.4,Sorry to interrupt. I was just looking at the time and it's time for us to go. So we'll have to see you later.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Yep.,,,,
Luis,110.4,And Ice deposits are frozen water.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Yes. So that is the equipment.,,,,
Luis,110.4,"Oh, yeah, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, that's what I was looking for your perfect",,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"Oh, OK.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,That's right.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,I think you've convinced me,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"That I guess I still don't know how come I'm in the group kiss my answer was right, I got it from the right place.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, that's a great example Oliver, thank you for explaining that to us.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, that's a great example, thank you Oliver for that.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, lunar orbiter.",,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"Ok, um NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter.","Ok, um NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter.",,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, there you go.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"So, that's awesome.",,,,
Jazmin,110.4,Oh that's it?,,,,
Teacher,110.4,and it's the Lunar orbiter is a small machine and,,,,
Teacher,110.4,It definitely could have been just up there lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Good. So there are a few different answers that you could have, but the lunar orbiter is definitely one of the answers that you could have,",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"So yes, that is one of the answers to that. The equipment was used to find water on the moon. So great job.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,yeah that is correct.,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"Okay, that makes sense because.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,I think so to water is a super valuable resource wherever you go.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,That's right. So the scientists did use a tool called the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Exactly.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,That was a perfect response.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, perfect.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Good job, Luis.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Perfect. Great job.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,The microscope. Great job. Jazmin.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Perfect. Great job, Chris.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Perfect. Great job, Oliver.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,A lunar orbiter. Great.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Nice.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, so they use the Lunar Orbiter. Correct. Good job.",,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"so my answer with this. It was NASA send a small machine, but I was like why why is my answer wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, NASA sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"OK, so that's what I should say? NASA sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon?",,,,
Teacher,110.4,We already had the Lunar orbiter part.,,,,
Farrah,110.4,I think I already put evidence in my answer too.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,In the craters.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"To find water on the moon, and because.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Again Farrah kind of touched on it and her answer.,,,,
Farrah,110.4,To look at the water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,110.4,To look at the water.,To look at the water.,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Definitely, the Lunar orbit are so that's why we're including the Lunar orbiter in our answer.",,,,
Jazmin,110.4,Okay. And then the microscopic word?,,,,
Teacher,110.4,There you go. So that was a small machine that they use to investigate the moon to look into the large polar craters.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,They did. So scientists used a lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Awesome. So you have the lunar. You're right.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, exactly. Thank you for sharing Chris, so the water was found in this craters.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah. Okay, great, great job. Okay.",,,,
Luis,110.4,"Yeah,  they need to breathe when they're out there looking for the water",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, you are right.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Great. So the small machine is the lunar...,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, your right.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, you are. Your right.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"All right, the lunor orbiter.",,,,
Chris,110.4,"Okay, so",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Yes.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, you are right.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Yes. So the oxygen tanks are providing oxygens. Right.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, correct. Luis So the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Luis,110.4,Says that they they used it to investigate and it looks for ice deposits and a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes. That's exactly right. Nice work, Luis.","Yes. That's exactly right. Nice work, Luis.",,2,
Teacher,110.4,They still had to use it. Correct.,,,,
Oliver,110.4,"Excuse me, must go on. I just looked at the clock, it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. Yes Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,110.4,I'm so sorry. I just locked up a lot. And we actually have to go to lunch now.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes. Good work. That's the equipment that they used to discover the water on the moon. Nice job, Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, exactly.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Exactly.,,,,
Luis,110.4,"Oh, OK, I see that make sense.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, that's absolutely correct. So the lunar orbiter is what was used, so that the scientists could discover that that water.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, that's exactly right, Oliver.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Oh, Luis. Let's be kind to our friends, that's really not the way we treat each other in the classroom. So, um, you're right. Luis It is the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"You're off to a good start, like how you said he's a word from the story.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Thank you for that answer. Farrah. Thank you. I agree, it is very that is an important word to pay attention to equipment is.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, thank you. Farrah. Thank you Chris for contributing that and for answering my question. I agree. I think equipment is an important word to focus on in",,,,
Teacher,110.4,That's the answer that I was looking for.,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"Oh, so I just had to say the name",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, you are correct. There is there is something new for us. We didn't know that we can get water on the moon.","Yeah, you are correct. There is, there is something new for us. We didn't know that we can get water on the moon.",,,
Teacher,110.4,Yeah definitely is very important. Thank you for for responding.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Or good Luis I like that it's out prefer if you raise your hand so we can keep that same routine gone but thank you. You're correct. So, good job.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Awesome. Thank you for letting me. I think we're getting to the right place.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,And what I heard from you guys is that they used a lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon.,And what I heard from you guys is that they used a lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon.,,,
Teacher,110.4,yeah they definitely used the Lunar orbiter um to find the source of the water um so I wanted to talk to um.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,So the answer for Farrah was correct one right.,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"So, how did they use that machine, though, because they talked about that too didn't they use that to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes I think we today, you need to see microscope, so it is very small amount they found the water or I think.  Chris.",,,,
Chris,110.4,Okay well in the part that i've read it said that they found the water deep in the moon's polar craters and when I go swimming in the deep part of the pool there's more water in the deep part of the pool than in the shallow part of the pool,"Okay well, in the part that i've read, it said that they found the water deep in the moon's polar craters and when I go swimming in the deep part of the pool, there's more water in the deep part of the pool than in the shallow part of the pool.",,,
Teacher,110.4,Part Three okay.,,,,
Farrah,110.4,"Ya there's a sentence It says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's where I found it.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Oh that's a great answer Oliver.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Okay, so you're absolutely right, it does look like it's a lunar orbiter",,,,
Oliver,110.4,yeah i'm so sorry but it's time for us to know.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,that's correct that's correct very good Jazmin,,,,
Teacher,110.4,Exactly yeah it's called a lunar orbiter,,,,
Teacher,110.4,yeah it is it's both they use both machines both pieces of equipment or tools.,,,,
Farrah,110.4,Okay okay so um I guess i'm still just not sure how the microscope and the Lunar orbiter like how they fit together in the same answer?,,,,
Teacher,110.4,yeah the small machine is one of the pieces of equipment that they use,,,,
Teacher,110.4,yeah lunar orbiter so that's one piece of equipment great,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yeah, but you know it.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, the ice is so small.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,Great work.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,yeah great conclusion. Oliver. what do you want to add?,,,,
Oliver,110.4,"Um well so actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I want to say this was such a helpful class.","Um well, so actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I want to say this was such a helpful class.",,,
Teacher,110.4,"yeah great so discover's a keyword and waters, the keyword,",,,,
Farrah,110.4,I think equipments an important word.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"I think you're right, I think you do,",,,,
Jazmin,110.4,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"I like that, so they sent a lunar orbiter to investigate.",I like that. so they sent a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,
Teacher,110.4,Great so we know that we're looking for a piece of equipment to answer this question now the next question that I want us to ask right we've just asked what kind of answer do we need.,Great so we know that we're looking for a piece of equipment to answer this question now the next question that I want us to ask right we've just asked what kind of answer do we need.,,,
Teacher,110.4,Okay equipment to discover water and Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"And yes, I was going to say the same thing is also that I, I don't understand why my answer is wrong.","And yes, I was going to say the same thing is also that I, I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,
Teacher,110.4,"Oh awesome everyone pulled out really interesting words, but I want to highlight Jazmin Luis and Oliver I think y'all were spot on.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,equipment whoa that's really great,,,,
Teacher,110.4,lunar orbiter whoa that's really great yeah it's the name of the equipment,,,,
Teacher,110.4,equipment and discover or two great words,equipment and discover are two great words.,,,
Teacher,110.4,awesome okay yeah I know you were on your way so let's see so now what now that we know so scientists found ice using a lunar orbiter cool.,,,,
Teacher,110.4,"that's right, so we have the name of the Lunar orbiter",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, you're right the scientists were the WHO,",,,,
Farrah,110.4,"um I mean, I guess, we could still use what Luis said Oh well, she said NASA sent a small machine for me, she could say um.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"that's perfect Thank you Jazmin, so I think part of a great answer for us when we're thinking about what's the equipment that the scientists use is exactly what Jazmin just said she called it a lunar orbiter do you have a question Farrah or maybe something you want to add.",,,,
Farrah,110.4,"yeah well um I said, I said that the answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"No that's a great point Jazmin I don't think you're wrong if you don't say that because, like you said it's not mentioned in the text.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,I think that Luis just identified one of the reasons why Water on the moon might be a valuable resource in the future .,I think that Luis just identified one of the reasons why Water on the moon might be a valuable resource in the future .,,,
Farrah,110.4,Yeah well I'm still kind of confused.,"Yeah, well, I'm still kind of confused.",,,
Teacher,110.4,yeah absolutely you're right um NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to discover water and that's your answer right there good job.,,,,
Jazmin,110.4,"Oh wait, I have to add that part to this to discover water.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, that's why they need the microscope very good all right",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"Yes, very good that's a good answer the Lunar orbiter is a little robot they used to investigate, but if there was people in and they needed to to drive the orbit or maybe they would be an astronaut, yes.",,,,
Oliver,110.4,"Well, actually I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now, but before we go, I wanted to say thank you so much for being so welcoming of all of our answers and helping us see that we didn't have to just pick one that there was room for more than one idea Thank you so much.",,,,
Teacher,110.4,"You are correct Farrah it does mean really, really small",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Chris. Do you think you know it.,,,,
Chris,120.1,Yeah yeah discover,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Does anybody know,,,,
Teacher,120.1,So look back at your answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Is that all that they used?,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Everybody look back into the text and find what did they use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Okay, is that the only one that you circle.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Yes, if you look through there and then circle your answer. You should be able to find your evidence in there to support your answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Luis Let's talk about your answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"But what else, what other kind of equipment or tool. Did they have to use",,,,
Jazmin,120.1,"Oh, oh, I didn't even I didn't actually say that they said, I just said that they sent a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"but we're going to talk a little bit about the wate. Can you look back in the reading and there might be YouTube videos on this, too, that you can look at a little bit later, when you get back home.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Chris. Did you find that answer in there?,,,,
Chris,120.1,"Yeah, about the water?",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Hi everybody. So, could I please hear a little bit more about the scientific tool like a microscope that you think you might need?",,,,
Farrah,120.1,"Yeah, sure. Okay, so I had said that you know like you need this microscope in order to look really closely, you know, like at the water",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Jazmin, what else do you think?",,,,
Jazmin,120.1,Me? What do I think?,,,,
Teacher,120.1,So Farrah and Oliver while I'm talking with Chris and Jazmin and Luis I want you to to look back in the passage and see if you can find a different equipment that they used. Can you gues do that?,,,,
Oliver,120.1,Uh huh.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"So Luis our science expert, out of paragraph two. How do we answer this question. What was your response?",,,,
Luis,120.1,I'm not really sure.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Okay, perfect. So how about you two kind of work together and go back and look at the text and look specifically for what piece of equipment they used to look for.",,,,
Farrah,120.1,water.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"How about you and Jazmin kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you guys can help each other, look at the text.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"So, Luis. Let's discuss your answer real quick. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Number three. Read again number three. The paragraph number,,,,
Jazmin,120.1,Number three. Okay. I'm not really sure.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Okay, do you have something to add to Farrah's answer.",,,,
Oliver,120.1,"I'm not sure. Like, what would I add?",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Jazmin, you want to add something?",,,,
Jazmin,120.1,"I wasn't sure. Like, why my answer was wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,What do you think this Jazmin?,,,,
Jazmin,120.1,"Like, what is the machine?",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Uh huh, that they used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,120.1,Small machine is it's called a lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,But what did they use to find actually water on the moon.,,,,
Jazmin,120.1,"Well, I was wondering",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Yes, that is an answer. But if the question says, What equipment did they used to discover what water on the moon. What do you think that should be a good answer to that question.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Let's see, Luis. Um, we gave you a little bit of time, did you have a chance to look back over. Would you like more time?",,,,
Luis,120.1,"Oh no, I read the whole thing. I was gonna say the same thing that Jazmin said like when you're asked me to look for equipment. I found two pieces of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,What is the question actually ask us,,,,
Farrah,120.1,"Oh, the question says what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Using this strategy. How would you answer that question. No.,,,,
Luis,120.1,"Okay, so I found the answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,You remember what we were talking about on the in the story about the equipment?,,,,
Luis,120.1,"Yeah, so I guess like well do the astronauts need those tanks, like when they're looking at the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Absolutely. You always have to dig into that text and just pretend like you don't know anything else. At that point, you've just got to find it in there. When you find something in the text, could you let me know.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"They do, and they have to have that stuff to keep them alive and well while they're out there. That's a very good point. But just like we were telling Mr. Luis, we have to find it in the text",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Well, let's take a look. I want you guys to look. I know a lot of you that found your answer for microscope found it in paragraph three, and I'm going to read that to you real quick. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Let's back up a little bit more to paragraph two, okay. So I want everybody to just look at paragraph two, and I want you to read along with me. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"So what about you, Oliver?",,,,
Oliver,120.1,Okay so art or science teacher always talks about microscopes.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"So why don't you go back to your passages and You know circle some or go back to the question and read it again, and let me know if you have any questions.",,,,
Oliver,120.1,I don't see anything that said discover in the story I'll look again.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Who can answer that question.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,What does it say in the article about what machine or equipment went to the moon.,,,,
Farrah,120.1,The microscope.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Alright, so, Luis. Let's get to you. Alright, so read me your answer.",,,,
Jazmin,120.1,"Ah I'm sorry, Mr. Teacher. I don't understand why my answers wrong, too.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Go ahead, keep going.",,,,
Luis,120.1,"Then, then that means that they had to go there in order to find it.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"That doesn't. Alright, so how. So how would you rephrase your, your answer.",,,,
Luis,120.1,"Um, okay. Um, so the scientists sent, what the name of the thing.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,All right. So why is it valuable to find water on the moon?,,,,
Jazmin,120.1,Because it would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"What else, what are some other benefits.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"And again, Luis, what was the question.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Keep reading. See what else you can discover.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Would you like to look at your answer that you wrote for the question and see if you want to change that answer?,,,,
Chris,120.1,"Um, well. Like, I guess, I guess no cuz like I guess the lunar orbiter landed in one of the craters that was full of water.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Do you remember what that was, or maybe where you could look to find that answer.",,,,
Farrah,120.1,"Oh,",,,,
Teacher,120.1,So we can go ahead and go back. I'll look at that and if you give me a minute to this kind of pull it up.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Is there anything you want to maybe add to that.,,,,
Oliver,120.1,"Um, well you did say that, um, you can't look if you're looking at the water than your, you have to first. That's the second stop. So then, um, I guess I have to look for the first step I gosh",,,,
Teacher,120.1,But I want us to go back and look at that again.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,To see if there is convincing evidence because,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"And so let's look back and see. So, Farrah and Oliveron. I want you to go back to the section that talks about water as a valuable resource and see if you can come up with a different answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"but let's see, can you find some other reasons and other evidence that's just one thing. Can you find some more evidence that supports water being valuable on the moon. Does that make sense Chris?",,,,
Chris,120.1,"Yeah, I'll try. I'll see what I can find.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,and see if you can figure out some other evidence that water would be valuable on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,120.1,"Um, so my answer was, I guess no, that it wasn't very convincing, because kind of like what Oliver said like, we wouldn't be able to use it for space for a long time, you know,",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"So, Luis, and Jazmin. You guys have been working together and Jazmin, are you able to re-evaluate your answer and maybe provide some more evidence?",,,,
Jazmin,120.1,Yet so basically so and Luis was sharing his answer about how water can be split into two parts into oxygen and hydrogen.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"But how did they discover water on the moon, what things did they need to find the water",,,,
Teacher,120.1,So what machine. Did they use to find that water.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,What do you guys think about that.,,,,
Luis,120.1,Um well for me I dont know,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"I want us to take a second and reread that paragraph, give me a thumbs up after you've read it.",,,,
Jazmin,120.1,The principal doesn't like us to do thumbs up.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"OK. So Farrah, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. So look back in paragraph 3.",,,,
Luis,120.1,Excuse me.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Right. But what else did you need to know?,,,,
Farrah,120.1,Where the water is?,,,,
Teacher,120.1,You guys look,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Back at the sin to me.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Go ahead and read rethink about your answer there for,,,,
Teacher,120.1,So re rethink about that. Do you think it would.,,,,
Farrah,120.1,"Valuable means like something that's really important. Like, um, um, yeah, something that's important.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Allright Jazmin while you were reading. Did you find any more information.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Figure out what what what other equipment or machines were used in the in the process that might help you a little bit better.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,and see if we can add to our answer or maybe even change it.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"All right, Chris, um, what was, what was your response.",,,,
Jazmin,120.1,Excuse me.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,but what what kind of equipment do they use to discover water.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"You can answer that question by reading it and you've given some great answers,",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Okay, well let's um let's remember kind of what we read.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,But what did they use on the moon to discover water. Do you know what that that tool was called,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Oh. So, Oliveron Farrah. What was the tool that they used on the moon.",,,,
Farrah,120.1,And,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Does anybody have an idea.,,,,
Oliver,120.1,"Yeah. So basically, um,",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Perhaps, um, does it talk about anything else within the paragraphs.",,,,
Oliver,120.1,"Um, let's see, I guess.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Do you think if we went back to the text, could we find anything else that scientists might have used when they were discovering wonder on the moon? Any other equipment.",,,,
Farrah,120.1,"Yeah, because we could. Okay, so we should look for I should look for more equipment?",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Um, what is the question asking us",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"So, Jazmin. Can you just tell me what that question means",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"So on there, you can make that on so again.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Raise your hand when you find find an answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,So what's another word.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Jazmin, what is the second heading.",,,,
Jazmin,120.1,Water is a valuable resource.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Yes, let's go back and look. Everybody taken another second. I'll give you a few more seconds to look back over the text.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,What did you get out of the question,,,,
Farrah,120.1,I underlined it,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"What did you use to discover the water on the moon, though.",,,,
Luis,120.1,Um. Is it the microscope? I'm not sure,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Good. Okay. So does that help us answer our question of what equipment was used To find water on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,120.1,"Still confused because i i i guess why the microscope. Is it, you know what I mean is it an answer too?",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Okay, do you have another answer at this time, do you think",,,,
Chris,120.1,"Um, yeah. Okay. So I actually was kind of agreeing with Luis Like my dad took me to NASA. And we went like all over the place and like looked at different stuff and like saw that like astronauts had to have, like, um,",,,,
Teacher,120.1,So we needed to decide about looking back into our  text there and try to underline or find evidence that tells us about the small machine or the equipment that scientists use.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"What other instruments do we, we determined that we need an instrument called a microscope we know what the microscope does and why we need it. Is there any other equipment that we need",,,,
Jazmin,120.1,"Yeah, I think that we would need the small machine that they sent up into space and I think, I guess I'm confused, like why is my answer wrong?",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Was there anything else in the text.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"So Mr. Chris, Mr. Luis I want you to keep thinking and Miss to",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Farrah. I want you to think about the microscope again because I really loved how you were able to tell me that a microscope is used for something I can't see.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"You might want to take another guess at the tool used to get that, to get those microscopic images?",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"and I have your answers so Farrah, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close. Did you see any other tools that you may need",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Alright, so lunar orbiter and a microscope, can we find any other tools that scientists use? Think that's it.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,but what other tool was using the story to help find water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Alright, so, from what I read what other",,,,
Teacher,120.1,item that they need on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Alright so Oliver Can you help me out after reading the story again.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Make sure that when you are using the specific name of a tool it's the tool that the question is asking for, so in this question what equipment was used to discover water on the moon, is there, another tool, you can think of that the scientists used from the text.",,,,
Farrah,120.1,"Well, I thought that was the correct tool.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Can you find a different one?,,,,
Teacher,120.1,That wasn't Jazmin or Luis's answer?,,,,
Farrah,120.1,"Oh well i i i had some equipment, but I don't understand why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"So for you, I just want you to totally um scrap the answer and we're just going to start fresh and new and we're going to improve and build, so I want you to reread the question.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"it's almost there you're almost there, but you just need to reread the question and reread the passage, because there is more information that you can use to include. Oliver what's up it's your turn.",,,,
Oliver,120.1,"yeah well, I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go. But I was listening to what you're telling everybody else, and I think you did help me think about if i'm answering the question and to try to find all the evidence and the answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"So I want someone else to answer my question again. Previously, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? And I want someone to revise their answer from last time. So Jazmin, do you want to try?",,,,
Jazmin,120.1,"Well, I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Does anyone else want to try the question again besides Luis? That thought maybe their answer wasn't up to par from last time. Maybe Farrah, do you want to try it? Farrah, do you want to try. OK.",,,,
Farrah,120.1,I'll try. OK. So the lunar orbiter sends-- the lunar orbiter--,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Okay, what else?",,,,
Jazmin,120.1,I circled equipment.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Ok. What else?,,,,
Teacher,120.1,So what do you think that the scientists used to discover water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"that's perfect I mean now you have three different types of equipment, so why don't you go through and rewrite your sentence take a minute to rewrite it and then come back and i'll ask you for your sentence okay okay.",,,,
Chris,120.1,"teacher, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Give you time to think about it.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Okay, I'll call on you in a second.",,,,
Farrah,120.1,The water.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"So can we go and look right back and just quickly, maybe skim the page and see if we could see any new equipment that was found.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"That's right, but do you know what object did they use to find water in the moon?",,,,
Luis,120.1,"I think the same stuff, like they use oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that. I think they used the same thing.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Did NASA use so do you think you want to like change your answer, or maybe add something after what you just said that might make your answer a little bit stronger.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,so maybe just for answering that question um can we like think of.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,An answer for that.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Okay. How about you read the text and then i'll come back to you later to see if your answer has changed.,,,,
Luis,120.1,Okay okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Is there anything else that you want to add to that, or is it just that.",,,,
Oliver,120.1,"Um, well, I would say like scientists use the microscope to discover water.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,And that's a really do you want to be a little bit more specific with your answer for me?,,,,
Chris,120.1,"Well, I guess that they found lots of water like they found a whole bunch of water in these craters that was kind of, you know what I mean.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Good so when you go and you look through the text, I want you to just let me know what your answers are directly okay.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,What Jazmin?,,,,
Jazmin,120.1,"How did you know that we should put the microscopic part in the answer remember when I was saying, like i'm trying to figure out.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Chris. Can you tell me what kind of equipment that they used To discover water on the moon.,,,,
Chris,120.1,You told Jazmin that she was close because she said on the small machine and then you asked her what it was called and she said the lunar orbiter so I think you told her that that was the answer right?,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Right, it can be a little confusing if you don't read over it carefully. Huh.",,,,
Chris,120.1,"Yeah, I guess so. Um, but I do know, like a lot. I went to NASA. And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Well that's, well, that's great. So, Luis, what do you think about the equipment that the article has told us about?",,,,
Luis,120.1,"Um, ah, You mean nothing like that what you told Jazmin about?",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Uh-huh. Oh, you know what else?",,,,
Jazmin,120.1,What?,,,,
Teacher,120.1,And then I want anybody to know if they want to change their answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,So well I check in with Jazmin. Do you think that you could work on that a little bit.,,,,
Chris,120.1,"Yeah, oh look, oh look in the story again.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,I think that we should all go back in our text to skim for more detail to see if there's more than just the microscope that scientists use,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"When I say go, I want you to all reread the text and see if you can find more detail that answers the question. What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,So maybe you can look at the text closely and find the answer. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Yeah, so maybe you need to look at a text and more closely and the find the answer.",,,,
Luis,120.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Next, though there was another piece of equipment that was talked about survey. Farrah I would like you to go back in the text and see if you can find a better answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Thank you, Oliver. So after reading that statement. What did we learn",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"You can, did you want to give that a try.",,,,
Oliver,120.1,"Um, yeah. Well, before I do that, I just wanted to say I'm Oliver",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Can you try,,,,
Chris,120.1,"I guess your I can try again. Because if I have to pick one from the story, I would say.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Try again.,,,,
Farrah,120.1,"Okay, so we used to think it was the microscope, and now we think it's the lunar orbiter because that's the equipment they used to discover. So I guess if I was doing this again, maybe I would do what you had to have just do and look back in the question for an action word",,,,
Teacher,120.1,I see some few shaking their head. No. Huh. Alright so next strategy you can do is revisit the text.,,,,
Chris,120.1,"So, so",,,,
Teacher,120.1,And see if you can find something different.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Okay. And when you get to that part. Please raise your hand and let me know. We'll go over together to fit to talk about the equipment that they used. Okay.,,,,
Oliver,120.1,"Yeah, I'll look",,,,
Teacher,120.1,What do we think they used,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"I would love if you could do the same for paragraph one and paragraph two,",,,,
Teacher,120.1,So I'm going to give you a moment to reread the text and then I'd like you to give me a thumbs up or raise your hand when you're ready to share,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Water. Okay, so I'm going to give you one minute to reread or five minutes to read the text.",,,,
Farrah,120.1,I think we're all ready.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Can you remember what was that?,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Yeah. So how about you take a deep read of the three points and see if you can figure out what equipment they might have used to get that really small bit of water out.,,,,
Chris,120.1,"Okay, I'll read it.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Yeah. So how about you look back into the passage and see if you can find any more information in any more research.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,So I wanted someone to elaborate on their first answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Great. Yes. So now I suggest that the two of you go back to the text and circle the answer your new answer after looking for that. Are you able to do that for me.,,,,
Luis,120.1,A new answer?,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"If we look in paragraph two, can do you see any other name of a machine.",,,,
Farrah,120.1,um.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,let's look a little bit earlier in the text and see if they use anything else to to find the water.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"um do you Luis or any of our other friends, do you guys know where can you guys look at your texts and see if you can find anything else about.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Yes, um what What about the paragraph that or the sentence that Jazmin helped us find in paragraph to do you think you could look at that and then maybe think again about what specific equipment that the Lunar that the Scientists are using.",,,,
Chris,120.1,Okay yeah um so it's a small machine called a lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,so I wonder if we could expand our thinking a little bit more about that process of discovering the water.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"You can look at, yes I would love for you to look again just take a second there's no pressure",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"You want to think about the tool, the most effective for that particular situation so when we're trying to find the water right so look, I want you to take a second to look through the text again as well, and just see if you can find something.",,,,
Chris,120.1,"Okay yeah yeah that math example that really make sense, all look again.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Okay, so what I want everyone to do now, I want you to revisit the text and find the place in the story that tells us the type of tool that was used to find water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Oliver, can you add on.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"so what might be a better tool to look at the big picture, instead of the little picture that the microscope is going to show us.",,,,
Farrah,120.1,Oh um.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Is there is there any other equipment, you know off the top of your head that they use.",,,,
Luis,120.1,"Oh there's tons of equipment well, they have the oxygen tanks and while they have to have a rocket ship if they're going to make it to space they use all sorts of things in that rocket ship, they have to have on the gross astronauts astronaut food there's so much stuff that they use.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,Okay just humor me just a minute I want you to take one minute I want you to answer the question again so remember the question is what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon go ahead and write your answer down right your new answer down.,,,,
Chris,120.1,You know I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Right and.,,,,
Chris,120.1,and find those words in the answer and then um.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Of the question so look back at the text to fill in that gap that you had missing, you have a really great start.",,,,
Teacher,120.1,"So did you have any other thoughts about it, if we just look at this paragraph, especially the second sentence.",,,,
Chris,120.1,"I guess I was I was picturing the really big craters and um like pools or lakes of water, because craters are really big, right?",,,,
Teacher,120.1,So and so I think you can get a better answer to something related to discover water.,,,,
Farrah,120.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Do you want to try to think about what else they could use?,,,,
Luis,120.1,um.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,"Remember, something else.",,,,
Luis,120.1,Ah.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,but um let's let's keep building on that right good Jazmin.,,,,
Teacher,120.1,Good job so based on the context of that on that paragraph Jazmin do you think you want to try it again and tell us the answer.,,,,
Jazmin,120.1,well.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Excellent so we're looking for equipment that they use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Thank you so much Okay, so the question is asking us what equipment and scientists use yes Chris.",,,,
Chris,120.2,"Well, since we're talking about equipment, I wanted to say, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So what equipment, did they use to discover water on the moon",,,,
Farrah,120.2,"Oh well, I guess, if something is so small that you can't even see it, how can you discover it don't you need to see it.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So today we are going to dig more into our question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon, so thank you all for sharing your answers.",,,,
,120.2,"So right now we are trying to answer the question, what equipment.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so we're talking about the equipment they used to discover water.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So we asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Alright, so the discussion question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,120.2,But what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon?,,,,
Luis,120.2,What did they use to discover water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment that they use to find water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So you answered the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, thank you very much. Okay. And so the first question that what you were to answer was what experiment designed, what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Yeah, I'm going to read the question. So listen closely. Okay, what equipment, did scientist used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Our question that we have was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,120.2,"Well, I was just gonna say like I already know like so much about space and like I don't really think I need any help. I don't think I should be in this group.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Help me understand if you don't mind what equipment they might use just to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,But let's specifically focus if we can On just how they discovered water on the moon. What equipment. Did they use to discover that water.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,And in your question. If you can take a look at your passage. All of you can take a look at the question again. It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Then the question two says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, we've just answered what equipment. Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,That's right. So let's look at our passage and see what equipment. Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, but we're going to what equipment. Did they use to find that",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So our second question that we answered, um, was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So let's look back at our question. It says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,but we're trying to figure out what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"But take a look at the question and what it's asking, it's asking us what was used to discover water",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so we know that the question is asking us for the equipment that the astronauts use to discover the water. So where do you think we can find the answer to that?",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Let's go to question two is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"All right, so Farrah, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?",,,,
Farrah,120.2,Uh huh.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Right. But our discussion question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Right and then it says what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,,
Chris,120.2,I went to NASA.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Yeah, and that's that's understandable because that's what the question asked was What did they use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so we just read the passage about finding water on the moon. The question we just responded to is what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon? Okay.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Yes. What equipment then scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,120.2,"Oh yeah. Um, so I circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Absolutely. This is specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,120.2,But this question specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water. Does that help?,,,,
Chris,120.2,"Yeah, I think you're saying like that. Yeah. So I know a lot of equipment, but the question is asking about the equipment that we use to find a water. So I was just talking about equipment but not equipment to find the water",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So let's look at your responses. So the question was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. Right.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,But so we reread the question right so what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, please, can you please read the question again.",,,,
Oliver,120.2,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"And Chris, you can you please read the question again?",,,,
Chris,120.2,"Yeah, sure. The question is what equipment did scientistis use to discover water on the moon? Oh.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, let's talk about the questions. One of my first question was what equipment did scientists used to discover water water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So this question, remember it said what equipment did scientists used to discover.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So, because at the end of that right they get a little more specific. Right. What did they use to discover",,,,
Teacher,120.2,It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so let's look at the question what equipment.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,120.2,"Well, I don't understand why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"It would be a good answer to the question, right. Let's look at the question again.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Is there convincing evidence that water on the,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Moon could be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Hi guys. So our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question. Yes. Luis,,,,
Luis,120.2,"Um, yeah. So I kind of know all about space already like, I don't think I need to even in this",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So let's look back at our question. It says circle the evidence in the texts that we can use to answer this question.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Well, what was your answer to what equipment ID scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,120.2,"Well, so my answer was, like, they had to use like oxygen tanks and spacesuits. And like all the stuff that astronaut would need if they were going up in space.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,but we are wondering what equipment did they use to find this,,,,
Chris,120.2,"Like, okay, so like I went to NASA, like with my dad and like I like know already that like you have to use spacesuits and oxygen tanks and like kind of like what Luis was saying like I saw it in the exhibits like I i just already knew that that you have to use all that stuff.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Yeah, that's a good point that you do need oxygen tanks whenever you're in outer space, but we're talking about the different pieces of equipment that you need to be able to see what's on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Well, they will need it to help them breathe, but what is the equipment that they used to see the things on the moon.",,,,
Luis,120.2,Gotcha. Okay. That makes a lot of sense.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"All right. All right, guys. We're moving on to question number two, which is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Luis,120.2,"OK. So I said that water could be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen. Because, remember, my dad's an astronaut. LAUGHS",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Alright, so our question was what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,120.2,"Yes, I think it was a small machine",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Alrighty guys welcome back from lunch. We're going to start with a new question. All right, so is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so everybody has just given their answers to our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so why do you what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon, Luis",,,,
Luis,120.2,"Um, so I think that the what they used was oxygen tanks and um space suits and all that kind of stuff, because otherwise they wouldn't be able to be on the moon and like run around.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,But how did they discover water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Good. Has everyone had a chance to answer their question what equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So, who's ready to tell me what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,But the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So going back to the question.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"It was, is there. What equipment didn't scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Thank you. Um, so the question was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Through the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,They used that equipment to keep themselves safe in space. But the question for discussion is what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Scientists did use a microscope to look at the water that they found. But the question was asking what was used to discover the water on the moon. So the microscope was looking at actual droplets of water after it was, the water was discovered. The question was, how did they discover the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, there you go. So what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon. So",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So the second question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.,,,,
Luis,120.2,I just wanted to remind you that my dad is actually an astronaut.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so is there convincing evidence that it could be valuable. Is there convincing evidence that it could be valuable on the moon?",,,,
Jazmin,120.2,"Well, um, it says that there's water on the moon. And what is valuable because you need it to drink.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"What is the question. The question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon to be valuable. Right.",,,,
Oliver,120.2,"Well, I said no, there isn't any evidence because they haven't been able to get to the moon to find evidence because it's gonna take a lot of time and money.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"All right now. So the question is, what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. Right.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,What took equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Jazmin,120.2,"Yeah, I think so.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So I just reviewed your answers for what told it scientists use to find locate water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, I've read your responses to our question. Let me read. Let me reread the question again.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Hold on just one second. Okay. The question was what equipment did scientist us to discover water on moon. Okay. So, Luis.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,The Lunar Orbiter. OK. So our question that we had what equipment did scientist us to discover water on the moon. What do you think they sent,,,,
Jazmin,120.2,A scientist sent the orbiter to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so our second question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,but does is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,And so we want to answer this question together what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Why don't you start with what it, what. Why do you think that the scientists used on the moon.",,,,
Luis,120.2,"Well, okay. So here's what I know is like probably they had to use like I'm like spacesuits and oxygen tanks and they had to use, like, stuff like that. Like gloves and like helmets and things. I think that's what they had to use",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, thanks. OK. So our question that we're going to talk about this time around is",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. What are the key words in that question. I'll read it again so you can hear them ready is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So the question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"What, we're going to look at the question. The question was what equipment good scientist use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"In the question. It says, Is there convincing evidence that it could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Perfect. And what equipment did they use,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"because the question said is there convincing evidence that, you know, water is valuable and",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Lunar Orbiter. That's right. So what equipment did the scientists to use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,120.2,A lunar Orbiter,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Now let's see is, does anybody want to share why they think water could be valuable?",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Alright, so we just talked read the article water on the moon. And the question is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Right. But can you find what the what NASA used to investigate the water on the moon?,,,,
Chris,120.2,"Yeah, yeah. I thought, Farrah said they use like a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Exactly. So can you now answer what type of equipment they needed to discover water on the moon?,,,,
Chris,120.2,"Well, I had said that they could do it with the craters. I said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Right. But when they were able to discover some, how did they discover it?",,,,
Farrah,120.2,"They said that you need a tool. Well, this was my answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Right. Okay. So, and our question said that NASA. They sent something to an equipment to investigate right so what actual equipment. Did they sebd to investigate water.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so now what does it say that they sent. What did they send to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,But we also our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Because we need to know which,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Equipment did the scientists sees to discover the water right to discover the water so,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So what if I put the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon was,,,,
Chris,120.2,Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So, question two is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. Okay. That's our question to",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay. Um, so my question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. Okay, so, um,",,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment do they use to find the water. So while I'm talking to,,,,
Teacher,120.2,because we were talking about the question is there convincing evidence that,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So do you think it would be,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Important to have water on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,120.2,"Um, yeah, I mean like like Jazmin said out people need to be able to drink water. Um so yeah that's valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So let's look at our question. Our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Let's start off with rereading the question. So it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,All right. Okay. The question was we read our story. And we want to know what the scientists use to find water on the moon. Right?,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"All right, so let's talk about the question. It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Everybody gave a different answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Right, who heard in that story what they use. What was the name of that scientific tool.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Wonderful. Okay. Well, let's look at our discussion question.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"It said what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon. Now, have y'all already thought of your answers for this question?",,,,
Jazmin,120.2,"Yes, we did, we all, yeah",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So our question that we have first is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"All right, you guys. So we're going to look at our second question that we have from the passage in the question states is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. Yes. Luis",,,,
Luis,120.2,"Okay, I think I got this all figured out. So now I'm all good.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"With your with your answer to, number one, which says what equipment did scientists, you discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment is used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So the question is asking us what equipment did scientists used to discover the water on the moon. And it asked you to circle the evidence in the text.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Oh well, our discussion question today was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So our question is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,120.2,A small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Awesome. So we're going to go over our reading passage that you all did water on the moon. And so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Oliver,120.2,"Well, we came to the same answer, basically.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"All right, I appreciate it. Alright, so the second question, we're going to look at is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Awesome. We talked about what is is there considerable evidence to show that water is valuable.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So it says if they're convincing evidence that water on the moon Could be valuable.,,,,
Chris,120.2,"Um, well, I guess I'm not sure.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Okay. So the second question that we had was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be value.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so the question at hand is what equipment to the scientist use to discover water on the moon. So have all you thought about that?",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"But what we want to talk about today is, is what they did to discover the water on the moon, and then try to figure out what would be the value of having water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So I'll read the question again for you guys but it was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,We're gonna follow up with the question of is there convincing evidence that water on the name could be valuable.,,,,
Farrah,120.2,"Oh, it means that like",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Where did you get the question is what equipment. Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"The, the second question that was asked about the you know how the moon is a desert and how water is a valuable resource. The second question that you know the second prompt that was given is is that is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"What equipment did scientists, use to discovered water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"And we talked about equipment we have, like you said, the tablets and pencils. But what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Of you guys are going to look back over questions about convincing the evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so we're looking at, again, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable. Yes Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,120.2,"I'm so I'm so sorry. But unfortunately, we do have to go to watch. But before we go to lunch. I just really wanted to thank you for",,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment did the scientists use discover water on the moon. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, thank you. Okay, good. Good to see everybody. Okay, so I asked you what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. Let's, let's go over some of your responses here,",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon. Very good.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,we had our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,120.2,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so what we went before we went to lunch we were talking about our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So going back to answer our question.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So, Farrah, do you want to start with the question what equipment. It's scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.,,,,
,120.2,"Oh, we can possibly answer that. But unfortunately, we have to go to my next. Thank you so much for working with it. Thank you.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So the question says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"You know that, um, but I'm just going to direct you to the question, which is Scientists us to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So what equipment that science use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Let's pause and let's let everybody look at the question. Question number one. What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Let's recap. Question one WHAT equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. What did we decide,,,,
Oliver,120.2,"Okay. Well, you said that it was what Jazmin and Chris said, but I, I don't understand why me and Farrah are wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So moving on to question number two it says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"All right, so we just talked about, and read the story on discovering water on the moon, and the question was what did they use to discover the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,And I think that's super cool. But the question was what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon. .,,,,
Luis,120.2,"Yeah, definitely. Because they can't breathe on the moon without the oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So coming back to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Okay. When we read that question. What are some words. And let's do,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Let's do Jazmin, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Yeah, so it would be cool to to if you went home and told your mom and dad about this story then to know what they used right so that's where the question is coming from because what if your parents asked you, what did they use. And that's what this question here is asking, what did they use",,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment is scientist you discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Today we are going to look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Circle evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So I want you to take a look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Circle that evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So going back to the question right which so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. So going over that.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So Chris, they you, What did they use to find the water on the moon in the craters.",,,,
Chris,120.2,What Farrah said?,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So the question is, what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Oliver,120.2,"Yeah, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter investigate. This is the one that Chris just read right?",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Good job. So we're looking to find what equipment they used to find the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Is there convincing evidence that there's water on the moon can be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, alright. So thank you again for sharing all your answers. Okay, so our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Okay. Do you have the text in front of you.",,,,
Farrah,120.2,"Yes, we do.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Let's read the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Chris,120.2,"Oh, okay, yeah, I guess not.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,and our question again was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Alright, seeing no hands. Let's begin. We all have answered the same question, which I'm going to read. Now what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So I'm going to reread the question for all of us, so that we can hear it again. The question is, what equipment did scientists,",,,,
Luis,120.2,"Oh no, that's okay. I was more of a comment. Really, I was just gonna say like, I don't think I have to be on this group, cuz like I kind of already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,120.2,"Sure, no problem. OK, so my answer was, you need to see typical color microscope to look really close.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,But I'm going to reread the question for myself and for the class what equipment did scientist used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Awesome. Well guys, I've taken a look at the answers that you gave to the question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"And turning our attention to that question and you all have read, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Farrah,120.2,We can go one at a time and give you our answers again,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Yeah, there is a question. The question is, what equipment, the scientists use discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"All right, so here's my first question, what tools and equipment. Did you see that the astronauts were using in space.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Miss Farrah I saw that your hand was raised, what, what kind of toll or equipment. Did they use",,,,
Farrah,120.2,Have I said that they use the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Okay. So was there any other equipment that we used.,,,,
Jazmin,120.2,Excuse me.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so, um, you guys were asked the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Now the next question we were covering  Is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Alright, so we are going I had asked the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,",,,,
Farrah,120.2,"Whoa, I guess I kind of like, Um, no, I just saw the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Water on the moon, and you have answered your question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,But we want to look back in the article and say what tools they used on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Responses to your questions, or to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Go ahead. Luis What's your question.",,,,
Luis,120.2,"Um, well, I was just. excuse me. I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Can you help me figure out what tools that scientists needed to find water on the moon. Can you tell me one of those items.,,,,
Oliver,120.2,microscope,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So what did you guys think for the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Oliver,120.2,I thought it was pretty easy.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So today we're going to talk about after the reading, do you think that water is a valuable resource to astronauts.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,What do you think was the most important piece of equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So when you read it, you should have known what the equipment was that scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, let's think back to the question. The question was what equipment did NASA use to find water on the moon.",,,,
Chris,120.2,What equipment did they use.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,What would you change your Institute,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"We need to make - when we are given a question, remember the question that you guys all answered was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon. Remember answering that question?",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So the five of you just all told me what your response would be to the question. So looking back the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"I want you to go back and look at the question, so the question says is there convincing evidence that water can be valuable. OK?",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So I know I know, so the question said, is there evidence that water can be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so our first question is what the equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,120.2,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So we're going to focus on the question, what do a quick what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,120.2,"i'm excuse me, I should be and best group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Who was that Luis what is it called.,,,,
Luis,120.2,lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"For this question we're talking about what equipment, did they use to help discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So you guys now that we've gone over this again and really dove into this material and answered the question and looked at it in different views, can you guys understand, do you guys understand what was used what scientists used Luis.",,,,
Luis,120.2,"i'm sorry yeah I mean they use the orbiter and they use a microscope, but I also know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for water and definitely using oxygen tanks, so I think Chris's right.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So yes, they did use masks and suits and oxygen tanks, but to discover water on the moon remember what they used.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"know what we're gonna do is we're going to focus on the question i'm sorry I lost it is there, convincing evidence that water is on what on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Yeah, so I just wanted what do you know what the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon was?",,,,
Oliver,120.2,"I think it's the microscope. But I guess since we're in this group. It's not the microscope, but I thought it was the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,We're just trying to help. Luis remember what the lunar orbiter was,,,,
Jazmin,120.2,"Okay Luis It says, NASA send the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Yeah, so you know what equipment, the scientists used to discover water on the moon. Oh yeah, Chris.",,,,
Chris,120.2,"Hey, I'm sorry. No, I will wait. Go ahead.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"because the question was what equipment, the scientists use to discover the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So today we're going to be reviewing the discussion question and answers that you guys had over the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So what tools did scientists use to find water on the moon. Jazmin's answer was, NASA sent a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So we're looking for the equipment that scientists used to discover on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Awesome, thank you Farrah. Um so first, I just want to start by saying um just reviewing the question real quick.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Just so I can make sure that everybody knows what the question is um So the question that we're that we're going to be reviewing the answers for today are what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So I'm going to read the question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Chris,120.2,Ok. Ok.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So if we were to read the question again, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"That's great. So after you guys read the article, we have the question to talk about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Farrah,120.2,I got my answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So do you all remember reading and answering the question and your notebooks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,the question what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so now moving on to the second question, it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon, excuse me, could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,considering our reading that we've already done we're going to consider the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"My name is Teacher . So you guys just answered what object did-- I'm so sorry. What equipment did the scientists used to discover water in the moon, right? OK.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Before even before I answer your question. I'm just gonna review what we're going to go over. So we're gonna talk about the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. We're going to talk about that Luis what's your question.,,,,
Luis,120.2,"Um, well, I was just gonna say that. I know. Like all the stuff about space. So, like, I don't really think I even need to be in this group.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Sure. Great question. So let's look back at the question we're going to answer. And I think that might help answer your question, Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So the question we're answering is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Oh. Thank you, Luis. Right now we are not talking about space. We are talking about including evidence to support our answers. So do you have anything to share about including evidence?",,,,
Luis,120.2,"Well, I know that we're supposed to do that every time we answer a question.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So now, we're going to go more into the thinking aspect of answering the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"OK, and let's look back at our question to see just what we need to answer. So it says, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"All right, everybody, so you just answered a question for me about our water on the moon passage or question was what equipment and scientists, you should discover water on the moon, so I want to talk about a couple of your answers so let's start with Jazmin oh Luis you have a question.",,,,
Luis,120.2,"I guess, I was just gonna say that I, I I don't think that I need to be in that group, because I don't think I need any help because I already don't our space.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"What that means is the question was what equipment, we used to find the water on the space on the moon, and while your answer told me the equipment that we use to look at the water.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,The question that's being asked. So the question that was asked was what equipment do scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Right, so our question for number one was what equipment and students us to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"question has multiple parts to it um so let's like go over the question, so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,but the question was asking what equipment.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"but then the question is, is there any evidence that water can be valuable",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Is there convincing convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,,
Luis,120.2,I think I got this all figured out so i'm all good.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"But I want us. But the goal. And the question from the assignment was what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon,",,,,
Teacher,120.2,was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So the question we're answering is what equipment do scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"I just wanted to clarify what the question was, so it says that is there convincing evidence that water in the, on the moon could be valuable. Now your answer, yes Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,120.2,i'm.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment did scientists use to discover?,,,,
Farrah,120.2,I said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So let's use the first question on the reading what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So let's look, all together, we are trying to find why we use a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Jazmin,120.2,To find water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Because it's microscopic awesome Oliver.,,,,
Chris,120.2,"Okay, scientists found craters full of water on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so, Luis, what can you tell us about the equipment that the scientists used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,120.2,"Um, well. Well, I had said that, um, I think they need to use like oxygen tanks in order to go to the moon. You know, when they have to wear their space, shoot. So, and that's equipment tools because they can't breathe on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So let's look over our initial questions. So the first question as a group is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?",,,,
Chris,120.2,I'll say mine.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So the second part of our discussion question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?",,,,
Oliver,120.2,"Excuse me, Miss Brown? I'm sorry to interrupt.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"OK. So we're going to discuss the next question. And that is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable? Does anybody have any thoughts on that?",,,,
Luis,120.2,"I just wanted to remind you, my dad's actually an astronaut.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Oh, good. So I just asked you the question and got your response to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. And then we had a circle. The evidence in the text, so that we can answer the question.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"No, we're good. Okay, so let's see the question that was first asked is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Awesome. So we're going to look at the second question, and the question just to reiterate, was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"All together, we're going to go back to the question.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"And almost all of you, I'm going to ask you to really re examine the questions That you're asked about what equipment to the scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So let's go ahead and start digging into what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,120.2,That is also a really good point so let's go back to our prompt and want everyone to look at and see what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so it says we're entering question. One question one is about the equipment. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,What else do people think is water valuable why or why not,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"The question is, what equipment at data centers to use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"But let's look at a question. Again, the question is asked, What equipment did scientist to use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Teacher : So I understand that we read the assignment water on the moon in your discussion question was what equipment and scientists have used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,You as well. So our first question from the article that we read that we have to respond to was the question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. Yes. Luis Do you have a question.,,,,
Luis,120.2,"Um, yeah, I should be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Alright, so my first task that I would like you to do. And I'm going to give you a minute to do this is I want you to reread the question. So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So if we look back at that question. It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,. So let's reread the question.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,The question asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,

Teacher,120.2,Let's take a look in the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"The question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the moon, the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Good. So now if we look at your answer to our question. Our question was, what, what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. And you said, NASA sent a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,I'm going to pause in read the discussion question the discussion question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,The discussion question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,What you think is the piece of technology that we use that the scientists used to find,,,,
Luis,120.2,Oh. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So I saw that we had the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,120.2,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so can we look back in the text. I'm at the question that was asked, it was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"the question was, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. Um, so I want. Yes. Luis",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Of convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.,,,,
Oliver,120.2,"I wish we had time to hear another answer, but actually we have to go to lunch, but this is a really fun class. I don't want to end.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"And the question. So two questions. The two questions that will, one of the questions that we had is what equipment did scientists you to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So we can strengthen our skills. So the first question says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,I'll read the question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Going back to the question what equipment, the scientists used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So I like to go over. Question number two with you guys it we is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,reread our question here what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, you think the most important words in the question.",,,,
Oliver,120.2,um excuse me teacher it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,What was the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So the first question that I want to tell you is what equipment if scientists used to this cover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So I'm going to start with this question. What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So our discussion question today is going to be what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,120.2,"Excuse me, excuse me. This is Luis. Um, I shouldn't be, and this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,To my question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"The question is, there is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So let's talk about the prompt. We were asked you guys what equipment and sciences us to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So I'm going to say the question one more time, which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So the next thing I would ask you is when you read the actual question I'm going to read the prompt. One more time.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"To put into one general idea to answer this question, so also the question more time what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,um so I know that we just talked about this question right what equipment and scientists use discover water on the moon and Luis.,,,,
Luis,120.2,um yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"yeah right, I thought it was super cool to i'm wondering if we can go back to the question right, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"The question that we're thinking about today, that is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Okay um so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So does anyone know what equipment they use for discover the water in the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"ok now so hello. You, the question you you answer the question about what equipment did a scientists use to discover water on the moon right yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,120.2,"yeah okay um excuse me teacher, yes, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so you can really look deep. Hi ya Jazmin yes.",,,,
Jazmin,120.2,I don't understand why my answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,let's look at our discussion questions so we were supposed to think about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,so when we read our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So I want to focus on the second discussion question um so the can is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,and you know what when i'm looking at your response to the question which was about.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,That is a great word that will help us answer the question and said what equipment was used to discover water on the moon great Jazmin Thank you.,,,,
Jazmin,120.2,"yeah and so i'm just wondering, because I know that's the question and my answer was NASA send a small machine and X equipment and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"The, the question was what equipment was used to discover wate.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Our question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,120.2,"yeah yeah so I I thought it was a microscope because I read this part where it says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Excellent so i'm going to ask the question, one more time. What equipment did scientists use to discover water and the moon?",,,,
Farrah,120.2,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,What is that piece of equipment they used to discover that teeny bit of water?,,,,
Chris,120.2,well.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So I know that first up, we have the first question we answered in our journal, which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"so First, I see a Jazmin could you share what your answer was please am the evidence.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,awesome so with some confidence of what did you get for number one and where did you find your evidence.,,,,
Jazmin,120.2,"Okay, I got NASA sent a small machine and I found my evidence at the beginning of paragraph two.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Alright Chris your it's your turn what did you get for number one and where did you find your evidence and proof.,,,,
Chris,120.2,"Oh well, so this isn't what I said for number one, but now I realized number one is talking about equipment.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Could you tell us specifically what piece of equipment, did they use in this reading in order to find that water on the moon,",,,,
Chris,120.2,"mm hmm okay so well, first, I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon and that's still true, but when I talked to Jazmin and Luis they both were talking about equipment on so since you said Jazmin had the right answer I think it's a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Alright, so go, I am now looking for the best piece of evidence that matches and talks about equipment to find water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Yes, thank you, but we are looking specifically for how were they able to find that water on the moon, and the way that they were able to find that water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,for answering the question on what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,120.2,"um well um okay well um I guess it's um I didn't circle anything in the reading um, but I just know that after scientists are astronauts on the moon, I know they need oxygen tanks 100%.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Hi Everyone, so our question today was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"On that water right, we want to figure out what tools or what equipment, do we use",,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Chris, I see your hand everybody take a look what word, do you see inside of the word polar.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,Oliver I appreciate the hand up everybody look back at your paragraph who found that water.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Right now we're trying to figure out exactly what piece of equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"awesome Thank you Farrah for reading that out loud, for us, so the question is saying what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Keep in mind the question is, what did scientists use to discover water on the moon. After talking about the word investigate discover and look closely, what do we think the final answer is? what equipment did scientists use? so for this one i'm going to call on Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,120.2,"OK, so the stuff about investigate that makes sense.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Mm-hmm. So how about we move on to the second question. Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?,,,,
Jazmin,120.2,"and wait I just so with with my answer about the machine, why what- I still don't get why I was wrong. I said NASA sent a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"All right, come back together team. Now that we've had a chance to look back at our passage, let's review our question again. Okay? What was the type, what was the name of the machine that supported the scientists in finding the water on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, was anyone able to identify the name of the tool that was used to find water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"did you locate the machine that found the water on the moon, the name of that machine, Chris.",,,,
Chris,120.2,well I guess it's a lunar orbiter um,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"and let's listen keeping the question in mind, the question is what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"answering this question, or what equipment is scientists use to discover what water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Now you actually gave me the results of it, but the question was what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon alright so so.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"It doesn't say circle, the evidence in the text. That we can use to answer this question.",,,,
Luis,120.2,I guess I skipped that part.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Right, they want to know what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,How did you get that answer.,,,,
Luis,120.2,"Well, I know, after our astronauts up on the mound looking for water they definitely are using oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,um so we I just asked you the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,
Luis,120.2,um yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,120.2,yeah I I understand. Okay so we're looking at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,,
Teacher,120.2,mm hmm so let's look at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so we were asked what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Alright, so does anybody want to take a guess after looking at those keywords what we're going to use or what was used to discover?",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Oh, I was wondering if you can tell me a little bit more about how so scientists found craters full of water in the moon.",,,,
Chris,120.2,"Oh, oh yeah um so.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,I just want to make sure that you see all four components in there as well.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, go ahead and write your new answers down.",,,,
Chris,120.2,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Right, how can we discover how can we find these craters that are full of this water what what mechanisms or what machines were really used to help us discover this water on the moon.",,,,
Chris,120.2,um well I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"and let's think back to the question that we, we were asked. what tools did the astronauts use to discover water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"how can we bring all of that together, to then say what truly right what tool was used so that these astronauts could discover this water on the moon, what are your ideas.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Yes, all right i'm going to give you all 10 more seconds to read over and then let's come back and discuss if we think we've found a sentence that has a piece of equipment that talks about being used to discover water Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,120.2,"On well, I would still say the same sentence, I said before, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look directly at it.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"When we are talking about what what equipment they specifically used right to to discover water on them on the moon, so, if you look at the text that you have.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,If we now we went back to answer that question right what equipment did did did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"each of you individually, which was the the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon, and is Jazmin pointed out, oh sorry about Luis yes.",,,,
Luis,120.2,Okay yeah I think I got this all figured out so i'm all good.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So we just talked about how equipment and discover are two very important words but what I want you to do is identified the specific piece of equipment that they used,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So, yes let's all read and see if we can come up with that specific piece of equipment,",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So, initially, I gave you the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"I want us now to spend the same amount of time thinking about what the second half of the question is, which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So if you're looking at the question we have what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,yeah what equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So here if we go back to the question, what kind of equipment scientists used to find water on the moon, so what is our answer?",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"At the question i'm going to read it if you could follow along what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon circle, the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"um so earlier today, you read about water on the moon, and then you answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and you need to just circle, the evidence in the text.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Well, in a lot of ways that's right Okay, because the question was what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Alright, we are gonna get started talking about your responses to the question what equipment it's scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,,
Chris,120.2,"First Okay, I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"What I have a question for you, what do you feel like if the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,",,,,
Jazmin,120.2,I forgot again oh man hold on.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Right Okay, so we have the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Find text evidence, just as you were doing in that first part of class to inform this answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"so one more time, will the water they find on the moon be valuable to them.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Okay, so where did they send this machine to.",,,,
Jazmin,120.2,get them on.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"I I like what you gave me there Let me read the question, one more time and then I can think about your answer a little bit what equipment and scientists use to discover what on and you said oh i'm sorry Oliver, yes",,,,
Oliver,120.2,i'm trying to and I love to teach I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,I was wondering if you could expand or elaborate a little more on what you meant by you circled the same as Farrah.,,,,
Oliver,120.2,"Oh yeah okay i'm so sorry I know we both thought about the answer to the question about equipment was on the microscope and since she she started first, so I just said, I circled all the same thing, instead of repeating.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Alright, so Hello everyone and, as you all know, we just finished reading the water on the moon text talking about the moon, is a desert, and we are all responding to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,120.2,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this room, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,which was what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,
Luis,120.2,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I alreadyknow all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Alright, so Hello again so right before lunch, we were talking about how, in this question, which I will read again quickly what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,So remember our question is asking about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Alright, so our plan for today is that I am going to give each of you guys some time to read over your responses to the question that I had originally asked which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So let's look at the question again, it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon",,,,
Chris,120.2,All okay oh wow.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So the question is also asking um what equipment, do they use to discover water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"Yes, in response to the question about what equipment was used to discover water.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"The first question, I saw was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,,
Jazmin,120.2,yeah I said NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So we've got a new question that's is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be invaluable.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,yeah maybe we can glue all of these ideas together and come back to this question is there convincing evidence that water could be water on the moon could be valuable,,,,
Chris,120.2,"When you were talking about the future, I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"We are, but we are investigating what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,",,,,
Chris,120.2,"Well hi this is Chris, I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"and let's look at the question. The question is what equipment is scientists used to discover water on the moon, right?",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"All right, thank you alright so again, we have that question about what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"awesome so I noticed that we answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and all of you had great responses, yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,120.2,um yeah I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So y equals did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,120.2,So what equipment is sciences us to discover water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,120.2,i'm in the craters so let's go back to the context of the question how what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,120.2,Because we want to know what good scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,What equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.2,"We've all read this article water on the moon from the New York Times, and now we're trying to answer this this question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,"So we've just read the article water on the moon by the New York Times, and now we're analyzing this second question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.2,And you answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"And Farrah Would you mind reading for us again, the question that we're going to be answering together?",,,,
Farrah,120.3,Okay it's what equipment that scientists to use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Excellent and Oliver could you read what is the second part of that, what are we circling.",,,,
Luis,120.3,"excuse me, I have my hand up.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"and that's deb that's what I was going to ask you to read, is that second part of the question, there you see where it says circle.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,And to recap we're going to look for that evidence so let's let's do a quick reread as a group of this,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"so to keep going around Chris, if you wouldn't mind reading the first paragraph there, where it says one.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Excellent Jazmin could you read the second paragraph, for us.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"yeah, I would like to because this is where I found my answer it says.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Luis just to get your voice in here let's take a look at that last paragraph, real quick Would you mind reading number three for us.",,,,
Luis,120.3,"yeah you got it Okay, that means that the moon Estelle drier than the driest desert on earth water they found as a microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"can you read the question for me, what is the question actually asking Chris.",,,,
Chris,120.3,"Oh yeah it says, or what equipment at times is used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"One thing I want to ask you to look at is the first part of our question so, can you read the first part of the question for me Chris.",,,,
Chris,120.3,Just the first one.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,can you reread that chunk of the text for me.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,Let me see.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so now we're looking at this first part of the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay guys, so I really like the way that you answered those questions, and I can tell that you look back in your text to find your answers, but let's all look back at our question. Let's look back at number one. Do you want to if you guys want to read this question for me.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Farrah, do you want to read it for me.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,Oh yeah yeah okay so,,,,
Teacher,120.3,So we are going to look back in our passage. So I will everybody to get back into their passage,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay. Well, if we look back in the number three which says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Go back to the text that you read,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Go back to the text and look,,,,
Teacher,120.3,The equipment was called a lunar or orbiter that NASA sent to investigate,,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"Okay, okay, but didn't I--",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, go ahead and do that for a moment.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"With their space suits by walking into the big craters. Because your response said they found craters full of water on the moon, but can you look at your passage with me take a look at, paragraph two, and your passage. Can you look at your passage with me.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"And made it says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. Now the lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in large polar craters",,,,
Chris,120.3,Very small.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Teacher:And I'd like to take a look and read in paragraph four, if you will, Farrah and and the group. If you look at their paragraph four.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So can one of you, would one of you like to volunteer to read the first paragraph?",,,,
Luis,120.3,"Yeah, sure. I'll read it. Um, me Luis, I'll read it but but I do want to say, I don't think I'm supposed to be in this group, cuz I already know a lot about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay. Would you like Chris, would you like to read the second paragraph?",,,,
Chris,120.3,"Yeah, sure.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,So would someone like to read me the third paragraph?,,,,
Luis,120.3,"Um, I can read it.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Let's look at our passages and let's see what paragraph that that might be. Can anybody tell me,,,,
Chris,120.3,I found my answer. Paragraph one,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Let's look back at the text. Okay. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Says, and and paragraph to the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Can who can read that for sentence to me.,,,,
Oliver,120.3,I can read it.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, it says the scientists said that one ton of a top soil there's a lot",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Of work. This would hold only 32 ounces of water.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,But I do want to challenge you to go back and would you actually read the the discussion question for me again.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"And I want to challenge, just like Chris, take a look at that question. Can you read the question for me.",,,,
Luis,120.3,Um yeah okay um what scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Let me point you in the right direction. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,I'm going to point you to paragraph three. Look at paragraph three,,,,
Chris,120.3,Uh huh.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Can you read the discussion question for us. Again, Luis.",,,,
Luis,120.3,"Sure. Um, what scientists used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Look at that question again.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Can you read it out loud for me.,,,,
Chris,120.3,Yeah. What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate what does it mean to investigate,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Jazmin, can you can you keep reading in that second paragraph.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"Yeah. Um, okay. The Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater nice ice deposits are very small st to set that one top of the top layer of the surface. will, in total 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Okay. So could I have someone. Raise your hand if you would like to volunteer to read. Question number one out loud for us.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, Oliver. I saw your hand first. Will you read. Question number one for us, please.",,,,
Oliver,120.3,"Um, yeah, okay. So question one is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay. Can you, can everyone look back at number three on your document. So let's see. Farrah, can you read the first sentence of bullet point number three on your document, please, just the first sentence.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Oh yeah, sure. Okay. Scientists have found evidence that water can be foudn deep within",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"I'm gonna stop you there. We're looking at number three, not at number one, can you try again?",,,,
Farrah,120.3,Oh yeah. Yes. Sorry. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"All right, so, Farrah, we're gonna stay on number three, but I would like you to keep reading. Can you do that for me?",,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Yeah, sure, sure, sure. Okay. Um, okay, we're still in number three. Yeah. Oh, cuz this is where my answer came from.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"so Jazmin, will you go to number two and read the first sentence on your document?",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"Yeah, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar to investigate",,,,
Teacher,120.3,So can you guys look back at paragraph two?,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So let's look back at paragraph two, that first sentence.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,What does it say Jazmin?,,,,
Jazmin,120.3,It says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Now, Oliver, can you read the first sentence in paragraph two for me?",,,,
Oliver,120.3,"Oh yeah, sure. Okay, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Let's see, Chris. Could you read the second sentence in that paragraph paragraph number two.",,,,
Chris,120.3,"Yeah, sure.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,And Jazmin. Would you read that last sentence and paragraph number two for us please?,,,,
Jazmin,120.3,Yeah sure. These ice deposits are very small.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,But we look back at the question for me. Luis It will you read the question back to me.,,,,
Luis,120.3,"Um, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"And then in the second paragraph, right there. If you could go back and reread that second paragraph for me.",,,,
Chris,120.3,To read aloud.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so, but before we do that can Farrah. Will you read the question aloud to the group, please.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Yeah. Okay. The question is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,how about Luis Would you go back and read paragraph two for us. Would you read it aloud place.,,,,
Luis,120.3,"Okay. Um, let's see.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,So let's look at the question again. Luis we read it to me one more time.,,,,
Luis,120.3,"Yeah. Um, okay, so what equipment Did scientists use discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"That's a okay remember it is always find to go back and look at the text that can only help you. So if anyone else wants to take a look back, feel free to do that now.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So while we're letting you take a look back, let's dive into another response.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,So why don't you read that question for me again.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so what, what, why don't you use this new strategy then and let's look at second question from the text so Luis wants to read the second question for us.",,,,
Luis,120.3,"Okay, it says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So, but if we look on down in paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"In their paper with me. It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"But in that first paragraph. it says that scientists have for long time that the moon is a desert, because it is it has no atmosphere like we have on Earth. However, they used to believe there was no water on the moon. Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,120.3,Sorry to interrupt Mr Teacher. But I was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch so we'll have to see you again later. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Paragraph two, I'm going to read and I want you to follow along. It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. OK, now I'm going to stop there.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So if we look at paragraph two, I just want you. You can read it to yourself or you can read it out loud. Could you read the first sentence of paragraph to to me.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,That's just a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,So now I'm going to read the next sentence.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,It says that this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,So why don't you take two minutes and read over the passage and tell me what you think that scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,120.3,"Okay, I'll do that.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,The question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"In the first paragraph tells us what scientists have known for a long time. The moon is a desert. But if you go to the second paragraph, and the very first sentence. It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Says the orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.,,,,
Jazmin,120.3,Jazmin: That's where I got my answer from,,,,
Teacher,120.3,So tell us something that you learned from reading the text what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,120.3,"Wow, like, okay, so they use, like all kinds of equipment like they had to use like space suits and they had to use like, you know, all the stuff that astronauts have to use right.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Alright, so let's read the question, what does the question say",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So, in, in paragraph two, what does paragraph two say?",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Well, then, what is the second paragraph, say,",,,,
Teacher,120.3,The very first sentence.,,,,
Luis,120.3,NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter.  Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Keep reading, what does the next one say?",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"Okay, I'm water is heavy. It takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, can you read the sentence at the word machine comes in Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Oh yeah, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so let's read straight from the text. Let's go. Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Um, okay. So should I should do the part that I circled",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so everybody look at your paper. Let's look at paragraph two. Jazmin, can you just read that for me again. What did you just just read it one more time for me.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,Sure. Okay. NASA sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter will land at the South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. Should I keep reading.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"And that they use equipment to search for things. So when you look back at your reading. Oliver, can, can you look back at your reading in paragraph two, and read that one more time for us? Okay.",,,,
Oliver,120.3,"sure. Okay, so, paragraph two, um, let's see.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"The whole thing a paragraph two,",,,,
Oliver,120.3,"Okay, um, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter orbiter will land at the Moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one--",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"And then I would like for you to read to yourself silently just passed the word machine, what actually let's have Luis read that sentence for us.",,,,
Luis,120.3,"Okay, so, um, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so let's look down the next sentence past that one. Can you read the next sentence for me Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,120.3,The Lunar Orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So if you look at paragraph number three. And it's look at, let's read paragraph number three. I'm going to read it. You follow along. Okay ready okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest or driest desert on Earth. The water they found is, what's the word there?",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Great response. So let's go back to, and I think you pulled that right out of paragraph five, can you read that this the first two sentences on paragraph five, for me, Luis.",,,,
Luis,120.3,"Oh yeah, absolutely. Okay so paragraph five moon water could be useful in other ways. Water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, and what else does it say about it.",,,,
Luis,120.3,"Um, well, it says that like get astronauts could read the oxygen and then oxygen and hydrogen. Oh, they use both for rocket fuel.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so if we look back to paragraph four, it says that water on the moon would be a valuable are very important resource you see the very first sentence on paragraph four, okay.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,It could be useful in a lot of ways.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"All right. Well, let's look at it together.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, let's see.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"Cuz my answer. I said, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated. You can't survive without water. Okay. And then in the paragraph number four. It says future astronauts could drink this water.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Look at paragraph five,",,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Is me Farrah. I see the last sentence kind of after Jazmin and Chris's. It says, having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things. So is that the right answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"I want you to go back and look at the passage. It says, water is a valuable resource. I want you to reread that and raise your hand after you've reread that passage.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Luis, are we rereading, make sure you're reading our passage.",,,,
Luis,120.3,"Wow, I was just thinking like my dad is an astronaut. So I know all this stuff, you know.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"You remember that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Because in paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that when ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,That's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Okay, so to investigate that was the lunar orbiter right",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so let's look back to paragraph. Let's see. Paragraph four right we're under this heading where it says, water is valid, a valuable resource. So it says water on the moon would be a valuable or very important resource.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, well let's go back and reread so water on the moon will be a valuable or very important resource, it can be useful in a lot of ways.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"For example, future astronauts could drink this water. Water is heavy. And it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Moon water could be useful and other ways, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts can breathe oxygen, hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Chris. Look back into paragraph 3, and can you read that aloud for me? About what they use to find the water in space, on the moon.",,,,
Chris,120.3,"Yeah, sure. OK, paragraph 3. That means the moon is still drier than the rest of-- oh, sorry. OK. That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic, meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it. You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Right. So if you look back at that third paragraph, can you read that first sentence for me, Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Yeah. It says, That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,But what does the first sentence say?,,,,
Farrah,120.3,It says that it's really dry.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Yes, those are great equipment words. OK. Can someone else read me the sentence for those for one of those Jazmin, can you read me the sentence where it talks about the small machine.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,Let's see. NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Obriter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Good. Awesome. So can some, Farrah or one of you, which would somebody like to volunteer to read paragraph 1?",,,,
Farrah,120.3,Oh. I'll read. Can I read?,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Yes. Absolutely. Go ahead, Farrah. Paragraph 1.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,OK. Scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on earth.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Good. Let see. Are you reading paragraph 1 right under the moon is a desert?,,,,
Farrah,120.3,Let me see. OK. I see.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,OK. Let's go ahead and read paragraph 2 and 3. Did somebody want to read two and somebody else want to read three? And then we'll talk about those four answers.,,,,
Jazmin,120.3,Yeah. I can read paragraph 2.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Yes. Good. So let's keep reading paragraph 3, and then we're going to go back, and we're going it's kind of getting more information, OK. But that's a very good start. Very good. So paragraph 3. Who would like to read 3? Chris, would you like to read it?",,,,
Chris,120.3,Yeah. I'd like to read it. But also I wanted to say that I went to NASA and so I know that I use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit and stuff.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,So paragraph three. Who would like to read three?,,,,
Chris,120.3,"Yeah, you're welcome.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So in the text, I think it was in",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"In paragraph five, it says, imagine the moon could serve as a stop for spacecrafts to refill their gas tanks before heading out into the solar system, so they could visit further white areas of the solar system, or they could come back home with the fuel that they yeah",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Oh gosh, remind me. Other questions, man.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,I'm,,,,
Teacher,120.3,So read that sentence again for me. And while you're reading it. I'm going to talk with Oliver,,,,
Teacher,120.3,and in our text when we look at our texts. Let's all look at our text.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,So what machine was used to find the water,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So I think we all need to reread the passage. Okay, one more time. I'm going to give you about two minutes to read over it and then we're going to come back and look at our answers again. Okay.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,We can read super fast. So we're done.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"All right, well let's uh, we are actually I'm gonna let some friends take turns reading, who would like to read first?",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So as we continue into paragraph two it states NASA sent a small machine. Now, Jazmin. Yes.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,My answer came from paragraph two. I still don't understand why my answers wrong.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, awesome. So we're going to move down to paragraph number three. Can you all find paragraph number three.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,So let's look back at,,,,
Teacher,120.3,paragraphs three and four specifically,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"A minute to look back at paragraphs three and four, and then I'll give you about two minutes to talk. Okay, so let's look back at paragraphs three and four for about a minute",,,,
Farrah,120.3,"So, um, when I read it, I read the thing where it talked about the microscope, because I thought microscope was a tool just like Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"As a group, look back at paragraphs three and four. How's that sound.",,,,
Luis,120.3,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"The beginning of paragraph two, okay. So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter landed on the moon South Pole to look for ice deposits and a large polar crater. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Let's look back, I'll give you guys about a minute or so individually. Let's look back individually.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, yeah. Let's look, paragraph two, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole to look for ice deposits",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Let's look back at the text.,,,,
Luis,120.3,"Oh, um,",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Perfect. Okay. So if you look at our original question. Let's go back and Decode that question.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,That's okay look back through those first couple paragraphs.,,,,
Oliver,120.3,I'm not sure.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"But let's look back at this specific article because this is about water on the moon. Okay, so let's look at paragraph two,",,,,
Teacher,120.3,water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Everybody look back with us and Jazmin read that sentence that you found NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"Okay, so in paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Hey, you want to take a quick look at your article that you read. You could look at the sentence. What do you see there?",,,,
Teacher,120.3,It says rocket fuel.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,"I don't, I don't see what you're seeing",,,,
Teacher,120.3,The part of the paragraph. The article. The second part where waters valuable resource. It's paragraph number five starts off moon water can use one other ways.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Okay, yeah, yeah. Oh, I see that I see.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,I've got your answers that you that you wrote down and so Chris. Could you read the first question that we were supposed to answer.,,,,
Chris,120.3,Uh huh. It says what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Well, why would finding water on the moon useful.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"But if we go back in the text, and we just need to clarify.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Teacher:Chris can We go to paragraph two,",,,,
Chris,120.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Very first in its,,,,
Chris,120.3,NASA send a small machine on the lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Luis Can you read the second sentence and paragraph two,",,,,
Luis,120.3,"I'm sure. Okay, this loan or what, oh well land damone South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,but what we really want to focus on is more of this reading. And so why don't you go ahead and read the discussion question for us.,,,,
Luis,120.3,"Okay, um, the discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Jazmin. Can I get you to read the question.,,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"Reach Every Reader:Okay, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"All right. Can I get Oliver to read the question for us, please.",,,,
Oliver,120.3,"Sure. Okay. So it says, um, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon would be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so let's go back at a our article, so everybody look at your article. Farrah, you had a great question there. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"All right, who would like to read the first part there.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Can I get you to do it, Oliver.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Alright, Farrah read that, the number one.",,,,
Oliver,120.3,"Um, yeah, I can read it. Okay, so, um,",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Great. All right, who would like to read number two.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, let's let Chris, will you read number two.",,,,
Chris,120.3,Um yeah okay so,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Alright, Jazmin. Can I get you to read number three.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,Sure. Okay. Number three,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"You, why don't you go ahead you and Farrah, why don't you go ahead and take a moment to read back again starting from paragraph one and see if you can underline what they use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Teacher:And then also I would like you. We need to relook at the question and we need to reevaluate that question. So can you read back the question for me.,,,,
Chris,120.3,Yeah okay. What equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"they they use the small machine, the Lunar Orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,NASA sent this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for US Department posits in a large polar crater. These deposits are very small.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"And then in paragraph three, it says that means the moon is still drier than the dress desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it, you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"Okay, well I got my answer from paragraph to I don't know what's wrong with mine.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Okay. And then if you look in at then at the next,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Ever end the end we're going to look at the next paragraph and so,,,,
Teacher,120.3,So let's look back at the text. So what is the question we're trying to answer.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,The question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so if we go back and we look in the text. Okay. Do you, can you guys see the text.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Yeah, we all have it on our tablets.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Let's look at the third paragraph. Does anyone want to read that for me.,,,,
Oliver,120.3,"Yeah, I can do it.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay. Well, you mentioned how you know about oxygen tanks and about masks and all that good stuff. So can you read to me, please. The second paragraph, under the moon is a desert.",,,,
Luis,120.3,"Yeah, okay. Um, let's see. So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to invest",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Can you read that. Yeah, read the next sentence.",,,,
Luis,120.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Um, what do you think it does. According to paragraph two, what does it do, again, what's the second sentence say",,,,
Farrah,120.3,Lunar Orbiter will land at the South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar,,,,
Teacher,120.3,will you reread the question for me.,,,,
Luis,120.3,"Yeah, okay. Um, is there convincing evidence that",,,,
Teacher,120.3,And it can you continue for the next two sentences.,,,,
Chris,120.3,"Oh, yeah, yeah. For example, future astronauts drink this water. Water is heavy. It takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"The scientist, it says that they need a microscope to look closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Alright, so first of all, let's look at the question so Chris, would you go ahead and read the question to us.",,,,
Luis,120.3,"Sure. Okay. It says, oh, what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"I want to look back at the question so Jazmin, would you go ahead and read the question for us.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"Okay, it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, well I do see oxygen tanks and it's actually in paragraph five, so I'd like everybody to look at paragraph five,",,,,
Teacher,120.3,To look at paragraph and we're going to see why we're going to see why that doesn't work. So it says the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Water could be useful in other ways. Water can be broken down into parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts could breathe the oxygen, oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so go ahead and read that last sentence for us.",,,,
Oliver,120.3,"Okay, so it says on your needle scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Well, that's fantastic. How about you be the one to read paragraph two for us again because it seems like we're a little confused on the correct answer here and I want to see if we can hone in on it.",,,,
Luis,120.3,"Okay, um paragraph two",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Sure. So, Farrah, why don't you go ahead and read our discussion question to us.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Um, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Perfect summary. Thank you so much for summer for us but I loved your summary. And you mentioned one piece of equipment that's used, let's go back and look at paragraph one into",,,,
Teacher,120.3,but read the question to me one more time.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So, let's go back up the text has one, two, and three. So in looking at the one, two, and three, they're short little sentences.",,,,
Luis,120.3,Excuse me.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Let's look at number two, the sentence starts with NASA",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Okay so reread that,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so that number two we just read, read",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"And it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So, reading back through and what Jazmin had just talked about with this small machine",,,,
Chris,120.3,"Want me to read, read, where I got my answer from or you want me to read where Jazmin got her answer from?",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"But how about. First, we go back to the question itself. Oh, yes. Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"Well, I was just when you say I wasn't sure why.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Would you be okay to read the final sentence there. Oh, yes, yes. Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"I will, I will just be about, like, I was wondering if this was maybe the answer is NASA use a small machine to get to the water. This is that a good answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,What's that say,,,,
Chris,120.3,"So in part three, it says",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Yeah, the one starts with that the final sentence there. My apologies. Oh.",,,,
Chris,120.3,Gotcha. You need a scientific,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Can you look back in the text and see,,,,
Farrah,120.3,[Reads text to herself quickly]. NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,So let's look back and can you reread paragraph three for me.,,,,
Chris,120.3,"Yeah, but my answer is in paragraph one, it's not in paragraph three",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Can you read paragraph two for me.,,,,
Luis,120.3,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So if you look back, paragraph two, can you read that for me.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, good. So I want you to go back and I'd like you to look at paragraph number five.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,So we need to look and paragraph number two.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"In paragraph number two. The first sentence. It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon surface.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Or the South Pole and look for ask deposits in a large polar crater vast deposits are very small.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So the water they found is microscopic and it says, meaning that you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it.",,,,
Chris,120.3,Microscopic's kind of like really small.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"All right, Farrah, let's have you read the first paragraph right where it says one",,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Okay. Um, let's see.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Oliver saw your hand first. Let's go with you.,,,,
Oliver,120.3,"Um okay. Um second paragraph, and number two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Hi, Jazmin, I saw your hand first. Let's go.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"So, let's see paragraph three. That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific to call the microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,let's very quickly. I'm just going to quickly read because we're crunching on time. I'm going to very quickly read starting in paragraph two follow along with me.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon's South Pole and look for an ice deposit in a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that up to one ton sorry one ton of top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Yeah, I see, I see. In the last minute. So, would you mind Chris, would you mind reading paragraphs one and two for the class, please.",,,,
Chris,120.3,"Yeah, okay. Scientists have known for a long time that the moon is it desert because it has no opposite like we have",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Let's look specifically at. Well, I'm just going to read the whole thing quickly for myself, NASA send a small machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate that lunar orbiter would land in the south pole deposits",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"These ice deposits for very small sounds. It says that one of the top 10 layers. Okay, good. That was for myself. Thank you guys and that they would contain water.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"How about we look halfway down. Do you see the sign the sinister begin scientists said that one ton, you see that sentence.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"I'm going to read that for all of us, scientists said that one time of the top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water. And if we continue that's that's only about four glasses of water",,,,
Chris,120.3,"Um, no. I guess it's not",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Well, let's look at paragraph three reading",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Do me a favor, I want you to look at paragraph five,",,,,
Oliver,120.3,"Okay, one word or can be useful and other ways. Okay, um, water can be broken down into parts hydrogen and oxygen. And I swear. I swear I'm",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so with your eyes closed and you've got that picture of the craters in your mind. I'm going to read you this paragraph. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic,,,,
Teacher,120.3,If you guys have your text handy. I would use it,,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"The lunar orbiter, in paragraph twol",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so let's take a look at the text.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So see, let's see if we can look back and find the answer in the story.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,So if we look back in the story.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"under paragraph three, it says that means the moon is still drive and the desert dries desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic meaning. It wouldn't be able to see",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"See if you look straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,NASA send a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for us deposits in a large polar crater. These deposits are very small.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So paragraph two, says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,That means the moon is still draw than the driest desert on earth.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Why don't we all take a look at number two on the worksheet good somebody read that for me.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,And I repeat it. I'm NASA to small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate lunar orbiter south pole for look for ice deposits,,,,
Teacher,120.3,yep the first sentence of the second paragraph okay.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,NASA sent a small machine to the moon to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"It says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. So water they found is microscopic meaning you would not be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look real closely.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,Um.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"all right, can you read that to me please.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,NASA small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"We learned about how scientists found evidence that water can be found on the moon's polar craters these craters are in dark places that the sun never shines. NASA, which is the big space station that sends stuff to the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to to look for these polar craters that have the water in them. And then we found the water, but the water is microscopic.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"I want you to like for everybody else go back and reread because in the small, the first paragraph, is where you got that from.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So that's correct. So now we're going to reflect on what Jazmin shared there. So I want everyone to look at lunar orbiter and read the first and second sentence of paragraph two. Anyone want to read out loud, the first, second sentence of a paragraph about the lunar orbiter.",,,,
Luis,120.3,I'll read it. I'll read it. Ok. NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Alright perfect so i'll give you guys a second, if you want to read the first three paragraphs just read",,,,
Teacher,120.3,The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,um yeah so I sent a microscope That was my answer um so I don't understand why my answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So before we share our responses and possibly revise and change them, I want you guys to reread and look at the paragraph four, five and six in your reading once you guys are done, we can look at, we can keep going with this lesson.",,,,
Luis,120.3,um excuse me.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"What I want you guys to do is to look at that reading, one more time",,,,
Luis,120.3,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So on the first text it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within moons create polar craters us craters are dark places that the sun never shines.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,I'll we know NASA has sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks like a night looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Okay, I'm",,,,
Teacher,120.3,For the third call it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic Microsoft,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it, you need to scientific tool called the Microsoft look very close",,,,
Oliver,120.3,"Know, you'll be used the um the microscope. Cause that was my answer was a microscope. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,The discussion question was what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,Thank you,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Um would anyone like to read the question, the first question for us.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"um would anyone like to read the question, the first question for us.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"All right. Hi, everybody. So we, we just read the moon is a desert and I asked the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"awesome I am going to start your two minute timer to read the text really closely, if you finish before two minutes go ahead and read it again your two minutes, starting now to read.",,,,
Oliver,120.3,"We can read super fast, so we we did our two minutes.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,So i'm going to give you one minute to review the text you guys can let me know if you're done before that.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,So we have NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"but I want to reread it again I want to show you a sentence, and I think it's a.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"three, paragraph three, it says that means the moon, is still drier than the driest desert on earth, they found water that is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"would be a valuable or very important resource, it could be useful in lots of ways, for example, future astronauts could drink the water like you said right water is...",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,yeah,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Would you be able to read that last sentence for us, then, as a group.",,,,
Luis,120.3,"yeah I would love to read that sounds great okay i'm in paragraph five, is that right.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Rocket! Exactly it says here the moon could serve as a stop for spacecrafts to refill their gas,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"why don't we look back at the question is just read it one more time, can you read it out loud for me.",,,,
Luis,120.3,"yeah Okay, it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"It did so, I want you to read read me the question out loud.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So if we read, question number in the first response. So scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's cooler craters. These creators are dark places where the sun never shines",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So now reading number two, so NASA send a small machine called lunar over order to investigate this order looks for ice deposits in large polar craters. These ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Let's move on to the last one. That means that the moon is still drier than a dry desert on Earth.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,The water they found is microscopic mean you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it. You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Can you find it and that's in paragraph 2.,,,,
Luis,120.3,Not I sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large bore crater these ice deposits are very small.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Does anybody want to go back and read over in paragraph 5?,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"But let's kind of read. Can everybody go back and read the number Paragraph to where it starts with NASA sent a small, can you read that those first couple sentences of that paragraph, please.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Can you read the sentence that you found that in. I believe it's the first sentence and paragraph two, can you read that whole sentence.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"Yes, out loud.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Yes, just take a second and reread it.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Let's look at Paragraph two, where NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter books for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,So I was hoping that maybe in your brain and your head quietly right now. Is there any way that you could reread paragraphs one and two. Actually let's start with just paragraph two.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Yeah, maybe reread it once or twice, just to see, okay,",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Yeah, great. Okay, now you can start to read the task now.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Teacher : NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Teacher : The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called or microscope to look really closely. So, Luis, or Oliver. I'm sorry.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, and Oliver can you reread that first question?",,,,
Oliver,120.3,Okay um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Farrah. Can you read the question for me that you're trying to answer.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Huh. Yes, it's um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Can you reread the part in the article about the microscope for me, please. Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Yeah, out loud.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"and then Chris, can you reread the part about the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Chris,120.3,"Yeah, I can do that. Definitely. Um, it says, let's see, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and lock her ice deposits and a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Um, can you read the next two sentences for me.",,,,
Chris,120.3,"Mm hmm. Yeah, okay, these ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Can someone read reread paragraph two, for me, where it begins with NASA send a small machine, who can read that for me.",,,,
Oliver,120.3,It says NASA sent a machine called all Lunar Orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar quarter. These are still deposits are very small.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,but let's read the next step. So can someone read the third paragraph out loud to me.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,So let's start by looking back at the question again.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,So can someone read the question out loud to me.,,,,
Chris,120.3,"Yeah, I'll read it.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,That's a really good question. So the way that I would try to find the answer to that is by looking back in the text.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Each ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one top 10 of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,So why don't we begin by just reviewing the question one more time. Could someone read that out loud to me.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,So why don't we all work on that together. So could you go ahead and read that question out loud to me Luis.,,,,
Luis,120.3,Yeah okay um the question as what equipment at scientists to is to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,You were talking about which equipment they were using first and let's if I would suggest you revisit the question one more time.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Can you read what that question is.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Yes. So, so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Farrah, can you read?",,,,
Oliver,120.3,All okay,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,The second one is NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,These ice deposits are very small. And then our third fact is that means the moon is still drier than the driest or desert on Earth.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Oh, interesting. Okay, so what I want you to do is I want you to right now read me the question that we're trying to figure out",,,,
Oliver,120.3,"Okay um what equipment did scientists use to find water on the moon. Okay, so we're looking for the equipment that scientist us to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Oh, alright. Can you read that whole sentence to me, starting from the beginning.",,,,
Oliver,120.3,Yeah okay this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar greater,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Oh, so it says this Lunar Orbiter. Will look for deposits.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Yeah, so I see where you're looking. NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,It is water on the Moon. The Moon is a desert.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, I'm going to continue reading number three. That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So you just answered a question about, I'm not exactly sure what it was with someone like to raise their hand and tell me what you just read and what you just answered, Luis.",,,,
Luis,120.3,"Okay, yeah. So um we answered the question about the equipment and the water on the moon, but I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Oh, I love to hear what you know about space right now I want to focus on the question that we had to ask, what was it exactly do you have the text in front of you. Maybe someone can read it from their book from their icon.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Okay, so the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,I can see this is that you're talking about the water they found is microscopic can you continue reading that paragraph.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Okay. Um, so the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Can you reread the question to me.,,,,
Oliver,120.3,Yeah. On what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the mound.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Can you reread the question to me.,,,,
Luis,120.3,Yeah. What equipment did scientists to us to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Even I want you to go back to the text and reread pragraphs one and three.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, everyone looked back and paragraph two,",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"But I would like, for you to reread for me, the first sentence of paragraph three, can you read that allowed for us Chris.",,,,
Chris,120.3,"Oh yeah Okay, it says, this means the room is still drier than the driest desert on earth.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Yeah, that's interesting. Um, I wanted to point a specific area I wanted us to read together. Um, can you look at bullet number three and read the first sentence out to me.",,,,
Chris,120.3,"Okay. Oh, part three. You said the first sentence. Okay. It says that means the moon is still drier than the dryest desert on Earth.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Can you read the second sentence out loud to me.,,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"Okay, the second sentence on this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit handle large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,So can you go back to the text and think about the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,But how about we look once again at the text you know.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,But so i'm curious if we can look through the text again.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"yeah well that's the cool thing about this text, so it kind of explains it um Chris, do you mind reading section two out loud.",,,,
Chris,120.3,On yeah I can do that okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Can you can you read a little bit earlier in the text for me?,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay i'm wondering if you can read the question out loud, for me, can you do that.",,,,
Luis,120.3,question asked what he did scientists to us to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So Would you mind reading the text for me and seeing if using something different, at the end.",,,,
Luis,120.3,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Oh awesome do you want to go back to paragraph two, with me really quick, can you read that first sentence for me.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Totally, so we're going back to the question, so what what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon,",,,,
Teacher,120.3,You know what Farrah that's a great point can we all look at our text and look at the second paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Farrah or Jazmin That was a great point, could you read out the part in paragraph to that you thought gave you your answer.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,yeah it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter line at the south Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"And then also I want Farrah Oliver and Chris, will you guys look at the fourth paragraph and then Jazmin and Luis will you guys look at the bottom, the last two sentences in the fifth paragraph?",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Yes, sorry I think I drew your attention to the wrong part of that paragraph, will you read the i'm going to read it to you that way I don't have to keep telling you which sentence ""moon water could be useful in other ways, water can be broken down into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen""",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"astronauts can breathe oxygen, oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel. Rocket fuel can help spacecrafts to move, just like a gas helps cars.",,,,
Luis,120.3,"Okay, I heard this one, and so it can like help spacecrafts to move like fuel.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay that's Okay, if you guys have the texts in front of you, we can look where it says number two do you see where it says number two i'll read it for you, it says NASA.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Take a look specifically at paragraph two.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Paragraph two.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,They I guess they use the Lunar orbiter to discover it.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Chris, you mentioned that scientists found craters full of water on the moon. Can you take a look at the the title for me, can you read the title of the article for me?",,,,
Chris,120.3,"Yeah, ok. It says Okay, water on the moon is a desert.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"awesome great yeah we does everyone see in the first sentence and paragraph two, it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbit to investigate great i'm seeing head nods.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Yes, so you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, can you read the next sentence out loud, for us, please.",,,,
Oliver,120.3,Okay um so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Alright, so I want everyone to focus in on the second sentence and we're going to look at it in paragraph two, it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater so.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"yeah that is that is 100% correct, but can I have somebody read question one out loud for us again.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,and specifically what is the sentence say.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,"yeah it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, do you think you could go back and reread the article and then complete your answer?",,,,
Luis,120.3,"yeah yeah Okay, I guess, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"That you're on the right path right, and so I want you to do the same thing as Farrah just looked at that text because again.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Exactly, so what I want everybody to do now is take a look at the text and we are going to read the first paragraph again together.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,The moon is a desert scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's color craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Everybody should look at your paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Good now let's look at the second paragraph together NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"That means the moon, is still dryer and it's a very fun for.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, and can you read that out loud, for us, please.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"mm hmm so let me read that part, the first part, or part two together so NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter will land on the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,I think we just need to take a moment to look back at what we read.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So when I say go, you have one minute to review your three little paragraphs and then we'll come back together to talk okay go ahead.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,and Jazmin can you just point us back to that sentence that you read in the story and read that for us again.,,,,
Jazmin,120.3,"Yes, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,So Oliver can you read the question again that we're working to answer.,,,,
Oliver,120.3,Mhmm yeah.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Farrah can you read the question for me.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,"yeah Okay, so it says what equipment did scientists use to discover.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So Luis said, I understand that let's let's go back and read the text just see where can we find this evidence in the text Chris, do you want to add to something before we move up yeah go ahead.",,,,
Chris,120.3,"yeah yeah cuz it kind of goes with what Luis said because I went to NASA actually, and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and also masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"but now Farrah can you give it another try, can you read, can we can you read, part two of the decks.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, you can get to drive so don't feel don't don't be afraid go ahead yeah Farrah would you like to just read the text for us again",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So how about why don't why don't we carefully look at the number of paragraph two, can you can can Jazmin use that paragraph two, can you read it out loud for us.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,go right ahead.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"yeah yeah and, since you and Farrah you guys are agreeing each other, can I have Farrah read the third paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Oh, you didn't know about the water and that's incredible well if you actually go back to the passage in the first paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"so let's start from the beginning, so if you go back to the question I love to have you wide, so why don't you try reading the question again.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,Okay um what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"but Luis can you read the question for us, do you have it.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,there's a little bit more keep reading.,,,,
Luis,120.3,I don't see anything.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"so once again can Oliver can you read the question, one more time for me.",,,,
Oliver,120.3,"Okay yeah okay that's what equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon, so all the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay Okay, so I can see where this is going to be a little bit confusing um so you're absolutely right that the piece of equipment is a microscope but can you read the sentence that has the word microscope in it Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,I circled it and everything.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Can you read the sentence before that Chris.,,,,
Chris,120.3,"yeah yeah I can do that right before it says Okay, the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"and take a couple of minutes to read it, while I connect with your fellow space enthusiasts classmates and maybe you can also kind of keep an ear open while you're reading and and get a sense of what your classmates got out of it so Jazmin what yes Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,I understand why my answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"There is paragraph two, could you go ahead and look at paragraph two",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,Oh yeah I could I could write the whole sentence nasa's into small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate that is that right.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,that's that's right there in that paragraph to you keep reading a little bit more.,,,,
Oliver,120.3,"Like Oh, they want me to study the surface and don't know.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,mm hmm that is a great question so if we look at the text that we read it says that the Lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Would you like to read the passage since we feel like the confusion is still there and let's read it together as a class and see what the passage says, Chris, yes, Chris?",,,,
Chris,120.3,"yeah well Actually, I have a comment it's that I, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So maybe if any one of you can volunteer to read passage 2 and as a class, we can try to figure out the answer to this question would like to volunteer for that.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,yeah I want to take a look at that article again that water on the moon article that piece from it says.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"adapted from the New York Times that piece you read, I want you to go back, but I want to see if we can flesh out what Jazmin's talking about here.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"The water or identified the water so let's all go back to that text and i'm going to give you just a few few seconds, maybe 30 seconds.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Oh yeah you're absolutely right i've seen that line, it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"i'm wondering let's go back to that question can somebody read the question that we were supposed to answer again. Oliver yeah, thank you.",,,,
Oliver,120.3,"um well actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to and valuing all of our answers.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,I know we had a question to start us off that was I don't know Can someone read the question that we were trying to answer before we got in this group.,,,,
Chris,120.3,yeah it was on one equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, thank you for responding Chris so i'm wants to go back and I think it was to see if we could try to make an inference so Chris, if you can look at the third paragraph and I want you to just, would you be able to read for us the first line of the third paragraph Chris?",,,,
Chris,120.3,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"So Chris, actually read the next sentence too.",,,,
Chris,120.3,"Okay, all the water they found is microscopic meaning wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it okay.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"I want us to think very carefully about what question with the question is being asked to us, what is the question that we're trying to find the answer to Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Oh i'm so sorry I really I really want to keep going, but we have to go to lunch now.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"In in writing those responses, so what I want everybody to do is I want you to read the question, one more time Okay, we oh Luis you have a question go ahead.",,,,
Luis,120.3,um yeah well I I shouldn't be in this group. I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"but can you actually read the question out loud, for me, can you read the question.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Which one of you would like to read the question again out loud for me.,,,,
Oliver,120.3,"I can do it, um okay equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,um can you read that part in the text out loud for me.,,,,
Farrah,120.3,"yeah Okay, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"But what was that second part of the question, can you read the second part of the question, Chris",,,,
Chris,120.3,"circle, the evidence in the text we can use to answer this question.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"can I have a volunteer to read this question out loud, please.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Right, so can we can one of you read the question out loud for me i'll read the question that's great.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,What equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,yeah so we've used evidence from paragraph to hand paragraph three let's take another look at paragraph one and see if there's any other information there that we can use.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Does someone want to read paragraph one out loud for us?,,,,
Luis,120.3,yeah I do!,,,,
Teacher,120.3,yeah thanks Luis go ahead and read paragraph one for us.,,,,
Luis,120.3,"Okay, it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moons polar craters and these craters are dark places where the sun never shines.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,So the first thing that I want us to do we're going to look back at actually what the question is asking us.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"All right, go ahead and look backward in the text, what about the rest of us.",,,,
Chris,120.3,"I forgot to put the discovering water part, but I did put the equipment in my answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"i'm wondering, could you read the question that we wanted to answer out loud for everybody.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,And the next part of the question.,,,,
Luis,120.3,"um it says okay circle circle, the evidence and the text that we can use to answer this question.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Part two great thanks for referencing us all to the text so everybody look take a look at your text right paragraph two right NASA send a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"let's go back to the question, can you maybe the first.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"yeah definitely definitely agree, so the universe is so mysterious, and there is very large space for us to explore. So um, do you know what is our question for today?",,,,
Luis,120.3,um yeah it is it's right here it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"but anyone read it out to the whole class. Luis, could you please read it, for us, the first sentence.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"yeah and um Could you also please read, for us, the first sentence of Part two",,,,
Luis,120.3,Okay okay NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"All right, you all gave such great responses to this question now, I just want us to all take a look back at the question i'm going to read it, and if you could just follow along yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,120.3,Up yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Great so it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Okay yeah in the text . Chris.,,,,
Chris,120.3,I can read it.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"And so it says the water they found is microscopic meaning they wouldn't be able to see it if it were, if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"yeah, so why don't we take a look at paragraph two together so can everyone take a moment and maybe just reread paragraph two, to yourself.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,So maybe um I wonder if Oliver could you repeat the question back to us if you have it handy.,,,,
Oliver,120.3,"yeah Okay, right here on the question as what equipment that scientists use or discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,If you guys can all look at that second paragraph that starts with the word NASA.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Jazmin do you mind reading that first sentence out loud.,,,,
Jazmin,120.3,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, great um Luis do you want to read that paragraph three, for us, maybe just focusing on the last sentence there.",,,,
Luis,120.3,You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,It says this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in the large polar crater,,,,
Oliver,120.3,looks like it's looking for deposit.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Water on the moon, I want us to take a look, though back at the question that was being asked and I want us to think about oh yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,120.3,um yeah excuse me.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,Now we're going to look at back at the question to think about what is this question asking so can anyone read for me the question that we need to answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"so I want to go back to what Jazmin said so Jazmin can you read actually the first sentence of paragraph to read the whole sentence, where you found the answer okay.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,It says NASA such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Oh Okay, so can you keep going and read the next sentence.",,,,
Jazmin,120.3,Is lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Ah, OK that's a great point so let's go back to the microscope So what does it say.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"What does it say on paragraph three, about the microscope um can anyone start reading with the sentence that says, the second sentence and paragraph three Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Can I read it Okay, the second sentence.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,is actually showing the text but Farrah I want you to read the question more closely. So what does the question ask us?,,,,
Farrah,120.3,"Okay, it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"I want you to read closely about the paragraphs, the second paragraph,",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Can we look at test again and.,,,,
Oliver,120.3,"Excuse me on i'm so sorry I really don't want to interrupt, but I just looked at the clock and.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Good cool all right, so we just read this short excerpt about discovering water on the moon, and so our first question, can I was wondering if someone can remind me Luis you look really excited to answer so if you could please reread the question for us?",,,,
Luis,120.3,"Oh yeah I can but I just wanted to say before I read anything that I don't think I need to be in this group, because I already know, like everything there is to know about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Alright cool that sounds good alright so let's jump back into that first part, do you mind repeating the question for us?",,,,
Luis,120.3,"um Okay, so the question was um what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Alright class so let's jump back into where we left off and have you guys in your groups you guys can continue talking and just reread paragraph two okay.,,,,
All,120.3,All right.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Alright, so the main question I wanted to help you guys answer today is the first question that we answered some remind me of that question.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,Well let's take a look back at the passage okay um can I get a volunteer to read a paragraph to just for some context.,,,,
Teacher,120.3,"let's all take a look at that part of paragraph two, there, right at the beginning NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,120.3,"Okay, so this this might work for you to this next suggestion, so what I might do is do a little bit of rereading.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So let's see Chris what answer, did you put for the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Chris,120.4,Oh man oh I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,um so I was wondering if I could get them volunteer to share.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris, did you find the piece of equipment in the text, yet.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"yeah so Luis What did you find you were reading, what did you find for me.",,,,
Luis,120.4,i'm the same thing that they found that the Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"hi so, can you guys repeat your answers to the question for me real quick and we'll go down the line from Farrah all the way down to Luis from right from my right to from my left to my right yeah Luis do have a question.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah yeah before we do that, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah repeat for me what your answer was. Real quick.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yes, Okay, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Great Thank you and you Oliver?,,,,
Oliver,120.4,yeah i'm I circled the same as Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Wonderful. Chris?,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, well, I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Nice and Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Okay, well, I said that NASA send a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Great and Luis.,,,,
Luis,120.4,yeah okay well i'm scientists they use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Great So if I were to ask you again what kind of equipment, do they use what would you would What would you circle.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"So, so I just need to circle, then maybe I just need to circle lunar orbiter?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Okay. Does anyone want to raise their hand and tell me what they think the action word is,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so what is your answer to the discussion question?",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, let me see. I said, that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. I already know that equipment that they use.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so what's your answer?",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, that they use the microscope to look closely at the water",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Luis, what do you think?",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Well, I think that because they they really like to have to travel around a lot that they probably use their like their their their like telescopes to look at the water. Um, well, like when they were on Earth, you know, because that's how you can look from Earth on",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris did you find the answer.,,,,
Chris,120.4,Um yeah i guess i well i went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"nd first I'd like to address Farrah Farrah, would you like to read your answer to us.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, Chris, would you like to read your answer.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Yeah, okay. So I said that pre scientists found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yes. Okay, and Jazmin, would you like to read us your answer.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,and Luis that would you like to read as your answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Okay Luis What do you think,,,,
Luis,120.4,"So I looked at, paragraph two, and what we see and like what I was listening to everybody. I'm",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So let's talk about some of your answers. Would one of you like to volunteer your answer. Luis,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Can we start with your answer. Luis,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Yeah, sure. So basically what what I said was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Great. Can somebody volunteers for me to give me a word that you might have underlined that can help us find an answer. Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yes, in the way that I underlined was well action like two words. Equipment and discover.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,I wanted to just Farrah. If you remind me of your answer.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"So no, not for a long time. I don't think that the evidence is",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Um, let's see who was it that told me that the water is heavy and carrying the water was maybe not a good idea. Chris was that you",,,,
Chris,120.4,Yes that was me.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What about number, paragraph two, could anybody find that answer.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yeah, I found the equipment, but it wasn't an aircraft to I found the equipment in paragraph three because yeah",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris, maybe",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Yeah, well, I know that all that. And I know that. Well, I went to NASA with my dad. And so I know that our scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right. Did you guys circle, a word.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Who would like to tell me what word they circled,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Farrah, let's start with you. What word. Did you circle in your question.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,Oh my circle two words right,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Good. How about you, Chris.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Oh, I did as well.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Can someone tell me what two words that they circled,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Good. So who would like to share what they circled on their paper or on their breeding passage,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris, what did you underline or circle.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, so what I circled up. All right, what I was looking at was, I was thinking like that water can be broken down into two parts, and that was where was that, oh yeah, in paragraph by water can be broken down two parts hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, Farrah, you know, what did you underline or circle.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"So, okay, be what I was looking at",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Okay. All right. Then what did you underline or circle.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and, like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Jazmin. Would you remind me of what you had told me before.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yeah, I said the lunar orbiter because it says, and NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So, um, I want to know from you all. Maybe each one of you can tell me something that you remember or that you found interesting about the reading. So I'd like to start with Farrah. Can you tell me something that you found interesting about the reading.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yeah, so I think one thing that I thought was really interesting was when I was looking for the for the equipment, but to see like how much equipment they have to use it. There's a lot of it.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, Oliver. What about you, was there something interesting that stood out to you about the reading.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, yeah, I think what was really interesting to me about this one was like the fact that there was just like, you know, the fact that there's so little water like it's all spread across the surface, but they were still able to find it using the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay. And, um, Chris. What about you, is there something really interesting about the reading.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Hi, Jazmin. Thank you for raising your hand, would you like to share something interesting about the reading.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yeah, I guess, the thing that I had was that I was kind of confused about why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,All right. Luis You said you knew a lot about science. Was there something interesting about this article that stood out to you.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Hi. Yeah, I was really cool and I think for me, like the thing that was so interesting is like seeing that like you know how they use the equipment. They have this equipment and then they have to use all these different pieces in order to like find the water and study it, that's really cool.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay I saw savannas hand first. What do you think, Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris, do you have something you'd like to add.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"On y'all because I was just thinking that because I went to NASA. And I just know that scientists use like lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots, and that wasn't in the reading.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"I'm sorry, Jazmin, what was that?",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Then I don't know why my answer is wrong. Because I said a small machine and they asked about equipment.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Do you remember put for that?,,,,
Farrah,120.4,I'm I'm trying to remember. I don't remember what I put. Let me just see. Because I circled it on my tablet oh yeah I circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,What did you put?,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"On well I circled the same thing as Farrah on the bottom of the page we I didn't like circle it because she circled it, but we had, we had the same answer. What I circled the same thing. Um, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, do you have anything else you want to add?",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Well, I. It's meet Farrah here, I just want to say that I don't understand why my answer's wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,I'm sorry. Say that one more time.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,I guess put more of the question in my answer. So I couldn't have said a small machine to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Um, what, what did you correct it to what did you write down again.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, well, I didn't. I already submitted it, I don't remember what I wrote down, um, let me see if it's on my slide.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,And let's just see what you guys got Farrah. Did you find one.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,I did and I already corrected my answer too.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right. Um, and then Oliver. Did you get the chance to revise yours?",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Oh, I couldn't figure out what was wrong because I thought the microscope was right.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah. Would you remind me of your answer again.,,,,
Luis,120.4,Excuse me. I shouldn't be in this group. I know all about speed.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you. Can you repeat that?",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,I don't understand why is my answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,So who can raise their hand and tell me what equipment.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris. What do you think about the reading. Was it informative for you?,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Well, I think it was informative because I realized that there was all this water in all these craters on the moon like it sounds like there's overflowing water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,What do you think about the article Oliver?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Was it interesting for you?,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Well, that's a great question. I think what was interesting was mostly the fact that I'm like well",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Will you like to do that. Luis,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, yeah, like there's a few things that I should are that I've learned from like I learned that, like, Well, like you have to use all this equipment and stuff like that.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Farrah, what do you think about the article that you learn something with the article today?",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yeah, I learned about how you use microscopes different ways, I think that the thing I want you to the question I have is like why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver. Thanks for raising your hands there.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, yeah, so I thought the equipment. I think that the microscope, I agree with Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris. What equipment do you think that they use.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Well, okay. So one thing that I noticed is I been to NASA with my dad and I love space and I noticed that the astronauts use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that. You know what I mean. So I was wondering if they use that for this too.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,What do you think Jazmin? What equipment did they use?,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"I am convinced that they used the lunar orbiter. And I think that that's like, because that's the small machine that they set and unfortunately",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so, Farrah. What equipment do you think that scientists used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Oh, so I think it's the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver. What was your answer.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, so my answer was basically that I had I you know I circled the same thing as as Farrah. And I think the same thing that the microscope was was what they used to discover.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"You know all about space. Let's see. So even if I remember correctly, you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Absolutely. Very good, thank you. And so what was your response to this.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Well, I mean, I had that same as Farrah, because I circled the last what she thought was the last sentence and I I circled the last sentence. Do you need assigned a tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Thank you for that understanding today so Chris, I'd like to hear your response.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Well, I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So, uh, and I'm so sorry. Chris, I might have dismiss heard you. Could you repeat your response for me, word for word just an I make sure I",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So Farrah, let's start with you. What was your answer to the question number one.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay. So I said,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Ah, say that statement. One more time.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so now let's look at your statement.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Now once you read your statement again.,,,,
Luis,120.4,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so what is",,,,
Luis,120.4,The Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Once you read that to go back to Chris Chris. What do you think about the answer to the question is,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, I also kind of like Luis I definitely feel like I knocked it out the park this time because",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Also, let's hear",,,,
Chris,120.4,"OK. OK, so here we go. Um, water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, what was your answer to this question.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Say it's not a good answer. I just say it might be some improvement there. So, Jazmin, what you got.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,What was your answer. Sorry.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"I mean was different from there. So I don't know. They said, Yeah, but I said no. I said no. It's not ready yet.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Well he's reading that. What was your answer.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay well i i thought that it was kind of similar to deaths, where it was like, not for a long time because it said, making this plan will take a lot of time and money.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Did you guys did you have any luck, searching for more stuff over there.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, yeah, we found some stuff.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,You just said it does know what was your answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Right. Luis What's another use,,,,
Luis,120.4,rocket fuel all,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, I would like to hear from you.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,What I said was that scientists is used a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"The small things on the moon was having to be looked at, through a what Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"so I said microscope, but I'm not quite sure. Like why is my answer wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,And Oliver I noticed that you circled the same thing is what Farrah did,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What do you think, Farrah? What was your answer on that? Do you remember?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So. Would anybody like to share one of their responses for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon S,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so can you tell me your answer again.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Oh. Yes. So basically, my answer was just that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Okay Luis What did you create your answer to?,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, so basically what I was saying was that scientists found ice using a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay. Um, what other questions do you have Chris.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"I guess like I went to NASA. And so I i know that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and suit, and I guess I'm wondering, like why that wasn't right.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Let's look at your answer. Luis,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Yeah, I talked about equipment in my answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Can you repeat that please,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yeah, I thought it was a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver. Can you tell me,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, so I saw I listened to Jazmin's answer. She said that it was, um, the Lunar Orbiter. I think",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Awesome, great Jazmin. So I first want to start with Farrah. Farrah Could you read, you me your answer",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yeah, sure.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,but let's get to Luis. Luis read your answer.,,,,
Luis,120.4,Said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Will you read your answer for me please?,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Okay, so I said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated. You can't survive without water",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so let's look at Oliver.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, and what was your answer.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"So I said, like they need like all the oxygen tanks and they like you know they need, like, all that stuff that like astronauts used to like go fly around in space.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, okay. Now who wants to share with me. What words did you choose what words from the question. Did you circle. Yes. Luis",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, yeah. So I guess I was wondering, like, I think I know the words, but I was wondering about like discover",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Is from the other group wants to share which word. Did you discuss,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"So basically we said like, what was that we talked about the different machines that people would say, okay, people would use.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, anybody wants to share that. What does that mean yes Farrah?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Jazmin refresh my memory. What was your answer.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,To be connected with that they use a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, it can be at Oliveron. What did you circle the",,,,
,120.4,One.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Luis What did you circle.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, so I basically when I went in. I circle.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So what was your answer to the question, what tool did the scientists used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Well, I was saying that the scientists would have to use like I'm like spacesuits and that they would need like rocket fuel and they would need oxygen and like all that stuff that I already know before like ever doing the reading.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, Jazmin. Let's look at your answer that you gave. Yes, Luis?",,,,
Luis,120.4,"I do have a question. So, um, here's what I was thinking. Um, I know like a lot about space like practically everything that you can know about space. I don't really think I need any help. I don't think I should be in this group.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,How did you answer the question again?,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"So I said that NASA sent a small machine. And then when I was reading, I said NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Luis Luis What did you want to ask first,",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, well, I was just gonna say that I kind of know like all about space. I don't think I need to be in this group.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so what did you your. And what did you want to add to that. Chris?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, I'm sorry, Chris, what did you want to add to that.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so what was your response Luis?",,,,
Luis,120.4,"So okay, so my response was that water can be split into two parts at the hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay. So your answer. Tell me what your answer was, again,",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yeah, so my answer was that yes there's convincing evidence because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated. You can't survive without water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, what do you think",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Um, to basically we. Is it the answer to the question, or like, why are you",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Yes. So do you think water could be useful.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Oh yeah, I think it would be really because astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water. Also, you could use the order that they have and you could grow a garden all over the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris. What do you think, do you think water could be valuable from the moon.",,,,
Chris,120.4,I'm yeah i mean,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver. What do you think,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, okay. So I was thinking that no and mostly because it's not it's not ready.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, Farrah. What do you think",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Um, so basically I thought that. Okay, so my answer is also know and that I guess I feel a little different from Oliver is like, it wouldn't be useful for a long time.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,so Farrah. Let's look back to your answer you answered.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, that's two of the key words Jazmin, you can maybe you can give us another one.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,How about Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, Deb, is there a different word that you found",,,,
Oliver,120.4,I'm gonna say convincing.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,So Luis Can you remind you what was your answer for this question.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Now Chris. Can you tell me what your answer was, again,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, Oliver. Can you tell me what your answer was",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, yeah. So I said that. Um, no, like, I didn't think the evidence was very convincing because it's not ready yet.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"can you remind me, Jazmin, what was your answer to this question.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Um, Farrah what was your answer to this one.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay guys, so let's go ahead and review your answers. Yes. Luis",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, yeah. So, um, I just wanted to say that, like, I don't think I need to be in this group because I already know. Like all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Well, let's review some answers. And then we'll see about that. Okay. So, Luis I noticed that you when you answered. Can you repeat your answer for me.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, yeah. So basically what I said was, um, Let's see, what did I say I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, I'm gonna while you look, I'm going to go to Jazmin and look at Jazmin's answer so Jazmin. Can you repeat your answer for me, please.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Yeah so i said NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,now Chris. Can you repeat your answer for me.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Yes Farrah/,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"On. I was just wondering, because I guess I'm still not sure why my answer's wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Um, can you repeat your answer for me.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yeah, so my answer was basically that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So can you read your response. One more time Farrah a please,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yeah, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so, Luis, did you discover how to, did you discover the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon?",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, well, I just kind of kept looking around and look what I was like I i looked in paragraph three.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, well do you know the answer to our question that we are talking about today. So how did scientists discover water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Oh yeah, sure. Um, well, they need like oxygen tanks and spacesuits in order to roll up to the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, do you remember the name",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yeah, okay I think so, when we were rereading. I saw that in paragraph two NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right before our little time is up and we need a good clear, concise answer. Anyone have one that they would like to share?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Your answer was what?,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Good. I think I had the right answer. I said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated. You can't survive without water and and that's true and they talk about in the first paragraph that astronauts could drink the water. So why am I in this group.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Now, Oliver, could you talk to us about your answer?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, Farrah, can you please, um,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Can you share with your friends. What was your response.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Yeah. So basically, my response was, I circled the same thing as survey.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Jazmin why don't you share with us.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Well I was thinking that you could use water to grow things, so that we could have like a garden, can you imagine how beautiful it woud be?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Thank you, Luis, and Jazmin. So who would like to share something that they underlined.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris, what did you underline",,,,
Chris,120.4,"So I said that you could wait. Okay, um, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen, which is a big deal.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"You're right, Farrah. So what did you say for your answer?",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"I'd say-- I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. But the teacher said that we were all over here because we had partial responses to the question. But I don't understand why mine has a partial response.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So what did they send to investigate the moon's craters?,,,,
Chris,120.4,The Lunar Orbiter?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"OK. Good. Good. Sounds good. So let's see. Let me see. I know you guys had already submitted me some questions. Farrah, can you talk about your question a little bit? Your answer that you gave me.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,Yeah. Sure. I said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Right. Cool. Thank you. Luis I'll need your help. And so can you guys show me your responses to the first question.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"says we can't lift up our tablets off the desk, but we can meet them. Um, my answer was that NASA send to small machine.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Awesome. So, um, let's see, Farrah. Were you the one that talked about",,,,
Teacher,120.4,The microscope premier,,,,
Farrah,120.4,Yeah um I circled the last sentence. It's in the in the story where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's at the end of paragraph three,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oh yeah. Okay, so can you read me your answer. Again, sometimes it's hard to keep up with so many. I can't see him.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yeah. Um, so this is",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So, Luis. Tell me what",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"While you're thinking, I'm going to answer, guys. My question, what did you need Jazmin, what was your question.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Oh, it wasn't a question. It's just that I found the rest of the sentence.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Alright, Oliver. Did you find something else.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, well, I found the same thing. Not even was saying, but they have also have a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter. Um, but I thought one is talking about. I spend only in paragraph one paragraph three, or they're really talking about the water",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Good. Okay. So, I think, paragraph two, is really important. So, Farrah. I asked you to do something. So did you",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Um, okay. Yes. So, so I looked, I looked, because I was also I was listening to what you are seeing a Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, Jazmin. Have you talked it out.",,,,
Luis,120.4,Uh huh.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so tell me what you got.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Me, My family. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch. Um, but I did want to say thank you so much for",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so let's go over some of our answers Farrah. Do you want to give your answer.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Oh yeah. Okay. So I said, that a scientist, would need to use a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver would you like to give your answer to the reading into the question.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"and Chris. Can you tell us what you think the answer is, and what you found in the text.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, what did you find in the text.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Basically, NASA sent this small machine. And that was what was like, what found all the water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,and then Luis You said that you knew a lot about space. I bet you really enjoyed this reading. Then what did you find out that NASA used?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oliver, what did you see why you were reading",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, I guess I saw the same thing cuz I I just kept seeing microscope, and I kept thinking about microscopes for some reason.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris. How about you, why you read. Read your story. What did you find",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Well, okay, so I tried to focus on the equipment.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What did you circle, Luis.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Well I, I wanted. I'm sorry. I just wanted to say I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So I would appreciate it if you would just kind of listen and maybe you will learn something new. So, Farrah,  can you read to me your answer about the question that was asked.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yeah. OK, so my answer was basically",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver. I did see that you put you answered the same as Farrah. So in your words. Can you tell me how you would answer that question.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,And what was your response. What did you put,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Luis Do you have a question.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, yeah. Well, it's kind of more of like a thought, I guess. I think I got this all figured out. So I think I'm all good.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Sure and Luis I saw that your hand was up. Do you have a question.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, I forgot.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Farrah, you want to go first. Oh, and Chris awesome Farrah, you go first. For me, okay.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay. So, all right. So my answer was basically that you need a scientific microscope to look really close and",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yes, Farrah go ahead and say it.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay, so actually I guess it was really about looking like discover",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So Def, do you have something to add to this? You had your hand raised.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"No, I was gonna say the same thing as Farrah, but I'm still kind of wondering why our answer is wrong like why the two of us is our answer is wrong. I don't quite understand.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Okay well so Farrah just had a really good point. Farrah. Can you repeat that for Oliver for me.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yeah, so that basically like when you look at it, the third paragraph. Like it doesn't say discovery to we're supposed to match up.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin? What do you say again, can you say again.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yes, i was going to say investigate.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"You're not sure. Okay, we'll keep looking Chris, what, what can I help you with, what do you think you know the answer.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Well yeah, I was gonna say, I went to NASA with my dad and I know that scientists lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and that's not in the reading. But I know that they use, you know,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What else, Luis.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Farrah, what is valuable mean to you.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"You did. Okay. Perfect. Alright, so let's start with Jazmin's group. What are some of the things that it said make water a valuable resource from the moon Chris.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Yeah, okay. So one thing is that water can be broken down into two parts into hydrogen and oxygen. And it says that",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yeah, so I was just going to ask like,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Yes. Luis Did you have a question?,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Teacher? Yes. Yeah, I just want to remind you that my dad is an astronaut.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What else do you think would make water valuable, Oliver. What are your thoughts on that.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Well, I had read the same thing that Farrah was talking about in the last paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"OK so Luis what's another way that water could be valuable, what's another thing they could use water for?",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Excuse me, Mr. Teacher. I just thought about something from the story.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, Chris. Go ahead.",,,,
Chris,120.4,Water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,What are some things you can use oxygen for? What do you think Luis?,,,,
Luis,120.4,To breathe?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Farrah, what do you think?",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Um, so I think that the um the equipment was the microscope, like in the reading. It says you need a microscope, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So Chris, what do you think they used to determine the water was on the moon. What did. What did the reading tell you?",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Well, so here's the thing, like I kind of thought that, like, um, well I've been to NASA with my dad and like we really",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Um, and so, yes. Luis Do you have a question.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Oh, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Any ideas about how they might detect water on, from the orbiter?",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Hmm, okay. Now that I've seen a picture of it. Um, I think that, let's see, how would they detect the water. Um, I feel like maybe maybe the camera just kind of look for it. And if they see some puddles of water and then that's how they find it.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Any thoughts about that?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris. Go ahead. What do you think, Farrah, go ahead.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Well, I was just, I was thinking that you know if I'm, if, if, if the astronauts got, like, you know, thirsty or something, then they could just like drill a hole in the moon, maybe, and then they could drink the water like that maybe.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So Oliver what do you have,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Well, I was just looking at the clock and I i see about it's time for us to go to lunch. So I just wanted to let you know before we call",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So, Sabina, do you care to share your response with us.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay, Farrah. And so, do you mind to share with us what your response was,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So, Jazmin, what did. What did you say",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,I said that I used to small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"That water on the moon could be valuable. It can be of use for the astronauts so Jazmin, you stated that there was not convincing evidence is that correct",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Well, I just, I mean, I do think there's convincing evidence because like they could drink the water and they could stay hydrated and you need water. So that seems to be convincing the have water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"And then Jazmin, what did you say astronauts could do",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,I said they could drink it.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Teacher:Alright, Luis, so without looking at the text, do you know the answer to that question?",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, well, I think that they use like oxygen tanks and that they use like space suits and stuff like that.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, Farrah, and what was your answer to the discussion question.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,So my answer was that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris?,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Yeah, okay. So I think like discover is like how you you find something or you kind of like um like you. You like find something",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Alright, Jazmin, you kind of want to explain your answer for us?",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Sure. So basically what I said was that that NASA used a small machine. And that's like the machine that they sent to the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What is it, Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,So they used the lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Farrah, what did they discover",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"They found lots of um, well they found water, they found amounts of water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Jazmin?,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"So they used the Lunar Orbiter to discover water. And so we have to go in just a moment. But before we went, I just wanted to thank you for",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,So I think they sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, you haven't spoken yet. What do you believe they may have sent to the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"I would like to at least in the beginning, let's let's let Jazmin and Chrise let us know what they got for the first question.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,And Oliver. What was your answer to that question.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, OK. So my answer was no, you know, I'm because I don't think it's ready yet.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, now let's go over to the first group.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Farrah, what's something that you learn new from your partners.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"So Pearson was talking about how he went to NASA. And he like got to go and visit with his dad. And so he was talking about how like in like rocket launches how like the, like, um like, it looks like smoke but it's actually steam comes out of the rocket when it flies up, which is pretty cool.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay. So your answer was, will you refresh my memory and tell me what your answer was?",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Sure. My answer was, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yes, Luis?",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Okay, so I think that they probably had to use stuff like oxygen tanks and masks and spacesuits and and like, stuff like that, you know,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Jazmin?,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,I think they use the small machine machine. And it's called a lunar orbiter. I think that's what they used to discover the water,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay and Farrah, isn't that what you mentioned? You'd need a scientific tool called a what?",,,,
Farrah,120.4,A microscope.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Okay. All right. Farrah?,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Um, yeah. So I just unfortunately we have to go to lunch. But before we went to lunch. I just wanted to thank you for working with us.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Farrah. I, it seems like you and Oliver here, we're kind of on the same path. Farrah. Can you read your response for me, please.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,I'm sure I can. I think Luis has his hand raised.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"And then while you're doing that. Can I hear from some of the people that haven't talked about what about Chris or Jazmin, and when you tell me what  what you read.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, and what, what did you find what what do you like to share together as a group.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Well, I guess we were listening to, as you were saying this stuff with with Jazmin. So I guess the, the difference is like what's the best answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So that sounds very good. So, would anyone like to open up with what they thought as far as their response to the first discussion question.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So anything. Would you like to share,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Yeah, yeah. Okay, so, um, we were reading that up first.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yes, that is what it's called. So did any of you guys, Farrah, Oliver, Chris, Luis, Did any of you guys see any other information about the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, yeah, this is Luis.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"and Jazmin, what did you say that small machine was called again.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,It's called a lunar orbiter,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Well, then yes, go ahead and ask it.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay. So I was just wondering, like, okay, so I went to NASA with my dad and we went and looked at, like all the spacesuits. And like all this stuff.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Even you can go ahead and start.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, yeah. Well, I was gonna say like I already kind of know all about ease. So I don't think I need any help. I don't think I need to be in this",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Um Let's have someone else talk for a second if anyone has their hand raised.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,What do you know about equipment used in space.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Well, I don't really know very much about like",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So what are you thinking Chris. I haven't heard much from you.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, I have been to NASA with my dad. So I know that like scientists use up like equipment like masks and suits like stuff like even said so.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, what are you thinking",,,,
Teacher,120.4,What are you thinking for number two.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Number two, which is, which one do you mean number",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oh, this actually does anyone want to start and share their opinion again allowed",,,,
Luis,120.4,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"I'm glad you haven't figured out, Luis. So can you remind the class of your answer.",,,,
Luis,120.4,I yeah okay so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,so Chris. Can you share your answer again.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Alright, Luis. Did you find where",,,,
Teacher,120.4,You found oxygen tank.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, do you have a question.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Are you finished?,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"No, I'm ready to answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"10 more seconds 987654321. All right, let's actually start with Farrah, and we'll move our way around the circle to Luis, so, what word did you circle Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"So with that, I circled was ice, ice deposits",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Let me go to Oliver. What did you circle.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, so I circled the part that says very small kind of for the same reason, but like the fact that you have to use a microscope to look at the ice deposits",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So let's see what Chris has to say.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, what did you put",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"I circled the same thing, small machine",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"and, Luis, what did you put",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"But what did Chris and Jazmin tell us about how the microscope, got up there.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,It said that,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Anybody want to--,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Seems to be where we're at. Jazmin, do you have something to share.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Okay, yes. I think that the most important word is discover because like finding it",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So looking over your responses. And it seems like everyone has read the article. Yes. You had a question.,,,,
Luis,120.4,Excuse me.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, so what did we decide was the most important word in that question. Somebody raise your hand.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So that we can answer. Yes, ma'am.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,Okay. I think the most important word is equipment.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"But let's hold that yes, you have your hand raised. What do you think the most important word is",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Yeah okay, I'm Chris. I think the most important word is water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,When you have that tool identified or that piece of equipment. Go ahead and raise your hand.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Teacher.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"And then Farrah, can you explain your answer.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yeah, sure. Okay, like in the third paragraph, they were talking about finding the water and it said the water they found is microscopic",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Luis Let's uh, let's start with you for a second. So for equipment from the passage. The moon is a desert.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,What equipment or do you see mentioned in there.,,,,
Luis,120.4,And I see,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Jimmy. Do you want to repeat that for me what your response was to the question.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yeah, I was this, I said yes.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Exactly. Very good. So what equipment did they use to discover the water,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Well,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,What was that,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"I said, equipment and discover.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah. What was your answer.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"OK, so my answer was basically no like I don't think it's very convincing.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, Jazmin, do you have anything to add to what Chris said",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Well I guess,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, um, Luis, what are you thinking",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Well, I guess, like I'm kind of thinking",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Mm hmm. And then what did we use to go back and find our answer.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oliver, you said that you circled the same as Farrah. So can you tell me what equipment, the scientists use to discover the water on the moon?",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, yeah. So it looks like um Farrah and I circled at the beginning, we circled the microscope, because that seemed like the equipment that was probably used to see the water that was so small, but um",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Alright, Jazmin, I see your hand. What did you find?",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Basically, I wasn't quite sure about microscopic. I think I know what it means, but I wasn't totally sure",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yes. Does anyone else. Yes, Chris, what did you find?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Anybody have any ideas?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"start with Farrah, would you mind reading your answer to me.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris. Would you remind me what you were saying, just so we can catch back up.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Yeah, so I was just say, um, let's see, I think it was talking about like the before lunch. I was talking about like craters. Well, so my answer was that the craters were full of water on the moon, and that that was like you know what I mean, like, they found all this water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,What else did you guys decide with your group discussion.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Go ahead.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Who would you like to go?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Um Jazmin. Go ahead.,,,,
,120.4,"Okay, so basically what what we were discussing, we didn't agree, but I thought that the answer was the small machine which when I was looking was saying that, was a, was the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oliver, you have a question.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Oh yeah, um, well actually, at the end, maybe I'm thinking a little differently um like, I was thinking, so you'll have to use all the things to discover the water, is that the idea?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver would you like to share first,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, yeah. So I was thinking when you said like more detailed like that we need to use like",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Let's hear from your partner Jazmin and see what she has to say.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Okay, so basically, the first thing I was gonna say is that I'm still a little bit confused. And I think what I'm confused about is how Like how we can make sure that our answers are complete.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Farrah, would you like to go first.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yeah, I don't think it's actually, I guess, I guess I don't really have a question, because I understand why it's the lunar orbiter because it's not",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, would you like to add anything to that.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yeah, we have to go to lunch.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,What was your answer to that question.,,,,
Luis,120.4,So I said that scientists use a lot of it like oxygen tanks and stuff like that.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, and you did answer the question was, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. What was your answer to that question.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"I said on water can be split into two parts, oxygen and hydrogen.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"And Jazmin, what was, what was your answer to that question.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"I said yes. And I said, the astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated. You can't survive without water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris what was your answer?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver what was your answer to that question.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"So my answer was, I said no because it's not ready yet.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oh, they can ask you this.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, I",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Alright guys, so where we left off. We were talking about and the periodic element table and Mr. Luis in your response to this second question. Do you remember what you said about the water",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, let me see. But I did want you to. I just want to remind you, my dad is an astronaut.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Miss Jazmin, what do you think",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Well, I was thinking about the water can use. You can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, miss some Vana. Have you figured out",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay. So real quick, back to the last question, Farrah, can you repeat the answer in that you came up with for this?",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Oh yeah, okay. So basically, you just need a scientific a tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,You guys want to share your responses to this article.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Sure, we can do that. Um, okay, so I said, you need a microscope to do the water",,,,
Teacher,120.4,You guys have any ideas from the reading that you want to share with the class.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"First, let's hear, Oliver. What's your response.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Yeah, I kind of had a similar thought that basically no it's not ready yet. You know what I mean like that we can't, we can't just use the water because it's all ice, you know.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Great Chris.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Um, yeah. So I would say, water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it in the ships.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,What was your answer.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"I mean, this is me, Farrah. I looked at over and I don't understand why why the microscope is raw",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oh, whoa, whoa, what did you respond to that question.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Well, I said that, um, you know, that they could use. Um, maybe that's uh",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, do you want to share with us what you thought is water a valuable resource?",,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah okay, So um I said",,,,
Teacher,120.4,yeah so that's one reason does anybody have any other reason that they thought that water was a valuable resource?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Never know! Jazmin, what do you think okay so um.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Hmm okay let's see, I wrote, Yes, I astronauts should stay and drink the water and stay hydrated oh like how you said you can't survive without water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,What did you say water is a valuable resource or not.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"I said no, not for a long time.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Can I hear some of your responses.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Do you want to hear mine?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Does anyone else, want to share they wrote.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Oh well, I don't understand why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Good i'm Chris Luis didn't want to do you want to share? Yes, Chris.",,,,
Chris,120.4,yeah I was just I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Luis do you read something different or similar?,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Actually, I wrote about the oxygen tanks too. Because that equipment and the question as our equipment, and so I said, you know the equipment that scientists use on them owner oxygen tank.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,awesome um okay so Luis I know you are unsure about being in this group can we look at your response.,,,,
Luis,120.4,yeah yeah sure.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Do you want to share.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,You want me to share now.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Can someone raise their hand and let me know what it was?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oliver, do you have anything to say?",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Well, I mean, I, I circled the same thing as Farrah. Um, so I guess I mean I don't know why I'm in this group. If we're right then what's wrong with with my answer?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay everyone, do you mind giving me your answers again, really quickly, before I give you some feedback.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, yeah, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"But we're going to figure that out right now, so can you. Could you remind me what your answer was",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Yeah, okay. I said, ah, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, how about you?",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Good job. All right, Chris, your turn.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Uh huh. Okay. So I said, or something different. I said umm",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Alright, so we're Chris, do your best. Let's look through the text again and we're going to come back to you. Okay, Farrah. What was your answer?",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Oh, my answer was that um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Um. Oliver. How about you?,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, okay, well i i had the same answer as Farrah cuz I I said the thing, the same thing about how they went um, so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely um cuz",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Well, there's multiple pieces of equipment. So they're all right. Um, what was your original answer? Let's build off of that.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, so I said that they found a lot of water in the craters.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What was your answer, can you remind me.",,,,
Chris,120.4,yeah I said that scientists found crators full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Alright, so Jazmin now it's your turn, can you remind me what your answer was for the question number one.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,yeah so I said.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"i'm sorry, when you say for hydrogen again, while.",,,,
Luis,120.4,The story says that they can put them together oxygen and hydrogen can be used as rocket fuel.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So we asked the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, what are all of your answers.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Who wants to share first.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,anybody else like to share what they would change their answer to.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris, what would you change your answer to.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"So I would change my answer what I would say, as I would say, like um, so I said initially scientists craters on the water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Luis What would you change your answer to?,,,,
Luis,120.4,"And um so actually for me, I was just gonna say that I think that i've got everything all figured out now, so I was gonna say I think about good can I go back to my desk.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Would anybody else like to share what they would change their answers?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oliver and Jazmin you can go, because you already went yesterday.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,um okay so basically what I said okay so initially what I had said was that I circled the same as Farrah Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah do you want to share what you attend your interview.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yes, so it seems like for me okay so originally I said that.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Jazmin do you want to say some things I know you add years before.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,So actually fortunately it's time for us to.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Why don't we go around the table so Farrah, you can start and then it will be Oliveron Chris and so on.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Sounds good. Okay, you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really close.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Can I ask a quick question?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris, what about you.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"um I think for me like what I noticed is like kind of similar to like I I bring a lot of my like background knowledge, because I know all about this stuff.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver What about you?,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"i'm so actually I understood a lot, so I was thinking about it, and then, when you were talking to Luis and Jasper, it really made me think that like.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Can anybody tell me?,,,,
Chris,120.4,Valuable means like has a lot of value?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,So I want Oliver to go first. And I want him to remind me of what his answer was.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Ok so what key words did anyone circle?,,,,
Farrah,120.4,I circled equipment and water.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,So I want some people to share what equipment they circled.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oliver, you can go first.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,I circled ah microscope.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Go ahead.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,Ice is frozen water.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, perfect which student wants to speak out first about what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,I said NASA centers small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"yeah So what did you said, your answer was what can you tell me again.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"yeah My answer is, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So i'm going to ask you to look at i'm going to have you told me your answer,",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Okay, you want me to say it now.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Could you tell me what you think.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, maybe?",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"And oh gosh, I don't even remember what the question was now.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,What was your answer. Can you tell me again.,,,,
Chris,120.4,Here that on the phone craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Um, can you repeat your answer for me.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yeah, I said that NASA found a small machine. And that's the same thing. Farrah just said.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So, does anybody want to explain their answer to the question initially?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"awesome okay um so looking at the responses um does anyone, and just raise your hand, but does anyone would anyone like to share their response with us.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"um not to put you on the spot Chris, but since we are a small group I think you just be comfortable maybe you sharing with us.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So with that in mind, who can tell me what are the two tools that we need",,,,
Oliver,120.4,That,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Which is what? Like-,,,,
Chris,120.4,I went to NASA.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Jazmin do you want to share your sentence with me really quick oh Chris yes Chris well.,,,,
Chris,120.4,I went to NASA so.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oh perfect what's your answer okay.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,um scientists used a tool called a microscope to look really closely and a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,What did you have.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"The same ones, I guess, everybody else because also the only two that I saw.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Does anyone know the answer to that question?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Does anyone else want to share their answers?,,,,
Chris,120.4,Well yeah I had a completely different answer than them. I said let me look at what I wrote down.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, let me hear it.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Oh, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Perfect who wants to share their answer first.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What was your answer, let me hear it one more time.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,yeah yeah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,So who wants to share their answer first?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Can you read me your answer one more time, please.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"yeah what I said was that, yes, it's it is.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Can you read me your answer please.,,,,
Luis,120.4,yeah so I said that scientists use a lot of equip like oxygen tanks and stuff like that.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So, Farrah. I'm going to call on you first. So what did you say when you answer this question.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Excuse me, teacher, I shouldn't be. Ms. Great. I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Farrah, can you tell me what you responded to that question",,,,
Farrah,120.4,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So now Jazmin, can you tell me what you answered what your answer was.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,yeah I said I said to small machine and I don't understand why my answers wrong.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So today Chris, could you tell me what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon, could you read your answer to me?",,,,
Chris,120.4,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Alright, so now Oliver, can you tell me what you answered what you said.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,yeah um well I took all the same thing.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"OK OK so Farrah, can you tell me what you said.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,So can you guys tell me a little bit about what do you think this equipment looks like? Luis?,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Well, I was just going to say, I kind of know all about space already. So I don't even think I should be in this group.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,That sounds great. Do you want to start?,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Yeah, so my answer to the question was that scientists use lots of equipment, like oxygen tanks and stuff like that.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Okay awesome um who would like to share what they found would anyone like to go first.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"let's just go left to right Farrah, what do you have for the first question, what are some examples of equipment found on the moon.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay, so I highlighted two things first I highlighted the microscope because I thought that was something that you really mean like would be important.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yeah. All right. So Luis since you said you know a lot about space, can you answer the question for us what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon from our water on the moon text. Do you remember what the equipment they used",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Well, yeah. So I was I was saying that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and and stuff like that.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yes, Chris. Do you have something to add?",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Yeah. I mean, it's about science, though. It's not about the story. But I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oliver, do you have anything to add? I haven't heard from you.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Well, I was looking at my answer when you told us to all look for where we found everything, but I circled the last sentence, just like Farrah. So I was just trying to think if what you told Farrah, I guess, is the same for me.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"That is right. Now, Chris, would you like to share your answer?",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Yeah, sure, I said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,awesome Luis what's your question.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"um so I was just gonna say that this has been really fun and I think that i've got it all figured out, so I.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,what's going on Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,I was just when.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, Dave do you have a question.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"um yeah, I guess, for me, I, so I read that they weren't going to put a moon base on the moon, maybe by 2024 That was the goal, and I was wondering like.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Luis Do you have anything to add, I see your hands raised.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Could anyone answer that.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Oh, that's a really, that's an interesting question. Um,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yeah, Chris. Go ahead. You can respond",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Um, well, I was gonna say that. I went to NASA. So like with my dad. And so, I noticed that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks, but it sounds like you're telling us that the lunar orbiter went without any astronaut. Is that right.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, is there anything that you want to add",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Farrah, do you have anything you want to add",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Oh, I think I was going to answer the question before, but actually we have to",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"we're gonna actually go to the passage right now, so I have Farrah could you tell us your answer to the question to question one again.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,there's another tool that they used. Did anyone mentioned that tool in their answer would like to share?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What anyone else, want to share their answer? Oliver, I know you had a similar answer to what Farrah said, is there anything else you'd like to add to the group answer?",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"um so yeah I thought that Farrah was right and I, I found that evidence myself what I noticed was that",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Coule you repeat your question to your classmates your answer your responses to your classmates?,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"yeah, so basically my response was that water is valuble because astronauts keep drinking water,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft. Who mentioned this in their response, could you raise your hand?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"before heading out into the solar system. So let's review why water is valuable and I know that Oliver had a response as well, what was your response, before we go over the reasons why water is valuable.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Well, so I actually have my opinion is that water um yeah I can see that it's valuable like it's not that it's not valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"I can read it to you yeah sure, could you read it to me real quick sure.",,,,
Chris,120.4,I wrote scientist on craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Good answer do you want to read it to everyone i'm ago.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Is a kind of the process of what you did to correct your answer Okay, so why don't we start with Luis. Luis so, can you tell me the difference between your original answer and your second answer.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"um yeah OK, so my initial answer, I was saying that scientists like use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that which I knew, because I already knew that and then um.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Great, so why don't you tell me a little bit about your answers.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay, so, basically, I said that initially you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely and then I said.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,What do you have any other suggestions.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"yeah, so why don't you tell me a little bit about your two answers.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, so what I said was initially that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, and then I realized that.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"hi so Luis, can you tell me a little bit about your answer.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Oh yeah Okay, so I can, I can tell you that, basically, I was saying that yeah that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Good i'm glad okay i'm Farrah why don't you tell me a little bit about your answer now.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay, so I said that no i'm like it like would not be valuable not like, for a long time.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, and Oliver can we talk about your answer a little bit tell me what you answered.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"yeah so I said i'm like Farrah I said no, because it's not ready yet.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,um Jazmin let's talk about your answer a little bit.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"and see what I said was asking I say yes, that is valuable because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah. Can you remind me of your answer.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Sorry to interrupt. I'm sorry but I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Alright so Farrah. Can you remind me of your answer.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yeah, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"so Chris. Can you tell me what your response was,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, Oliver. Can you tell me",,,,
Oliver,120.4,Same thing.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,so Farrah can you remind me of your answer yes Luis.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah let's start with you.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay yeah so I said no, not for a long time.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"yeah Okay, thank you Luis why don't we look at your response.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Excuse me teacher i'm still confused.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, Luis would you like your turn now.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Yes, I, like my turn, thank you.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Would you yeah yeah exactly right all right let's look at your response now Chris.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Well, why don't we take a look at your answers really quick and see what we see what you wrote. Alright, sounds like a plan?",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Yeah, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Alright, so um Farrah do you want to share the answer that you got for the first question yeah sure okay.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,I said um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay um how about Oliver, what did what was your answer.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,I have that same answer us Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,yeah you yep do you want to share with you wrote.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"i'm sorry teacher, but I was just looking at the clock and it's time for the next group so we'll have to see you later.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,I think we're just so we're just going to pick up right where we left off last time we met so Jazmin why don't you go ahead and share the answer that you had.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oh Okay, thank you alright Jazmin why don't you go ahead and read your answer.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Okay, so I said NASA send a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,awesome um Luis What about you do you want to share your answer?,,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah Okay, so I said i'm scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So can you give me something different?,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Well, I mean, it was this-- I think that's the right answer though because it talked about the equipment and what it does, and it's looking at the water. So I don't think there is another answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So could you tell me a piece of equipment that they used?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, so, Farrah. Do you want to share first",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"How about you, Oliver.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"How about you, Chris. All right.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Um, yeah. So I said that scientists found craters that were just full of water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"How about you, Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, all right so Farrah i'm gonna start with you so in remind me of what your answer was.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"yeah sure I said i'm that you'd need, let me look, I think I say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay okay all right, and how about you remind me of your answer now.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Okay, well, I I had a circle, the same thing I Farrah because mine came from the third paragraph to it says um.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So remind me of your answer one more time.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,I said NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,They do do that so Chris was that your answer for the.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Alright Luis so I don't you remind me of what your answer was for the first question.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Okay, but I also just want to say.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, can you just remind me of your answer.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah Okay, so I said i'm.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,What did you say Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,The lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,No problem. So let's all share what we had for our responses.Who would like to start?,,,,
Farrah,120.4,I'll start. So I said that  In terms of what it meant it. Scientists us to discover water.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"so, can you guys raise your hand to someone to answer my question. what color is my sweater?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,You can raise your hand and i'll pick you so you can share the word you chose.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,i'm Farrah what where did your group choose as the most important word in the question.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,So we had a disagreement.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris Jazmin or Luis do you guys have an answer to share Chris.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so we changed our answers a little bit to include the word lunar orbiter into our answer. What else can we add into our answer to make make it a little bit more credible?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,The word starts with an e.,,,,
Chris,120.4,Um. Equipment?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Does everybody agree.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,So Can somebody look and try to see where a good evidence would be to add into our answer.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What evidence, do you think you put in your answer Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay, well, I put the Lunar orbiter and then I added that to what I said about the microscope So then, I have two names of equipment and I have looking really closely, which is from the story and evidence is just from the story right.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"And we, where does the water hide on the moon?",,,,
Chris,120.4,In the craters.  That one was in my answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,So what can we what answer can we come up with to use the evidence?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,To support what we are trying to say.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, well, I okay So what about mine, because I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,A lunar orbiter. Farrah kind of touched on that in her answer.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,i'm still kind of confused.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,When you confused on Jazmin?,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,I guess I don't know which evidence i'm supposed to be looking for.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Does anybody want to volunteer their answer?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Does anybody else want to volunteer their answer?,,,,
Farrah,120.4,I could.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What was your answer, Jazmin?",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,That NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"OK, that's awesome, Luis. Do you have any thoughts about the water on the moon? Do you think that it's a valuable? Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon is valuable, based off of our article?",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Water is valuable. We've got to drink it all the time. So yeah, based on the article, I would say, yeah, water on the moon is valuable.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What's your idea, Chris?",,,,
Chris,120.4,It was something about how it was talking about water can be broken down into two parts.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,who would like to discuss their answer first,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So let's go back to Farrah. And I think, Oliver. You also had a similar answer to Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Luis How are you doing, because I know you mentioned the oxygen tanks as well.",,,,
Luis,120.4,I yeah that is what I had also said yes.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Do you want to talk about your answer. Luis,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, yeah, yeah, I can talk about my answer. Um, so my answer is I'm water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Anybody else want to talk discuss their answer yes, Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Um, so I was thinking you could use water to grow things and we can have a moon garden a garden on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"That the water could be used for Farrah, do you have anything else to add,",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Well, so this is so fun and interesting but we have to go to lunch. I'm really sorry, but thank you so much for letting all of us express our ideas on this question.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"S Chris. Thank you so much. You're very brave to go first. It's always a bit of a challenge, so well done.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Well, I think the main point of part one is that it tells us that scientists actually found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Right. Who's ready to share. Thank you,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Well, I don't, I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oliver, go ahead.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Oh, I'm so sorry but I just looked at the clock and actually it's time for us to go to lunch.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"I'm going to start with Chris right there in the middle. Can you tell me what your answer to the question was, remind me, please.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Yeah, okay. So I said, water is heavy. So it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Luis can you tell me what your answer was to the question.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Yep, sure can. Okay, water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Does anyone want to volunteer to go ahead and go first.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"yeah Okay, I can go.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Luis I know you had eaten and sorry I know you had some expertise, would you like to share.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So I think we have one more person we haven't heard from yet, would you like to go ahead.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay yeah Well, my answer is scientists found careers, full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Okay anyone find any interesting clues.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Do you have something for me. Yeah.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Okay, it's on scientists to use a microscope to discover water on the moon, and I found my answer in paragraph three",,,,
Teacher,120.4,You ready okay let me hear it.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Scientists used a small machine to discover the water and I found the answer in paragraph two,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, who can raise their hand to tell us what the main ideas.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris. What's the main idea of this text.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, so I think the main idea is that they have found water on the moon, and they used to think. There wasn't any but now they know because they found it.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,And I will go it's Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Okay, so, um, Chris, I agree, partly like yes, it's definitely about water on the moon, but I think it's also about how there's not a lot of water on the moon. Like, it's only on these really small little bits.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so, um, you can answer the question now.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,Can I go first.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yeah, please go ahead",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah please go ahead.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Share with us your answer.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Yeah, well,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yeah, go ahead Farrah",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"So I thought the key word. The most important word was equipment, because that Word tells you that you're looking for, like, a tool for your answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yeah, you can share",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Um, so I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yes, Chris. Go ahead.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"On. So I said, water because my answer was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon, and the whole story is about water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Yes Jazmin what is your question?,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yeah, actually, maybe I can help Chris, because my word that I picked was discover",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Yes. Luis. Go ahead.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, it said it was a lunar orbiter NASA sent a small machine called lunar orbit are to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay. All right. Let's talk in our group about no question, Chris, can you read your answer that you gave",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, yeah. So my answer to the question was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Teacher : Awesome. So, Farrah. What did you say, What was your response for The understanding what equipment did scientists use",,,,
Farrah,120.4,I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Teacher : Oliver, Jazmin, Luis, Farrah. Did you hear anything.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Well, um, this is Oliver I heard you say Lunar Orbiter. I'm like, I know you said that. Sorry to answer because you can told Jazmin, but I still don't really understand why it's not the microscope from Part three, because that's also equipment and they also needed to find the water",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Alright so Chris, what were the key words that you underlined from the sentence.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Well, I said that the key word was water because my answer was about the craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver would you like to share?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Luis what did you think?,,,,
Luis,120.4,Well I also said equipment.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, what did you circle?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, well, you do that Deb Farrah and Luis Do you have a question.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Oh no, no question. I'm going to read too.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What about you, Oliver, and Luis Do you feel like you need to reread or what did you talk about in small group.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Well, we agree that the microscope was a piece of equipment and they probably used it to to look at the water and then the only other piece of equipment we saw was the small machine.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So we were talking about the different equipment and Chris and Jazmin were rereading the article so Chris and Jazmin, would you like to share with the group any of the equipment that you circled from the reading.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. Definitely. So, well, we found the same to that Oliver and Farrah. I guess because there's the small machine on the",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah. What was it looking for,,,,
Farrah,120.4,The small pieces of ice.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Yeah Oliver give it a try.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Okay. Well, I think the key word as equipment, because you have to know that you're looking to find a tool to answer the question.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So who wants. Why don't we start with Farrah. Could you tell me what you actually wrote for your answer.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Oh yeah, sure. Okay, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So how about Jazmin, could you actually read what you wrote?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yeah, Jazmin. Go ahead.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Well, I think that it's",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Right. Go ahead, Oliver. Did you have a question.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"I do have a question. Yes. So I'm not sure I agree with Jazmin, because what I'm thinking is, if the water is so small that you can't even see it without a microscope, then how can you find it if you can't even see it.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Does anyone want to give me just let me know what they answered, or what they think if they even think that they want to change their answer what equipment was used",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yeah, Jazmin, what do you think",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,So I said that NASA send a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Does someone want to give it a try, and try to combine those two answers. Maybe Oliver?",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Oh yeah okay well yeah cuz my, my first answer was the same as some animals about the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Alright, Chris. So what would you say in your answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah. Can your group. Tell me what you What your reflection was,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yeah, yeah. We'd love to go first. Okay, so, um, well, we had the same answer. Originally, so our, our",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"How about a Chris or Luis. And I haven't heard from you. Yet, what were your takeaways.",,,,
Chris,120.4,Can I go?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Look like we're ready. Who would like to share Your takeaways.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Oh, we can go first.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,What about Chris.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Oh, okay. Well, I want to know if my new answers. Okay, so my new answer is the water, the scientists found on the moon was microscopic",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What, what did you say for your answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah. What did you say,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, let's see, Jazmin, you have your hand up.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Here. Yeah. So I listened to the facts and I still don't understand why my answer is wrong. I said that NASA scientists small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver. What would you like to add to that.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"I get that they sent the lunar orbiter, but I cricled the same answer. as Farrah, and, and I still don't. I don't see why it's not the miscroscope, because it sounds like they used that too, right?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Exactly. I'm Chris, do you have anything to add.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Yeah, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"With that being said, let's talk about all of your answers that you guys gave to the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon. Who wants to volunteer to go first, was what they said for their answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Who else would like to share that what they said as their answer.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"I'm ready, I'm ready to go.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Who else wants to share their answer and what they got.,,,,
Chris,120.4,Can I go. Can I go,,,,
Teacher,120.4,And then Luis What did you say for your answer.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Ah, I said you need a scientist need oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Great. And so what is the answer that you've come up with now.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Would anyone like to share,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yeah, I can share",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, Jazmin. Go ahead.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"So, you told me to look again and see if I can add more details to my answer. And I found more details in part two, which is where my answer came from.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Okay. Um, so I thought the microscope. IT WAS THE RIGHT ANSWER. AND NOW. Well, now I know about the lunar orbiter is the right answer, but I don't really know how I would have known that I'm without without Jazmin telling us",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver. Did you find anything.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Okay, so, um, I think, a part that you're talking about is the part in part two, where it says about looking for the ice deposits, because I guess the water was not just water. It was ice and they found it as ice ice form.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Luis.,,,,
Luis,120.4,Yeah okay um my answer did not really change like i guess i get i get how you say it has to be in the story and yeah okay they use a lunar orbiter. Maybe they use a microscope. Who knows but if there were astronauts there have to be oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,What is it Luis,,,,
Luis,120.4,If ice. It was ice.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Let's start with your answer. So what did what was Oliver's answer.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay Oliver said, Well, we actually had the same answer, which was that it was the microscope that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Yeah Luis What's up,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Yeah, I just have something to say. And that's, I just wanted to remind you, and also you do that. My dad is actually an astronaut.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So, Oliver and Farrah. What did you find when you were reading",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Okay, well, um, before we have said down microscope, and I think we still bought kind of think about microscope might be right. But there was one other tool. And that was the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,And Farrah. Were you getting the same things as Oliver since you're working together.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yeah, we found those two pieces of equipment. Yeah. The Lunar Orbiter and the microscope, and it also talked about a cup like measuring the water",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Luis Do you have a question.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Go ahead, Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Okay, so you said, I have to look for more detail. And so I found about this machine, a few things. So first it said that it was called the Lunar Orbiter and then also it said it looked for the ice deposits and the craters.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So, Oliver agrees Farrah agrees. Good. Luis Can you share what you were gonna share earlier, thank you for waiting.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Well, I was just saying I shouldn't be in this group because I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris you have a question?,,,,
Chris,120.4,Or you went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Luis What was your answer to that question.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, I said I'm that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Jazmin what was your answer to that question.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris. What was your answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver. How is your answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"When you work with your partner, you're going to share your answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oliver, can you read to me what your answer was to number one.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Yeah. Um, so my answer is the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Well, let me just review, do you want to share something",,,,
Chris,120.4,Sure.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay Luis I'll work with you, independently, Luis, what was your answer to the question.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Okay, it was, um, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver have a different tool that he found,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Yeah, the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Teacher:Farrah. Can you tell me what you what you thought.,,,,
Luis,120.4,I'm. Excuse me. Excuse me. This is Luis.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What do you think, Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay, so I'm",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Since we first answered the question. So anyone have any new ideas, Chris. What do you think",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, so",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"When you have an example, raise your hand. Luis What's your example.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"My example as water can be broken down into two parts, oxygen and hydrogen.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Would anyone like to share out the answer as to what they believe. Scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,I know that you all have burning answer an average if I to go over with you are Luis Do you have a question.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Yeah, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So who would like to share what their response was to that question, Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Okay, my answer is that NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Would anybody else like to raise your hand and share what they answered for that question.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Yes. Is that what you answer for the question Chris,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Oh no, but we were just talking about the equipment. And so that made me think of that. And I thought, probably, they would have to use those things too. Don't you think",,,,
Teacher,120.4,but who would like to raise their hand and answer is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Well, I have a few things to say. So my first answer was, it was",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah. If you have something to say.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"No, I was done.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,so tell us about why water is why what evidence is there that water could be so valuable to have on the moon.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah so you can take water, and you can split it into two parts, you can make oxygen and hydrogen.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,so let's see Chris and Jazmin who would like to share next.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Well I can share.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, Chris you're up next.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"So I heard, I read on Facebook by uncle posts a lot of stuff.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,so Farrah and Oliver did you find or did you revise your answers yet.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Oh yeah we did ciz we took a look and say we,,,,
Teacher,120.4,And while you do that i'm going to have another student share their response does another student want to share their their answer Farrah yes.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay, so um I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"and so Chris did that help you answer the question, what was your answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so, can you tell me.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so Luis, can you tell me like what your answers.",,,,
Luis,120.4,yeah okay so um I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"To tell me about this reading and tell me what equipment, the day scientists used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,Yes. Can I go,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Is your answer is enough. Okay, Jazmin?",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Farrah. I know you said equipment, and I think that's important. But actually, I think the more important word is actually discover",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So let's talk about it. I'm, I have a question for you. Leave the one to say something about it.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,You want to say something about the text Luis?,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Yeah, I do. I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Thank you. Hi, Jazmin. You have a question for me.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yes, I said that necessity. A small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah and Oliver were you able to find out more information  through working together?,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"On actually I just looked up clock and we have to build a lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for having us look back at the text and look for really detailed answers on that was really helpful. So thank you so much.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, what did you say was the most important part of the question.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"I still have to say I just want to remind you, my dad is actually an astronaut.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Thank you. Jazmin, what were you gonna say was the most important part of the question.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Okay, so I think the most important part of the question is evidence",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yes, Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Well, I think you can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yes, Chris.",,,,
Chris,120.4,Water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Yes. Luis,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Yeah, so I know you could drink it. Well, it doesn't sound like there's a lot",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oliver, you have a question.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Yeah, so, um, we have to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you because you listened to each one of our answers and you asked every one of us.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So does anyone. Does anyone want to volunteer in a response to that question. I have any ideas about that.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Luis. Go ahead.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Um, yeah. So we were reading water on the moon. And I just want to remind you, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So let's jump back into it I. Does anyone remember what the prompt was last week.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oliver, go ahead and love that smile. Go ahead.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Um, yeah, it's all what equipment did scientists to was to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So let me. I'm gonna have someone volunteer. If you want to tell me your answer from before.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So that I have some of your answers. And I just want to have you guys Reiterate to me what your original answer was,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,There are many volunteers. Farrah yes go ahead.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Um, I said that she would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Can I have another volunteer to tell me what they said.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Jazmin go ahead.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Okay, well, I said that, yes, I sent a small machine and don't understand why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Teacher:. And I think that's something that we could all use. So I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you guys a question again. So Chris go ahead.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Oh, yeah. So I went to NASA. And I know that scientists use all sorts of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Exactly yep exactly yeah what did what would you have said Chris What was your answer the second time you.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Well, so well, my first answer was scientists found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oh, did you have a second answer, maybe or any thoughts new thoughts that came to mind after reading through it.",,,,
Chris,120.4,yeah well actually I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So, Svaannah have you found anything yet about an any other equipment?",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Yeah, yeah, in the in the second paragraph, it talks about how NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,yeah so Luis did you learn anything from this from this reading.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Well, I mean OK, so now, I know that there's like.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Great um well Luis doing that Jazmin, can I ask you about your answer.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Yes.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"And we're circling evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question. So Farrah, can you tell me what you thought on what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"So my my answer was that I thought that they use, they would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so I believe that they use the microscope to find the water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,um so Farrah I want to start with you um can you read your initial answer for me,,,,
Farrah,120.4,Oh yeah absolutely so what I said in the first one was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,just to ask um Farrah What was your revised answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yes, it's the Lunar orbiter so um can you restate your answer, for me, now that we have that information can you restate your answer to that initial question?",,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah Okay, so I would say that my revised answer is a scientist found ice using a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Great, great job Luis. Um Farrah I wanted to touch base with you um again, I asked for your initial response um but can you please tell me what your revised response was?",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Oh yeah sure, so my revised response was that students use the orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oliver I want to or Chris, you had your hand raised also can, can you tell me what you were thinking?",,,,
Chris,120.4,"yeah absolutely so, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you and I in particular, I really wanted to thank you for working with us.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,yeah go ahead Oliver.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,um the question is asking what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah Would you mind sharing with us what your response was.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"yeah Okay, I said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,can anyone maybe chime in on that,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Jazmin please.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,got it got it and Chris Would you mind sharing with us your response to question one.,,,,
Chris,120.4,yeah I said i'm scientists found craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver go ahead.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,um yeah so um they said it's microscopic um they also said it's ice.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Does anyone want to volunteer and answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Okay well oh yeah go ahead Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,And it's it's asking us to find an equipment.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Excellent, Farrah, could you read us what your response was to question number one, please.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"so um, I would like, for Chris, please, if you would mind sharing what your response was that would be great.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Luis.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah okay Chris, so the water on the moon it's not like water like a pool or like an ocean um it's like this tiny, tiny little tiny little pieces of water tiny little pieces of ice you can't even see them.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"And Chris, you had the hands on I guess you can tell me why you think.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, so my answer is um scientists found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Well, who else Jazmin you had a answer also when.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,I said that NASA send a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver you had a question you had answer also,,,,
Oliver,120.4,um yeah so I circled the same thing as some fan oh okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So so Luis what are you what's what you have in your mind, then.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris what what was your answer?,,,,
Chris,120.4,um I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Your answer what was your answer.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,I said NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,What Was your right answer was? Oliver,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,but the teacher didn't say that you had the right answer Oliver,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So you when we went through and circled the evidence from the text about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon, what did you say again Luis.",,,,
Luis,120.4,um well I sat at scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,And I wanted to check in and see what evidence you guys circled maybe you guys could give me the number that you circled in our readings for where you found that answer.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Um, I found mine in paragraph one.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"yeah So if I was going to if we were going to completely start over, and I was going to ask you guys what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon, what would you guys tell me.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris, what about you.",,,,
Chris,120.4,um you know I went to NASA so I know that scientists use of lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Can you tell me what your answer is too is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah so I said water can be split up into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"And then, when you guys are done, I would love for Chris, I want you to tell us a little bit about what you found in the fourth paragraph that made you think that water having water on the moon can be beneficial or valuable and then",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Jazmin I would love for you to tell us why what you found in the fifth paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"amazing all right, well, I was just wondering if anyone wanted to share just their thoughts on the text, what did you think about it were you interested in learning about water on the moon, is it something that maybe isn't your favorite subject any any thoughts um let's see Chris.",,,,
Chris,120.4,yeah she.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, dad i'm so sorry for keeping you waiting What would you like to share.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,What okay um I just had a quick question because all that stuff about the plume of dust and everything that's really cool but I don't know how I want to know that i'm.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"OK, so now that giving you that time would anyone like to share what words to use circle that you think are the best words that will help you answer the question.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, let's go Chris, what did you circle.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, so um well I circled equipment, because well, so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits so I picked equipment.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, let's move our last one Farrah What did you circle.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay, well, I circled two is that okay.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Your guys's responses for what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon i'm wondering if anyone could share out one of the tools that they remember reading about.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, what was the second one Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin What about you, did anything stick out as interesting to you?",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,um.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Well Jazmin what were you thinking.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,um.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So Jazmin, what answer did you write for this question?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oliver, do you have an idea?",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Okay yeah I was saying, I was thinking well it says it'll land at the south Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris What was your thinking for this question.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"I was, I actually found my information in the first paragraph, because that's where they were talking more about the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so what else, what did what did you say, for how the scientists found the water.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Oh, I said that they found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Ok well, Luis let's talk about your response, we'll jump over to Farrah and then we'll all get a second to revise our responses. so Luis What did you share for the equipment scientists use?",,,,
Chris,120.4,"um I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, you know I went to NASA so I know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver what are you thinking?,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Yeah sorry to interrupt you teacher, but I was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go so well i'll see you later okay.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,alright Farrah what were you thinking.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,um yeah so um.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Ok. Um. Farrah I just asked you to share out your response to the question of what equipment,,,,
Teacher,120.4,let's take a minute right now and try to revise our answers and then Luis let's start with you for sharing out a revised answer to this question.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Okay um Okay, so I think i'll say.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Of course, thank you Luis I appreciate that, and thank you for being so patient and Chris, where you done speaking or did you want to add more about what the Lunar orbiter does.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Well, I wanted to add on it's really about the Lunar orbiter but it's that on I went to NASA actually so I know that the scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Luis could you share your answer now, thank you so much for waiting so patiently.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Oh yeah well, I was just gonna say that about the Lunar orbiter so What it does is it looks for where the ice a little a little small it looks for where it is on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, so can I have someone raised their hand and share what answer that they got for number one",,,,
Teacher,120.4,can I have somebody else share their answer please.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"and you said that you change your answer, could you tell me your first answer then what you changed it to.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"so Chris, could you repeat your answer for us, please.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"mm hmm so my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon, but when I talked to Jazmin and Luis they were both talking about equipment so on i'm not really sure what the right equipment is.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,Okay yeah I circled you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so who would like to share their response first.",,,,
Chris,120.4,I can go first.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,What was your answer.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,That NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, and Farrah how about you, what was your answer?",,,,
Farrah,120.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"And Oliver how about you, what was your answer?",,,,
Chris,120.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,So what was your answer the question.,,,,
Chris,120.4,um that they found craters for water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, what did you figure out.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Okay, I heard you telling Jazmin and Chris and Farrah that they can add some of their background knowledge into their answer so i'm just going to do that, and so I think I can go back to my desk.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, all right, how did everyone else do with their answers, could you",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"And Oliver, how's your answer doing?",,,,
Oliver,120.4,um well i've just been kind of listening to what everybody else was saying um so I haven't changed mine yet um.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Yeah So could you tell me your answer again?,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"um yeah well I had circled the same thing as Farrah. I circled that last sentence in paragraph three, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah and Oliver how's it going as far as you're looking through the text.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay, so um i'm beginning to think that maybe instead of the microscope it's it's the machine i'm that Jazmin was talking about.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah  go for it,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Does anybody have any thoughts?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,yeah Farrah what would you like to add?,,,,
Farrah,120.4,Well i'm i'm a little confused because I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope in order to look really closely for my answer and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"you're welcome welcome Oliver we haven't heard from you, I see um.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Well, I was talking about the grand Canyon I was talking about remember.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"If you were to go to the moon Jazmin What would you do to try to water there, what would you do Jazmin?",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"I would use the small machine that NASA sent, and I would use it to get the samples that you need to find the water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris  what do you have to add?,,,,
Chris,120.4,I went to NASA and I know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay okay put your hand down. So Chris, what are you thinking?",,,,
Chris,120.4,Well i'm i'm thinking that so actually I went to NASA so I know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Who would like to share one of theirs, the response that they gave to that question.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oliver, What did you come up with.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"um well, so I said the same thing as Farrah about the microscope um because that's a scientific tool and they talked about in the story.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris, what do you think.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Well, so um so in there, it talks about that lunar orbiter but I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, Oliver, what do you think.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"yeah well um it's sort of sounding like lunar orbiter's the right answer um, but I still think there's evidence about the microscope um how can you find something if it's too small to see. don't you need a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, do you have the answer in front of you would you like to share with the whole class.",,,,
Luis,120.4,yeah so I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"awesome are why don't we move on to Chris Chris, would you like to read out loud your answer.",,,,
Chris,120.4,And you know okay so up I said scientists found critters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Right is really excellent tool all right um Oliveron thank def, thank you for waiting patiently, would you like to go with your answer, do you mind sharing your answer with the whole class.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,yeah I can share so.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So yes, would you like to share with your response to begin with.",,,,
Luis,120.4,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,All right does anybody would like to share the answer.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"And I think the answer is all, let me see what.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What was your answer, can you share that with us again.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,yeah I said masses into small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"about the previous texts and science class okay all right Farrah I have your response up here would you like to share out loud with the whole class, so we can go ahead, yes Luis?",,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah excuse me i'm Okay, I think I got this all figured out so i'm all good.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,awesome Farrah go ahead.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,Okay yeah um so my answer was that all you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so can you share, will you share with the group what your answer was.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yes, I said NASA send a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So who thinks they can answer that question now what evidence, would you circle.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver what are you going to circle.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Okay Well, this is so, I changed my answer so first I said the microscope like Farrah did, but now now, I think, maybe they were just saying that it's really small so.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Thanks Luis. Can you guys quickly share what it is that you were just answering about the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon just in a couple of words. Luis can we start with you.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah Okay, so I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris, what was your answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Ah, OK so Farrah are you going to share the same answer as Oliver, the microscope too.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"um yeah well, so my answer is, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Great, Jazmin, what about you.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"I would say that's a kind of medium because well my answer was the small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong, why am I in this group.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris do you know wat a crater is?,,,,
Chris,120.4,yeah so.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,So we're still talking about the Lunar orbiter does anybody have any thoughts that we didn't bring up before Luis.,,,,
Luis,120.4,um yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver did you did you what did you think about the Lunar orbiter because it's just so amazing like Could you imagine the way that this this orbiter is able to reach a part of the moon that we've never been able to reach before I thought that was so interesting.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"yeah it's really, really interesting um and one thing I thought was really kind of especially interesting about it was that on when they found the water, it was so small.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So, can you tell us a little bit about some of the equipment that was mentioned in the article.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Oh, in the article I was going to tell you more equipment that I know.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Uhm what equipment did you find in the texts that scientists used to discover the water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Does anybody have any ideas Chris yeah.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"yeah, so I think is when something sort of goes around something else.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Does anybody else have any ideas about what other types of equipment scientists use the NASA scientists use?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah do you want to tell me about your answer.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"I said that all scientists know I said, you need a scientific to hold a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,did anybody find another piece of equipment or that they said in their answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"yeah I definitely want to go soon, so what pieces of equipment, did you talk about in your answer Chris.",,,,
Chris,120.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,What did you say in your your response.,,,,
Chris,120.4,I said waters heavy so it's good they don't have to carry the ships anymore.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So what do you think, do you think based on what you've heard and read in the text you think finding one on the moon can be valuable.",,,,
Chris,120.4,yeah definitely um yeah because then they wouldn't have to carry it all the way up there in the space shuttle they could just get it on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,that's a good idea why don't you do that then.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay, because I said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oh. Chris, did you discuss your observation with Jazmin do you guys have an answer?",,,,
Chris,120.4,"yeah okay so uhm Jazmin pointed out that it says, actually, that the ice deposits are really small so, even though I was picturing like these big lakes and pools of water, it sounds like it's not really like that.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"so I think that's can take us back to what's Farrah and Oliver have been looking at.Farrah and Oliver, have found the answer to this entire question by now? would you like to share your answer?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,would like to go and answer them okay so.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"um so I I told Chris, but um you hey we need the microscope total closely because there's not a lot of water it's a very little part of it, because it says microscopic.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, I think I see it, would you like to share what you see.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,Okay it's called a lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposits.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"so, why now, why do you think that we are not ready for this exploration for a long time.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"On Okay, I mean it's kind of like what Oliver said Oh, but cuz at the end, it says like they need to come up with a plan, and it will take a lot of time and a lot of money, do you think you will be a good investment so i'm like Well, no, because it'll take a long time.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, why do you go ahead.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Was I was just asking.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What did you like the most, Chris?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, what do you think?",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"If there's water on the moon,",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Luis I know you do right?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris, you too?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Farrah, what do you think?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Okay somebody else tell me what word they thought was really important in that question to kind of give us a clue to what the answer should be.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Jazmin, what do you think.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"I was thinking, maybe discover.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"And how about you Oliver? What word do you think is real important in that question, to give us that clue to find the right answer?",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"um well, I thought equipment also um like Farrah did um but I guess another important word would probably be water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What do you think, Luis?",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Hmm what equipment, ok we had equipment, did scientists use to discover water well I guess really the only good word left is moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So Chris, what do you think.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, well, I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"go ahead Farrah, what were you going to say?",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So Oliver, you told me you circled the same answer as Farrah. Can you remind me which part you and Farrah circled again?",,,,
Oliver,120.4,Um yeah we both circled the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"And Chris, what did you just tell me about the -what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon?",,,,
Chris,120.4,"yeah well just listening to what you said to Luis I see how all the cool stuff at NASA it helps the scientists, but it does it do the finding of the water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, my stopwatch is actually broken, but since you're all looking at me i'm gonna assume you're out then Chris, what did you find when you went back to the text to figure out what this small machine was anf, and how they actually maybe got that water.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, so well I looked through the word machine.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,so who wants to start us off by how they answered this question.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,um okay i'll go cuz I don't understand why my answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Okay well sure let's let's um once you give me your answer and we'll talk about it.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Okay, I said NASA send a small machine and I think that's right.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"And water on the moon okay i'm go back, could you go back to your first answer for me um when you answer that question, what was the what how did you first answer it.",,,,
Luis,120.4,I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen thing.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oh yeah Jazmin What was your answer again.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,um NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Excellent Chris why don't you start us off, how would you answer that question now that we've had a chance to explore it a little bit.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, well, I said um scientists found craters for water on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay Oliver and Farrah sorry, you know both both kind of speaking same time Oliver let's doyou first and then Farrah",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Okay um so I wasn't sure, but I heard Chris and Luis saying that Jazmin's  answer was right, so I I said um NASA sent the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Right exactly can anybody else tell us anything they read in the article.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Yes, I can.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,i'm moving on her from Farrah What did you read in the article anything new that we haven't talked about just yet.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"yeah so um I read that Okay, the water is microscopic and so for the equipment, I said I said, you need a microscope to look at it really closely, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Okay What was your answer.,,,,
Luis,120.4,um. My answer was Scientists use lots of equipment Like oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"or anyone else can jump in if you'd like, are there any other tools that tou can think about that they might have used outside of their oxygen tanks to help them discover the water? yes, Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Well yeah and this goes back to the question that you asked me before Luis interrupted um so well I picked the microscope because they said, the water um it's really small and you can't discover something if it's too small to see you need a microscope",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris um So what did you learn about those craters on the moon.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Oh well, the scientists, the found these craters full of water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"yeah, Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,um well investigate makes me think of like a detective searching for clues.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Chris?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"ym yeah I can try and put this all together. Okay, so the astronauts went to the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"and can you go ahead and remind me, what did you respond.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"Oh yeah well, I said that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Jazmin What did you share what did you find as your response to that question.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Okay, I said NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris, would you be able to share with us, which you were able to locate.",,,,
Chris,120.4,yeah oh so I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver can you share what you how you respond to that question.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,and so Luis go ahead and share it you're about to share.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"um yeah well, I think I thought that's all figured out now so i'm good.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"awesome Thank you. Hey Luis, how's your search going.",,,,
Luis,120.4,i'm i'm okay at work really well but um I just I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch right now.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, great job so based on the question that Jazmin just read out to us what should our answer be.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So I know that we spent some time looking at the questions right looking at the sentences and the text Can somebody give me a sentence that stuck out to them that they think answers this question.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,And I got this.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"and I want us to move on to the second question, and before we do that can Somebody tell me a strategy that we can use well answering the second question.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Did anybody get it does anybody know what they sent up in space to figure it out to analyze all this, Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yes, and I said NASA sent a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, great so would you like to share with the with the group what you found what text you found to answer that question, that would be super helpful.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,i'm trying to think what you said about make connections on right.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,Is it like on like inference our teacher does say talk about inferences.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"yeah Farrah let's start with you, thank you for volunteering.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,yeah so I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope.. to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,yeah Jazmin why don't you go ahead and share your answer.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Okay, so I said, my answer was NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,yeah Chris go ahead and share with us.,,,,
Chris,120.4,So investigate is when you sort of... Look around for something in particular are sort of like a detective might investigate a certain place for like clues and stuff.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oliver I haven't heard from you, yet do you think we've found all of the equipment that they used in this text.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"yeah well I think we did, but i'm still a little confused about why it's my not the microscope like why that isn't exactly the right answer. Because I was sort of thinking, how can you discover something if you can't even see it yeah I mean, I guess, I guess they use that small machine, but I still think that microscope is the right answer.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, who wants to share what word they circled in the prompt.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yes, well i'm glad you're able to connect that personal experience what did you end up revising your response to the initial prompt, though.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Oh, oh okay well at first I didn't say any equipment what it sounds like that's really important because it's a it's a key word like you said so now, I said on my answer is the small machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so who can tell me, one of the words that they thought of that means the same thing as equipment anyone have a word that they wrote down.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, savana what what where did you write down.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay, so I thought, a word that meant the same thing as equipment with the tool.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,anyone else let's have one more person share what's another word for equipment.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Why don't we get three words that you all wrote down that have to do with discover so to someone want to volunteer word that they wrote down that has the same thing as discover Oliver why don't we hear from you first.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,What did you discover for that I said find.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,one more word that someone wrote down for discover anyone have another idea here.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Really, what did what was your response to this question, can you just remind me.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah um well, I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,let's debrief do you think that your response has both of those parts.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay, mine has the equipment, but not the second part.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,How about you Luis.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"i'm Okay, I guess, I have that first part two, because I got equipment, but I don't have anything about the water in the Mon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, what do you think was the most important question or the most important word that the question was asking you.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"I said equipment, I said equipment to.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Farrah What did you say.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Alright, so let's move on um let's see uh Jazmin can you read what your answer was please.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Okay, so I said yes, I said NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"let's move on, so um Chris, could you please read your response out loud.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, so I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So could anyone tell me how do you think about this question so what's your answer to this?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"and Oliver, could you please tell us?",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Yeah, yeah well so um it sounds like the right answer is actually the Lunar orbiter and.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Great okay so tell me about the word phrase that you just circled.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"okay so on Oliver, could you please read for me your answer.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,yeah okay well I forgot the same answer as Farrah that is um microscope.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,let's go ahead.,,,,
Chris,120.4,Okay well um so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, would anyone like to share What were they circled.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,that's awesome do you want to tell me your revised answer.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,yeah um.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Alright, would anyone like to share what they wrote for those questions Chris go ahead.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Well, first, I was wondering, is my new answer okay.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So we're thinking about what tools or what equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon. So Farrah can you remind me what your answer was? what did what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon?,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay, so I said that you'd need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oh OK, and then Oliver can you tell me what you said, as your as your answer?",,,,
Oliver,120.4,yeah I circled the same as Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oh, could you Luis could you tell me what piece of equipment you circled in Part two",,,,
Luis,120.4,"um well, I mean you said that okay equipment as like a lots of things, because they said equipment not piece of equipment, so I figured you could say everything like lunar orbiter microscope oxygen tanks yep.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Luis What did you circle.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Well, paragraph two that's where they talk about the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,yeah go ahead Jazmin,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,I say.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"it says Farrah, can you tell me what piece of equipment you circled in number three",,,,
Farrah,120.4,Okay microscope um because they say the water is microscopic and they can't see it without the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Yes, would anyone like to volunteer to go first.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,yeah yeah I want to go is that okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Would anyone else, like to share, you can raise your hand if you're ready.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"um yeah well, I would just say i'm actually I circled the same as Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,anyone else have responses yeah Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"yeah so now i'm a little confused because I guess well, I thought it was the microscope but it sounds like maybe Jazmin is correct, so is she right or am I right.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,would anyone like to volunteer to go first and start us off by reading your answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Who would like to go next.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,i'll go.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"What anyone else, like to share.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,I don't understand why my answers wrong.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,hmm yeah could you read your answer for me.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,yeah I said NASA send a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"But i'm excited to hear how you connect all that knowledge to what we learned about in the article about the equipment for finding water, do you want to tell me a little bit about your response to the question based on the article, we read.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah sure Okay, I said what did I see I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Would anyone else, like to share well Luis goes back to read the article.",,,,
Chris,120.4,I can share my oh answer was scientists phone craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"While Chris goes back to read what anyone else, like to share their responses.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,um yeah I don't understand why why my answers wrong.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,hmm could you read your answer for me.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,yeah I said scientists sent a small machine out NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"would anyone else, like to share.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Alright, what anyone else, like okay okay good yeah would anyone else, like to share.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Before the issue, the response I was just thinking about um the other kinds of equipment that we're talking about with even because I went to NASA into I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,does anyone with anyone like to go first Luis firsthand what's up.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"wow excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, because I already corrected my answer so i'm good.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,awesome so you corrected your answer so we'll take you as a volunteer to go first.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, why don't you share with us.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Okay um so he said, NASA.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,and Chris or Farrah do either one of you want to share sure Chris.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,what are you working on in this response.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Oh yeah the water scientists found on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter was microscopic.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,yeah let's see do you want to add something.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,I know teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's actually time for us to go i'm so off to see you later okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,So finally miss Farrah. Do you want to share your revised answer,,,,
Farrah,120.4,still kind of confused.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,So what's your revised answered.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Okay um so Oh, let me see.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Do you remember your first answer.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,um yeah my first one was about that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely because I got that one right out of the story.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,that's tell me tell me okay.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver could you repeat your answer as well.,,,,
Oliver,120.4,"um yeah well, I suppose same thing as Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Well Would you mind sharing with us how you would maybe answer this question like?,,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah, so I think she should just add the name I think she should just say um.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Thank you for sharing that with us that's a very interesting fact I didn't know that does anyone else, want to try working through their response or strengthening it.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Great now let's give Oliver the opportunity to answer my question.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Okay, go ahead Oliver.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Excellent thanks Farrah and Jazmin Would you mind sharing, can you share what you circled.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"And so I circled small machine, my answer is NASA Center small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Now Chris, can you tell us what you you wrote as your response.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"yeah Okay, well, I said that scientists found creators, full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,anybody can raise their hand or shout out.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Luis.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"Rocket ships, rocket ships",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oh well, then, would you like to start, do you have an answer to this question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,120.4,Oh yeah well um I said that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,So do you want to share answer with the group and we can work through it together.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"Yes, well, I said NASA send a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"um So do you want to go first, so how did you answer this question.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,yeah all right okay perfect so um let's let's go around does someone want to tell me what words or phrases they circled when looking at this question yeah Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Can someone else tell me what other words they circled or phrases that they circled in this question.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Do you want to share it with the group yeah okay.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,Ya so I said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"yeah I agree, I do think that they use the microscope to look closely at the water but Jazmin do you want to share your answer.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,yeah okay um.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oh yeah do you want to share with the group.,,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah yeah. Okay, so we're talking about equipment and discover and water and so Farrah was like well you know how come it's not mine because microscope is equipment and I think that Farrah's right.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So do you want to offer your answer what was your different answer.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So using these all of this information, what are we thinking.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Okay yeah I got it so what the teacher saying Farrah it's a microscope was used to look at the water, but the Lunar orbiter it was used to look for the water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,What did everyone else write.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"I said before, a conversation I said NASA send a small machine, but now I see that.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,you said they found a Small machine and now you think what was the second half of your sentence?,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay cool, I think we are all really excited to hear what you have to say so i'm going to go ahead and start with Farrah I know you have your paper in front of you Farrah Would you mind reading aloud what answer you gave to that question, we had.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,yeah okay so um I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Oh wow okay perfect so you guys are all familiar with that scientific tool, thank you for your answer Farrah let's see who would like to read the response next do we have any volunteers yeah perfect go ahead Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,120.4,"OK, so my answer is NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"alright, so we have had Farrah and Jazmin share their answers, so far, and we have Luis Chris and they've left with either one of you like to volunteer to go next.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Okay perfect sounds good let's see we have Chris and Luis left would either of you like to go okay go for it Chris.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay well so two things one for my answer, I said well that scientists be found creators, full of water on the moon, and so actually I went to NASA and I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"But thank you so much for your answer Chris, and I think it is now time to move on to Luis are you ready to share your answer Luis.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah I am so my answer, I said well if kind of like Kara since actually cuz I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, perfect so Chris, can you go ahead and read your response to me.",,,,
Chris,120.4,yeah okay um so I wrote down that all.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,let's hear what you guys have been talking about.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"All right, i'll be right here all right Oliver and Farrah, how is it going what have you guys been discussing.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,"Well, I was talking about.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Thank you Jazmin alright Chris, can you go ahead and read your response to me Chris.",,,,
Chris,120.4,yeah sure I said um scientists found craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,What do you think Farrah do you want to share a little bit about your thoughts.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"um well I guess yeah that's that's similar for me, because I was looking for equipment and I saw the microscope and arm and I was looking for kind of the water on the moon part of it, and I saw that in um in that paragraph three.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"and so you all had answers that i'd like to draw on, and I think I want to start with Jazmin Jazmin, can you tell us what you said for this first question.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"yeah and then I also noticed that Oliver and Farrah you guys took a similar approach when you are looking at the text because I, I think you guys used a different word, maybe Farrah do you mind telling us what you mentioned, for your answer.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,yeah I said microscope was the equipment.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Oliver you said the same thing?,,,,
Oliver,120.4,yeah I think the microscope was the equipment they used.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Luis I want to come back to you hun because you mentioned um some other things that you know that scientists might use on the moon, do you want to tell us about what you think scientists may use on the moon.",,,,
Luis,120.4,yeah yeah so an important piece of equipment as an oxygen tank like they need those so they can breathe.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris, you mentioned what the scientists were doing on the moon, do you want to tell us what the scientists were doing on the moon.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"um so they're looking for water right, and then they find water deep in these craters so like they found a whole bunch of craters with a whole lot of water.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,yeah Jazmin do you have something to add.,,,,
Jazmin,120.4,But I guess I don't understand why my answers wrong.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Well, first of all, can you tell us what you said, what can we do with that water.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"I said that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris, what do you think.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Well, so I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Do you want to start.,,,,
Farrah,120.4,"yeah yeah Okay, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"yeah yes Chris, you want to add to that.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"yeah so um well Actually, I know that scientists they actually use a lot of equipment on like oxygen tanks and masks and suits because I went to NASA so I know they use a lot of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,what about you Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,awesome we're gonna come back together Luis What did you learn from Jazmin's response.,,,,
Luis,120.4,um so.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"awesome okay Chris, what did you talk about.",,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, well, I was just telling Farrah and of how I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Thank you Chris What was your answer again.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"Okay, so I said that scientists found craters, full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"So, you said that you circle, the same answer so vana what answer was that.",,,,
Oliver,120.4,"Oh yeah we both said for the appointment, we both said i'm microscope.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Luis What was your answer.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Farrah, can you tell me what your answer was again.",,,,
Farrah,120.4,yeah so basically what I said was that you need a scientific to have a microscope to look really close.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,What was your answer again.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, do you want to go first.",,,,
Luis,120.4,"yeah absolutely Okay, so my answer is that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,And then Chris Do you remember what you said.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"yeah I said that scientists found creators, full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Okay, so how about somebody else in your group tell me what you got to the final answer either Chris and Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Okay cool and Chris go ahead.,,,,
Chris,120.4,"So I thought, when we were discussing up like I think Jazmin as a really good theory and I I could see how it could be the Lunar orbiter I can I can see that now.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Great all right now let's get some more quiet hands, what did we get what do we have an answer on that first question.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,Is there anyone who thinks they might have found the tool mentioned in paragraph two.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,Does anyone have an answer that they want to share with their group when they've improved.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Does someone to have a response, they might want to share with the group.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,So i'm just interested in hearing hearing from you what your answers were.,,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Chris, can you tell me what your response was.",,,,
Teacher,120.4,"Farrah you've been waiting so patiently, can you go first, what do you need.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"that's that's totally correct I think we'd all agree with you that if you had a microscope you would use it to look at water really closely, although let's think about what happens before that point right.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Add on, you know how exactly those equipment were used to discover water on the moon right, so I think each of you had like a piece of it, and then we just had it to we just needed to add on to that, so we have the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So like a couple people just circle microscope and that's a great example, but there are multiple tools like you just pointed out  that come from these things.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yes, we do need a microscope to look really closely at things. But that is not what the scientist used to find the water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"It is semi right. You could have went into more detail, you put that it was a small machine, and it was a small machine, but, um, it is called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Jazmin,130.1,"Um. Okay, so the answer is, is it's called a lunar orbiter?",,,,
Teacher,130.1,And that is very close and,,,,
Teacher,130.1,Not exactly. But I like your thinking of what keeps the water together that is in our passage.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So you were partially correct that you do need a microscope to see this. However, that's not, they didn't just send a microscope up to the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Well, you are you are partially correct, but the the equipment that they sent was this machine called the Lunar Orbiter and that was able to go across the ground, the surface, the moon surface to check for these deposits.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Then once they figured out that there was,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Deposits, a very small water then they had to get the microscope out to make sure what they thought was there. Okay, the microscope actually gave them the evidence.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,That there was water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,Then the tool they used was the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Not completely wrong. It was, they will did send a small machine, but it really doesn't",,,,
Teacher,130.1,So that's why I said you're you're on the right track.,,,,
Jazmin,130.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, so you said that you'd meet a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and you are right, the microscope is a piece of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yeah, sure. Okay. And Luis you also were right that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks,",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Valuable okay yes I agree that valuable is a key word. That's right. But we're going to look for one more thing. One more. Other key word in the question so Farrah. Could you tell me what word another word that you circled,,,,
Farrah,130.1,"Oh, yeah. So, okay, I should actually, I had a question, because I circled.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Chris scientists found craters full of water on the moon. That is absolutely true. And that's absolutely something that was in that reading,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, so there's two pieces of equipment that we're actually looking at here.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,One is kind of a version of the other slits. Think about it.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So wouldn't you say that they needed to use not one, but two pieces of equipment to actually figure out that there was water on the moon.",,,,
Chris,130.1,"You know, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits. Um, so yeah, it makes sense that they would need other equipment too.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"And and that is an equipment, a microscope is a piece of scientific equipment, you are correct.",,,,
Farrah,130.1,They're looking for the water,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yeah, and that's right, they do use that.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Awesome. Okay. So yeah, they would have used that equipment they would have to use oxygen if they're on the moon. If it were astronauts on the moon. Right.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Well enough. That's right. The astronauts use all that you are correct in that,",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Well, okay. So those are pieces of equipment that they use it in. So, that is correct.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, I read all of your answers and I think that you have very good points. Everyone, but you have to think a little bit more about what is the question about, for example, the question is, what, let me see the question again.",,,,
Oliver,130.1,I can read the question if you want me to,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Jazmin says that NASA sent a small machine. And that was right too. But that was not enough for that question. They sent a small machine, but you have to look for a better word to answer that question.",,,,
Jazmin,130.1,A better word?,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, so you said that NASA send a small machine and that is right, but. Um, I think that may be you can read a little bit.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Um, I think that we can do even better. I think that's a great response, but I think we can make it an amazing response. So with our question we're asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,That's right. Luis So what we can do is you can kind of learn from Jazmin here and she can learn off of you were looking for a middle ground between the both of you. You both pretty much gave me a good answer you gave me,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Oliver. That was really, really good. We're almost exactly where we want to be. We can still make a couple of improvements on the end there. But we're so close now. So thank you for your",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"That's right, see you had one piece of the puzzle, right, you had the, that's what I was talking to you earlier as you mentioned, the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"And you know what, that's correct statement that you wrote down, you do need a Microsoft Skype look at something that's really small, but we when we go back and look at the question.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,So let's look at your answer. Use scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they do.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,That's very knowledgeable of you point that out.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,And that's a very critical tool when we're learning together as a group that's awesome dead,,,,
Chris,130.1,"So basically what I looked at what's up. Well, actually, I guess I didn't really circle. Well, no, I looked at the craters and they said how the craters had water.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, you are on you are on track to find the right answer. And we're going to dig deeper.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So Farrah. You are right, they, they set that small machine. And that's what they were using to discover where the water was",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, Farrah and Oliver, you did think that the scientists used a microscope to look very, very closely.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Your answer is not wrong, but it's not totally right, either.",,,,
Farrah,130.1,OK.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"I would say that you are almost there. Jazmin, I would say, because the question is very specific meaning what a piece of equipment. You said a small machine.",,,,
,130.1,"Yes, you do need a microscope to look at things that are really small.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yes, they use all all of those are examples of equipment and just for this particular moment.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, and they do use that and NASA and that is a good point. But I have a question.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,It's sort of right. They did send the machine.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,You did. You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they do use equipment like oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,Really close. I'm sure you do.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,Oh that is obviously a true statement. Right. You can't live without water.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Well microscope is definitely equipment, but it's not used in space, like, because we",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, so we're getting there.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, great. Okay, so let's reread over the text because Chris and Jazmin are really close to the answer.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Well, yeah, that's what they all have to use just to be there.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"That's true, but they couldn't get the crystals to investigate without the small machine, right?",,,,
Farrah,130.1,"Oh, so okay so they had to use this small machine to like find it in the first place.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,and that is one of the tools that was used to do some observation and some research.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So maybe there's something that you can go back to that text and see if you could find some more. So if we put Jazmin's information with your information and we work together, we can come up with a full and more complete answer.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, so that's that's part of an up. The answer is that we could have more space having more room. And let's see.",,,,
Oliver,130.1,I agree what Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, good. So that's a good start on your answer.",,,,
Luis,130.1,"Um, you know, I think it's pretty convincing because those two things are so important in space and like for space travel , that I think it's convincing that they have, like, you know what they talk about with whay you can do, yeah I think it's convincing.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Luis had a good start on his too,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Well, it's not completely wrong.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, yeah, I understand you were really close.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yeah, they looked at it really close with the microscope. So you weren't exactly wrong, there was just a more specific answer. Um, so yeah, good job.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"That is, that's a very interesting take and it's actually my first read through and answering the question, I thought the same thing.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Because yes, they would use all of that  but",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"No, it's not wrong. Okay. You just need to elaborate a little bit more. Okay.",,,,
Jazmin,130.1,"Okay, gotcha.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Right, you do have to have those things are question is about what the equipment, the scientists use to discover water on the moon. If they're on the moon we know that they're using the oxygen tanks and stuff like that, but what did they need to use to find out about the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,That NASA sent a small machine. It didn't say that it sent the astronauts to space. Does that make sense?,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So, Jazmin. I really like what you said with NASA send a small machine, you are on the right direction. So I want everybody to look at the text.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"In the polar craters. So you've got part of the answer, right?",,,,
Chris,130.1,OK.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,You've got a piece of it.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yeah. Does, does that sound like, I agree that they do use oxygen tanks when they're in space and in the moon, but I think what we're trying to figure out was",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Well, you're right. They do, they do need to use the microscope to look at the water to see it.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So, Jazmin. Your answer is not necessarily wrong, but we can go just a little bit deeper and to make your answer more detailed and just a little bit better than What we have right now. But what you have is a great start.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So you said that NASA sent a small machine. And that is correct. The, you have to send your small machine in order to discover the water,",,,,
Teacher,130.1,That's good. They do need that.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,So the oxygen tank maybe used to breathe.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, so they did find",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Craters water on the moon,",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Your answer is not incredibly wrong. You were headed in the right direction, you would definitely need a microscope, because the water is so",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"And Chris, your answer was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon. They did. In the article did say they found craters with some water on the moon, but they didn't say, full of water.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Mhmm. Good your answer just needed to be a little bit more whole, you had a small piece of the answer.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"And because Luis just responded with, he thinks he knows just about everything about this. And so, Hey Luis I did want to tell you that I really enjoyed reading your answer because you talked about the way water is split and you said to split into two parts, hydrogen, oxygen, that is correct.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, yeah, you're right. So the scientists would have to use an oxygen tank to breathe up in space.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yeah, maybe just pay a little bit more attention to the exact question, but you were correct. And your response to just didn't specifically, answer the question.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"They did. And those astronauts didn't have to oxygen, oxygen tanks like Luis said",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yeah, okay. So looking at your responses. I will say this, Jazmin. You were probably the closest and getting the correct answer with your response.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Chris, you put sounds is filming craters full of water on the moon. Okay, they did find craters with water.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Not necessarily.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"All right, now Jazmin, you put NASA send a small machine and you're almost 100% right",,,,
Jazmin,130.1,But I can do that.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Right. Okay, good. So maybe the microscope isn't what we used to discover it.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Because if you look, if we listen and look at all of your answers Chris, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,That's not entirely true. But they did find water in some of those places.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,We're so we use microscopes to discover things just like you guys said it is a tool that we can use to help us to discover things,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"What tool they this, the scientists used so you can use a microscope.",,,,
All,130.1,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So I think both of you were, you were right in the fact that they do use the scientific tool, but we just need to clarify what that tool.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So you were right in that it was a small machine. So great job. Jazmin,",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"No, no. So it's the moon isn't ready for us to live on yet. So you're absolutely right.",,,,
Oliver,130.1,"Yeah, because then you can like take a bath on your card arm drink it. Like, like what",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Those are all tools that scientists use but just make sure you're reading the question of what specific equipment did they used to discover water on the moon. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay. And that would be that would be correct. There's definitely no oxygen in space,",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Well, it's part. It's part of the answer",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, well let's um so you're you were able to find out that there was that they used a small machine. That is, you know, very good job, you were able to discover sort of what the answer was.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"And Chris, you are you are you know you were correct to you, you're able to find out where they were able to find the water.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Well, they would definitely use that equipment, especially to You know, breathe and sort of operate within the space around the moon and on the moon. So, good job. Yeah, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"I'm not totally sure we could have, like, maybe the entire moon being covered by garden.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,It's not that it was the wrong answer. It could have been a better choice and we're going to get talk about more about that when we're talking just like you brought up discover before when you look at the question. Did you look at discover,,,,
Farrah,130.1,"I'm I'm mostly focused. Well I guess. Yeah, I thought about discover just like Oliver I circled equipment and water.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,So you both are on the right track here in the equipment. They're using a microscope to see the water.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"You might have made an observation about the scientists finding craters, which is very good that you're noticing the craters, and that's where the water is.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,So you you are partially correct so you're right in the sense that NASA did send a small machine,,,,
Jazmin,130.1,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So, you are correct. NASA does use all types of equipment that these boots, they have special, special articles of clothing that they were, but some some things like the the oxygen tanks those on they use for different things. So those things, they might use like when they're exploring space around space missions, but for this, they're talking about a machine that they use to find out about, to find out about the ice deposits",,,,
Chris,130.1,"Okay, that makes sense.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yeah, that's a really good question and the Lunar Orbiter, it wouldn't need the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,So you're partially right when you kind of say that the,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Oh, that's really interesting. I don't know if that's the truth is, I mean, I don't know, like that's the like a truthful, like a",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Let's talk about it, Luis. So your answer is scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and that may be true, but um let's.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So again, that's true. I can tell you read part of the text. That's true. And you're talking about water which is the questions asking you to talk about water.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"All right, but you're definitely on the right.",,,,
Jazmin,130.1,"Okay, so I just have to add more at the name and stuff to it.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Farrah and Oliveron, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water on the moon. And you guys are both on the right track. You guys are really thinking and I like where you're headed.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Absolutely, absolutely. Those are some great observations. Yeah, yes, that absolutely would be equipment that NASA would use. But let's refer back to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,And the scientific tool. So I think you we're on the right track.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Her perfect so Jazmin, you were absolutely on the right track.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Absolutely. They do. You're absolutely right. So a lot of equipment is huge. But what we have to do.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,I think you guys did a great job and you were on the right track.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"They absolutely do. Yes, that is in fact true, but let's focus on what the question is actually asking.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yeah, it said you would if you were to look closely, but how they discovered or how they found out that there was water on there.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Was not with that microscope.,,,,
Chris,130.1,"Okay, okay, um,",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yes. So, you are correct on how scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,And I think that with all of her answers. We're all getting on the right track.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,You are getting to the right answer.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yes, I know what you mean. They use the microscope to look closely at the water.",,,,
Oliver,130.1,"Um, yeah, I could try to see like",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"They did have to use that equipment, while they were in the on the moon and stuff like that.",,,,
Jazmin,130.1,So I was gonna say us with the machine was and I was gonna say the machine is the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Well, that's very good. So the microscope would be part of the answer and lunar orbiter would also be part of the answer right Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,130.1,Okay yeah so so microscope and lunar orbiter?,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay Luis Let's look at your answer. You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen, oxygen tanks. That is very true. You know, when they are in space. They need the oxygen to be able to breathe.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"OK. So the scientists, they do need to use other other equipment so like the oxygen tanks when they go up into space that does help them.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yes, small, but it's actually smaller than small, microscopic is a really big word that means very, very small, small enough to where we can't actually see it without a special tool.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"That's a great question. You're partially right we're not entirely there, you're very right. When we say that you did actually use a microscope to see the water. Absolutely.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"That's absolutely right, but we're only Halfway right it's as if we have, you know, we're, we got a foot in the door. But we got to get the rest of the way in.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So we are halfway,",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"so Farrah and Oliver, yes, you absolutely use a microscope to see to actually see The water.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Sure. I bet they absolutely did have to use some a lot of equipment to get to the moon. I can't imagine just you know stroll up to the moon. So absolutely use a lot of equipment to get up there, so you're not wrong in that regard.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So in essence. Yeah, they should probably do use oxygen tanks when they go to space. They need to breathe. Right.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"And you're right, whenever they go into space, there's a lot of equipment they have to use to get into space, to get to the moon, to land on the moon,",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Absolutely. So your initial answer was correct. They need that water to be able to drink, be able to survive.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Mm hmm. But what Miss Jazmin just read and what's advantages told us. It makes me think that there might not be full of water that we can see. What do you guys think,,,,
Chris,130.1,"I don't know. You know, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks shoots",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yes, they did use oxygen tanks to find water, you know, but that was not exactly the purpose that those oxygen tanks were designed for",,,,
Chris,130.1,"Well, they're they're yeah they're designed so you can you can breathe in space.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Right. So even though it wasn't, even though that they didn't use the oxygen takes to help them in their mission to find those samples.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, so looking at those. Yes, you wouldn't need those for space exploration",,,,
Teacher,130.1,They do us all a lot of tools like that.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Well, it was right. You had one thing, but then we had to find the other tools that scientists used so you had it almost right. We just had a fun one more tool.",,,,
Farrah,130.1,Gotcha.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,So Farrah helped us by saying that there was a matter microscope. But we're still trying to figure out what other tool even. Do you have any audio.,,,,
Farrah,130.1,Teacher. I don't understand why my answers wrong.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"OK, so the microscope. Is it wrong, but we've answered one part of the question. So now we want to. It says, what other what tools. So we found one tool. We want to find the other tool so microscope was correct, but we want to find the other tool also in our story. So even you had said.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,So you have one of the items we they needed to find water on the moon. Let's see if we can find the other item that I needed on the moon in the,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"No, I think you all helped each other come to a big conclusion with a bunch of answers that you all might not have thought of after you read it for the first time. It's nice to talk to other people and get ideas right.",,,,
Oliver,130.1,"yeah well well thanks teacher it's time for us to call, but I wanted to say, thanks for asking asking everybody about our thinking thinking that lead our answer so it it felt good to take some time to explain my idea, so you know I felt valued.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Okay. So your answer wasn't completely wrong. You did mention how NASA did send a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"I would love for you to use the actual your, your answer was not completely wrong.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yeah, so that is a pretty good response because the lunar orbiter is definitely a small machine and it is what they sent to the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,And that is a really awesome response because that is definitely true scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yeah, no, you definitely did and I do like that you used the oxygen tanks as the equipment.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, so that is a really good thing to bring up Oliveron. I appreciate that. So again, your response isn't wrong you just focus on a different section of the text. So you kind of focused on that microscope that was at the very end. Right.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yes, and that's great. That's a great answer. It is a small machine. That's what a microscope is. But the real word that we want to do to find here was in the last paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"But it would, it wouldn't be the thing that found the water.",,,,
Luis,130.1,"Okay, okay. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay well after we asked the question, your answer maybe didn't include what the question was looking for.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So, Jazmin and Luis also found different paragraphs. So there are multiple answers.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,yeah there's multiple pieces of equipment that's why I have you guys answering any.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"The lunar orbiter is another equipment on and then, as their fellow classmate also mentioned in her sentences shall be getting to sort of them said microscopes yeah.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"um so just maybe adding a couple more equipment to the sentence can help it not just bulk it up, but give more understanding to follow reader who is reading a sentence.",,,,
Luis,130.1,"Okay Okay, I can add a couple more names of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,You are correct Farrah but not the answer is exactly looking for.,,,,
Farrah,130.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"That is true, but it's not fully insured",,,,
Teacher,130.1,If you were to go up to the moon you got all that equipment.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"As I said, everyone else, your answer is correct, but it's not exactly the answer I was looking for.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"know your background knowledge is correct, but he's not the answer, or the way that I would have where did the answer.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,because your intro wasn't exactly what we were looking for.,,,,
Luis,130.1,"um so well, I guess, I would change my answer to.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"wide range, you could have multiple answers like how Farrah said they use the machine to get there, well, they couldn't find the water if they didn't get there right, so they use the machine and they use the microscope excuse me, yes Chris.",,,,
Chris,130.1,um I.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Alright, so Farrah as I was saying there's multiple tools that were used to find the water, because we had to get there in order to find the water right so that's a really good answer",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Jazmin, you started off your response really well.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Jazmin, you said that NASA sent a small machine, you're correct that NASA was mentioned, so you got that part of it, but um.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,So your answer it's not okay you're not it's not wrong you're just not fully there okay so.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"um your you, your answer was NASA sent a small machine. So you're right about like a small machine is a piece of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,but there are some more evidence that can be used and also you said how you can't survive without water,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Which is right, we all know, that's a known fact.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,but you didn't answer the question.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,But that it doesn't really explain why water being on the moon would be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,Well it's wrong in a sense that we're going to get to in a moment.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yes, yes that's a good point but we're focusing on the equipment they used to find the water.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Not what they wear.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So you're on the right path. You just need a bit more. So, that makes sense.",,,,
Jazmin,130.1,"Oh, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"so Farrah you have one part and Jazmin had the other part, and we need to add it together.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Farrah you are um you are on the right track, you do mention the microscope",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"yeah, so we are, microscope is part of that.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,yeah we're just getting closer and closer to the answer.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,Our answers are a little bit just -they're in the right direction but they're not exactly meeting expectations.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yeah. So what's your, your response. I'll read it to you. Was NASA send a small machine, which is true, NASA did send a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,So Farrah. You're right. You need a scientific tool called the microscope. That's right. You're right. We also need,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"All right, Farrah you talked about how you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's a great sentence great start",,,,
Farrah,130.1,"yeah I saw in paragraph two, there was a small machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yes. And that is very true. They use those equipments so many times a day in many different things, but it's not actually what they used to discover the water on the moon.",,,,
Chris,130.1,"Okay, yeah, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Answer the question because often chicks are definitely use.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,I just think that I could see a little bit more room for improvement. So,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"You do? Well Luis I bet you have a ton of background knowledge on all of your science equipment, but I think that what this question was asking for doesn't mean necessarily background knowledge, but more for you to look at the evidence from the text.",,,,
Luis,130.1,Oh okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"but for this question it didn't necessarily ask for background knowledge, so what you said was probably would be used potentially to find water on the moon, but",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"For the question to look in the text to use the evidence and I don't think in the text, it talks about oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,So your answer wasn't wrong. I think you had a really great start to a response there. You said that NASA uses a lot of small machines they sent a small machine. That's true. That's correct.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"There both right, because in the text it actually talks about both of those things that were used to discover the water on the moon so.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"They did need that. It was just like I was telling Luis. They use that, as well. Luis was right about that one.",,,,
Oliver,130.1,"Yeah, I just was going to say unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you for working with us. And in particular, I wanted to thank you for especially encouraging us to draw on our background knowledge. That was really cool to be able to talk about the stuff that we already INAUDIBLE]. Thank you for letting us share.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Also, sometimes you might answer and your answer is not wrong, but it's not answering the question that was asked. So we want to also look at the question because sometimes we might find something that's in the text and we might say it, and it's very true, but it has nothing to do with the question that was asked.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yes, yeah, those are other tools that scientists use.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So next time. It's good, it's okay that you chose the same answer that shows me that you guys are highlighting the right answers in the passage",,,,
Teacher,130.1,you're absolutely right that they found water on the moon. That's what our passage told us.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"you're absolutely right, so, while your answer is right that scientists do use oxygen tank sometimes when we were talking about water being found on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,but I don't think it answers this specific question and you understand.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,Exactly there's a possibility that the Lunar that there's a Microscope on the Lunar orbiter that helps us look at the ashes on the moon.,,,,
Oliver,130.1,Oh that's all.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,Part of it.,,,,
Jazmin,130.1,Oh OK.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,Your answer is a great start okay oh.,,,,
Chris,130.1,will be super microscope and Jazmin set the Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yeah, it's really - it is really important.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,And but just because they didn't talk about it in the reading doesn't mean it's not important.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,so you weren't wrong I just think that you could build upon your answer to add more to it to make it even stronger.,,,,
Farrah,130.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So I don't think that your answer so like I was saying that your answers are necessarily wrong if you're sitting in this group, I think your answers in the work that you did could use some improvement.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"and give you the same note that I gave Farrah, although the answer is correct, I think that you could build a deeper meaning and build build upon your answer to Oliverelop it even more and make it even stronger than it already is.",,,,
Oliver,130.1,"Oh OK OK, I guess I mean what I like I read the whole thing and I looked for all the key words and I found I found that sentence with the key words in it.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Your answer is correct, I just when i'm looking at the answers I know that there are more parts that you can add to the answer and to make it a stronger answer doesn't it doesn't mean that it's right or wrong, it just can be stronger.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"I part of what I think with your answer is that although you stated they used a microscope,",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So Chris your answer, although it did come straight from the article and the reading that we had.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Well, there is a couple of answers.",,,,
Jazmin,130.1,"Yeah, I think my answer is right, so I don't know why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"And then Chris, we're going to look at your answer. And it was really great, and I think that you really understood the text, but I'm not sure you quite understood the question that we were asking.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Can you tell me what equipment they use so Farrah and Oliver, you're not completely wrong. A microscope is a piece of equipment. But that's not the full answer.",,,,
Chris,130.1,Ok ok so,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Right, and then Farrah and Deb also let us know that they use a microscope as well once they discovered the water. Do you remember reading that",,,,
Chris,130.1,"Yeah, yeah, I remember reading, paragraph three, but I didn't think that um that that was it. Because, because they said that they were talking about finding the water and I had seen that there was like a lot of water in the craters.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,So that's good. You thought through that. It wasn't a bad answer. It just wasn't correct for that question.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,so Jazmin. Your answer was correct.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Right, so they might have used a lot of different equipment to get to the moon to survive on the moon field a walk around and breathe. You're right.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"They have to get us use the spaceship to get there, but we're talking specifically about to discover the water just like it says from the Reading.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"I want to take a look even closer Farrah. There's another scientific equipment that was used to specifically find the water because the microscopes going to help them maybe look at the water closer or look at other things, maybe just magnified. But they didn't use that to specifically find the water.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So the equipment that we're looking for is the equipment that they use to get into these creators. So wouldn't exactly be a microscope that they use to get into the craters to find it. Jazmin, just something you'd like to add",,,,
Jazmin,130.1,"Um, yes. So, um,",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"What I just the only thing your answer is great because it's right from the text and it's saying why having water up there is important,",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So yes, they did use some equipment to go to the moon, but let's focus in, on the other, bit of what did they use to discover water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"But let's go and see if we can find anything specifically related I think you're all on a really good path, but we're not quite there yet.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Yes. So that is one part of the one part of the answer.,,,,
Farrah,130.1,"Okay, you want to have reread it",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, so there is another tool in there.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Totally. Totally. And I completely understand that. So I love that you answered the question because your question is,,,,
Teacher,130.1,If I had to say. Your question was wrong. Your question was right or your question was spectacular a plus. I'm going to say your question was right.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So that's like, okay, you know, but I want your question your answer to be spectacular.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,The microscope is a tool that they use. But I think there's a more more important piece of equipment that they use.,,,,
Oliver,130.1,"Oh, okay, I need to look for that because I thought a microscope and that's pretty important.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Thank you for that answer Oliver. Yes. So they used a lunar orbiter to discover the water and then they used a microscope in order to be able to see it closer, since it was so small.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Teacher : So you were almost there. Nice job.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,Your answer wasn't totally wasn't completely incorrect.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"But you were missing step number one. So, Jazmin did a great job of explaining. Step number one and you did a great job of explaining. Step number two. But now we need to put it all together.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Right. Oh, I'm sure that's absolutely right. They to go up into space. We need tons of equipment that we don't use down here, right.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So we need to, there's two parts of this answer. So we need to combine what Jazmin set. And her answer with what Farrah said in her answer, there's two parts.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Wow, that's a great start. Chris, so it does",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So you are right, they probably would need a microscope to see anything that's so tiny that you can't see with your naked eye.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"You're right, you wouldn't need the microscope in order to look at the water, but in order to find the water",,,,
Teacher,130.1,So I don't think it would be oxygen tanks. I do think those would be helpful. But I don't think that that is exactly what the scientists used to discover the water,,,,
Teacher,130.1,But if we Investigate a little bit more into the text we might see that there was something that they used before they got to a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,Wow. Yeah. You're exactly right. Water. We do use water to grow things. I'm not sure that that would work on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"I don't think that we could. Um, I don't think that we could grow plants per se but water has other uses on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yeah, I think you're right. I think that it might take scientists, a long time to use that water, but that doesn't mean that it's any less valuable because I think that there are lots of different",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Yes, that is true that the water on the moon is microscopic but as the first with the first step that we did with reviewing the question.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Did they say, did they ask about how do they see the water know they asked what was you to discover water. So yes, that is true that the water is so small you need a microscope. But that's not what's really being asked of us.",,,,
Farrah,130.1,"Yeah. Okay, that makes more sense. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So yes, that equipment can be been gone to the moon. And in the process, but that's not the exact equipment that is used to discover the water, Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,130.1,"I'm, I'm really sorry, but we have to go. I wanted to say before we go, thank you for really helping us understand the question. And the question was about the word discover because that helped us well at least that helped me really understand what the best to answer was",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"That that's not quite really answering the question, like, as we go on.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"We are getting closer to the to the answer they sent a small machine,",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"You say that the microscope is part of the equipment that they used to discovery water. Right. And yes, you're right. There is there is a part of the equipment.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,You're right that oxygen tanks are equipment that sometimes they need to go to go to the moon. But that's when they,,,,
Teacher,130.1,When they need astronauts and they need human beings because human beings human beings needs oxygen over there.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Your answer isn't wrong because It answers the question, but we want to see if there's maybe a better answer. Sometimes there's two answers and one of them's a little bit more specific.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,so actually like that at this moment that's not exactly what the the object that they use is called,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"And Jazmin, you said NASA sense a small machine. Okay, and you know it you're actually correct. But",,,,
Teacher,130.1,That's a great place to start as and thank you.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,even though I did like your answer. I think we can do even better job of answering the question.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,So I think if you included a microscope in your and your answer with the Lunar Orbiter. That would be like the best answer I can ever ask for.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"But it's important that we add that we have both things. And if you want it bad microscope, you can.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,So you are right on track to finding the right answer.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,Well your answer is actually not wrong it's just half of the piece. So yours was more of the smaller picture,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"exactly right, and you know what you were onto something with your microscope response because, by the way, that is a really essential part of analyzing the dirt on the moon, however, the microscope is not how we got the dirt to analyze Chris what's up.",,,,
Chris,130.1,"Oh well, I just wanted to say, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Oh unfortunately I don't think they use a oxygen tank in this time.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,you're right Farrah when you said that they need to find they would need to use a microscope because the water was microscopic they probably did have to use a microscope but that's not necessarily what they were using to find to discover that water right.,,,,
Farrah,130.1,"Okay, so you're saying.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"yeah exactly Okay, so what i'm hearing from you guys now is, we have two different tools that are really important in this",,,,
Teacher,130.1,But what I really want you to focus on right now is what's important for the water right because it's true we we like I said when Luis we need those oxygen tanks right if we need to breathe.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,so I would kind of pair you a little bit more with Jazmin saying you're on the right track.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"But let's find the paragraph and tech the scientists like sentence and where it corresponds, because the answer was not oxygen tanks and I didn't see that, from the paragraph, so your job is to find a paragraph",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So now we have two pieces of equipment right, so we have the Lunar orbiter that Jazmin talked about and her response and the microscopes man that you talked about in your response",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"You talked about the microscope but you didn't talk about the Lunar orbiter and Jazmin you talked about the Lunar orbiter but not the microscope and they used a lot of pieces of equipment, because it takes a lot of things to find water on the moon it's a big discovery.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Of the question we use the equipment that we just talked about the Lunar orbiter and the microscope that Farrah and Oliver and Jazmin talked about to discover the water.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay scientist, or I can see a better one.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"yeah that's part of it, but there's also right now the small machine that we are thinking about right now right?",,,,
Luis,130.1,Right yeah the orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"You know I think you're I think you're right on track is there, if you look at the article, do you have the article with you.",,,,
Jazmin,130.1,ya it's on my tablet,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"I think you're on the right track,",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, so it's possible that it's one of those two pieces of equipment they, thank you for sharing your thinking.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"yeah that's a really great point so for each of you what i'm noticing is that, like we may have spoken about one piece of equipment or maybe the other one.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"let's think about how we could you know circle both the civic equipment and not only that, but also think about what each piece of equipment is doing for us.",,,,
Jazmin,130.1,"um yeah well i'm still not totally sure, because I know me and Farrah we were thinking about the microscope because if the ice is so small, how are you going to find it if you can't even see ya.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"I think that is a great response, but I know that you could go even one step.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay okay well that's it that is good that there's oxygen tanks, but to discover this water they're going to need more than oxygen tanks right probably going to need more.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, great so that's almost there I think if you had circled that whole sentence and they investigated the Lunar orbiter and then, if we put that together with savannas answer.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Okay, so you would also use a microscope. So you're right you're both right that a microscope is a tool that scientists use to help them look closer at things.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Oh, your answer is not wrong. They did send a small machine so that's equipment that they would use.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Alright, so we've got the Lunar orbiter and the microscope as our equipment",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"You know, I think that, in combination with what everyone just said um is the best answer",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Well you're actually both right, so they use that machine called the Lunar orbiter to get to the moon, to investigate and see if there was ice.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So you're both right they use a lunar orbiter to get to the moon and define the water, but then, in order to see the water they use a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"huh yeah so I just want to say you're right NASA did send a small machine, but I want to push you to expand your answer.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,but they they weren't using the microscope to discover the water,,,,
Oliver,130.1,"Okay, I feel like I didn't see the word discovery.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"so, for example, and Luis the answer Luis was talking about using oxygen tanks and it's true that scientists use oxygen tanks, but they did not use oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,is something you would use to find water on the moon.,,,,
Oliver,130.1,um I also read that there could be a base on the moon by.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Your answer is not wrong, actually, but it could be even better.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,So let's think about this. Do you think that maybe they used both of those things to find the water?,,,,
Oliver,130.1,Oh um that could be it.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So I think if we consider what Jazmin said, and we add what Farrah said, we might get a more complete picture of what scientists need to find water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So I think the three that we've identified so far, all together, will will lead us to a great answer and I think, specifically when we look at the text two have those specific pieces of equipment are mentioned explicitly in the text Jazmin do you want to say something.",,,,
Jazmin,130.1,"yeah well that was that was gonna be my question because I mean I picked the small machine and and I understand also microscope is in there, but I don't think I would have thought to put oxygen tanks because it's not really in the story so am I wrong if I don't say that?",,,,
Teacher,130.1,so that the machine necessary is the Lunar orbiter but the scientific tool that they want to use is a microscope So these are two parts of the answer to the question.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,um yeah if you if you include both of them in your answer that would be better.,,,,
Oliver,130.1,"um this is Oliver um I just I just looked at the clock and unfortunately it's it's time for us to go to lunch, right now, but thank you so much for really helping us use evidence from the text and our answers that's going to be really helpful next time.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Actually I think it's partially right,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"mm hmm right so that's partially right it's not a wrong answer but it's a, we could get close, we could get an answer that's more specific right? Okay, so I wouldn't say it's wrong all right, I think you're on the right track for sure. Great job, Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,Right and so that's also getting to part of the answer right.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"So you both had part of the answer you said, to put it together.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"yeah it would be both because you would need the two parts, like the small machine when I began to investigate and I noticed ice deposits, but since they were so small, or to look at them, they needed that needed a microscope look at it more closely.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,You and Oliver,,,,
Farrah,130.1,Oh yeah but I mean also Jazmin because she said something different.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"One second Chris, I will get right back to you, and they use a microscope they use the Lunar orbiter to investigate, so there was a couple of different things, yes, Chris?",,,,
Chris,130.1,yeah well sort of about that I went to NASA so I know that scientists date to really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,"yeah so that's what we're going to find out, right now, so based off of your answer it's just it's not that it's wrong it's just that we have pieces missing from the answer, so we got part of it right, but we want to get the whole thing OK.",,,,
Teacher,130.1,"Right so in the same way, like how I spoke to eastern before it's not necessarily that your answer was completely wrong you guys just all had parts of the answer correct",,,,
Jazmin,130.1,yeah that makes sense.,,,,
Teacher,130.1,I think that might answer another question of how can they see the water.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"awesome awesome okay Farrah and Oliver will pair up and and find the answer to that question, thank you folks.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,You got it Oliver are you are you on board with that.,,,,
Oliver,130.2,um yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense it's like they use one then they use the other.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,now um can I get someone else let's build on samantha's answer can I get someone else to talk about how.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"This microscope would allow us to discover water so then we got the first part of the question right the equipment and now, can we get someone to think about how that connects to the discovering waterpark yes Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,Um yeah.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"awesome a lunar orbiter now let's have someone else add to that answer, so how did that allow scientists to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"does so, what other folks think about this now is that where we want to agree as an answer go ahead Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,130.2,"And so I found my answer and part three, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and that's evidence from the text also.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,About Luis's new answer and compare your new answers while I work with other people.,,,,
Jazmin,130.2,I just need to write something down.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"yeah Farrah and Oliver have you guys were both reading, did you find something similar or something different to Harris and Jazmin and Luis.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Well, I mean that's The only other equipment that they have in the story is the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,So what investigate mean does anybody know. Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,130.2,Yes. So investigates like when you're a detective and you're like getting clues and finding out the truth.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,So did anybody say like a title?,,,,
Teacher,130.2,What do astronauts use it for Jazmin.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,is there convincing evidence that it's a valuable resource Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,130.2,"I'm still kind of, you know, like I i saw the parts that they were saying where they were like,",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Yes, why don't why don't you look back you and Oliver work together since you were you had the same answer.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,And you can talk about it. And I'm going to speak with Chris for a moment. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Chris, could you help us out a little bit more, maybe with finding a different piece of equipment that they might have used.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,And who can tell me what tool that what tools did they use,,,,
Jazmin,130.2,Is it the one that I said that we were just talking about the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Oliver. Did you circle, those two words.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,Yeah I circled the same one.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, well let's look back at our reading passage and Farrah and Oliver since you guys had the same answer of microscope. I want you guys to look back at your reading passage",,,,
Teacher,130.2,and if you finish before I come back to you. Go ahead and work on the next question.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"I wonder, maybe Oliver can help us out because I sent him on this mission to find this answer.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Farrah, would you agree with what Oliver said?",,,,
Farrah,130.2,Yeah yeah cuz that that was the same. I had circle too Oliver. I had circled like you know you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Because they were looking at the water. And that's what the question is asking.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So let's hop back to Chris for a second and see if he was able to find what answered, or the answer to this specific question.",,,,
Chris,130.2,"Okay, so I saw in the first paragraph, where they're talking about the water and the water was found deep within the moon's polar craters. Um, but then I remembered that you told Farrah that finding isn't the same thing as discovering so now I'm not really sure, you know.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Let's see if we can figure it out because Oliver had the same answer is you. So let's talk with Oliver and see if we can work together on that one.,,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Yeah, in paragraph three, the last one, it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay that's a great question. Can anyone tell me what they think would be the answer to Farrahs question, which is, wouldn't it be the microscope that discovered the water or can Jazmin support her answer with evidence that is the Lunar Orbiter. Okay Luis What do you think?",,,,
Luis,130.2,"Um, yeah. So what I was thinking. Just like on the question that you're asking is, like, you use lots of equipment and you don't need a microscope to to detect it. You can detect water using other tools.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, anybody else have a different answer than that.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Jazmin, can you tell me, or maybe how about with with Chris, he's not sure if the moon is wet or dry. Can you maybe help him out and and see if you can give a different answer?",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,I don't know either if the moon is wet or dry.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Okay Luis are you able to help?,,,,
Luis,130.2,"Well. I know, I know a lot about space like and I know a lot about the moon. Like, I know that the astronauts like to go to the moon and",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Perfect, yeah. And how many of you guys picked out equipment or discover",,,,
Chris,130.2,I picked out equipment and discover too.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Luis what did you get,,,,
Luis,130.2,I said equipment discover and water.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Your answer was that scientists found I see using smaller machines. But guys, did we know that ice is water right?q",,,,
Chris,130.2,"Yeah, for, for me, that's why I was I was confused because I was looking for water in the story. And so I didn't see the pardon about paragraph two, about the ice cuz I was looking for the word water.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, perfect. So how about you two kind of work together and go back and look at the text and look specifically for what piece of equipment they used to look for. What were they looking for, again, was it?",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Perfect. Awesome. How about Oliver and Farrah. You guys look at that together. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"How about you and Jazmin kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you guys can help each other, look at the text.",,,,
Luis,130.2,"While I was just gonna say like, I know that like scientists use a lot of, you know, equipment, so like I said oxygen tanks and stuff like that.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,How about you two get together and you reread the passage together and talk about your answer,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So maybe Chris and Jazmin. If you guys want to look over that text again together, starting with paragraph one, two, and three. I think that may help if you reread that okay.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"What do you think, Jazmin, what do you feel about what Luis said?",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Um, well, I think, yeah, like he knows a lot about space and she knows a lot about stuff. So Luis, then you should just like even I mean you should just share with us what you think like your background.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Um, to kind of build off that Oliver. Could you remind me of what the question was, what question are we answering here.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Yeah, sure. Okay. The question was whatequipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Oh, well, I'll see here, Luis, and I appreciate your feedback. But what was the microscope attached to? Help Farrah out.",,,,
Luis,130.2,"Well, I guess I didn't really read that part because I didn't think I had to read the part cuz I already know man",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Well, I mean, won't you go back and reread it and help Savannnah out and Oliver, what do you think? You said you circled the same answer as Farrah. So what was the microscope attached to? How did they find the water in the crater?",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Was um was a microscope attached to, like, to the astronaut?",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Not really, but that's a good guess. Chris, what do you got?",,,,
Chris,130.2,"Um, so I guess like I kind of know a lot about NASA and I know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and like you know like masks and suits and stuff so I don't know. I think that Oliver's guess is pretty good. Like you could look and say, like the microscopes on like like what if you attached it to the hand of the spacesuit?",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, I'm one of these are really good guesses. But we're still missing the point. Jazmin. I'm calling on you. What do you got?",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"What I said was, it, it was a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Awesome. Does anyone else have a different response than Jazmin.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So I would like to know, I would like to hear from Farrah, and why you found what you found. And then why your elbow partner agrees with you.",,,,
Farrah,130.2,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Would anyone else like to build on his response.,,,,
Farrah,130.2,"Oh, yeah. So I think that he's right about equipment. But I don't think that like I don't think he was I don't think he was reading, ma'am. I think she was just saying stuff like that he knew, like I looked at it and I said like I think it's a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Why don't Chris, you talk with Jazmin. I want to see what you two can come up with together.",,,,
Chris,130.2,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay. Jazmin and Chris are Looking back, and they're thinking about Jazmin's answer. I would like for the four of you, and Luis can jump in, try and combine your answers and see what you come up with.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So, Jazmin was looking in paragraph two, they sent a small machine and Farrah and Oliver thought that they needed a microscope. So why don't the for the five of you talk together and combine those answers.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"What do you think about that, Oliver?",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"I mean, I guess it would be fine to grow stuff on the moon, you know, I guess. I mean, I'd probably want to have video games or something up there, I think.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,What did you say Chris. Do you think that equipment might possibly be a small machine as well.,,,,
Chris,130.2,"Um, yeah, I think it could be, um, I just feel like also like for me. Like, I went to NASA. And I know that scientists have to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to go into space.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"That is absolutely correct. Good job. Jazmin. Okay. I want you guys to give me. Can you give me a thumbs up if you agree. A thumbs in the middle. If you're not quite sure, or thumbs down if you disagree with Jazmin. Can you guys do that.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"well, we can't quiet do the thumbs, but we could do raised hands if we agree and then no raise hands if we disagree, is that okay?",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, so the anybody get a different answer for Luis?",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Did anybody get a different answer from Luis. Um, Farrah, what did Oliver. What do you get",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Yeah, I actually did get a different answer because I was still kind of thinking that it was the microscope. I feel like you know, like, that was really the equipment that they use to find the water.",,,,
Farrah,130.2,"Okay, so, you know, initially, that's what I thought, too.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Or anyone else find anything different?,,,,
Teacher,130.2,So who can say what equipment was used to find water on the moon about the scientist.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So, Farrah, can you add to that.",,,,
Speaker,130.2,"Well, yeah. So I was trying to figure out, like, was I guess I don't understand why my, my answer was wrong because like was the microscope. Did they use the microscope, because it seems like they did use the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, so let's speaking of waters heavy. Let's go to Chris's answer okay there's you said water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"and Farrah, you can help out too.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Luis What else is to say that oxygen, hydrogen could be used as",,,,
Luis,130.2,It sounds like that could be used as rocket fuel.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"All right, very good. So I want you to talk to each other in your groups and I'm going to ask Chris Jazmin and Luis to be in one group and Oliver and Farrah,",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"That is a very good question to anyone. Anybody wants to help him out and answer. Why would they put a microscope, along with the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"To look for something, to, what do you, do you have anything else, Luis Jazmin or Chris or Farrah to add to that? Investigate means what, what does that mean to you.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,And let's see if there are any other words in our text that might help maybe someone else in our group. So if you got the right answer. The Lunar Orbiter. What are some words you think we could underline or circle that might help a friend someone sitting next to you.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So what is a word in our texts that might help someone else answer the question, what do you think Farrah. What might help your friend.",,,,
Farrah,130.2,So I basically. So I was thinking about what word is like,,,,
Teacher,130.2,And while I talked to some of the others. Maybe we'll discover it together. What do you think,,,,
Farrah,130.2,"Oh, OK. OK.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"OK, let's see if we can put it together. Let's work together to see if we can find this answer. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So let me see. Um, let's see what other answers we have that we could talk about and work this out together.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,and let's see class. Raise your hand if you think that's a true statement. They found craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,so let's see who can add to that.,,,,
Chris,130.2,"Okay, it's me, Chris, I talked about the water to I said I'm water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it in the ships anymore.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay. So eventually I think should go along with what Oliver said I don't think we're quite ready for that yet, but I do think that maybe a long, as we research and in the future, that could be a possibility that",,,,
Teacher,130.2,So you and Jazmin you and Luis work together and see if y'all can work to combine your answers and help each other out.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So, that was one of the things that was evidence was that you could drink the water from the moon. So you think that you could work with Luis?",,,,
Teacher,130.2,See if you can look in your text and you and Oliver can work together because you guys are kind of on the same page too. yes Chris.,,,,
Chris,130.2,"Um, yeah, I guess I was thinking like, Well, let's see. What was I gonna say... I was gonna say that, well, I guess what I found was that water can be broken down into two parts. So hydrogen and oxygen. So I guess I was going to say that, like, yeah, that's stuff that also is useful.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"And I'm sure that Farrah and Oliver might be thinking, well, I picked a specific tool.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Do we agree with her answer.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"What could, Can somebody help Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Did we read about that. Oliver?,,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Yeah. So basically, um, I think that, well, it sounds like the microscope like",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"And if you have any questions, we can help somebody else can help out.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"So yeah, I wasn't sure how to make my answer better",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Can somebody help,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Farrah, can you help him out there?",,,,
Farrah,130.2,"So I think that they they use the microscope to discover the water like that's how they they found it. So I'm not really sure like why is my answer, like um not right.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Farrah?,,,,
Farrah,130.2,I actually have a question. I still don't quite understand why my answer was wrong.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,can anybody or Farrah. Can you tell me,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Does the rest talk with Luis about because he's trying to find which one discovers the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter. I think you have the answer. So, talk with Luis and help him discover which one it is.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,OK. OK.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Good. So, Farrah. So what did Chris, you say about the water",,,,
Farrah,130.2,"Um, he said the waters heavy if it's on the space of the spaceship.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So then Luis Would it be valuable to have this water and in space, so we don't have to lug it from Earth to the Moon.",,,,
Luis,130.2,"Um, yeah. Yeah, that'd be great because you know if I have to carry water might my arms and be tired.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Chris. Do you want to answer. Luis's question.,,,,
Chris,130.2,"Oh, I'm kind of had a different idea. I was just thinking like you, I went to NASA. So I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like masks and oxygen tanks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, well let's ask your other classmates.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,So let's break it up into groups Farrah and Oliver if you will be a group of two AND THEN Chris Jazmin and Luis,,,,
Teacher,130.2,So let's take about 10 seconds each person is going to share,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Group members, while the first person is sharing",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"You are just listening to them. So we're going to start with Farrah, you will be our first person to share",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Debbie will be the second Chris, you'll be the third Jazmin forth and then Luis last so each person, you're going to have about 10 seconds to share your answer. So, Farrah, if you will go first. And then, Oliver. I'll tell you when when to start",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"After that, okay, so you'll share with the group Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,130.2,"Well, me and depth kind of set the same stuff. We said that you know the Microsoft the microscope is his equipment and then we said that we also saw in paragraph four, they were talking about a spacecraft and we said that that was equipment to",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So let's um let's talk to our the rest of our classmates. Let's see what they thought, and then maybe we can",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, Jazmin. Do you agree. Also, do you have something else to say.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Yes, I see.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,All right. Does anybody have anything else say thanks important or is everybody else agree that convincing evidence and valuable role very important words.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,So I want you guys to turn and talk and share and pair for about 30 seconds and look through there and see if you can find some places that Show through the text that water is a valuable resource.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So just paragraph four or five and six. Okay. So, Oliveron Farrah. You guys and Chris can work together and Jazmin and Luis You can work together.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Anybody can answer.,,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"For example, future astronauts could drink this water.  You can drink it and do other stuff, right?",,,,
Teacher,130.2,How about Farrah and Oliver show us another way that water could be useful and tell me the paragraph that you're in and start read the sentence that it comes from as well. Okay.,,,,
Farrah,130.2,"So unfortunately, we have to go to our next class, we go to our next class. I just wanted to share with you how awesome it was to have you with us today.",,,,
Luis,130.2,"Yeah, um",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Very good. That's a claim that Luis said, right Luis?",,,,
Luis,130.2,"Yeah, that's what I was gonna say that was, that was the answer that I sent for the question.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Well, let me, let me ask Jazmin, a question, Jazmin, you mentioned that NASA sent a small machine. What kind of machine did NASA send? Maybe you can help Chris with that one.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Okay, let me look. I don't remember. That's a small machine called a lunar orbiter. That's the small machine. It's the lunar orbiter Chris.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Okay so Luis You know a lot about space. Can you tell us what the Lunar Orbiter is?,,,,
Luis,130.2,"Okay, well, so I know a lot about like what astronauts wear and what they use, and I know that there isn't gravity, but I actually never heard of a lunar orbiter before, so this is news to me.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,That's great. So do you guys think that you can use a microscope to find water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Chris. What did the scientists, fine.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, yeah. And so what did that small machine do? Chris, can you look in paragraph two and tell us what this small machine did?",,,,
Chris,130.2,Yeah okay so small machine um,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, so Chris, can you help him out and tell us what the lunar orbiter does?",,,,
Chris,130.2,"Yeah, so I could do that. But I like first. I just wanted to ask, like, um,",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Yes. Does anybody else have another aspect, what they may have also sent with the astronauts.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, so, and Oliver did you agree with Farrah.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Um, yeah. No, I agree, and I think that makes sense to me.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, that's one type of equipment anyone else know about another type of equipment.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,We also use it in science class to,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Yes. Maybe, Farrah, do you think you can help out Luis?",,,,
Farrah,130.2,"Um sure. Um, I actually was thinking that the microscope is is probably the the tool that they use to discover water on the moon, but it seems like that answers not right. I'm a little confused about why",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Oh, okay. So, based on what Luis just read about a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"But let's see what the point of a microscope is according to the article. So, do you know what paragraph or. Can anyone help Farrah, find the paragraph that a microscope is mentioned in Oliver",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Um, yeah. OK. So the paragraph. Let's see, they say in the last paragraph, paragraph three, and they say that the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a my first go to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,So what do you think about this Oliver,,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Um, okay. So basically, my thinking.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Did you all hear what I said to Luis?,,,,
Oliver,130.2,Your said to Luis that he has to restate the question and an answer the question.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,So does anybody else see any other equipment. Any other answers that it could that you possibly had that was related to,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Equipment.,,,,
Chris,130.2,"I wasn't in my answer, but I went to NASA. And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay. Thumbs up if you agree with Farrah thumbs down. If you think something, it needs to be added to that answer.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay everyone, Oliver. What do you think, do you agree with Farrah or no.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Well, I agree with Farrah. I'm because I'm not really sure, like, well, Farrah had a question about it.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Anybody else have a different answer. So we're, we're, we're stuck between microscope and lunar orbiter right",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Teacher:. And then Chris was able to help push that answer a little bit further to identify the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,did anybody find a different word than equipment in question one.,,,,
Chris,130.2,Um yeah I I thought water was the important word,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Somebody help Chris out what is another word that is maybe only said once or twice that we could look for in the text. What's another keyword somebody else found,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Yeah so convincing is an important word. And I do like valuable, valuable is a good one. Also convincing. What is it convincing. Convincing what? what are we being convinced of. Does anybody have a word to go along with savannas word convincing.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Exactly. So in that reading piece astronauts went to space and the company called NASA sent a piece of equipment up to space. Does anybody remember the name of that piece of equipment.,,,,
Farrah,130.2,I think the equipment was a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, now that you have circled your keywords. I would like for you to turn to the person beside you. So, Farrah and Oliver YouTube can talk Chris and Jazmin, you can talk",,,,
Teacher,130.2,And then eighth and you can share your answer with me. I want you to talk to the person beside you about the words that you underline that you thought were important to help you answer this question to go ahead and take 15 seconds to do that.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"I want you guys to talk about with that same partner,",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So, Farrah and Deb, you talk together Chris and Jazmin, you talk and then Luis You can you can talk with me.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,So I want you to take a couple seconds and talk to the person but Sachi,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So, Farrah and Deb, you can work together. Chris and gel together and Luis You can work with me. Okay, so take a couple seconds.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, so equipment and discover did anyone else underlying equipment.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"I guess. So you can have what we talked with Farrah, and Oliver here, right, which, if you don't mind. So",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So, Jazmin. Your answer was that NASA send a small machine. So Chris, do you think that they use that machine to look at it because we couldn't see with our eyes?",,,,
Chris,130.2,"The machine, the microscope?",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anyone know,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anyone agree or disagree with Oliver,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"You believe you don't need any help? Well, we're going to work through this together and we'll actually see what we can learn along the way. Does anyone else have any questions before we begin?",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"We're not entirely there just yet. Oliver, what you got to add?",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Well, we are absolutely on the right track. Jazmin, what do you have to add?",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Okay, so like I don't really think that it's the microscope. I think that it's the machine. The Lunar Orbiter. And the reason that I think that is that it, it talks about like using that to investigate and that sounds like the like the thing that the question, like discover, what it does.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, so I think right now what we can do is discuss with your neighbor or even the group and kind of talk about where you guys got your answers from and what you'd like to know more about",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Okay, we can do that.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, well let's see what Chris and Luis thought as well.",,,,
Chris,130.2,"Okay, so I'm like, here's the thing. I basically like my dad took me to NASA. And when we went to NASA. We went and saw like all of this, like, um like all of these like space suits and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff that like Luis was talking about.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, that's a really good thought. Farrah. I want to hear from your classmates and then we're going to come back together and see what everyone thinks about your key terms. Okay. Jazmin, would you like to go next.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"I was trying to figure out why my answer was wrong, and when I looked at it. So the word that I circled I circled keywords in the question. I circled equipment, and then discover, then I looked at the text, I also circled, in paragraph two, investigate.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,And so let's hear from Luis and see what he has to say. And we'll come together with a group response. Okay.,,,,
Luis,130.2,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. I always like to talk. So I basically um yeah so what I was looking at when I was looking at the reading was I basically was saying. Like I said equipment too. And then I said, like",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"I want you guys to break up into small groups so Farrah Oliver and Chris and then maybe Jazmin and Luis If you guys will work together for just a little bit. And if you have questions while you're discussing. You can ask me, but this is what I want you guys to focus on",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Sure. Well, I know that a couple of you guys had your hand raised. But Chris, would you like to share how your it's your may have been reconstructed and maybe that will help Oliver with his words. Since you guys may have similar answers.",,,,
Chris,130.2,"I wasn't really answering the question, so I ok so my answer now would be like that scientists are found craters full of water on the moon by using the lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So. Mm hmm. If you can split water up into two elements, like you said, how can you and Mr Chris that said that they had to use oxygen tanks come up with what the astronauts could use water on the main for",,,,
Luis,130.2,Um okay so,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"By using what you and Mr Chris and Mr Chris, you can talk to. Luis and see how good your response and Luis just wanted to work together to help astronauts.",,,,
Chris,130.2,"Okay, so, so I was talking about the meeting debrief and you said that to Luis And you're talking about them needing to drink on",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Oh, I think it takes, can someone find it.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Now, now you guys have not, but you guys were so close. So have Mr Chris and history. Luis out death.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Okay, so, so it sounds that water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and and that it says that I should not breathe oxygen. And that's important.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So what other kinds of equipment would you guys say that you would need to find water on the moon, other than a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Does anybody have any ideas, Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"I said  the small machine, but I'm not quite sure why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Right. Did anybody else see anything else in the text that you might use. So we have a microscope. Jazmin?,,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Basically, what I thought is its a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,So now we know they have. Oliver you remember what I tools the scientist used?,,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Um, yeah. So I guess they used the microscope and the Lunar Orbiter. Is that right?",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Is there somebody Chris, would you like to help her out.",,,,
Chris,130.2,"Yes, had to be from the craters, the craters for the water",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Alright and Chris. Can you tell me the other item that they needed,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, so let's continue to look maybe Jazmin can help you out.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Luis, Do you want to try to help her out to",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anybody know what they use you either the hydrogen oxygen for within the water?,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"I had a really good answer um well I I brought you guys, all together, because you guys all had varying answers so i'm hoping that when you guys hear your responses like your classmates responses.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"You can get ideas for them as well, because even the smartest people in the world, work with other people to make things better, because if you can collaborate, then you guys all learn at the same time.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"And maybe from listening to your classmates you might see in the text and see new things and learn from what is really happening, along with what you have found in prior knowledge okay you then so let's listen to our classmates all right.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"so maybe as we keep listening, as you heard from Jazmin and we might hear from Oliveron Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Okay well that's great why don't we go to her and asked her about cars and we'll come back to you to see if there's anything more you can add afterwards okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"so Oliver is there anything you'd like to add to that now that we've looked through the text and, if you want to review it again see if there's anything else or add.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Now Chris, now that we've heard everyone else's responses, do you have anything to reflect on or add about what you've heard and how this equipment was used to get to find the water on the moon.",,,,
Chris,130.2,"yeah, I guess, so I I think like I read that there could be a base on the moon by maybe 20 or that made me think that you know, like I don't know like It made me think that this is something that could make that possible.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Oliver, let's have everyone look first before you share. Anyone besides-- anyone else? Chris, what did you come up with?",,,,
Chris,130.2,"In that paragraph two, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Good job for knowing the answer. Anyone else want to try? Luis, do you want to go? Yeah, go ahead.",,,,
Luis,130.2,So I feel like the answer is lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,I want- before we get into that I want anyone else to share any other equipment they may have circled.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Anybody else?,,,,
Jazmin,130.2,I circled two. I circled small machine and Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Okay. Anyone else anyone else have any guesses?,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So I want to get into some small groups really quickly so i'm going to put with Farrah and Oliver. And then Chris Jazmin Luis are going to work together, and I want you to compare and contrast the difference between the Lunar orbiter and microscope.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"I want you to do this with a with a small group. So Farrah and Oliver can do it together and Chris Jazmin Luis can also be a small group, and I want you to circle any equipment, you see, in the reading, that you think is important, and then I want you come back in one minute.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,Okay um So the first one that I see is the small machine.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"i'm not saying any answer's wrong right now, I just want you to collaborate with your peers because they all have different answers then you. So I want you to collaborate with them, okay? Thank you for the question.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Ok, all, what do you see.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Do you guys know what did NASA send to help investigate Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,130.2,They sent the small machine.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anybody in the group remember reading about what they use to find the craters.,,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Well, I put in my answer that NASA sent a small machine. I don't know why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Do you want to add Jazmin, what was the equipment that you had said that may be Luis's thinking about?",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,It was lunar orbiter,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anybody want to help out Luis and tell him what the lunar orbiter was,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Luis What do you think, do you agree with death.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Well, I think you're thinking could benefit everybody else and how you just does everybody. Does anybody else want to explain why their answer could maybe be right.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Well, I mean, in paragraph one it does say that there's the the the waters deep in the craters. So I don't think I'm wrong, either.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anybody want to help Chris. Oh.,,,,
Oliver,130.2,Well i mean i i support. What's the microscope. Cause my there's a tool as equipment and they're talking about looking at water and in that part of a story.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Luis What do you think,,,,
Luis,130.2,"Okay. Well, I guess I gotta look in paragraph two",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So, Jazmin, what do you think",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Can anyone help him?,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Think about what's Farrah said.,,,,
Chris,130.2,I'm not sure.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,That's okay. Can anyone help him.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,um to make this a little easier did anybody have any answers that were different from savannas.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,let's see Luis did you have anything different today.,,,,
Luis,130.2,um yeah I mean I kind of noticed a couple things so one of the things that I noticed was that.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,who can raise their hand and what isn't it.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"That Luis didn't say, how about Farrah. What did. What did what equipment and I use",,,,
Farrah,130.2,"So I believe they use the microscope because you, you said that we should look at the text. So why I believe that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to see, and then the text. It's like saying that the waters microscopic so like I think that's it.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,For the next for the next person who answers.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,I think so. Who agrees with Jazmin who agrees that the lunar orbiter was a tool that the scientists use,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anybody else have any ideas about tools?,,,,
Jazmin,130.2,They said that NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Think so. No. Okay. Does anyone else want to say something real quick.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Awesome. What about Jazmin, what do you think about that.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"I mean, I think it might be cool to go to space. But I feel like if we make it too easy to go to space. And that'll make it too easy for everybody on earth to just, you know, like",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"That's a good idea. No thought, Luis, did you wanna chime in on anything. I know.",,,,
Luis,130.2,I'm,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Let me see Does anyone want to help her out or point to where it was in the article.,,,,
Farrah,130.2,I had microscope.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Let me see who else I.,,,,
Jazmin,130.2,Still don't understand why my answers wrong.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"or yeah yeah okay great does anyone else, want to add anything, maybe Jazmin or Chris.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,together.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"About Jazmin can you read yours, and then we can maybe like a grief, we wanted to add something to it, or maybe take something away Okay, so I.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,said yes actually that's can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,drink this water does anyone else remember from the text what the water can be used for drinking and there was one more thing.,,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"I wrote about curing it, but I guess you can't that's not what it's used for.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,So do you guys agree that that can be very valuable.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,do you agree with Farrah do you want to add anything or take anything away from it all.,,,,
Oliver,130.2,"I was pretty good, let me see you're sad you're sad the hydrogen oxygen is that rocket fuel, you said breathing.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Yeah. Oliver, can you help us out a little bit? I see you raising your hand.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Well, I'm sorry to interrupt, I was just saying that it's actually time for us to go to lunch. I know it was a really short time, but I do appreciate how you helped us really look for the evidence in the story to put in our answer.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"or Chris, do you have any suggestions.",,,,
Chris,130.2,"On not not about this, no, I was gonna say that I was gonna say I asked my new answer is ok",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Really smaller exactly.  Did anybody else think that while they're reading or see that in the text? Oliver?,,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Yeah, I am. I thought that I thought the same thing I Farrah. So I, I was thinking the same thing that that the microscope was the tool because you had to use it to see the the water",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"All right, so Farrah and deb why don't you guys work together, while I finish up with everyone else, and you guys can turn and talk quietly and find some more things that we can find for evidence, yes Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,I don't understand I don't understand why my answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Who agrees with Farrah that you do need a microscope to look really closely at things.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Well let's look who knows what a lunar Luis do you know what a lunar orbiter is?,,,,
Luis,130.2,um no actually okay I don't know that one. I don't know what that one is.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, who can tell me what a lunar orbiter is?",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"um well when I was reading the story, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. The Lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so the Lunar orbiter it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Farrah, do you agree with that.",,,,
Farrah,130.2,um yeah well now that I understand um yeah uh yeah I do.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anybody remember?,,,,
Chris,130.2,I answered craters full of water. But you said craters wasn't equipment. I know that they said there's a lot of water deep in the moon's craters. So I would think a lot of water.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Does anybody want to-- Luis, do you want some help from a friend?",,,,
Luis,130.2,"Yeah, I do.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anybody want to help Luis out? Why does the article tell us that water on the moon could be so valuable?,,,,
,130.2,I had an idea. But I don't remember--,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"OK. Farrah, what do you think?",,,,
Farrah,130.2,I guess I don't know. I don't know if-- I think NASA has a lot of money. So I guess I figured they can spend a lot of money because they have a lot of money. But I don't know if it's worth it.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Very good, very good. Um, so can you go, or can you turn and asked help from a friend.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"All right, who agrees with Jazmin or Chris, do you have something to say.",,,,
Chris,130.2,"Yeah, so I went to NASA. And I saw that the scientists, they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all sorts of stuff like that.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"that's a really good reason, we do need to talk about the equipment in the text did anyone else have any other ideas.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anyone want to jump in?,,,,
Luis,130.2,"Oh yeah definitely well, the thing is scientists can use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks too.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, so you still think that that anyone else that has everyone else's opinion stayed the same, or have they changed.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anyone else have any difference of opinions were anything else that they discovered what rereading the text.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Actually Farrah and Luis I think we're going to work together. Luis Are you are you with me.,,,,
Luis,130.2,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Jazmin add on.,,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Well, to find the water NASA send a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anybody want to help Farrah make answer stronger.,,,,
Luis,130.2,"Um, I can do it. I can do it. I'm",,,,
Teacher,130.2,What do people think. Do people think that,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Scientists use the microscope to discover water. Do people think it was the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Do you agree or disagree.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Chris. What do you think, do you agree with Farrah endeavor. Do you agree with Jazmin and Luis Why",,,,
Chris,130.2,"Well, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Do you thin they used the microscope. Do you think that they used the lunar orbiter? Why or why not?,,,,
Chris,130.2,"Well, maybe. Maybe both.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"What do you guys think. What do you guys think the answer is, then",,,,
Luis,130.2,I have a question.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Um, what do you guys think about what Farrah said",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Do you agree with her thinking, Do you disagree with her thinking why oh",,,,
Luis,130.2,"I'm sorry, that was Luis, I should have raised my hand.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Luis, make sure that we're raising her hand. What do we think",,,,
Chris,130.2,"I think, oh,",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Does anybody want to add some more detail. Oliver, thank you for raising your hand.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Yeah, well, actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch. But before we go, I just wanted to say thank you for encouraging us to add more detail and to really listen to and build on each other's answers.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Do we agree or disagree with Chris. Why, raise your hand.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Would anybody like to add anything else to what they think the main idea of this text is,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Did anybody else use a strategy, similar to Jazmin or differently to Jazmin, and how did it help them or how did it. Yeah. How did that help them to do this work, Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Um, well, okay, I'm Jazmin, she said about how she read it and she she thought about it and look for evidence. And I think I did something similar, but I actually came up with a different opinion. So I think part of part of the question was having an opinion.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"But except for this Equipment. Can you, can somebody share what is another word that you found that is also important in the question.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So, Farrah, and Oliver, how about you two work together and talking to each other.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,And I'm going to work with other three students in a few minutes.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"And then Jazmin. How about you, you maybe help us later to help out out Chris and Luis to answer the question, because your answer is NASA sent a small machine, right.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,Yes.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,So if you are going to revise your answer. It may help Chris and Luis to understand better.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,You had equipment and anyone else in the group have equipment.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Alright, so what I would like us to do next is Oliver Farrah and Luis I would like to group with you together and Chris and Jazmin, we're gonna work together. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,So you can start working in your small groups.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Chris. Do you agree with Jazmin.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"You learn the word orbit and Farrah. What did Chris, say, what does it mean",,,,
Farrah,130.2,It means to go around.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Luis is Oliver right,,,,
Luis,130.2,"Yeah, I mean, it's like, close enough. He couldn't he has to better words, I think. But yeah, he got the idea.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,To someone want to try to put that into one answer.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Did anyone want to add anything to that I can. I still see a hand Chris.,,,,
Chris,130.2,"Yeah, I would have to say, I went to NASA. And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Does anyone have a different answer or did they find any other information about any equipment. Yeah, Farrah. Go ahead.",,,,
Farrah,130.2,"Yeah, so I picked a different piece of equipment and Jazmin picked",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"All right. And once you're done, you can share with the partner, partner next to you.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,See if you guys got the same answers.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Anybody else find any other piece of equipment.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"You can take a minute to talk with the person next to you and revisit what that process was like, and then we can share out loud.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Yes. Do you all agree nod your head yes if you agree to that strategy.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,What do we think folks?,,,,
Teacher,130.2,nod your head yes if you feel like that is the equipment that they used. Does that make sense.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, can you help them out. You guys, what part in",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Yes, Chris",,,,
Teacher,130.2,So looking at the reading There's another machine that the scientists use did anyone remember what that other machine that they used,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Who remembers what the lunar orbiter looks for,,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Um, well, I think it looks for the for the water",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So what I'm going to ask you all to do now is, you're going to turn to your partner. And what you're going to do is you're going to walk answers. So you're going to share each other's answers.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So let's say Farrah, if you are working with Chris. You two would share your answers with each other.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So as you're working. I'm going to go to each group individually, and we're going to discuss your answers a little bit",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, so go ahead and get started. And then I'm going to go to each of you individually.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,That's what I think. Does anybody agree.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Yes, that's a very good point as well. Chris and can someone remind me. Do we see in the text anywhere that there was any astronauts sent to the moon. Does anyone remember",,,,
Chris,130.2,"Oh,",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Oh, OK. I can see why you think that, but I don't see it that way. Does anyone else have an idea, why do we all have different answers.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,Maybe,,,,
Teacher,130.2,So for the remainder of class we're going to break apart into groups or into part with you. We're going to break apart.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Jazmin and Chris work together.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Oliver in Luis then work together.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Awesome. So you're going to share what you found with Chris and I'm going to work with Oliver independently, Luis you have a question. Okay.",,,,
Luis,130.2,"Yeah, I just want to remind you, my dad is actually an astronaut.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,You guys have until six o'clock to work with your partner.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Oliver, you can go with who doesn't have a partner right now.",,,,
Luis,130.2,"Oh, it must be. It must be Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Oliver and Jazmin should be working together.,,,,
Luis,130.2,"Oh, so it's Chris and so I don't know.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,You agree with that.,,,,
Luis,130.2,"Um, now I mean, maybe they used it, but it sounded more like it was kind of like after after they found the water than they had to like study it. But, um, I think that that oxygen tanks are probably more important. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Did anyone have a different answer than Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Does anyone did anyone else find other examples, Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Luis gave an example, Oliver, do you have an example of why water is valuable for for astronauts.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Um, I want us to go back in and answer our question again. So does anyone have another example that we could use of",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anyone agree with Farrah. If you agree can raise your hand. And if you would like to add on to why you agree or if you have another quote from the text,,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"I said that that's the scientists NASA center small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Would anybody else like to add on Oliver Chris or Luis to the first question.,,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Um, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anyone else have an answer that they would like to contribute.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Luis Would you like to help Chris. Oh.,,,,
Luis,130.2,"Yeah, I'm Chris, you just need to read the next sentence extra right thing or access oxygen and a high to use as a rocket fuel.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,You too can work together to figure out how the scientists got the sample.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Evidence. Thank you. Does anybody agree with Jazmin about evidence or does somebody have a different idea.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anyone remember what it's called.,,,,
Luis,130.2,"Yeah, I got this. It's called",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Can we, can someone remind me of that.",,,,
Chris,130.2,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Equipment. Good. I'm just gonna pull everybody in the class and see if we're on the same page. Or if someone else wants to tell me something different. Oliver, go ahead.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Oh yeah, I had also picked equipment, actually. So",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, thank you for giving your answer. I'm sorry to just call on you out of the blue, but, um, I think it's important to get everyone's input, so we can all be on the same page. Chris, what you think.",,,,
Chris,130.2,"Well, actually, I thought that it was water. What equipment to find water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Good. I like that, too. I like that. We can have different answers. So, so we'll consider water as well and Jazmin, what do you have",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,Discover,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Great. So you could say they discovered the water, let's bring this to a consensus, I think only have like 30 seconds or a minute left.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,So to wrap this all up. It's important that we're on the same page. And we use the information we we went back and discovered,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Equipment. All right. Did anyone circle anything different.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,awesome why don't you talk with Jazmin and you guys can figure out if that.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"does anyone can anyone else, help and let us know what different form water might be in on the moon, rather than liquid like it like we might expect okay how about.",,,,
Chris,130.2,they didn't?,,,,
Teacher,130.2,No does anyone can answer the how much water they found.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"mm hmm yeah so i'm wondering if anyone can help us dive a little bit deeper into this were there any other tools that the scientist needed for this mission, other than a microscope that we just heard Oliver and Farrah talk about a little bit yeah Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Okay, well, I said NASA send a small machine, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So how to do that Jazmin either you can answer, or maybe Chris or Luis could help you out with that.",,,,
Luis,130.2,"um I I I didn't oh okay well i'm My answer is oxygen tanks, I said oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,yeahm did anyone else find something else that they thought was interesting.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anyone else think they could answer Farrah's question?,,,,
Chris,130.2,"Well, I know I didn't have equipment in my answer, so I had to add that, um but for Farrah's answer I guess she is saying the equipments.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does that shift anyone else's thinking about their response to here Oliver explaining where he found that in the text?,,,,
Chris,130.2,Okay um I think I didn't even think about that second paragraph because of I was looking for water.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Jazmin is there anything else you would want to add to Luis's response to make sure that it fully answers the question?,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"does anyone else, want to add on to what the word equipment means.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anyone else have any other ideas about what equipment is.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"um Chris, you have your hand raised earlier, do you want to maybe add on to what Farrah and Oliver have shared so far.",,,,
Chris,130.2,Oh yeah well so i'm in terms of equipment actually I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Farrah, is it okay if Jazmin helps you out this question?",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Oliver you started out the same answer as Farrah, do you agree with what you said you want to add on?",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Oh yeah I agree, but i'm also um I don't really know how I would have figured that out if Chris hadn't told us about the suits and things, how would I have figured that out just on my own.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Maybe let's come back to Luis. Luis we haven't heard from you, since the beginning.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,can do you think you could answer Oliver's question? How would he know that scientists would face some of these problems with the big suits and having to survive on the moon.,,,,
Luis,130.2,"Um well, I mean it helps to know a lot about space, like me and I guess Chris he kind of knows a lot about space too.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So  what does everyone else think, do you guys agree that the microscope is the technology and the equipment that is needed In order to discover water on the moon, or do you disagree and might think it's something else?",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"The scientists need a microscope in order to look really closely at  At the finding water on the moon, is that something that you agree with or disagree with based on the text, and when you answer I want you to be able to find exactly where in the text he found your answer.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay well i'm going to toss it back to the team is her answer wrong, and if it is explained why with evidence from the text.",,,,
Chris,130.2,"Okay, can I try.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,and share their answer first with what they think the answer to number one is then share their evidence and prove why they're right,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Or would you go with your first answer.,,,,
Chris,130.2,"um well i'm not sure I think my first answer is right, but um I know it doesn't say equipment, but I don't really know what the equipment is I just listened to Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So Chris is a little confused about what actually is the right equipment does anybody have a suggestion for what Chris to do next, Luis?",,,,
Luis,130.2,"um yeah well, I just wanted to say um I think I got this all figured out so I'm good.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So, can you help us move our thinking forward what is something Chris to do to confirm his thinking.",,,,
Luis,130.2,"Okay i'm Chris, you need equipment and your answer, so I said oxygen tanks, because that is definitely equipment that scientists use on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"And the same person who was by the window closest to the window sorry is going to speak first, and I want you to share with your partner, the exact piece of evidence that you circled in the text, this time around, and if it changed tell your partner, why all right go.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"Okay um my answer didn't change, it's still microscope and I circled the word microscope because it is in the third paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"or actually Farrah um, do you agree with Luis that.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,OK Can someone else explain why the microscope was not an equipment that the scientists and NASA use.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Jazmin um How does that sound to you, what do you think.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"um yeah and then you told me to to add more specific stuff to my answer, so I found a little more, and I would add that the machine is called a lunar orbiter and they use it to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,and then Chris you're going to build.,,,,
Farrah,130.2,"Okay, so this paragraph, it tells us.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay Chris, can you build.",,,,
Chris,130.2,"Oh well, the craters they're dark.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Thank you Oliver for sharing your thought process. Do other students in the class agree, disagree, want to push back? Feel free to throw your hand up if you want to share thoughts on what we just heard.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Thank you Jazmin for sharing your thought processes. Let's see Chris, I haven't heard from you today. Do you agree with Jazmin that we can also use the word find or discover for investigate?",,,,
Chris,130.2,Oh yeah oh those words mean pretty much the same thing.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Also, yes, you are so right can anybody help right what is that machine call that NASA.",,,,
Luis,130.2,"Oh, we know this, I know this. .",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Is there anything else they'd need to find that water.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,So I just want to zero back in on a different part of the story. Did anybody find a different part of the story that gives us information about the tool?,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"now let's try to learn some appeals and see maybe what someone else said, and we can come to the closest answer so Jazmin, can you tell us what your answers and why did you pick that answer.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"And then, as a group, we can have a discussion to find out what we can vote, you can vote amongst each other, what do you think the correct answer is, and, as a group, you can decide, and let me know.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"yeah great Chris Luis do you have any thoughts I know you're all you also have like really enrich background knowledge about this topic, do you have any comments to share on top of the Chris, because you can add on to this.",,,,
Luis,130.2,"out while i'm and not so much about the moon base, but I was thinking about what Farrah was saying about it being the microscope and then you were saying Jazmin to answer was right, the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"As we were talking, did any of you remember that some of your peers answers came up in the text too? Does that sound familiar.",,,,
Farrah,130.2,"Some of them, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Luis our space expert Can you help us out.,,,,
Luis,130.2,"um yeah okay so um lunar you guys lunar means moon so anytime you see lunar it means about the moon, an orbiter is like an orbit it's like it goes around something and it says so, the orbiter at looks for the ice, I think, by going around the moon somehow.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Well, your answer is not wrong Oliver and i'm so i'm so glad that you picked to the microscope so I let as a way to answer your question, I would like one of your classmates to maybe kind of give us kind of a reassessment of how was it that that NASA made this discovery.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Oliver could you help me explain a little bit more to your classmates about why it is that you know the water on the moon, is still too early for Chris's goals.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"yeah cuz in paragraph six, they talk about how it'll take a lot of time and a lot of money and so that means that they don't have the time or the money yet so it's it's clearly not ready yet.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Does anybody have any other ideas about what equipment, the scientists use? do we.. Farrah yes?",,,,
Farrah,130.2,"yeah Okay, so I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"full of water, would you like to discuss this statement, whether your partner to make sure that what you're stating is not incorrect?",,,,
Chris,130.2,Oh sure yeah I could do that.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"like how you define what it is microscopic... would you want to think deeply about that or maybe. Talk to Dave about it in the meanwhile Jazmin can answer because chip, it seems like Dave also so called the same thing as us",,,,
Teacher,130.2,that's a very good observation would anyone else in the class like to contribute to this discussion and like to answer what Oliver just said?,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"What do you guys think that does it sound like a good enough explanation, Farrah and Oliver?",,,,
Oliver,130.2,"um, yeah that makes sense, but it didn't really say that in the story, so I don't think I would have known that if Luis didn't tell me.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,let's see if we can reset refine your answer further.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Who okay let's figure out if it needs further refinement and I think Oliver you also answered the same as Farrah, so why don't you the three Farrah, Oliver and Chris have a quick chat with each other.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,So you have like a quick moment to have a chat with each other and then share like Maybe you can reach a conclusion about the quantity of the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay um would anyone, like to add to the response further would anyone like to even further refine savannas response.",,,,
Farrah,130.2,"Oh, my mind was going to be different, I was just gonna add on to mine that NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,let's see if Farrah has anything different to say,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, so i'm i'm going to make a suggestion on how we value investments towards the end of our investigation or discussion today, but I would in the in the meanwhile, I just want you to listen to why Chris and Jazmin have made some differences to the benefits of this.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Based on what evidence, you have been able to collect Is there anyone else would like to add to the response that Jazmin has made.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,A lunar orbiter. Does anybody think that lunar orbiter might be the right answer or might be the piece of equipment that was needed in order to find the water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Farrah can you help Jazmin out?,,,,
Teacher,130.2,I know that food is pretty gross I want to bring you into Congress and you should with Chris because Chris raised a good point in his,,,,
Chris,130.2,uh huh,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Oliver and Farrah can the three of you chat for a minute and share, about what you discovered when you looked at your answers and then Jazmin and Luis can you do that as well.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Jazmin I think you talked about a small machine, do you want to add anything here.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,yeah um my answer is NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"anyone else were you able to see even from hearing what Luis shared and even from going back into the passage, we can we identify some other words from the actual passage that might give us some clues as to what the.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"equipment and what else, Farrah can you help out. What kind of equipment does it want to know about.",,,,
Farrah,130.2,Okay equipment for discovering water.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Chris, do you want to jump in? How about Farrah and Oliver? What's it asking for, it's asking for equipment for discovering water, what else is it asking for.",,,,
Chris,130.2,"Oh, oh circle evidence in the text.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,did anybody else have a different tool that the scientists used?,,,,
Teacher,130.2,All right does anybody else have any other ideas about tools that NASA might have used.,,,,
Chris,130.2,yeah I do.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So, if we take a step further, to see what kind of equipment scientists use to find water which other answers can you get from this paragraph? Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Oh well, Okay, I said that NASA sent a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,so could anyone tell me what is the action in this question.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"so um did anyone have a different answer from Jazmin,",,,,
Teacher,130.2,did anyone circle something different Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"um what else could they have used, I think that somebody else yes Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"um yeah so my answer was that NASA Center small machine head, so I don't understand why my answers room.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,and it doesn't have to be Jazmin somebody else can help her out if you want just find the line in the text that says that NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,yeah that's fair does anybody have have some input for Oliver as to why the small machine is also important Luis.,,,,
Luis,130.2,"Okay, so Oliver the machine is called a lunar orbiter, and so the orbiter it i'm excited to where the water is because a microscope a microscope is really small like depth, can you picture astronaut walking around the big giant mode like a tiny little less that would take.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Absolutely Chris, do you want to clarify that.",,,,
Chris,130.2,"Well, I was just going to add since we're talking about all the equipment that I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"yeah does anybody know when they use it, based on the text we can look in part three.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,So...,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anyone remember.,,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Yes, yes.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"does anyone can anyone summarize what those two machines were Oliver, I think you just had it would anyone else, like to build on that.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Yes, can I try and.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Thank you for sharing back does anyone have a different answer than Luis.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Does anyone have a different feeling about that answer, do you think the Jazmin has included everything she needs to she talked about the WHO or anything else Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,130.2,um no she didn't have the WHO and.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,I would agree. What do you all think? Do you think that that strengthens Jazmin's answer?,,,,
Teacher,130.2,What else do you think are important tools that allow them to look at water.,,,,
Chris,130.2,wow hmm maybe they need something to collect the water.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,what else how are they traveling to the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Anything else that we have.,,,,
Luis,130.2,"wow the rocket ships landing gear if they're going to go on the moon, they need landing gear um suits and masks, Chris already said that, food, really gross food for them to eat on the trip um.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,yeah in the story was there a part that maybe some one of your peers can help you find it.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Maybe someone else could offer something yeah Jazmin.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Maybe someone else can offer something.,,,,
Farrah,130.2,So you're saying you're saying it's the Lunar orbiter and not the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Well, what do other people think does anyone else have a suggestion so right now we're thinking is it a microscope Is it the Lunar orbiter what do we think the scientists used to find the water yeah Chris.",,,,
Chris,130.2,Oh well.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,What does everyone else think.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Do people or agree or disagree with what Chris just said that the Lunar orbiter with us to find or discover the water and the microscope was used to actually look at it specifically yeah.,,,,
Oliver,130.2,"that's that's really good answer, I agree with Chris about that, but I just I just looked at the clock and i'm so sorry but we we actually have to go to lunch, right now, but I really wanted to say, we really appreciate how you really took your time and.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,yeah so thank you did anyone else circle equipment also.,,,,
Oliver,130.2,Um I circled equipment too.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,so did anyone else circle discover.,,,,
Farrah,130.2,I circle just over two because the same thing same class in our English teacher told us about looking for the action word in the in the question.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"yeah So what does everyone else think do we agree with what Farrah and Oliver said, do we have a different answer what does everyone think.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"I have a different answer, but I think that they they did use it to look closely at the water.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,mm hmm so let's let's let's ask the rest of the group,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"but Jazmin what else, are you going to add?",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Well Okay, so I do think it's used to look at the water on the moon, but I guess, I had a different answer so i'm not sure either um.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,did anyone else identify that as a tool in this paragraph.,,,,
Oliver,130.2,Oh yeah I saw that one.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Can someone rephrase what Luis just said, what does the Lunar lunar orbiter do.",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"It looks for, um I was gonna say the same thing, it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater um.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,yeah so So what does everyone else think what do we think the Lunar orbiter is doing.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,What does everyone else think do they agree with what Oliver said.,,,,
Chris,130.2,I think so um let me see.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, so does anyone else have a different response for the second half of their sentencing saying now, what do I think after the conversation.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Alright perfect now I am going to have Dave and Farrah partner up and talk to each other about what you were just thinking about.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Jazmin and Luis I want you to partner up and do the same and Chris, you and I are going to spend some time together and be partners for today",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Okay, can you give me just one, second, while I talked to Oliver and Farrah maybe you and Luis can talk about why you chose your answers and what you think is different between your answers.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,does anyone have any other ideas on where we might.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,want to build off of either what Jazmin or Oliver said about the equipment remember there when but that scientists use Chris.,,,,
Chris,130.2,"Well, so for my answer, I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, but it doesn't new equipment and my answer, but that's how I answered the question.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"um, what do you, what do you all think.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"and at the same time I want, i'm wondering, is there any one else have different answers?",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,"Yes, I had a different answer.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anyone has some different ideas to add them.,,,,
Farrah,130.2,"um yes, I I thought, something different, so I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Does anyone have more to add on to this question.,,,,
Jazmin,130.2,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"So right now I want Chris deaf and Farrah to turn and talk to your partner and Jazmin and Luis will turn and talk with each other and you're going to answer does your response connect to the context of the question, go ahead and do that for 10 seconds.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"Farrah, do you agree that NASA use a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,"and actually Chris had a good point and his answer Chris, if you want to share.",,,,
Chris,130.2,My answer was.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Good good Farrah you want to build off that.,,,,
Farrah,130.2,Reach Every reader: Oh I just got the same thing,,,,
Teacher,130.2,Right good good anyone have a different answer.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,So what I want to do now is split you guys into two small groups so i'm just going to do Chris and death.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"I mean, excuse me i'm gonna do Farrah and death and then Chris Jazmin eat less or two groups so YouTube and then the other three.",,,,
Teacher,130.2,Chris and you want to build on that?,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"cool and before we wrap up just to make sure that we're on the same page So then, and then, did you have a similar answers to Jazmin or something different.",,,,
Oliver,130.2,So i'm Farrah do you want to talk first.,,,,
Teacher,130.2,"so let's build on that, how can we build on that a little bit more?",,,,
Jazmin,130.2,Well it's kind of wondering that because I don't understand why my answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"No. What is the type of word we used, but remember way earlier at the beginning of this lesson when we talked about action words.",,,,
Oliver,130.3,And that's how we discover discover,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So if we look back, it says that, they used a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So, to make our answer better. We could say NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,NASA sent a small machine called a loomer Lunar Orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,Okay then not full of water.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So, but what did they use to discover the water that, they used a microscope microscope to look at it. Once they found it.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it looked for ice deposits and the craters, and then they use that microscope to see it because it's so tiny. You can't even see it. You had to use a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,It is. But they didn't use it to discover the water.,,,,
Chris,130.3,I went to NASA. So I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"But they use the machine, the Lunar Orbiter to find it to discover it.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,But then they use the microscope once they found it.,,,,
Oliver,130.3,Oh,,,,
Teacher,130.3,This piece of equipment is used for a different purpose.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,They might,,,,
Teacher,130.3,Use,,,,
Teacher,130.3,The microscope is used for a different purpose. They didn't use a microscope on the men they use something else to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Oh, what do you do you",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"They do, yeah. But all of those pieces of equipment are used for a different purpose. We're trying to figure out which",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Yeah, the scientists use the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and discover water on the moon. That makes sense.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,So the equipment that they used is the Lunar Orbiter to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Yeah, so can we all agree that water is a valuable resource",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"It would take a long time. But eventually, it would be very, very, very valuable resource for astronauts to use,",,,,
Teacher,130.3,And so that is how they discovered that there was ice on the moon or water.,,,,
Oliver,130.3,"Um, I had the same answer as Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"But even, you did circle, if you circled the same thing as Farrah, you are at, you at, you were both actually not correct with that answer, so if you would have circled about the Lunar Orbiter, you would have been correct",,,,
Jazmin,130.3,"Um, but, okay, well, I don't understand what, why [my answer] is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"It says, NASA send a small mach, small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So that should have been your answer.",,,,
Jazmin,130.3,"Oh, okay, well, okay, now I know the answer.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"No. They might have used those when they discovered it, but they were not use to discover the water.",,,,
Chris,130.3,"Okay, gotcha.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Yes, it is very hard to say without a microscope, but the lunar orbiter is very powerful.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Well, they didn't send a microscope. They sent a machine called the lunar orbit orbiter right",,,,
Farrah,130.3,But the microscope is a machine.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,They had to send this machine called the lunar orbiter right,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"But they also use the Lunar Orbiter to that's what they use to find the water that there was water in the crater, then they had to go and use a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,They needed their lunar orbit Orbiter to get to the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,And see the surface of the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Yes, they took the lunar orbiter was the",,,,
Teacher,130.3,equipment that they used,,,,
Teacher,130.3,It was more than the lunar orbiter that they use dry.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,Because it wants to know what equipment and so they sent the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Well, the tool they had that the equipment they had to use",,,,
Teacher,130.3,Was the Lunar Orbiter to find the water,,,,
Teacher,130.3,Then to actually make sure that they see it. They had to use a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Yeah, so they had to use the Lunar Orbiter and they also had to use the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So we were looking for. They said, so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. So the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"But in this specific case, they didn't need any of that. Right. They sent the lunar orbiter up",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"And it went. So instead, it it checked for water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,A better word like microscope because the reading says that they need a microscope to find water on the moon.,,,,
Jazmin,130.3,"I don't understand because it says, Oh, what did they use to discover the water. And so, in paragraph two, they talk all about like looking for the ice deposits, and we we learned in science class that ice and water, are the same thing. Ice is just frozen water right?",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Mm hmm. Yes. And the small machine, I think that you wanted to say that that is small machine is a microscope. Right?",,,,
Jazmin,130.3,"Okay, let me see.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,Things like the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"And the Lunar Orbiter. Right. We could say they use the Lunar Orbiter to reach the moon and a microscope to find the water there specifically those kinds of things. Let our reader or the person that's looking at our answers know exactly what we're, we mean",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"And actually, the water would be valuable in the future.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Alright, so the lunar orbiter is just a machine that collected the water, but then the, the actual equipment to see the water was the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,Yeah. So though small machine was named the Lunar Orbiter. That was the machine that discovered ice or discovered water on the moon's surface.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So they did use a microscope, but it wasn't the item or the piece of equipment that discovered water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Where you would add the name of it and then you would add what type of water or what was the size of the water. Of what that they found so they would add that. So the answer, like a complete answer that I'd be looking for would be that the lunar orbiter was a small machine that found microscopic water on the earth or on the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,130.3,"Okay, okay.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,And for this particular reading The biggest piece of equipment that they use was that lunar orbiter that they used to discover.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"But what this article is talking about is how they discovered water on the moon, and I use a lunar orbiter to find [?] water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,That's how you got to know that there's water on it.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"And then the microscope is what she needs to study the water because it's so small that you need to microscope did this study yet, but the lunar orbiter is how you discover the water",,,,
Oliver,130.3,So they use the Lunar Orbiter to like discover it and then microscope to like study it.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,They didn't really use a microscope to find the water. The water was located underneath the ground.,,,,
Chris,130.3,So how did they find the water,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Well, scientists weren't on the moon to look at the water by themselves so they didn't need the microscope. They had the machine. The Lunar Orbiter investigating the ground for that water.",,,,
Farrah,130.3,That's interesting. So they didn't use the micrsoscope to find it.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Well, I'm glad you brought that up. Well, in our story in the moon is a desert. It doesn't mention that the astronauts themselves were on the moon, so they wouldn't have the need to include that equipment in our story today.",,,,
Chris,130.3,"Okay. Yeah. Okay, so they weren't actually there. So they didn't need to use masks and suits and stuff like that. Luis Like, that's the thing to remember, like they didn't do that. Is that right,",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Correct. They sent that small machine, the equipment. The Lunar Orbiter to investigate the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"and they didn't use oxygen tanks, although they do use them. They did not use them to find the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,The lunar orbiter was the machine that NASA sent to investigate to look for ice deposits,,,,
Teacher,130.3,You would need the microscope to be able to see it. So you and your answer and Oliver's answer was correct. It was a microscope.,,,,
Jazmin,130.3,So my answer---,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"But I guess you could say, you know, they did use the lunar orbiter also to investigate it, but to actually see it, you would need the microscope.",,,,
Jazmin,130.3,So is my answer wrong or is it like sort of right?,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So they use that the Lunar Orbiter to investigate, but to see the water they had to use the microscope.",,,,
Jazmin,130.3,Okay. Okay. That makes sense.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So the question was, you know, they're trying, they're going to need the oxygen tanks while they're on the moon, but you're also going to need different equipment to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,130.3,Okay. All right. Now I should say like scientists used a lot of ox used equipment like oxygen tanks and um and others equipment like I guess I could what Jazmin said and and the small machine to investigate to call it a lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So that's what they use to discover the moon, the water on the Moon was the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So a scientific tool called the microscope is a correct answer for looking at the water, but to actually just for the scientists to actually discover water on the moon, as it says in paragraph to the machine was called a lunar orbiter. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,So as you're reading and answering your questions always look back in the text. You can also underline important information that will help you answer questions after you are finished.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So they wouldn't exactly be using their tanks and their masks to find the water on the moon. That's just part of their, their work uniform and protective clothing.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,That is the equipment that they used. All right.,,,,
Chris,130.3,Mr. Teacher?,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"microscopes are used for to find tiny, tiny organisms underneath right to magnify it to make it bigger. And we didn't use a microscope to go and look for, you know, water on the moon. We used the Lunar Orbiter, which was able to be controlled from, you know, from the earth.",,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Oh, OK. I see.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Right, and so they use the Lunar Orbiter to discover the water. Now they use the microscope to look at the microscopic organisms that were found inside of the water.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"And so in this case case. In this case, the machine they're using is a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,The truth is that the lunar orbiter is what was used to actually find water.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,The Lunar,,,,
Jazmin,130.3,Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,That has a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,To explore for water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"You say, both of them because the lunar orbiter had the microscope on it.",,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Oh, interesting. Okay, gotcha. So like you would say both. Okay, interesting way.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,To discover water on the moon.,,,,
Oliver,130.3,"Scientists use the Lunar Orbiter. Oh, okay, yeah. So scientists to the question is like how what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. And you say, like right back scientists use the Lunar Orbiter to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"OK, so the equipment that is scientists use is a microscope to discover the water on the moon. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits,,,,
Teacher,130.3,So they used the machine that you're talking about the Lunar Orbiter to investigate the water,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"and the ice deposits. That makes sense? And then they used the microscope to look more at it, to discover",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So they're not, they're not using the mask and things to discover the water. They're using it more to survive while they're discovering those things.",,,,
Chris,130.3,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,Yeah. So first they had to find it. And then they could investigate using the microscope.,,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Gotcha. Okay, that, that, that makes a little more sense. I think, I think that makes sense. Um,",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Okay, so it's not written about it not might not be completely ready yet. But as they were as time goes on It could be. I think that it could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Yeah. So let's think of it as, you know, maybe it's not great right now, but in the future. It can be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,So maybe instead of tool you can use the word equipment to answer your question. Does that make sense.,,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Yeah, I think so.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So the lunar orbiter was the correct one. That is the small machine that they use to find the water, the microscope was used to look more closer to the water.",,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Oh, but I guess. So how do you figure that out. Is it just because you're the teacher, you know, you know,",,,,
Teacher,130.3,Yes. And you can also say how it's important that it will help them be able to survive because they need that water.,,,,
Jazmin,130.3,So I would say yes it's valuable because you need water to drink.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So, you were almost right, but the machine itself that they used was called a lunar orbiter. And that's what they used to see the ice deposits",,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Oh, so like they like found it using the Lunar Orbiter and then they used the microscope like like to see it.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Would it be on me, I guess, what kind of space plant would it be because Earth plants need oxygen to or, I guess, carbon dioxide that we give off. So I'm not sure if that's a space for them to grow.",,,,
Jazmin,130.3,"Yeah, that's a good point. I didn't think of how the heck",,,,
Teacher,130.3,looks for ice deposits. Right. So could the lunar orbiter be the type of equipment the scientists used?,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"And they use the microscope to look at the small teeny tiny deposit of water that they had. But to find this equipment on the moon, or to find the water on the moon.",,,,
Oliver,130.3,"They use the equipment. which is the lunar orbiter. Oliver, what's up?",,,,
Teacher,130.3,And that was the orbit.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"NASA scientists used the Lunar Orbiter to investigate water on the moon that takes words from our sin. It's am from our end. I mean, from our questions in its and from the Senate's in the passage. Correct.",,,,
Farrah,130.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Okay, but in the top of the reading. They talk about NASA as Jazmin was talking, they do send a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"And they do talk about sending that you might need a microscope, which Farrah brought up and Oliver.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,But the microscope is used to see the little particles of water. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Okay, while you were reading near the top, it does talk about a small machine that help NASA find water and it is called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,And that's what they helped find water,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Okay, so it says in here that water can be used for astronauts to drink. So that's a valuable way that we could use water now.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,But that isn't necessarily the equipment they use to discover the water.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,That isn't what they used to discover it.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Um, I don't think so. They sent a machine up there.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So they sent a piece, they didn't send humans up there, so no one would need the oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,So you might have circled water as well.,,,,
Farrah,130.3,"I did, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So they didn't technically need to use their oxygen, oxygen tank to discover the water.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"But like you said they did find water, but we need to look specifically other question on how they found that water and it was with the machine called the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Chris,130.3,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Yet specifically to find the water they use the equipment, called the Lunar Orbiter. Now there's other equipment that's talked about in this text, but specifically to find the water they use the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Jazmin,130.3,So we have to go to our next class that is so much for working with us.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,So even though we're not using the water right now. The implications of finding that water moving forward could be very beneficial to our astronauts and the spacecraft and everything of that matter.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"But there's other ways to detect it. So in this case, they didn't. It doesn't look like they said they actually use a microscope.",,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Oh yeah, that doesn't make sense. So they didn't actually have a microscope on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,130.3,but they use a different tool on the moon to discover,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"When they use the microscope, that wasn't to discover the water, that wasn't to find the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,That's when you get on the moon and you you have to use that microscope to look really closely. But that's not the tool that they use to find it for the very first time.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Right. Yes. And so once they discovered the water on the moon, then the scientists can use the microscope to look at it really closely.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Okay. And so what that lunar orbiter does, that's the small machine, Jazmin, that they sent and the small machine, you were talking about is called the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Okay, yes. Within the second paragraph, it talks about NASA would send, a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Jazmin,130.3,"So, is that just what I was missing was just the name of it?",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"but oftentimes when we're asked a question, we Want to come to the best answer, we can possibly give or the most clear and simplest answer, which in this case, Jazmin was just saying it is in paragraph two, but like you said, you said you went on a trip to NASA with your father.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,So when we write our answer.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"We would, we would say",,,,
Teacher,130.3,The Lunar Orbiter. What does it do was,,,,
Oliver,130.3,orbiter was arm.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"And that is the name. It's not capitalized like your name, Jazmin's capitalized, Chris is not is capitalized, but lunar orbiter is not. But when it says, called a lunar orbiter that's the title and that would be the answer. they're looking for.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Nope. So in the text. It said, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Jazmin,130.3,"That's close to my idea cuz I said in my answer. I said that NASA since the small machine, but I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"The correct answer is Masterson a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, because that is this specific piece of equipment that scientist used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,But however they use the small machine to find the ice deposits. Correct?,,,,
Chris,130.3,Yeah. Yeah,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"However, I think that they have a plan for the water",,,,
Jazmin,130.3,"Yes. Okay. See, I said that, yes, that the water would be valuable. And the reason that I said that. So astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water. And so what I was looking at, basically, I wasn't a paragraph four, and they were saying that",,,,
Teacher,130.3,and based off the paragraphs as Chris said we're able to see that they can use the water for two different reasons.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,So they use that small machine and the small machine was called a lunar orbiter said the lunar orbiter was the small machine or the piece of equipment that the scientists use,,,,
Teacher,130.3,What helped them found the water was the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,The small machine that they sent was caught a lunar orbiter and that was to help them investigate.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"What does, it just says that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look at it really closely. It doesn't tell us that they did use the microscope.",,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Okay, so you just needed to see",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Well, again, it says that NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. So, I do not believe that they sent any astronauts up there to look at it at this time that they just as they sent their small machine.",,,,
Chris,130.3,"Gotcha. Okay, so, so was like, like they may be need that stuff, but they didn't like use it necessarily this time.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"I don't really think they could have. It's that small, I don't think really we could see it with that that special tool that scientists created for us to actually use. So now what I want you to do, you guys know what elbow partners are?",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"However, they use the Lunar Orbiter to actually physically get there. Right.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,But if we were to choose one answer to be correct. I would probably go with the lunar orbit.,,,,
Oliver,130.3,"Um, so I think that I understand that the equipment like the answer to the question is the Lunar Orbiter, but I think I'm still not quite sure why. And I'm unfortunately we have to go to our next class. But thank you so much for working with us. We really enjoyed working with. Thank you.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"And since we're looking at the question when it says discover the water on the moon. That gives us a path to answer Lunar Orbiter, because that is what the scientists use to discover it.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,we can see they send a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter in this case.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,Yes.,,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Yes, they use the Lunar Orbiter to discover it. And then they use the microscope to study, I think, is that right",,,,
Teacher,130.3,So that's where you found about the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,Close. I bet you they didn't use oxygen tanks while they were there.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,Maybe they could use the oxygen for the oxygen tanks?,,,,
Luis,130.3,yeah that makes sense that's okay so then that's that would be helpful.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So if they could just pick it up on the moon, then they wouldn't have to bring it with them and then they could maybe even bring something else that they liked maybe like a favorite stuffed animal or something.",,,,
Chris,130.3,I don't think the astronauts are bringing stuffed animals they're like grown ups and scientists and stuff.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"You would need a microscope to look really closely at the water that they found on the moon, but that's not actually what these scientists use to find the water",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"If one of us went into space and we wanted to look at the moon water we would need a microscope. However, the scientists actually used the Lunar Orbiter to find the water",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Right, so in that sentence, we can see that the text is using the Lunar orbiter as the tool that is actually finding the water.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"But I want you to go a little bit further and be able to say that the microscope would be needed to see the water, but the Lunar orbiter is what found the water.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Like Farrah, though, I want to push you a little bit further, and while I do like that answer, and I think you could keep that I would want you to add on to it and talk a little bit about the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Because that is the piece of equipment that ultimately, the question wants you to pick out of the text, yes Chris.",,,,
Chris,130.3,And I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"yeah you're right i'm Sorry, I think, I said that in a bit of a confusing way, so you want to make sure that you would say scientists found craters of water on the moon, and the machine that they used to find these craters was the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,But the last passage has our answer in it.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Do you, you could mention um what equipment they use to find the water I think if i'm i'm pretty sure is a lunar orbiter that wasn't one that found the crators.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"yeah i'll i'll read it for you ready i'm ready okay NASA sang songs a equipment, called the Lunar orbiter which its purpose.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,is to travel around the moon and discover.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,new findings.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So we could say, for an example, we could talk about the microscope, because they used it to see the water you can talk about the lunar orbiter that NASA sent. Those are some options. Yes, Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"That is, that is correct. So the reason why we did this was because people were thinking, the microscope is what we were using to find the water, but in reality it was because we're using the small machine, the Lunar orbiter to find water. Does anyone have any questions about that?",,,,
Oliver,130.3,"No, no, and I, I was, I just want to say aw thanks teacher, it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"but we can add a little bit more so, we could say NASA send a small machine called a what does anyone know what that what it's called that they sign.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"All right. So yeah, you're right. They did send a small machine, but just so everybody knows the small machine that NASA son was the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Yeah, so the lunar orbiter was small machine that was sent from NASA to help discover the craters on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,So there's actually two answers,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So if we look in the reading. We can even see that that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So that's another tool.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,And now we understand that we're going to need a Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"A small machine called the Lunar Orbiter, so that's that's so all you need to add is what other machines that they needed to use",,,,
Teacher,130.3,is actually called a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,And that's what actually finds the water,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"yeah if you just take another look maybe at the second paragraph, the first sentence says a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"They use the Lunar orbiter to discover the water and they do use the other equipment, but the Lunar orbiter purpose is to discover the water.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"when we look back at the reading it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter, and the Lunar orbiter looked in the craters to find the water.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"that's perfect that's the perfect question, that is what we're trying to find the answer to, and if you guys look back, you'll see that it says the Lunar lunar orbiter discovered the water.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So if you wanted to write as your answer that they use the Lunar orbiter and they use so many other machines for different things you could, and that would be right, but I think just saying the Lunar orbiter is perfectly fine too.",,,,
Luis,130.3,interesting.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,um so a lunar orbiter is a the actual answer to the prompt so that's the equipment that was found in the text that describes what was used to find water yes Jazmin,,,,
Teacher,130.3,but the name of the small machine was the Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"or microscopes when looking for the water. When you went to look for the water, to discover on the moon, the equipment used was the lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,So it's basically a microscope so they can see really deep in the picture. And then the name for it-- it's lunar orbiter. OK?,,,,
Chris,130.3,"Oh, I was just wondering because I've been to NASA with my dad, and we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff. So they didn't need that stuff.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"But they also bringing a huge machine that it's called lunar orbiter. And this is equipment that the scientists brought to the moon, it was like a microscope. Oliveron? I mean Oliver, sorry.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So that is just another specific way of looking to see in the text what's happening. So like you, Jazmin. You explained that they sent a small machine. But if we use the tool of rereading the text, we would have seen that there was a name for it, which is the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Jazmin,130.3,"Oh Yeah. OK, I see that one right there. Yeah, OK, I see that.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,It's a Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,But they are tools that you use to help you acclimate to the moon in the gravity.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"And you're absolutely right, the small machine is what they used to find the water on the moon it's called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Even though lunar orbiter is, which is what the scientists used to investigate the craters are could possibly have microscopes to give scientists, a closer look. What we want to actually",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Think of in our answer is the actual equipment that's being used, which is the Lunar Orbiter and that helps us if you look in the text, it looks for ice deposits in large craters.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Do you know what this is look into paragraph for the sentence after it says it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft it tells us why it would be good for us to have water on the moon, yes Luis?",,,,
Luis,130.3,So yeah.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So what I thought would be the answer I was answering it would be the Lunar orbiter and they use the microscope to actually find the water, so I thought it would be both",,,,
Farrah,130.3,okay okay so we're both right,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"And they can drink the water right oh yeah and they can drink the water yeah awesome,",,,,
Teacher,130.3,There's two different equipment that they use to see the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,So first they found it with a lunar orbiter right?,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Now they're now after they found it, what are they going to use to see the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"that's Okay, so in the reading it referenced i'm the small machine it's called a moon lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Jazmin,130.3,"yeah Okay, I see that right there.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"You know, we can be concise and still state the machine that they sent up to the moon was the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,NASA sent a small machine next time you can write NASA send a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to the moon instead.,,,,
Jazmin,130.3,I have to write more words?,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"and on paragraph two, you can look closely and see it was like a lunar orbiter that was used to investigate and find the water,",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"so when you're answering you could say in paragraph two, I saw that I found a lunar lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,No.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Right, so now that we know a lunar orbiter is what we use to discover water on the moon, how can we re re answer this question?",,,,
Oliver,130.3,Can I just say it like how you said? A lunar orbiter was used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,we're using the microscopic part to prove that we need a lunar orbiter.,,,,
Jazmin,130.3,"Oh OK OK, I understand okay.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,So a microscope is a piece of equipment. But it's just not the type of equipment that they used to find the water.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Right, there were two. So a good full answer to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon would be scientists used the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon and a microscope to be able to see the microscopic amounts of water. Yes, Chris?",,,,
Chris,130.3,I just wanted to say that I went to NASA. So I also know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Our question said, what did they use to discover water? So oxygen tanks and their suits, that wouldn't be part of that answer. But they are pieces of equipment that astronauts absolutely would have to use.",,,,
Chris,130.3,"Yeah, OK.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So astronauts would be able to use the water if it was broken down for oxygen and hydrogen to fuel the rockets, oxygen to breathe, obviously the water to drink.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"it says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and that is the specific machine they use to discover the water.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,Mm hmm. Exactly. They use all that equipment to to just be able to be on the moon in general. So that was helpful for them to be able to be there. And then the lunar orbiter was something that they specifically used to Discover that water.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,The lunar orbiter is what they use to get through that hard exterior to find the water,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Right. Mm hmm. So that's all you would have to add to your answers, just that you can have more of its supply to you so they can drink it. Awesome.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Teacher : Um, but it's a small machine that's called Old Lunar Orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,But we also need Jazmin's part of the answer that. How did they even get the water down here. They needed that a lunar orbiter to see it.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,That's right. That's right. So we're going to begin by step one mentioning the Lunar Orbiter and step two would be mentioning the microscope yes Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Well actually it's it's time for us to go right now, but I wanted to say thank you for reminding us that we have to go back and read the whole thing to make sure that we didn't just pick part of the answer, but we actually find the whole answer.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So even though this astronauts went up there. Look, examining the water molecules, the lunar orbiter is what found them.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,You just needed a little bit more so in addition to using a microscope. They also use the machine called the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Oh, OK. So it's both.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Yeah, so I see I'm looking at the text to and I in our texts that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"But with this specific question the answer that. is correct, is, is the Lunar Orbiter. That was the specific source of equipment that was used to determine that there was water.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,The right answer is the lunar orbiter because it is what NASA sent on to investigate the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,It the lunar orbiter is the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,But I just wanted to go over that specific question with all of you today so that you can realize that the equipment that they use to discover though that water was the Lunar Orbiter. So that should have been the answer that we wrote down,,,,
Teacher,130.3,The lunar orbiter is what was used to investigate into find that water and know it gets a little confusing.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,The correct answer is a lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,But the first the first equipment that they sent discovered is water was the lunar arbiter,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Yeah, they have to use like the first step to discover water was it the this mall machine. The Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,But the thing that we're really looking forward to the Lunar Orbiter. Okay.,,,,
Oliver,130.3,"Okay. Um, can I try again. Can I do another answer.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,awesome Thank you so much so that kind of shows you that the machine that they were using is called the Lunar orbiter kind of describes what it does.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,you know because they probably couldn't have done it just with the Lunar orbiter so they needed the microscope as well.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Yeah, yeah so there's two, so I think it could be seen, like the Lunar orbiter went first and did the big picture work to see if there was water and then the microscope came in afterward and did the more smaller picture.",,,,
Farrah,130.3,I still don't understand why my answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"and the Lunar orbiter could be seen as the bigger picture, so the Lunar orbiter they're both the pieces of equipment that the scientists use to look for water.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,so that's why you know the Lunar orbiter and the microscope were kind of the more accurate answer to the question,,,,
Teacher,130.3,We actually do have water and craters here on earth,,,,
Teacher,130.3,they put the microsope,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"it's not the machine but the microscope, they use to find a water.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,And then one of them is a microscope to look at it closely to find a water.,,,,
Chris,130.3,"Right yeah because you said, well, that the craters you said they're not full of water, like, I thought right because the water is so small.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Okay um that's good they found the water, but how much I don't think we they didn't find it full a lot of water.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Yes, yeah it's true when you go swimming you go, you have to go through in the deep water, so that you know you have fun, but what they don't they they found in deep location in the moon not  in the deep water they went to the",,,,
Chris,130.3,okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Oh yeah but I don't think they This time they sended those kinda equipment equipment, because on the moon, they just um yeah they use those kind of equipment in time to time for different for different researches, but not this time I don't think",,,,
Chris,130.3,Well they need them to breathe on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"yeah scientists found the evidence, but scientists found the evidence, but it doesn't mean that science went there to find it the machine could be sended there and  then found the thing right.",,,,
Chris,130.3,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"They went sent the machine to put the moon and , then they found some water right, yes, Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,130.3,um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter that way I know all I need to know.,,,,
Jazmin,130.3,"Oh, wow, ok.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,Because you need the small machine to find the water and then you need the microscope to study the water.,,,,
Farrah,130.3,Oh OK OK.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,yeah so that will be the answer.,,,,
Jazmin,130.3,Oh so just have to add the name in there too.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,Exactly awesome the reason why the answer is not a microscope because they actually water that they found they actually use the machine to find actually find a machine they use a lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,so the answer was actually lunar orbiter from a pay a paragraph two.,,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Oh, but, but I did I had all the keywords I had equipment discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,uh huh the machine that we use to find water and the moon is called a lunar orbiter that's why I think I eat mixed up and pay and paragraph two and three.,,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Although they also do say microscope in the lessons and the last sentence of paragraph three, how come that's not the equipment.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"the scientists in this paragraph, according to the text, they use a lunar orbiter from according to paragraph two that's a small machine and that's called lunar orbiter to find water under surface.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So the lunar orbiter was a piece of equipment that scientist us to discover water on the moon hands up, if you agree with.",,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Oh well, I had a different piece of equipment, I said the microscope and.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"so they first use the Lunar orbiter like we talked about, and they also use the microscope to see the tiny particles of water.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"If if they had it already, but in terms of actually finding it the first time, I think that might go back to that lunar orbiter idea,",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"But the article, at least to me wasn't entirely clear which made me think the best answer would be probably the Lunar the Lunar orbiter because oh hang on just a second Oliver I wanted to talk about Luis's note Luis's answer on the oxygen tanks. Totally right",,,,
Oliver,130.3,"Teacher and I don't mean to interrupt you, but it's time for us to go to lunch.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"The lunar orbiter was the equipment that did the discovery, can you see that now, and the response.",,,,
Farrah,130.3,"um okay so yeah it said that the orbiter looks for the deposits, but the microscope you need to look at the deposits.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,they sent up a satellite with this orbiter that orbits the moon to analyze that hydrogen that they had found right,,,,
Teacher,130.3,they have a satellite go up right to do all of this.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,To investigate right.,,,,
Farrah,130.3,yeah I saw that one.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Investigators is the same thing as discover right,",,,,
Teacher,130.3,The lunar orbiter right.,,,,
Chris,130.3,yeah that wasn't the story.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,about the microscope both of those two tools together would be exactly what they used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Because they sure did, however, the scientist needed a tool to help them and it's a small machine discussed in paragraph two of the text okay",,,,
Teacher,130.3,fully answer the question right so um what I was really looking for here was the name of the machine was the Lunar orbiter on to investigate the water yeah Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,130.3,Well um I I guess the Lunar orbiter is the right answer but I don't really understand why because.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"yeah but um I if we're looking at this question in particular right, we do need to focus on  that the lunar orbiter helped them to investigate where the water was.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Well, I think you're right that they did use a small machine but they're also giving us this specific vocabulary, that the machine is called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,they sent a specific one called the lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"The surface of the moon is not like the pool it's maybe more like the soil or a farmland, so when you buried the water deep under under the surface it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a huge amount of water.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"you're absolutely right that there's water on the moon inside of the craters, but if you look closely in the text you could see that um these are very small pieces of water, instead of full of water,",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"so the craters are not full of water, they contains water yeah.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"um it's true that create crater is a big, but the water molecules they found is microscopic",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"so basicallyNASA sent this small piece of machine called lunar orbiter to find the water, so the part of finding the water is actually quite important to the to the text.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,So for you to,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Well, it could be, both because you need the Lunar orbiter to investigate",,,,
Farrah,130.3,"Oh well, the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Not for this one only because it's about the equipment they used to discover the water they would use that equipment and other scenarios, but this time it was just the mission and the microscope that we were looking for.",,,,
Chris,130.3,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,So you just had what they found um so the equipment would be that small machine the Lunar orbiter and then the microscope to look at it more closely Oliver.,,,,
Oliver,130.3,"On I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"Exactly, and they were like the small ice deposits in the large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,That was just something that was on the moon.,,,,
Jazmin,130.3,Oh okay.,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"So now, you know, two machines that they used in that they mentioned in the article.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"into your own little you put your little twist on it, which was good, but it does say in the text that you can use the water so would be valuable",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"No, so the final conclusion is that water is valuable right because it'll help with the fuel for the spacecraft and also help them make room in",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"I think, in this specific context and just finding the water at this time, they think the Lunar orbiter is what the main equipped piece of equipment that they use so that's a good that's a good point as well.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"yeah yeah definitely on the right track, hoping to get it to measure it but helping us find it it's the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,"There we go yeah good job, so the small machine on that you actually mentioned it's called a lunar orbit.",,,,
Jazmin,130.3,And so I just had to say lunar orbiter?,,,,
Teacher,130.3,"And um I also noticed, you know Chris like how you said that they find the crater so understanding that the Lunar orbiter is what we use to find.",,,,
Teacher,130.3,That is the tool that we use the Lunar orbiter not a microscope,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"If you guys can come up with a name that you want me to call you in the collective so I don't like to say boys and girls and I don't like to say you guys, so do is it a school mascot do you want to be the JET eyes the eagles the ketchup packets, what can I call you as a group.",,,,
Farrah,140.1,"Okay, how about how about.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oh, that is so awesome. Has he told you about these kind of thing.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"Yeah, he, he talks about it all the time. And like, that's how come I know so much about space.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Okay. When you deposit something, how much do, what do you deposit? Do you have a deposit a really large piece of something or smaller pieces?",,,,
Farrah,140.1,"Um, well, I go to the bank with my mom sometimes, and she'll deposit her paycheck, but I don't know if it's like a lot of money or like a small amount of money.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Well, when you think of a paycheck every week that would be a smaller amount for what you would make for the entire month. Does that make sense?",,,,
Farrah,140.1,"Um, I guess so. But I don't I still don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Farrah,140.1,But I'm just wanting you to look at it and different views. So in one week that might be a lot of money. But when you look at it over a whole month that's only a partial of the money.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,Yeah. So have you all  you seen frost in the wintertime or in the fall?,,,,
Teacher,140.1,Have you seen on your mom's car windows or the grass?,,,,
Luis,140.1,"Um, um, yeah, like on a car.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"What, what is he doing when he's investigating crimes. Does he does, he just leave them unsolved at the end.",,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"No no, he goes around and he looks for clues and then he talks to people. Um, yeah, to kind of find it out.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Could you tell me some equipment that they took up there that they used in general, while they were in space?",,,,
Luis,140.1,"Oh, yeah, I know a lot about that equipment.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Have you ever seen something through a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Yes, what thing that you see.",,,,
Farrah,140.1,We plant cells in science class.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"That's really good. Well, it sounds exciting. Did you enjoy yourself and NASA?",,,,
Chris,140.1,"Yeah, oh yeah, me and my dad we when we saw like all of these different space shuttles and all of these like different astronauts suits. It was the coolest ever",,,,
Teacher,140.1,OK. That is a lot of good information. Does anybody else have anything to say about that? Any input on what you think about space?,,,,
Chris,140.1,"Yes, yes. My dad, me and my dad went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment, like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to--",,,,
Teacher,140.1,OK. Why would-- why do you think that they would need the oxygen tanks?,,,,
Chris,140.1,Because they can't breathe. The atmosphere on the space shuttle and on the moon isn't the same as the atmosphere here.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,How about Jazmin? Can you tell me something that you know about space that can also add in with what Chris and Luis is telling us?,,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"Well, I don't know a lot about space, but I know that our environment is really bad. And so we might have to live on Mars or something if they keep destroying our Earth.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"That is a good point. Because if our atmosphere, which is the air that we breathe, which is in the oxygen tanks that we are talking about going into space, if that is messed up, then we won't have any air here on Earth, so we would have to look for some other place to possibly live. How about you, Oliver? Do you have anything to input?",,,,
Oliver,140.1,"I'm not really into space, so--",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"OK. Well, that's OK. A lot of people aren't into space. Some people are more into the environment, like Jazmin was talking about. Some people are into the oceans and stuff, which is very interesting too to learn about. How about you, Farrah? Do you have any input to go with the group?",,,,
Farrah,140.1,"Well, I read-- I read this book, A Wrinkle in Time, which is about going to different universes. So they didn't go into space, but they traveled through space and time.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,OK. Is that what you would consider a fiction or a nonfiction story?,,,,
Farrah,140.1,LAUGHS,,,,
Farrah,140.1,"That is pretty cool fiction. But if you look back in the older books from the past, a lot of stuff has come out that people thought was just science fiction and would not happen, and with science, we have brought it about. We are able to do a lot of things. Like back in the 1930s-- is that a long time ago?",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oh, LAUGHS",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Yes, they didn't have phones back then, the cell phones, like this. They didn't have anything like that. They had to wind on the wall.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,GASPS,,,,
Teacher,140.1,And there was cartoons and books about phones.,,,,
Farrah,140.1,Really?,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"And people thought that was just going to be-- that was science fiction, and that was not realistic. But do we have it today?",,,,
Chris,140.1,"Oh wow, yes. Yes, we've got lots of phones.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Right, right. And it used to be science fiction that we would be able to go into space, which is what we've been studying about is space and going to the moon and being able to do all these different explorations. Like have you seen the latest results and stuff from Titan, the moon on Saturn?",,,,
Chris,140.1,"Oh, man. No, no. When me and my dad went to NASA, we saw about that the whole controversy about when Pluto was a planet, and then it wasn't a planet, and then it was a planet, but I didn't know anything about Saturn.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Yes. Saturn has a lot of moons that are floating around it. And there's actually a moon that's called Titan. And they think that they may have found life on it.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,GASPS,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Well, they're microscopic aliens that live in the very, very cold, because it's really, really cold on the moon. On that moon, it's like 200 below zero. So it's really cold there. But they think that with their equipment, like what they had on the moon that was-- that they used to find the water on the moon, they think that they found some lifeforms that may have existed on Titan.",,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"Huh. Oh, wow. That's pretty cool.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Yes. That's pretty good stuff. What do you think about that, AUDIO OUT]? You know, there and outer space and stuff. Yes.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"No. I didn't know anything about the Saturn stuff and the moons and, like, teeny-weeny aliens. That's like, wow. I mean, that is pretty cool stuff. I didn't know that.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Yes. Yes, and we'll go into more of that as we study on about outer space and the different equipment that they're using, with the rockets and the satellites and stuff that they're using out there.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"OK, cool.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"OK? Do you have anything else? Do you have any interest in that, Oliver, about the aliens on the moon of Saturn?",,,,
Oliver,140.1,"I mean, I think aliens are kind of cool. So yes, I'd be down to learn about that.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Your answer wasn't wrong. You were talking about the atmosphere, which that is something that we are exploring in space to find different atmospheres that would hold life from Earth. Which that is very good that you said.",,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"No, I meant on the story. My teacher said that we all had to come and work with you in a small group, because we needed more help with our answers. But I told her that I think that I have the right answer.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,They would have to make a-- what would they need in order to be able to do a really good garden on the moon?,,,,
Jazmin,140.1,I guess they'd have to bring the plants with them to plant on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"So they would have to bring in an artificial greenhouse or something like that, possibly, maybe.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,How did everybody like the reading.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,You like the martian?,,,,
Jazmin,140.1,I like that movie.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Yeah, it's a good movie.",,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"Um, okay. So I can say I should ask and drink the water. You can't survive without water, having water on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft, water is heavy.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,So where did they find the water?,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"In polar crater. So what does that mean, is it around the earth or is it the top and the bottom",,,,
Oliver,140.1,"Um, it's at the top and the bottom",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Well science videos, my family. We love to watch science videos and documentaries and those are great places to learn",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"And it's a great place to learn more about what we're talking about,",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Kind of how I think about it. Um like a refrigerator,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"If somebody asked you what keeps your food cold use that you would say like the refrigerator, you wouldn't say the plug that plugs into the outlet that supplies the power",,,,
Chris,140.1,"Okay, okay, I think.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Well, fun fact, when I was in first grade. I wanted to be an astronaut. So obviously I didn't live up to that. But, you know, that was my goal.",,,,
Chris,140.1,You're a really good teacher.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Did you go to the one in Texas or Florida? Did you go to the John F. Kennedy center, or--",,,,
Chris,140.1,The John F. Kennedy center.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oh, so I think that's the one named after president Kennedy. Was it fun?",,,,
Chris,140.1,"It was a lot of fun. We got to see a lot of space shuttles, and astronaut, space chutes, and all of the different ways that they can breathe upon in space.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Is a while you're looking at it. I'm gonna go back to Luis because I'm pretty excited that his dad is a astronauts.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,but does that mean you know everything about what scientists using in space? How does an oxygen tank work?,,,,
Luis,140.1,"Okay, because there isn't any gravity. I mean there isn't gravity in space, but they're also isn't any oxygen and trees and carbon dioxide. So the site, so the astronauts have to wear these oxygen tanks in order to breathe when they're up in space, so they have, they have a whole a whole space suit.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Has anyone ever use a microscope before?,,,,
Teacher,140.1,So what are some thoughts that you've had on the text prior to answering any of the questions?,,,,
Luis,140.1,"Um, so I just wanted to say. Um, I already kind of know like all about space and like I kind of like know like all this stuff. So I don't think I need to be in this group.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,To the next time. Invite me.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"How do you convince people that you're the best at Minecraft. What do you say,",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Well, you actually show them by beating them in the game. Right. So you're using actions, instead of words to convince them.",,,,
Luis,140.1,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,Do you know the name of the facility that your dad works at,,,,
Luis,140.1,"I yeah he works at that that's Dennis Space Center. I'm in Mississippi, and he kind of like commute, so we don't get to see him as often as you know we like.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Well that's that's unfortunate, but does he, uh, are you able to speak to him on a regular basis, perhaps, or some online activity or is hearing stories.",,,,
Luis,140.1,Yeah yeah we talk on Skype all the time.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"All right, because we're looking at what equipment is just like today, sitting in front of you, okay. You're sitting there were at school.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Now we're not scientist and we're not astronauts and there's some things that we do know. But right now, you every one of your student at school, right. So what's an equipment you have right now. Thats helping you with your work, Chris.",,,,
Chris,140.1,"Oh. Oh. Well that's a good question. But I was gonna say first, just real quick because I went to NASA.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,And I'm glad you brought that up too about NASA because you know what today when we're learning you're having to use the tablets.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"You may have a pencil in front of you, but things are changing. Now, just like when they did their research.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,So did you enjoy reading the passage,,,,
Farrah,140.1,"You know, I think we did",,,,
Teacher,140.1,I want each one of you to get a little piece of paper. I don't want you to write down what all you know about space. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Alright, so let's go over. I want you to share with a partner, but I'm gonna have the first group, we're going to let Farrah, Oliver and Chris, you get, you three work together and let Jazmin and Luis work and share what you know about space. Okay, with each other, quietly okay so y'all can turn to each other and show each other what you know about space.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Okay, what's something that we use today or you've ever used if we want to look at something very close. It's really small, what's something that we could use",,,,
Farrah,140.1,Um like different than a microscope?,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Yeah, like a magnifying glass. How many of you have ever seen a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"All right, so Chris. Where did you see a microscope at",,,,
Chris,140.1,"Um, so, I saw a microscope, like in science class. Um like, I've seen it in a couple places, but I think we've all seen it in science class. And also we've like, you know, we've seen it in movies and stuff like that.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Oh you already know a lot about space. Good. What do you want me to tell me about space Luis?,,,,
Luis,140.1,"Um, well, there's like, I know all about like rocket launches and I know about like you have to where spacesuits and oxygen tanks and like you know like I know that like space is a vacuum. Like, all that kind of stuff.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"You are correct. I went to NASA as well. When I was younger, two different times and they use all kinds of really cool equipment.",,,,
Chris,140.1,"Yeah, it's really cool there. I had a great time with my dad.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,I had a great time there as well.,,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"OK, I see it says that NASA scientists small machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"The question asked about the equipment, but the article is talking about how the moon is like a desert. Did you see anything about the moon being like a desert when you were with your dad.",,,,
Chris,140.1,I'm not really like that wasn't really what was in the exhibit that was that was from like reading. I didn't know that before today.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oh, well, that's great. It seems like you learned something today. Did anyone else know that the moon is like a desert.",,,,
Oliver,140.1,"Um, yeah, I sort of knew",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Isn't. Tell me what you know about space.,,,,
Luis,140.1,"Oh man, I know all sorts of stuff. I know that space is like like huge and like unimaginably huge and like it has stars and like when you go into space. It's a vacuum. So you have to use oxygen tanks at masks and I know that like",,,,
Teacher,140.1,There's all this interesting stuff with like gravity and all those others.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Like a, I don't know if it's necessarily possible. But if you read it. That's super cool. Where do you read it up.",,,,
Chris,140.1,"Oh, some some article in a magazine.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Possibly. So I mean, at this point in time and this year. Anything could happen. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if next year, they did something crazy with everything happening. Yes.",,,,
Farrah,140.1,So I just would surely we have to go to lunch.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,A tool. So give me some examples of tools. Debbie had your hand raised. Can you give me an example of a tool.,,,,
Oliver,140.1,"Yeah, so, um, one on are playing a video game when I use my Xbox controller and that's equipment about are you so that's like a tool.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Yeah, absolutely. That's absolutely right. Is there anybody else that wanted to share a tool.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"Okay, well,",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"They wouldn't get stranded. You are right, think about like a gas station. So if you drive very far. And you need to fill up on a gas station at a gas station. What does it allow you to do if you have a way to fill up your car halfway through a trip.",,,,
Chris,140.1,We wouldn't run out of gas.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"You won't run out of gas. And it lets you like you're not gonna if we're going to the beach and we run out of gas halfway and there's a gas station. We're not gonna turn back around, right.",,,,
Jazmin,140.1,No. We'll just get more gas.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,We'll just get more gas and keep going.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,Do you?,,,,
Luis,140.1,Mhmm.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"I know at least growing up I was not always the most confident when I came to answering questions, even if I knew you know I knew the answer. Easy, two plus two is four, maybe I actually wouldn't",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Answer out of fear of ridicule from my friends or even the teacher.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,So like an ant.,,,,
Farrah,140.1,"Yeah, yeah, just like an aunt or something like that.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Can I look at something that's smaller than and because I didn't see an am with my eyes.,,,,
Farrah,140.1,"I'm walking. Yeah. Yeah. Like in science class, we look at like these little bitty. Um, oh, I don't remember the names of it, but we look at things that are like little bitty teeny, teeny thing.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oh, like organisms.",,,,
Oliver,140.1,"Yeah, like an amoeba also have an hour with a cold amoeba.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oh, who knows what the periodic element is for oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"So on the periodic element table there is owed to that stands for oxygen, water is H two O Mr Oliveron.",,,,
Oliver,140.1,"Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt you, Miss I burnt. I think I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch. So thanks for working with us.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Okay, so where we left off. We were talking about the elements and water in the element periodic table is H2O",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Yes. Yes, you do. Do you know anywhere else that they might use a microscope.",,,,
Farrah,140.1,"Like, well we use it in like science class",,,,
Teacher,140.1,what are the oxygen tanks usually designed for? Anybody know?,,,,
Teacher,140.1,Do you know what they use oxygen for them suits that your classmates might not.,,,,
Chris,140.1,"Oh yeah, So they use on a breathe because, while the oxygen tanks are to breathe because there isn't any oxygen up there in space and then the suits because it's so cool that if if the air touch their skins, they would they would freeze to death and then shattered pieces.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"that's really cool fact Chris, where did you read that.",,,,
Chris,140.1,"me and my dad had been reading this book about aviation and then we went to NASA so there was this whole exhibit about the traveling to the moon, and then what their plans are in the future.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Okay, what about equipment that's not talked about in the text,",,,,
Teacher,140.1,How did they get to the moon.,,,,
Chris,140.1,I do know that I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Awesome. Well, since you've gone there. Um, could you think of like two things that that you saw there.",,,,
Chris,140.1,"Oh yeah, absolutely. So I saw that they use like these are core to keep them like attached to the ship. If they had to do, like, you know what I mean, like a spot.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Yeah, I think I saw something with eggs or something. I am I am I have been for the military or they both might use it but I saw something like that. That that's really cool. That's really cool. Yeah.",,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Does everybody here have any any knowledge on space or is it just a couple of you.,,,,
Farrah,140.1,It's just a few of us.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Is there anymore knowledge you guys have. Yes, Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,140.1,"Um, so, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just really wanted to thank you for working with us, and in particular.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,You went to NASA? Really?,,,,
Chris,140.1,"Yeah, with my dad. I went to NASA. So I do know that scientists use a lot of equipment like",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Yeah, has anyone else seen anything from NASA, you can reach",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"so Luis has as well. Yeah, yeah.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"Well, I didn't go to NASA, but I did, um, I've seen that in box. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,would anyone ever want to go to space.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,And experience this.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Farrah. What about you, would you want to or would you not",,,,
Farrah,140.1,"Oh yeah, definitely.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,The water is hiding in the craters.,,,,
Chris,140.1,So they're full of water at the bottom?,,,,
Chris,140.1,yeah yeah,,,,
Teacher,140.1,Maybe maybe we'll have to read about that next time.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,So you like to read,,,,
Luis,140.1,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"That's, I love that answer. Do you like to garden yourself Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"Yes, I love to garden and I love to be in nature.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,You know all about space really where did you learn about space. Was it from a book or do you get to go to a museum.,,,,
Luis,140.1,"Oh well, I like to watch a lot of videos like on YouTube. So I look at a lot of stuff on the internet like videos and learning about astronauts and watching launches of rocket. Oh, it's so cool.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Person. You are so passionate about space. Do you want to be an astronaut when you're older.,,,,
Chris,140.1,That would be pretty cool. Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Good afternoon, everyone. How is everyone doing please raise your hand.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oh, thank you, Oliver. Would anybody else like to tell us about their day before we move forward. Luis",,,,
Luis,140.1,"Yeah, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,That's pretty amazing. Luis I wonder if your dad has ever seen the lunar escape or the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Okay, well, maybe, I don't know. So can you tell me what what do you know about space.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"I would love to go, I wonder, I hope that they're selling tickets soon to the moon base",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oliver. Go ahead. I like that shirt I have the same shirt. Actually, that's a really cool shirt.",,,,
Oliver,140.1,Thank you.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"I agree. I think we all see the moon as something far away and we hear certain things about it and we see pictures, you know, the big round objects with the craters.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,But we never think about how it would be to actually exist. There are walk around on the moon. So I agree with you. I think that's a really cool thing.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Were you surprised Farrah, that the scientists found water on the moon.",,,,
Farrah,140.1,"Yeah, I never thought there would be water on the moon. I thought it was just, I don't know, dry up there.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"how about you, Oliver. Were you surprised.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Yeah, me either. I think that's what the scientists thought too.",,,,
Oliver,140.1,"Oh well, I don't think I never really thought about that before, like maybe there is water on the moon, maybe around the moon. I wasn't really, I never really thought about it, I guess.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"How about you, Jazmin. Were you surprised.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Yeah, so those are this article made you think about something new. That's it. That's a really good reason to be reading current news.",,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"Yes, I would say I would say I was surprised.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"How about you, Chris.",,,,
Chris,140.1,"Oh well, I actually went to NASA and well I didn't know there was water on the moon, but I thought it was really cool.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Yeah. Me too. Me too. I thought this was great. I really liked space and I like seeing the moon way up there at night. So the fact that there's water on it is really intriguing for me.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"So, you know, there's a there was a lot of information in this article wasn't there. Luis or someone who's experienced about space, wasn't there a lot of information about in the article.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"Yeah, yeah. There was stuff in there.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"So Luis did you did you like reading over this paragraph, or you know, did you find it interesting or any thoughts.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"yeah I thought it was a really interesting because I didn't actually know that there was water on the moon, before I read this and I thought it was so cool how they sent that lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,yeah and Jazmin like was this the spark any interest in you or yes.,,,,
Oliver,140.1,"i'm i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us see both the big picture and the sort of specifics of the equipment um That was a really helpful way, to put it Thank you so much.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"that's more of like I know you mean i've been in i've been in like a crater like swimming as well, but that's different than on.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"awesome thanks Luis okay so first briefly before we you know tackle your guys's responses, I wanted to know just by raise of hands, who would love to go to the moon someday.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Luis, why do you want to go to the moon.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"Oh man well what just be such a cool experience to feel like zero gravity up there, I can't wait, I really want to go to space camp, because you get to kind of try it out like almost before you get to be an astronaut, and I want to discover new planets and galaxies too.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Absolutely me too, so you know some of you didn't raise your hand, so why wouldn't you want to go to the moon, if anyone wants to share.",,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"Yes, I can share.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,so let's let's kind of unpack lunar orbiter for a minute for a minute there does anyone have by chance in this group speak Spanish by raise of hands anyone.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Each okay well um you know the word for what is the word for moon in French, do you know.",,,,
Farrah,140.1,it's something we can like lune,,,,
Teacher,140.1,yeah so in Spanish it's Luna.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Yes, that is you're absolutely right and and why Chris, do we need oxygen if we're going to be in space or on the moon, for that matter.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Do you know anything that's super fun about space what's your favorite space fact.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,yeah Luis Do you know anything else about the moon.,,,,
Luis,140.1,"um not Really, about the moon, no.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"What about anybody else does anybody else in our group know anything specific about the moon, that we didn't read in our activity.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,No way Chris that's so cool would you guys like to go to the moon.,,,,
Chris,140.1,yeah yeah.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Alright, so first I was wondering what did everyone think about the passage that we read about water on the moon Is anyone have any thoughts or any ideas about what they read let's see Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,140.1,"Well um I just found it surprising that there was water on the moon, I never thought about that, before, so I was very surprised.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"that's amazing I really hope that you can Maybe you can be an astronaut, one day, and actually get to go on the moon, that would be amazing to know that what am I students got to visit the moon, that would be incredible.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,what's your favorite thing about space Luis.,,,,
Luis,140.1,"Oh, my oh wow oh that's really hard um I think my favorite thing about space as how um Pluto used to be a planet and then they said it was a dwarf planet.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Would any of you guys be excited to live on the moon, if you could?",,,,
Jazmin,140.1,I mean i'd like to live on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oliver, what do you think? Would you want to live on the moon?",,,,
Oliver,140.1,"um yeah I mean that'd be pretty cool you know, and then I could just kind of look down at earth and I can be like hey everybody down there i'm just chilling up here, even though they probably couldn't hear me but it's a pretty cool thing to do.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oh, what kind of stuff did you see.",,,,
Oliver,140.1,"Oh, all sorts of things lots of teeny tiny little brains and everything was so much smaller than I thought it was.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Since you went there and did it make you want to join NASA and go to the moon.,,,,
Chris,140.1,"yeah Oh, it was so cool I would love to put on that space suit and grab my microscope and look at the little pieces of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Right and how do you think you could you were just talking about life on the moon, and maybe how we need to do more on earth to protect our planet, do you think you could work that into your answer.",,,,
Oliver,140.1,"On i'm so sorry to interrupt, but I just looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch, right now, but I wanted to say.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oh, what do you know about space.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"Okay, I know that astronauts use space suits so that they don't like freeze to death in space, and I know that there's no gravity up there, so if they're walking around they have to wear like gravity boots so that they can walk on the moon, and a bunch of other stuff too.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Jazmin could you tell me a little bit about the atmosphere.,,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"um okay I don't know exactly, but I think that the moon doesn't have like an atmosphere that you know, like.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Well what's something that you could bring with you to the moon, so that you might not die?",,,,
Jazmin,140.1,You mean like spacesuits?,,,,
Teacher,140.1,How do you think you would do if you were on the moon?,,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"um well, I mean, I guess, I wouldn't die, but I wouldn't want to like you know, like live in a space suit, like all the time, that would be like really uncomfortable.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Before we begin, I have a question, do you speak Spanish.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Luis do you speak Spanish.,,,,
Luis,140.1,Well i'm a little bit I can try.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,Okay Jazmin do you speak Spanish.,,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"Yes, I do.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Great Jazmin can you teach us the Spanish word for moon.,,,,
Jazmin,140.1,and Spanish word for me is Luna.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,Oliver have you been to a really dry place could you tell us about that?,,,,
Teacher,140.1,Is space something you're interested in Luis?,,,,
Luis,140.1,Oh yeah oh big time I watch all these videos about space on YouTube and and I really want to go to space camp and go into the zero gravity Chamber oh yeah I really like space.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,and Luis one last thing what was Armstrong Neil Armstrong What did he say when he landed on the moon.,,,,
Luis,140.1,That that's one small step for man one giant leap for mankind.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Well that's fantastic, can you tell me something you know about space.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"yeah Okay, I know they just landed the MARS Rover.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Okay, have you ever used a microscope.",,,,
Farrah,140.1,in science.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"When you guys were reading this, how did it feel, did it feel really easy, kind of in the middle or really difficult to read.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Do you feel like this is a little bit easier to talk to each other, in a small group.",,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"Yes, yes.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"um, but I would have loved and maybe it's in a separate article, you know if they would have talked about kind of the space suits and the way that that they do provide I think they call it.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"But i've seen lots of videos where they use lots of different equipment, like the ones you described and they have to use like space suits and sometimes these satellites to see different things- it's very interesting.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"buttons and things to control things that are in space, because we can't be in space all the time, so they use them to control telescopes satellites like I said, to see what other things are going on yeah Chris do you have something to add?",,,,
Chris,140.1,"yeah well, I have a question sort of about the story so were there actually any astronauts on the moon looking for the water?",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Okay, I think it'll be really interesting because if you know a lot about space i'm sure you really like it, what is your favorite thing about space Luis.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"Okay, I love watching like the",,,,
Teacher,140.1,yeah that's really cool I I think it's really interesting also and such a cool advancement in technology so let's let's talk about the question that you guys responded to which was.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"that's that's really cool i've never been to NASA, but I think that would be a really fun trip What was your favorite part.",,,,
Chris,140.1,"it's amazing, you can see, all of these different space shuttles that have gone to into space for like the past 30 and 40 years.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Really so let's begin with you, then, what do you know about space.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"Okay, well, I know a lot about space, I know all about the different planets and I know stuff about uhm stars that Milky Way the sun kind of all the all the big ones.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Did you guys like the reading about the water on the moon, what did you think about it?",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Do you, what do you, what is your most what's your best fact that you have about space that you want to share with all of us?",,,,
Luis,140.1,"Oh well, my favorite um fact about space is that there used to be nine planets but then they kicked Pluto out of the planet club because he was too small.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,I know I kind of feel bad for Pluto don't you?,,,,
Luis,140.1,yeah me too.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Okay, great alright, so how about the rest of us, what was the most interesting part of the reading that you guys read?",,,,
Chris,140.1,"Oh, well I thought it was just amazing how the scientists found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Alright, do you think maybe one day we could live on the moon?",,,,
Jazmin,140.1,I don't know it's kind of amazing to think about.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,I know. Do any of you think you would like to one day live on the moon? What do you think?,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"i'm excited to work with you too i'm also excited that it's Friday and i'm excited that we're talking about space exploration, which used to be my favorite topic when I was your age yeah Luis.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"um yeah well I I shouldn't be in this room, because I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"You know the thing that stuck out at me when I think about space room, I remember when I was your age was thoses gold helmets you remember those.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"This is it really is one of my favorite topics, especially when I was your age",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"yeah that's great, in fact, those things, I think, if I remember right they were like 200 pounds or something, but you don't feel it when you're bouncing around on the moon right because the gravity is different.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oh does anybody know what is water, made up of what types of molecules of water, made up of anybody know.",,,,
Oliver,140.1,"Okay yeah I think we learned this, I think we learned this in science, because we learned that water as an H two O, and I know that all is oxygen and the h is hydrogen.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,um what are some jobs or what are some for some people that usually investigate that we know.,,,,
Jazmin,140.1,detectives.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,yeah that's a really good question so there's so much technology in the world that a lot of times we can go to places without actually physically being there right we've seen cameras and we've seen like.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Really Luis some what where else would you explore that's not outer space or maybe actually yeah let's say an outer space what's another planet, that you would explore if you had a really small machine that you could use.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"Oh well, okay um I want to look at Jupiter because it's so big and it has that red spot that's like a storm as giant giant hurricane, and I really want to look at that.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oh that's cool Farrah what about you Where would you go what planning, would you.",,,,
Farrah,140.1,"Well, actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch now.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,and hydrogen is part of h2o you heard people talk about h2o.,,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"Yes, yes, we have.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Okay, so they had they found that hmm there's there's some H two of those there's hydrogen up there, and maybe it's part of water h2o and that would be exciting right, because if there's water, you know that.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Right you all drink water every day right.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"So maybe in your site, yes, water is a big part of who you are okay.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,Know do you just like to read about this on your own.,,,,
Luis,140.1,"Well, I watch YouTube and I watched Nova sometime so yeah you know about equipment that scientists use of space.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"do you like like space, do you like to.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"no washing machine, but I mean I don't know how they wash their clothes, but that that would be a different different text right.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,So could you please tell us what do you know about space and why do you think it's interesting?,,,,
Luis,140.1,"Oh well, space is so cool because it's so mysterious like how big is the universe? we don't even know. We just know we have our planet and we have the Milky Way but the world could be the universe could be enormous and there could even be life out there.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,wow.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Do you think they would, how do you think data or no sorry Chris, how do you think that the NASA scientists could use the Lunar orbiter and the discovery of water as a starting point for building a base on the moon.",,,,
Chris,140.1,Well.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,yeah and how do you think that would lead to us being able to build a base on the moon.,,,,
Chris,140.1,"Well, or if there's water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"that's going to be possible, and what year was it 2024.",,,,
Chris,140.1,yeah yes three years away.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,Based on our reading.,,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"And since there's water on the moon, maybe because you use equipment like gardening equipment and they could make a moon garden, so that we could grow food.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,i'm Jazmin do you think that we'll be able to plant things on the mooon?,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oh yeah we might want, we might want to experiment with that Oliver what were you gonna say.",,,,
Oliver,140.1,"Well, I just locked up o'clock now and we have to go to lunch now.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"i'm not sure if you guys saw it from NASA where a woman was talking about how someday they hope to live for longer periods on the moon, and if.",,,,
Luis,140.1,I definitely want to live on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,I know wouldn't it be crazy and if they can discover water than they could turn that into things like oxygen for their oxygen tanks or.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,And I think they do use those special suits that's really cool did you see anything else there that you thought was interesting oh.,,,,
Chris,140.1,We got to see a lot of things like we got to see the whole space suit and I really wanted to try it on but.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"He did a space food look like it tasted good or does it look kind of disgusting, what do you think.",,,,
Chris,140.1,It looks pretty disgusting really.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Who can you tell me, one thing that you know about space.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"yeah okay i'll tell you three things first accidents have to wear spacesuits because it's really cold and they'll like freeze to death, second, they have to wear oxygen tanks, because you can't breathe them space and third there's no gravity there, so they got to wear gravity boots.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"This is all true. Luis knows this, correct.",,,,
Luis,140.1,yep yep oxygen tanks are my answer to that one Chris.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,jas Jazmin you're not so interested in going to the moon.,,,,
Jazmin,140.1,I would rather stay here on earth and focus on protecting the earth.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,I like that answer what How would you plan to protect the earth do you have ideas on that.,,,,
Jazmin,140.1,"yeah well, we need to plant more trees to save the forests and we need to protect our oceans, by not dumping trash and by making sure that we recycle.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Those are really beautiful ideas, thank you for sharing Jazmin. Farrah, why are you interested in going to the moon.",,,,
Farrah,140.1,"Oh well, i'm actually I was gonna say I looked at the clock on and it's it's time for us to go to lunch.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oh wow that's really interesting, are you really passionate about space.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"Oh yeah I lot of space and I really want to be an astronaut, when I grow up.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,That seems like it would be a very cool job well since you know so much about space and space exploration Maybe you can after we have our small group discussion tell us some interesting facts,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Oh wow did you get a chance to take any pictures, maybe you could bring them to class and show us one day.",,,,
Chris,140.1,"Oh yeah my dad took so many pictures, it was actually kind of embarrassing.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"I definitely feel you there my parents used to take a lot of pictures whenever we went anywhere, when I was a kid so I can definitely relate to that embarrassment.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,"yeah absolutely I agree with you, and you know what you just said Farrah made me think a little bit about like there's deposits of minerals and oil underneath the earth's surface and so.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,but you'd have to be a scientist to figure out how to do that Oliver.,,,,
Oliver,140.1,Oh yeah and i'm not a scientist i'm i'm just a student.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,well you could be.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"Fantastic, how do you get that knowledge or how do you know about space.",,,,
Luis,140.1,"Oh, I watch a lot of videos on YouTube and sometimes I read articles, like in magazines and I have this book with all these pictures of space Oh, I really like space.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,really like space i'm also big fan of space to.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,Do you remember a cool fact that they mentioned.,,,,
Chris,140.1,I think they said the really dark.,,,,
Teacher,140.1,"They they were Yes, that was mentioned it's where the sun never shines the.",,,,
Teacher,140.1,yeah isn't that cool.,,,,
Chris,140.1,it's so cool.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So we all as wild cats were talking about water on the moon right.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that sound okay.,,,,
Luis,150.1,yeah okay i'll i'll stick around.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Let me just stop pause for a minute and see if you guys have questions yeah Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Okay, well, so my question is, is it Okay, if I just say the microscope or do I have to less like all of the equipment, like the microscope and the orbiter and the oxygen tanks and masks and things.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"yeah so Luis we're learning about space, a little bit, but we're also practicing our good science thinking skills, so we can all learn more about our science thinking skills Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Absolutely absolutely so you guys, all I think should have an understanding of what this word equipment means.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does anybody have any questions about about what I mean when I say specific examples.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Oh, so it has to be from the story.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense to everybody does anybody have any clarifying questions that that they have yeah def.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Oh well, actually I I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense?,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"um yeah but I did that. Um the first part, the first sentence in paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Is anybody still unsure of what evidence means or is that something we all understand? raise your hand if you know what evidence is.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that make sense?,,,,
Chris,150.1,So I have to find the equipment in the story.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Hi. I'm Ms. [teacher name] and we're just going to be talking about your question today.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So, in this article we heard a lot of things about NASA and the moon as a desert and let's just talk about your answers.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So we have a lot of different answers.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So let's look back in our texts. And let's see if we had the best answer. Let's think about it.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Um, excuse me. Um, I shouldn't be ni this group. I already know all there is to know about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, well, we're just going to work on making sure we have the best answer for the question. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So did anybody talk about that? Let's see.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Well, um, I. It's me Jazmin. I said that they used a small machine that was my answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,You get it?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Oh, I don't understand why my answer is still wrong.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Now let's look at our question and let's remember what our questions said.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So do you understand how we could improve your answer?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So that makes sense?,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Um, I mean, I guess so. I guess.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Anybody have any questions about that question?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Um, well. I mean, I guess.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,That make sense?,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Okay. They use the Lunar Orbiter to um, they use the Lunar Orbiter to find the water and then I use the microscope to look at the water",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, so I have gathered you all here today because I'm concerned about each one of your answers to the question and you each talked about equipment or tools needed",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, so the next question is talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. And I brought you here together because I'm concerned about your answers.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,You ready?,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Okay, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,so and you guys had varying levels of understanding,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And which is a good thing, because we can help each other grow",,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Yeah, sure. Okay, so my answer was, you need a scientific tool calle a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All right. Um, Farrah and Oliver. Did you guys get a chance to finish reading, paragraph two, and revise your answer.",,,,
Farrah,150.1,"So we did look through paragraph two,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And I don't think you had. Did you have a chance to go back and read paragraph two,",,,,
Luis,150.1,Um no I didn't take a look yet.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Guess that's all that I have unless you have some questions. Yes, Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,I know I think that we all understand. And I think that we just wanted to share. So we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that makes sense?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"I mean, I guess so. Because I don't have a job and so like, so I don't really get, like, you know, for grownups and and how much money they have. Um",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make a little bit more sense?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Um, I mean, I guess. I mean, I guess, cuz you're you. You did tell me like I hear what you're saying. Like they sent I sent this Lunar Orbiter. Um, but what--",,,,
Teacher,150.1,You understand that.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"I'm thinking about. Okay, so what you're saying is that they sent the Lunar Orbiter and then they found the water and then they use the microscope to",,,,
Teacher,150.1,How Does everybody feel after you read that passage. Do you feel pretty good you feel a little confused.,,,,
,150.1,I feel like I had the right answer.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yes, sometimes we have to read this passage, maybe more than one time to really understand what it's saying to us right",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So can you look a little deeper and try to answer that question?,,,,
Luis,150.1,"I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"But can you look back in the reading and can you tell me It just the same way that you found out about the oxygen can you look back about the water and see what it says about that because I think if we use our brain just for a little bit and we read that reading, you're going to have all those same answers about the water too.",,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Whoa, okay. So finding a finding and discovering are really similar words and I totally understand why we could get confused with them. So, that's okay. Chris, it's totally okay when you just-",,,,
Chris,150.1,"I mean, I know stuff about speaks to like Luis I went to NASA. So I know that our scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks in suits, but I just don't know which equipment they use to, to, to find the water or, I guess, discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Jazmin. Do you know what that means.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"I watch sometimes umthis cartoon with a police dog, and he's always investigating crimes.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,What is the question asking us for please raise your hand if you think you know what the question is asking us,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,Orbiter,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"That's right. What that word that starts with an o, lunar what?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,What does this small machine do and they go up on the moon?,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Excuse me, maam.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,There's always things you can learn,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Um, oh, I guess, okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,You guys see that?,,,,
Luis,150.1,I'm sorry. I looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I'm good. So I brought you all back here into a small group because, um, I want to talk with you guys about your answers that you guys put For question number one. Yes. Luis",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already corrected my answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yeah, I want you guys to just look at the question",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And I want you to keep that in your mind. Just a minute. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yeah, I'm not sure. It's just that I didn't say enough?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Very good. So I had you read paragraph number two, because it's really where our answer is.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So, let's look. Let's start at the top, then let's start at the very top, the moon is a desert right?",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Excuse me, but I still don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Very good. So what did we, what did we look at and very closely.",,,,
Oliver,150.1,"I'm, I'm, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to a lunch. I know it was really really short. And we just met, but I really appreciate how you really took the time to like listen to all of us and really try to help us take our time to find the answer, right everybody?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Hi, everybody. Thank you so much for your responses taking your time and reading the text and rotten a response. Yes. Luis",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Um, yeah, so I I think I need to be in this group, because I know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Let's look at that. Did you have questions. Let's see.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Um, so I said that scientists found craters full of water.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Hey guys, thanks so much for reading that text and responding rotten those responses for me. Yes. Luis",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Um, yeah. So I've kind of already like, I know all about space. So I don't think I really even the be in this group.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, awesome. So let's take a quick look at our responses.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,I think you may still be confused Farrah. Right.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Mm hmm. Okay, but there is always something more than we can learn",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, but I think that we always can learn something.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So let's talk about your answers you already read the article. The moon and we are going to share our answers.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"In fact, you kind of took a took some some liberties that were there. So we have to think, um, why might that not be hitting right where we needed to",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And you, like I said, you hit a very important part of the article. But we got to make sure when we're answering these questions, we really read and we really try to figure out what does this question want from me?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So you kind of see where we went wrong?,,,,
h,150.1,"Um, yeah, you said that I was right on when I was talking about the water, but I didn't talk about the equipment. Right.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Thank you for your help. Today, Luis, and hopefully we all can grow and learn a little bit from what we're going to be doing today.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Thank you. So that's good. That's an area we can improve. And like I said, I appreciate your analysis there so Chris. What was the Oh, pardon me, Chris, Farrah. Yes, question.",,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Yeah, I still don't understand why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And you think you've got it out. So there were some room for,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Guys, you know, I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So hey guys reason I brought you together is I was looking at your answers these questions on this text, we just read and I just wanted to maybe help you out with some stuff. That's okay.",,,,
Luis,150.1,I guess I'll,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"You circle, the same as savannas, does that help you any",,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Well okay so yeah cuz I I I kind of had the same thinking. I said, Man, I was like, okay, a scientific tool is equipment on the water. Okay. But yeah, I see what you're saying about looking. It's not the same as discovering okay",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright guys, any more questions can be any other way. Do you understand what we're doing now that you need to specifically look at the question.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So I'm Chris or Luis, Are any of you ready to dig deeper and tell me another answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,We're just looking at the way that we are seeing our answers in different ways and what perspective that we're coming from.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Oh, OK. So then my one about-- let me see. What did I-- I know I circled a part of the story. Oh, yes. OK, so I said--",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Right. Well, we've all been separated into a different group. That way, we can learn from each other and get some more perspectives on what we answered for these questions.",,,,
Oliver,150.1,"OK. Mr. Lawrence, I just looked at the clock, and it's time for the next group, so we'll have to see you later.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,In your own words. You can do that.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"OK. I have to think about it, then.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,OK?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,OK. OK.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does anybody else have any questions on why it is the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, that's awesome. Well, I just want to kind of talk to The small group just to have a little bit more extra time with you to go over a few things I'm looking at your responses.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"For the first question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. I want to talk about that question real quick, before, Before we go to lunch.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Yeah, so I just have to add the name of it. And then my answers fine?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yes, you did a great job on that we are just wanting to I'm just pulling people together, just trying to get different ideas because there's difference of opinions on this question. So we're just trying to get a sample size of different answers.",,,,
Chris,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Because we chose to do a different piece of evidence.  And so your piece of evidence was just a little bit bigger. And so you just have to add on a little bit, little bit more than them.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay and Farrah. I just wanted to touch back with you and Oliver. I know you had the same answer is Farrah. Are you guys feeling a little bit more comfortable with going back further into the text, Mr Oliver",,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Um, yeah, I think that we are getting more comfortable. Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But thank you so much for working with us.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Oliver and Luis. Does that help clarify that question.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Um, yeah, I think that that makes sense because yeah okay that actually makes a lot of sense. So like Farrah, you're saying that like basically like that, you know, if you use like a microscope to see the water after you find it. You have to find it. First is that right",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does anybody else have any questions.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, thank you. Farrah for your question. Any other questions.",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Jazmin, do you know how scientists discovered water on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,That make better sense?,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Yeah, I think that's a little clearer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Is anything else I can do to clear this up for you guys.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Um, I guess, like what I was wondering, like, Um, okay, so like a small machine. Well, okay, so I think that I'm beginning to understand, but can you help me understand just like super clearly like how the ok so the microscopes like not quite the right answer and I got the same answer as Farrah",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Any other questions?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Great. I have what are your questions are the answers for the passage that you read water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group teacher. I know a lot about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So, anyone else have any other questions.",,,,
Chris,150.1,I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Understand the question was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. And each one of you had different answers in your journals.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Excuse me, I'm a teacher, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay. Does anyone have any questions.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Okay, I guess it's not a question.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does everyone understand now.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,That make sense?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does anyone else have questions.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"I do, I do, I do. Luis is. Yeah. I have a question.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Doesn't say that right. No, it doesn't say that.",,,,
Farrah,150.1,NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,I've read your answers. And I want to get a couple of clarifying questions have for you. So let's start with Jazmin. Okay. Yes. Luis,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Great. Well, so do you guys had an opportunity to review the discussion question?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Great, great, great answer. So Luis Do you think from your question from your answer to your question that you think that you needed to revise that question or the answer?",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yeah, I didn't really read it the first time. So yeah, I think that I see. I think I understand, like, why that's that might be a better answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Right, you find something. Do you agree with that everybody",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Exactly, so not what they used to look at it. So I wanted to go back. Is there anybody else who wants to share on that and that issue.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Our high quality answer can be found in the text. Yes, Jazmin well",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"I guess. Ever since you were. We were talking, I was just wonder, like, I guess. Still not sure like my, my answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Farrah any you look a little, little stunned. Is there something I can help you with",,,,
Farrah,150.1,With you up me,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Sometimes it is if you listen to the question.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"stop right there. Okay. So did everyone, did everyone read that with her.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Did you read that Farrah with her? Okay. Chris, id you read that you.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay. Appreciate that answer. Luis So maybe we could look at this together. And maybe we could come to some new conclusions possibly,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, I appreciate that, that you that you feel that way. But let's talk about this for just a minute.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yes. And so everyone corrected their answer, but we're going to talk about that today. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,We're going to talk about our,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Stick around. Yes, we're going to talk about our corrected answers.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Sometimes they don't put everything in the reading because then we would be reading forever.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So we answered our last question. So we're going to move on to a new question.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, so let's just go ahead and see and let's talk about some of the things that you've done.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, so let's look at the question, right. And let's look at your answers.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yes. Good. Okay, so that's what you do to re evaluate your answer.",,,,
Chris,150.1,"Um, yeah. So I said that water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it on the ships anymore.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Great. Are there any more questions.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Well, um, I mean, I think that I had the right answer. So, um, I guess. I don't know why my answers wrong, too.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yeah, so I understand. And I feel like you guys were all around the answer, but we are we're looking more for specific answer",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, I look back at the paragraphs that you have to find your answer in the reading. That's what the most important thing is so you need to read and be able to find your answers in the text. So I looked very closely to find the details that we were looking for.",,,,
Chris,150.1,"Okay. Well, I went to NASA. And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,What do you guys have questions about so,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So how is the water in the passage like let me give you an example. For instance,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So they're using all those background knowledge tips in order to help them find the answer to,,,,
Farrah,150.1,So they're using their background knowledge so me and Oliver get it because we don't know as much about space as then,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So if you read and you look for those details and you can also get the answer to,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does everybody see that sentence.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Ah, yeah, I see it. I have a quick question, though.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay. So real quick, I'm just clarifying what the question is really asking",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Um, well, as I said for the first question I think we were put in a group, just to have some discussion because everybody's answer was different.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So we are going to think a little bit. Yes?,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,Can you say it again.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so, reflecting in our answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Accepted okay and we are going to move on and to improve our answers to learn better about our subject. Okay, don't feel it's wrong. Thank you for for your input.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Because I am concerned, I think that you need to read a little bit more.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, but there is an experience that you you had when you went to NASA. And you can connect that with what you are learning. Thank you for sharing that. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Make sense?,,,,
Oliver,150.1,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does anybody else have any questions about their answer.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Um, I'm not. I think I'm still not sure about because I have the same answer as Farrah",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So maybe we can read to help us understand a little bit more about what your dad does,,,,
Luis,150.1,Yeah okay yeah that sounds cool.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,You guys think so?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And that's kind of what we're going to be talking about here today. So I really liked reading all of your answers. Um, and before we begin, what was the most interesting thing. You guys found in the article.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yeah, you got it?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,It is cool. So for us to talk about the question just for a minute before we really dive into those answers.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Now taking that in mind, I would like to talk about your answers just for a second so",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"That's right. So remember back to our question. We just have to find convincing evidence for its value. And like you said, we've done that. Right. We have tons of ways that it can be used.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Think we all should be here. I'm so glad that each of you and take your time and completing your task and you know we each of you have varying levels of understanding of the question. So each of you are going to have a part where you understood it better than one another, and we're going to discuss what we understood. Does that make sense?",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yeah, yeah, okay, I can stick around for that.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So we're going to discuss that here in just a few moments. Okay, Farrah, we're going to discuss why each of your answers for wrong and how we can do better to find the answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And that's what we're doing right now in this class. We're looking deeper into these questions and our answers.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,I'm almost a start like a couple words of restate and I want somebody. See if I can help me from the text finish that sentence. Does that sound good.,,,,
Chris,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yeah, and then also our reader knows what we're talking about route.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Let's see. I'm going to look at your responses, real quick.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"In the original time but it's, I want you to work on that next time.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So let's think a little bit deeper about that. And that's a good response so,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"we have a lot of good information. And so, so we've decided and",,,,
Oliver,150.1,Reach Every Reader:It's me Oliver,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Is there anything else that you can find in there, why go back to Luis to you read and see if you can find something different than Farrah.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Okay. Um, so yeah. Um, there's a bunch of there's two different things where they're talking about equipment in here. Um, so, in paragraph two, they talk about the Lunar Orbiter and then paragraph three, they talk about the microscope so",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Does that answer your question, Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yeah, I guess, you know, how do you find them?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay well let's just worked work together for a little bit. And let's just see where we get. Okay.,,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay. Well, that's what we're working towards trying to see where everybody's at and we'll get there.",,,,
Chris,150.1,So I was saying basically that there were craters like full of water on all this water.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"How about you, Luis. Did you read it for me.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,and as you're reading a lot of times you need to use a finger pointer to help you point as you're finding your words. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,You see it?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, we might can look just a little bit closer. And you might find out that you'll learn some new strategies that might help you with other prompts or stories or questions that might help you in the future.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So I think it might be good for you in the group and listen to some of the strategies I want to share with you guys. Would that be okay?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay. Hopefully we can find some strategies that work for you and you can use,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Exactly. That's exactly what I want you to start looking for and we're gonna keep going and keep going a little deeper into the rest of the group's answers and see what we can find out, but you are on the right track.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,A lunar orbiter. So what machine discovered water.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,And the Lunar Orbiter?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Absolutely. So do you understand how your answer was right. But we could have made it just a little bit more detail.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,I just have to add called lunar orbiter?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,It is the Lunar Orbiter and we're just gonna keep going and talking about our answers and figuring out where we came up with these answers and how we could have got them better.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Better. Okay. Okay. Teacher, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Right, so our microscope is used to look at our water, but we've already discovered our water with the Lunar Orbiter. Does that make sense now.",,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Yeah, I guess, I guess. So I feel like, oh yeah cuz discover is different from look at",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So really good job, you guys, but there are some more that we can look at",,,,
Teacher,150.1,We're gonna be doing a lot more practice with these questions so that you feel comfortable with it.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, so you have all shared your responses and I can see that we have have different responses here. Yes. Luis",,,,
Luis,150.1,"I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be on this group, I am already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh, well, there's so much more to learn. Space is so expansive right and so there's so much more to learn. That's awesome. That you like hearing about like learning about space, but maybe,",,,,
Luis,150.1,All okay,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All right. So you've all shared your responses and they're all I can see that they're all maybe a little bit different, but I think we need to relook at this question. So the question is asking us",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Now, if all five of us can agree upon one response. Yes. Chris.",,,,
Chris,150.1,I want to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So all five of us. We all have I heard some really great answers. Let's see if, now we can come up with a whole group response.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, I think there's always room. To learn more, and sometimes we can learn from other people's responses and also maybe what I has to add to those responses.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so we're gonna kind of review what the question was. And your responses.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Do you know how you could have. I'm not saying that your answer is incorrect, but maybe you could have put on because you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Correct?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Yeah, thank you.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Chris. Do you not remember reading that part.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"No, I do. I do remember, um, I thought that there was like a bunch of water in the craters. Um, but I did have a quick question.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And so the water that they found is microscopic. Do we know what the word microscopic means?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Everybody. Jazmin, do you know what microscopic mean? No?",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Well, I think it means something really small.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, I'm glad you you have a basic understanding of it. But in this room, we're just gonna learn a little bit more. And you can broaden your knowledge on everything that involves space. Okay.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Okay, yeah, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Uh, I looked at your responses to the first question of what equipment designs is used as discover water on the moon. I noticed we kind of had a",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Very in range of responses. Some of y'all kind of understood the question some of y'all are a little off.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yeah. And then I noticed that you put the same answer as Farrah. So does that make sense to you. Also, buddy.",,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Um, yeah, that makes sense. So like they use something else to find the water and then they studied the water using the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I think that makes sense. Alright, so I just want to kind of look at some of your responses. And then we can kind of talk it through. Okay, so",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Alright so this event and Divya What do y'all think is all kind of had the same answer.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"That is pretty cool. You'll have to go home and show him this article. Once we've talked about it some more, um,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And so I'm going to pull back up your responses.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So the other the other students that looked at that gave different answers.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Together, because I just want to go over a few of the things that we read in the article.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I'm just clarifying what kind of machine that they sent and the machine that they sent is called a lunar orbiter atoms, okay does that make sense?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Who told you that, that's not true. I just wanted to clarify your understanding of the art.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"We just want to understand better Exactly what you're trying to say. And when you said a small machine. We were able to clarify that. That's the lunar orbiter, we're going to get into more information. That makes sense? Okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And so I just wanted to kind of get your input and let you guys share with me your responses on the question.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Excuse me, a teacher. I hadn't been on this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense to you all.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Um, well,I guess I didn't know because you had",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,I think so.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay? Does that make sense?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Yeah, I think so. So like my answer wasn't quite right, but it was like that they they have to use something else to discover the water",,,,
Teacher,150.1,The Lunar...?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, perhaps you can help us all learn more about space as we continue going forward in a group.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Okay, yeah, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Um, yeah. Um, so they, it was the, they sent like a microscope and something else?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does anybody. Does anybody have any questions.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And that may be the case. Luis, but it is always best to, you know, sort of, definitely challenge our preconceptions of of science and how we can further our learning",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yeah, I could do that.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,I have also looked at some of the answers that you have given for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"If we wanted to explore perhaps more what would be even maybe more correct answer. So the question is,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"OK, so the Lunar Orbiter. Good job. So for the most part, that so that, is the small machine the exact same thing is the Lunar Orbiter?",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,It says in the reading that you need NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. So the lunar orbiter must be this small machine.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,To talk about the very question is you might remember the question who could read the question that we have,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Because we're talking about the space in the moon, but the reason we're here today is to find out how that we can answer these questions and look deeper into it. Okay, so she brought up.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And I'm glad you did that you know what you're doing. You're reminding me like when we look into text will become a detective and looking deep into it, just like Oliver and I'm sure to the rest of you.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And Farrah. The same thing discovers like a verb. We're looking deep into it and you're trying to find out what they discovered,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"I just I just was wondering like, I didn't. I wasn't quite sure why my answer was wrong.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay. And once you run it. You look at equipment you look at microscope and that is an equipment, but we're looking deeper into the question just like today.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Discover great. A lot of you are doing it. And that's I think that's awesome that you're thinking about that and looking at that and again that's a verb. It's going to connect you back.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"When you're looking at a question, you will get where they're asking for. And that's key points every one of you said equipment and they discovered and then a lot yes event Jazmin, sorry.",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,It's time for the next group. So thank you so much for working with us.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So we, we read the text. Did everybody understand the text water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Everybody understand?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Why it might not be right for what we're talking about right now?,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Yeah, like why that's not like the answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Let's great Luis Maybe you can share some,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Some ideas with us about the article.,,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so I'm happy that y'all are all here today and I was looking over your responses",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Everyone agree.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yep. Okay. So we're looking over your responses. We're going to look back at the paragraph. I know that some of y'all had some of the same answers and then some of your answers was a little bit deeper. And that's okay. Um,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,We just want to be able to give the best answer.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,That he gave us. So I just want us to expand and think a little bit more.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I want to talk about, like, I want to challenge you to look and read about the size of the US deposits",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Let's work together to create a sentence to answer that.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So let's work on formulate this sentence together. So we got the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Perfect. Okay. So what other. Does anyone have any questions about the microscope because that's one of our equipment.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Oh yeah it's Chris, I don't really have a question about the microscope, but I have another question. Um, should I save it?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"That's good, that's good. So we all, we all just read water on the moon. And you guys answered in your journal some questions.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yeah, I can't",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So we are going to start talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. And I saw your previous journal entry. And I want to start.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense. Chris?,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Yeah, it does.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Yeah, yeah, I think I got it.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"But then your answer is gonna be awesome. You can do it, I believe you can do it.",,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, does that make sense.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So I'm going To the question and your answer really quick.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"You already know all about space. Alright, well, how about you stick with us for a little bit and see if we can teach you something new. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,can we now see why that makes sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I think you guys have somewhat of an understanding to what the question is asking, but I don't think we are fully there. Yes. Luis",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in that spot. I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All right, well, Luis. Why don't you stick with us.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And see if we can teach you something new, even scientists are constantly learning new things about space. So why don't you stick with us and",,,,
Teacher,150.1,See what you can learn today. Alright.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So if nobody has any other equipment. Let's, let's look at those two",,,,
Teacher,150.1,answer choices and see which one makes the most sense and answers our question.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So does that make sense. Chris, I saw your hand go up. So does that make sense as to why",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Give you just a moment.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And when you're done, give me a thumbs up or raise your hand.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So do we do we understand why lunar orbiter is the correct answer to question number one.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Okay. Um, yeah, it's cause it's cards. It comes first in the story.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, let's double check our answers. That way we know for sure that we have answered the question. The way that it's asking us to. OK.",,,,
Luis,150.1,OK.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,There are a couple other of your friends that are needing a little bit help with the guidance of where to find their answers.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,About 10 more seconds. Is everybody done reading.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Hi guys. So today we are going to talk about our answers to the question that you guys needed to answer and I want to first say thank you for answering the question, so what I want us to first start with is I want us to all look back to the",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So you guys have already came up with an answer to this question.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And who knows, you might even learn something new, as",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, that's okay. It doesn't hurt to learn a little more right",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yeah, I guess so.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,I'm excited to work with you guys. So I looked over all of your answers for the question. And I wanted to start by trying a strategy and see if we have different answers.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Alright friends. Thank you for sharing your answers with me about what equipment did scientists use from our text. So now I want to dig a little bit deeper into your answers. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Hmm. Well, I'm glad that you know a lot about space. Okay. But we're all in this group to work on answering some questions. Alright.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, Jazmin, what do you think, do you agree with Oliver and Farrah.",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Well, I guess.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so we're getting ready to look at that one to hear from each person. We're going to take a look at that. So our question that was posed to us.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, we're just going to continue to keep going and dig in a little bit deeper into our text,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Luis are you looking at, paragraph two, there",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Um, yeah, I'm looking right now. Did you want me to give the answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Oh,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,In my room. I have a favorite word. It's called confidence and not everyone's confident are we,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I don't want you to have those feelings in my class, even if you're not confident. I want you to well fake it and see what happens. If you think you know the answer, let me know and then I will do my best to guide you in the right direction.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,If you don't come to the correct conclusion on the first trouble work together. Does that make sense.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Oh yeah, that sounds great. And I think that we all feel really confident now that you said that. Thank you so much. Alright.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,I hear that you guys have already shared out your answers and add honestly just like to go left to right and pick apart. Everybody's answer.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, the first three paragraphs, the answers in there somewhere,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Is the answer in there, or is that just a partial answer in there. What do you guys believe what do you think Farrah, and Oliver?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense you three,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"but I believe we've had just a little bit of misunderstanding. Does that make sense, just a little bit. We can easily",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"we just need to take it a little bit further,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I'd actually like if we stayed together as a group. I like the small group dynamic, would you mind staying with us and following along,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, does anybody else have any questions so far?",,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Um, yeah, I have a quick question. Um, so we were we were just discussing the text and looking at the question, how did scientists, or what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, I think we're all going to work together to form a deeper understanding of the article.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yeah, I could do that. That sounds cool.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does anybody have any questions remaining about that.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And just for a second, let's examine what Farrah and Oliver just said.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay and Luis So you have read the text right the text that is water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, and you did read the text, right, which was water is a valuable resource.",,,,
Luis,150.1,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, so guys you did really well with your response and I'm with the text, but I have a couple questions when to help us further our knowledge and understanding of the texts. Are you guys ready",,,,
Luis,150.1,Excuse me teacher,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, but um and I appreciate that you know so much about this, but at the same time, we can always learn more. So why don't you stick with us and we'll see what we can discover together.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Okay, yeah, I can stick around.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And you guys had some really great responses. I just want to talk to you about some of your responses. And let's see if we can dig a little deeper.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,That work?,,,,
Oliver,150.1,That sounds great.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does everybody agree with this?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, it's always good to go back and review things that you've learned",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, does anybody else have any questions before we begin,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All right, we're going to learn some more stuff. Okay, so you hang with us and we'll learn all kinds of new things.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And we want to make sure that we're using everything to answer the questions.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Huh, yeah. I sometimes everybody is just in groups to kind of talk more about it doesn't mean you did anything wrong.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,But there's some answers that maybe can be just,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Give more information to,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Them. What did you think,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Well, I don't understand why my answers wrong, um, cuz I pull mine from the text to",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"His answer is not that you guys answered anything wrong at all, just to kind of think more about it.",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Yeah definitely writing more and reading very close in the text and looking for because that was a very small piece of information that was very easy to skim over,,,,
Teacher,150.1,And it was definitely tricky to find and it would maybe take even reading it a couple times to find that,,,,
Chris,150.1,"I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks in suits to. I know a lot about equipment, but I didn't see that part.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,is just a group to talk about the questions they don't mean anything specific.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Oh, I thought we were here cuz our our answers weren't weren't right.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,We're just going to try and adjust the sentences. Just a little bit.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense. Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,I think so. I think,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So you're in this group because I wanted you all to kind of work together and hear each other's answers and kind of,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay let's talk about it, then what to do right Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,150.1,"I said, you need a scientific microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,But I just want to talk with you guys a little bit more specifically about the texts that we just read to make sure that everyone understands the water on the moon text.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"To the text, but I want to talk a little bit about how everyone responded after reading the text and I just want to kind of ask one more time.",,,,
Luis,150.1,I think the most important equipment was the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"I have to, I have to write more stuff in my answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay. If you have any questions, let me know.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"yeah you do know a lot about space um and I don't want to say that this group is for people who don't know about space, because you all did a really good job, but this group is just to work on giving responses to questions from a text.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So i'm gonna go one by one and give you each some feedback on what you said to the response. i'll start with Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"hey you really know what you're talking about, and it also shows that you found your answer from the text. Does that make sense, everyone?",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,yeah it makes sense to use that I have to use it okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make a little more,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"hi everyone, so I really appreciate you all, giving your responses to our second discussion question which was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable, so I want to just talk through each of your responses.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make more sense to you two or are you still confused.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,um yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Does hat makes sense, so you're connecting both sets of text with just a few words there.",,,,
Chris,150.1,yeah yeah yeah yeah I think.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay awesome um so Jazmin do you have any questions about your response.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Well Okay, I think I did what what Oliver and Farrah didn't do is I answered the question I said yes, and then I also did the thing, where I I I pulled the evidence from the text, so I guess I don't know why mine is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,yeah so because statements are a really good way to make sure that you have enough evidence to support what you're saying yes Oliver,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Well it's time for us to go to lunch, but I do want to say, I appreciate um how are you kind of explain what each of us needs to work on and how we can improve our answers.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh no, it's not anything like that, I'm sure you all have your own great knowledge of space. We're just going to discuss a little bit of how we read and responded to the passage. Do you guys remember the passage about water on the moon?",,,,
Luis,150.1,Uh-huh yeah I have it on my tablet right here.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Perfect. So we're just going to go over so you guys get a bit of a more clear understanding of this passage.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So does everyone understand that now from the passage?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, does that make sense?",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So does anyone else have anything that they were confused about?,,,,
Chris,150.1,"It's not so much confused, but I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does anyone else have questions on the passage?,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Okay, well, I don't know why mine was wrong, because, I mean, I know, I know a lot about space. And so I know that um scientists and astronauts like they have to use oxygen tanks to go to go to the moon. They can't breathe.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"That was a really good thing to - if I asked about anything you needed to go to the moon, that would be a great part of your response. But do you see where the question was a little bit different than your answer?",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Um, cuz yeah well I mean yeah cuz well when you said okay, you don't need the oxygen tank to find water you need oxygen tank to breathe. So, yeah, yeah. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you need a reminder of what the question was?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Oh no, I can see it. Um, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Well, I mean, it says that they look at the water with a microscope. That's equipment, um,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"If you need a second to look back and find another piece of equipment, we can come back to you and I can move on to Chris again.",,,,
Chris,150.1,"Yeah, so I went to NASA. So I know that it is used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you understand that?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,How it's used to find water.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"That's good, that's good. Um, so you guys read a text water on the moon, and we're gonna be talking about what you said like your responses.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yeah, no problem. Um, so basically I was just saying that like I kind of know like all about space. So I don't think I really need to be in this",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh, well, you know, everyone learn something new, no matter how much you know about it. There's always something to learn about something.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Well, I can stick around.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Um, anyone, anyone else have any questions before we start? Alright, sounds good. Sounds good.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yes, those are perfect things to add, um, do you have any other questions before we move on?",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"No, that makes sense. So like I should just say like in detail, like what it was",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"yeah it's good good good to hear, so I brought you all, and you know it's a as a group, because you guys all had very various answers to the prompts.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh well, you know the the greatest minds in the world, always always now I learned something new, every day, so you know you try give it a shot, you know, keep an open mind to it.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,so do you have any questions for me on that well.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"um do you have any do you have any questions about that, so far, well, I just i'm gonna try to write it down, so I was trying to remember what you said.",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,So NASA to smell machine.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So we'll be talking about your responses to the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable um so first of all I your I like your responses all they're all different, and I like that so what's what's taught was start with Farrah so you're your.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh come on stick around for a while, but you can learn something new from this, you know some i'm almost 20 years old, and I was reading some of this and I don't even know about it.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,let's try to keep an open mind and Luis I feel you like this science stuff right i'm.,,,,
Luis,150.1,Sorry.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,It won't be boring trust me it'd be super excited.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,What do you confused about.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Well cuz, you said that So the answer was a good answer, but my answer was completely different and and no offense but she like only wrote a few words and I wrote like a lot of words, because you told us to expand our answers but they're different.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"um you're right, I did say to expand on your answers um and you know I try to thing everyone's answer can be right, I mean um.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,and see how it kind of thinking more on that helped you figure that out.,,,,
Chris,150.1,I think it was what you had said before about wanting us to to just add more add more.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"um so yeah i'm to so to bring us all to you and your your your responses were great and I love, how you guys saw more about it and added an extra sentence to it.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And it can help you learn it better, as well, so i'd like to thank you guys for taking the time to answer the questions as well, oh.",,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Well, we want to thank you teacher for asking us questions cuz I I like how you you.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Does that make more sense of how what I wanted from you, Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Oh yeah, I think that makes a lot more sense. Thank you.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Hi guys. Did you enjoy reading,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Yes, we enjoyed it and we're ready to share our answers.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"You know, I think it's awesome that you already have so much knowledge, but nobody can know everything about one thing. So the more we learn the better off we might be. So maybe we should just keep our minds open to what's going on. And maybe we can learn from it. Okay.",,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"But from this point on, I think I'm going to need to finish with telling you guys what's going on. And then you can raise your hands. After, okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"that's awesome that you know a lot about space, but there's infinite learning that we can have none of us know absolutely everything is because none of us have been to space I don't think, have you been.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"No, not yet, but I will.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And i'm sure, one day, you will get there, but until then let's try to focus on learning a little bit more, so all right i'll repeat myself just so you guys remember.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, so I believe we left off the savanna talking about the microscope being the only thing i'm sorry Luis, how can I help you.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Oh well, I just was off, I was gonna say that, like, I think I got everything figured out now, so I think i'm all good to go.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, well, I appreciate your thoughts, but i'm just going to ask that we keep listening and that maybe we'll find new knowledge okay so.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"let's just keep listening to our classmates make sure we're all respectful to each other and let's keep our hands down until I come to you Okay, unless you have a serious question.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that make sense.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well that's great that you have some background knowledge, we're just going to build that in this group and expand your knowledge on the subject.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"To all guys. So all of you guys read the text and gave good answers. So to start off, we're gonna start with Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And since we're in a small group we're supposed to discuss it here for next time. I just want you to look closer at the text.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so to start off everyone had a great start answering the questions um.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well it's always great to expand your knowledge, because you can always learn something you wouldn't have thought you needed to know before so it's always a good experience to build upon our responses and our knowledge of the subject.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"As I was saying you guys all started off great and we're headed in the right direction and we only need to build your response, a little more to fully answer the question so to start with Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Most of you have an answer.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So just basically look closer and it stated in the text, but you just need to read it thoroughly to answer the question you had a great start.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"um well there's always room to grow for everyone when answering a question or doing an assignment, so, for your answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Always you guys want to always build on each other's thoughts so even though, if you agree, or if you have the same thought you have to think of a way that you could either add on or ask questions.",,,,
Oliver,150.1,"So I I read that they weren't going to try to build a moon base on the moon by like 2024, and it was just making me think like.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Exactly, these are all great reflections and for the next text you can always think back to this and see how to build on",,,,
Farrah,150.1,"So, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go I really wanted to thank you for a couple things.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Good. Awesome job. Awesome. Alright, so, um, we remember the other day, we read the text water on the moon. Do we remember reading that. Yeah. Awesome. So the reason that we are meeting today is because we're going to try to work on your responses. Everybody did a great job. Yeah. Yeah. Luis",,,,
Luis,150.1,Excuse me.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, okay. So we remember we read the text water on the moon. Remember reading that and digesting the text? So in the text. Remember we",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Yeah, we talked about, we use a microscope in science class.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So, um, you all gave responses. And I just want to like we want to meet in a group, just so we can work on our responses. Does that make sense. Alright, so",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense?,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"So after, I have to write more stuff.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,That makes sense? Good.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So I know where everybody is at learning. So I can help you guys further if you need it.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,Okay. It does. It was just that it was exactly the same because she circled the last sentence and I circled the last sentence too.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And even if you circle the last sentence, I still want you to say something. It's for good participation and I want to make sure everybody says their answer.",,,,
Oliver,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Good, awesome so we just read the passage that is called water is a valuable resource.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And the five of you had answered the question that is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And i'm going to tell you exactly what I, what I want you to do, and I want you to apply that. You may understand it now, but I still want to tell you my concerns just so you and I are both on the same page.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, that's OK because we'll all learn-- all of us are learning anyway. So all of us are going to keep learning. So that's OK if you're in this group. You're going to join us, I'm happy for you to join us today.",,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Yeah, sure, OK. So I circle the last sentence in the text. You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So would you think that would be a form of equipment used by NASA?,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Yeah, because a machine is equipment.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,hi everyone so today we're going to be looking at questions from our readings. Everyone know what I'm talking about?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Is everyone done?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh that's Okay, because we're still revising our answers, and I know you had an answer to the questions. So that's okay, you're going to learn anyways, I appreciate you sharing that.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Ok, everyone's done?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so I want everyone to come back to class for a second. Come back into group.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I noticed from your small groups that you guys are talking about, you guys are looking.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"that's okay Luis because we're revising our answers and we're all learning today. So I appreciate you sharing that. It's okay, you can be in our group.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Hey everyone, I'm so I just heard your great responses. I just wanted to touch base and maybe see if we can get a deeper understanding. We have a great start. But we, there's a couple pieces were missing. So can we work together to do that. Yeah.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yes, excuse me.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, well I pulled you aside because me as the teacher. I saw that maybe we could all help each other, get a deeper understanding of space.",,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,That makes sense.,,,,
Luis,150.1,I guess.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Um, maybe I think",,,,
Teacher,150.1,I didn't see you. Didn't I just want to make sure that we're on the same page.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Oh,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Again, just make sure you have all those pieces. Yes, Jazmin. I'm sorry. I see your hand. What's up,",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"I don't understand why my, my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Oh that's awesome we're going to really dive into this material and you're probably going to learn something you didn't already know you knew so we're going to still stay in this group and work together,,,,
Luis,150.1,yeah sounds good.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,you can look over what you have and then we're going to come back together and we're going to answer the question.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"If you guys have any questions at any point, you can just raise your hand and I can answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,That makes sense?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,and then we're going to come back together and figure out a really strong answer as a group that answers the question completely sound good.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Hi guys, so I liked hearing your responses about the water on the moon text, but I brought us all together, just because some of us.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, we're all here together because we're going to deepen our deepen our understanding of what we thought of the text. So I think that we all have a reason to be here together. So, just listen to what I have to say, please.",,,,
Luis,150.1,All right. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So this was an activity where I kind of wanted you guys to discuss the question of what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you understand?,,,,
Oliver,150.1,By water. We're so small they have to use a microscope to see it.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,You understand?,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Oh, I, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots, um, lots and lots of different equipment.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, so does anybody have any confusion about what equipment, the scientists used to discover water on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So we're talking about how we just read the moon, is a desert, and I know that, yes, Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"we're going to learn, even more so i'm sure you're in the right place.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,You understand why it's a microscope.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,uh huh because.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,And that's why me and Jazmin just spoke a little bit longer just to make sure Jazmin understood what the name of the machine was i'm just trying to so Luis Do you understand what the name of the machine was and what it did.,,,,
Luis,150.1,yeah the Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh, that's okay. It's always fun to be with groups.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
All,150.1,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Um, well, actually. You might know a lot about space, but we're gonna go over what you guys read in the text. So it might be something that new that you might not know",,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So have you guys already read the text.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Um, yeah, and I want you answered our questions. So I'm not even sure why why we're in this group.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So today we're going to be reviewing,,,,
Teacher,150.1,The answers to everyone's discussion question.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"That we recently did over water on the moon. Yes, Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Excuse me. Um, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"that's interesting thing to say. I don't think even science, all like scientists that have studied space for years know everything about space.",,,,
Luis,150.1,I mean ask me anything I know I know everything that I need to know.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,I don't think even scientists like scientists that have been studying space their whole lives know all about space. Space is so big.,,,,
Luis,150.1,I mean well I know a lot about space.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"um However, I think that some some mistakes that I saw across the board in some answers, or maybe not some mistakes, but just some places that everybody can work on um I believe.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,you guys just finished reading water on the moon. I noticed that. And I also noticed that you guys tended to have some answers that weren't thought about as best as I think you guys can think about. I think you guys can come up with better,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Better responses to the question that I'm asking because I know you guys are super smart and you can do that. All right.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I just want to make sure that you understand all of what what we just talked about and stuff. And what we read. This is just to help you understand, just a little more",,,,
Teacher,150.1,because I know you have really good words and you can use them and you're able to tell them I know you can tell me,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So i've just been reading your responses and I wanted to pull you guys into a smaller group, because I feel like we can all do a little bit of improving on our responses and that's Okay, yes Luis excuse me.",,,,
Luis,150.1,I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh, I know you do we all, definitely know all about space, and I know you all wrote some well all a lot of great answers, but we just want to take the time to make sure that your sentences are.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So we want to dig a little bit deeper than that okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"We I know that you can dig a little deeper than that I know you're smarter than that, and I know that you have more complete sentences that you can give me.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that make sense yeah yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And they all had great information in them, I just pulled you aside, because I think we can each Dave a little deeper Okay, yes Luis excuse me.",,,,
Luis,150.1,I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I know you guys all know all about space, but I just want to make sure that you're capturing the reading and the question clearly OK.",,,,
Luis,150.1,OK.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"OK now i'm going to go through each of you individually, but before I do that, I want you guys to do something first okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Can you guys do that.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All right, i'm going to count and then i'll let you guys know and time's up okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,raise your hands when you're all done reading okay.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Well, I need a two on underline just equipment right.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All right, we're all done yeah alright perfect now i'm going to go through each of you, so that we can try and build your responses, a little better okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,I just want to make sure that you guys are getting it and I want to make sure that you have a little more understanding so Jazmin are you ready to take your time.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does everyone have the article water on the moon pulled up on their tablet.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you see what I'm saying?,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Okay, let me look again so",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you understand?,,,,
Chris,150.1,Um so it is correct that they found craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you guys see that?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,but I it just means that you need to look a little bit further into the reading yes.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,Is the answer to the Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense?,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Oh so it's like a like maybe they weren't astronauts up there, like Maybe it was a like a NASA they call it an unmanned pro.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,yeah I can see make sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that make sense,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does anyone else have any questions or confused about anything?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense?,,,,
Luis,150.1,yeah but didn't they use like oxygen takes to walk around and see the water?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,And so your responses were all a bit little bit different. So I love that because we have a variation of answers. But I just wanted to go over these responses to see if we can get some really great answers.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Or you could use maybe something you found on your own. You don't need to use what you said.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Okay. Okay, I'm gonna read it and see.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright guys, so we just shared our great answers for the question but I just-",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"As we're going over our answers, I wanted to think back and let's really look at the question to see what the question was asking.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And you can raise your hand if you finally found a piece.,,,,
Chris,150.1,Ok so I found a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright guys, so we just answered the second question, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable and so you guys had some great answers.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,That supported the question and I do see some more evidence from the text that we use that's really good.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"and raise your hand if you find any evidence that would right away tell you, yes or now.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense?,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,yeah I think so.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,not carrying the water on the spaceship would be valuable. Does that make sense?,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Um, saying more about why it would be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Right, I understand, but it's really important like when we listen to other students responses. It only helps us better understand what we're learning about and it's also great. I'm sure you'll have some great contributions today.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"yeah, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, you know what it's actually really important to foster collaboration and listen to our peers responses to help build on what you already know.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"You know what then we can actually just build on your background knowledge in your understanding that you already have, I think it's great that you already know a lot about space, but it's really important to build on that knowledge.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,do you all remember answering this question?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So Oliver does that make sense to you too?,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"yeah I think so, so we just have to say, both of the names of the equipment in our answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"There's always room to learn more, even if we think we're the best at a subject. There's always something new we need to learn.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,A good attitude to keep is that never know.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Too much there's always more that you can learn.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"that's cool, I guess, I can stick around.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so hearing your responses, I do want to do a little bit of work, you guys had some awesome answers, but I want to make them even better.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,I loved your guys responses looking at it.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well there's always always more to learn that's how you get really good at something you don't think that you've learned it all, you always have an open mind to learn more.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Okay, I got it.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"OK, raise your hand when you're finished.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yeah, so do you remember what I said to Farrah?",,,,
Oliver,150.1,That she's gotta say stuff in her own words. She can't just pull the quote from the story.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"OK, so now, hearing back from all of your responses and everything, they sound amazing, but we do have to talk a little bit about getting our minds a little bit deeper in the text. Yes, Luis, I believe.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yeah, it's me, Luis. Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group. I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Good to see you too. So right now we're going to kind of discuss your responses that you had about the The story about not the story the reading about the moon,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"You know a lot about space. Well, I'd love for you to stay and share some of your ideas with the other friends in our group, I think that would be",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Right. Do you want to go through it together. So let's see what we can come up with together.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense. Is that a little easier.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Yeah, I guess that's a few less words. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that make sense.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that make sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,That make more sense.,,,,
Chris,150.1,yeah that makes a lot.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Hi boys and girls. So we just finished our small discussion about water on the moon. And you guys all had wonderful responses.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,But now we're going to go a little bit deeper into the text and really think about,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh, okay, I understand. I think that we can always learn from each other. And so I think we can. What you can do is look at the responses of your classmates and see if there's anything that you didn't know which would be really cool.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, the good thing is, we can all learn some more from each other",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"and we can help each other by doing that, by listening to our peers and coming together to make a stronger answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Is there anyone would want to add anything to our conversation? Yes Chris.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"So I kind of was just well Okay, so I was thinking about that I went to NASA so I, like you were saying, I know that scientists use a lot of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Someone to explain a little bit more on what they were reading about or what they thought was interesting.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Yeah, okay. So when I was reading the",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I would just want some more expanding of your answers like anyone can expand on their answers, but if you don't have anything to say that's totally fine.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"hey guys so listening to your answers lots of them were very great really proud of you guys, I just have a couple of questions.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Does anyone else, want to add into it or thought that they saw something interesting in the reading yes.",,,,
Chris,150.1,I worked at NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so great job explaining um that you guys think or did not think that water could be valuable on the moon for astronauts but I guess Luis okay.",,,,
Luis,150.1,I think I got this all figured out now so i'm all good.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, well, there are a couple of other students that I just want to ask a couple questions and maybe clarify and we can all talk about it, too, and go over the answers um so Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So this one's a little tricky I feel so.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"OK, that's great that you know a lot about space, but this is a specific part of space that we just want to talk about. Being in this group doesn't mean you don't know about it, it just means that I just wanted to hear a little bit more of what you thought. OK?",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Oh, OK.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So I agree that you did it correct your answer and I think we're really on the right track, but what I want to talk about right now.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So I know that we just read the article water on the moon. And you guys were supposed to answer a question right,,,,
,150.1,"Yeah we we all answered it. And, um, we told you, our answers. And then, um, you said you'd give us some feedback on our answers.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,That is a way better answer. Do you see why it's a better answer.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,I'm good. Because I added more words.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay guys so now we're going to work on question number two.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, I want us to work on how we answer the questions, not necessarily the information we already know about the water on the moon um but just how we answer the question okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you see how there could be some confusion there.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yes, I see that you know a lot about space, but we're also going to further what we're going to know about space and use our knowledge about space to figure out more on the water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Everyone takes their own pace.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"You need a - oh the miscroscope. Yeah, the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Awesome. Does anyone else have any questions about their responses?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yeah, Chris or Oliver. Do you have questions?",,,,
Chris,150.1,"Well, I guess the thing that I was thinking was kind of what Luis was saying before, I still have a question about it because I went to NASA with my dad.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yeah, of course. And Oliver, do you have a question?",,,,
Oliver,150.1,Well basically I wrote the same thing as Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All right does anyone, excuse me does anyone else have any other questions.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that makes sense.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,Oh yeah I guess.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh okay well if that's the case and that's perfect and like I, so I would have the same note for Farrah as well.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense to you.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"yeah yeah it did okay I bought my answer, I did all pull some information from the text.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay well why don't you stick around for a few more minutes just we can hear because I want to talk about your answer after Jazmin's done., alright sound like a good plan?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Does that make sense, do you have any questions.",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,Still kind of confused.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, does that make more sense?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that make sense.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,yeah yeah yeah that does make sense okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,does anyone else have any other questions.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Okay, this one isn't a question, but now i'm just all thinking about my answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So we just finished reading Our texts water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, there's always more that you can learn. And if you feel that you are an expert on the topic, you can always share with your classmates, so they know more or just as much as you do.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Does that make sense,Luis?",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Okay, I can do that. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, so I was hearing some really great discussions on being said and I just want to focus on your responses individually.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Everyone so after reading all your answers.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,It seems that there's a little bit of confusion.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,You all feel very strongly towards the question of whether they would be or there wouldn't be and it seems that there is a divide between the yes and the no.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Luis,150.1,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does my suggestion makes sense would that have helped you,,,,
Teacher,150.1,give a different answer.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"I gotta say if if I think it's a valuable or not, I think.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"yeah yeah it does so, so, then I, my answer is right, I just. Wait actually what was wrong with my answer, because you, you said that I did good because I answered the question and I said yes.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, we're just going to go through your guys' answers today just to make sure that we can have a full understanding in the broad spectrum of it. I think you all have a pretty good understanding, but I want to make sure you know fully what's going on.",,,,
Luis,150.1,OK.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"It's not always more, but I want you to be able to see where the evidence is coming from. Because then, I know that you know where the evidence is coming from.",,,,
Chris,150.1,OK. OK. Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Reading the text is very important.,,,,
Chris,150.1,OK. I think I got it.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So we're all in this group together, just because I wanted to pull you guys and make sure that we all understand together and work through our answers together in a group so even if.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,We believe that we're understanding everything I just want to make sure that is clarified among everyone okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, everyone, so we were working on our responses.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so that we can make sure we are understanding.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Okay, all right, paragraph two, it says lunar orbit our land at the south Pole and.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,All right does anyone have any questions about their responses and how they can help to make them better.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,i'm still kind of confused,,,,
Teacher,150.1,That makes sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,that's a very interesting question does anyone else have any questions or comments related to the question about what we were reading.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,A small question.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Hello Everyone, I know when we are working on. Our tasks in discussions with water on the moon. And I know we are gonna dive into what we read.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,we're gonna we're going to really dig deep into more detail and get you will get a good understanding of the text.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So I just want to make sure that everyone knows what they're reading and how we can really bring out the best in all of you guys.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh, Luis, you know plenty about space, but I just want to talk about what we learned in the text and what kind of interested us.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Oh, oh, OK.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you understand what I mean?,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Yeah, yeah. Because I went to NASA with my dad, so I do know about the Mars Rover and other things, too.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,You understand?,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"So you're saying if Farrah has the same answer as me, then I should try to find a different answer?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,You guys have any questions?,,,,
Chris,150.1,"It's not so much a question, but remember how I was telling you about how I went to NASA with my dad? So yeah, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, too.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"um Luis  I saw you guys seen this group, because I think that all your answers showed really good understanding of space, but I think that we could just get a little bit closer a little bit more specific have an answer to the questions.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Okay, I guess, I can stick our out.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Alright guys let's come back together now and let's share let's share the words that we chose in our groups.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"i'm Luis I think that you guys all have it figured out, but I think that if we just look at it a little more in depth, we could just get our answers to that much better",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And we are going to look at our answers to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So let's look deeper into that Luis.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"I got my part in paragraph two, I just didn't say the name of the machine, but I had it.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,but we are going to look a little bit deeper.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All right, well let's try to listen and maybe help our friends along the way okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So let's.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Try to think about why we have to use.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense. Do you see that,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Oh yeah, I see it.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,What about making is that making more sense to you.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Oh, I don't think I know I don't understand why I'm why it's not the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,the microscope. Good job. Farrah. So does everybody understand?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"I think so, um, you know what I just realized it's it's time for us to go to lunch, but I did want to say",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Luis, you are very smart. But there you've got to remember there is always room for us to grow and improve and learn more, OK?",,,,
Luis,150.1,OK.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Anybody else have a question?,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"It's not a question. But I was just looking at the clock, and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So we just read a little excerpt about the moon. Correct.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Did you guys enjoy water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yes, water on the moon. Did you guys enjoy the reading.",,,,
Farrah,150.1,Mm hmm.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,And I want to just go over a couple of your answers.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,And that's why I pulled you,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Guys, excuse me.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, anybody else have any questions before we dive into our answers.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"We're just going to look deeper into them and kind of, you can explain your thinking to me. So then I can understand better and we can help each other, understand better so that sound good.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So that's great. Well, we're all going to just go over answers and see if there's anything to make them even better than they are now. Because you never know, you might even learn something new too.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay. Okay, anybody else have any questions before we dive into our answers.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So I want you to reread your answer that you gave And then raise your hand if you have any questions or if you think your answer is good or if you want to say something while your answer or ask why we're going to be really looking at your answer. So make sure it answers that question.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,But do you see how rereading back to the first sentence and paragraph to how the lunar lunar orbiter was something that they use to actually discover the water. Do you see the difference between that in the microscope?,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Honestly, not totally like I got back. Maybe they used both, but I don't really see why it's not the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Is that making sense to you. Farrah as well.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Yeah, yeah. I understand it better now.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you understand now how it's more of the lunar order that they use to discover the water,,,,
Luis,150.1,"I mean, that sounds like a pretty good answer. I mean, I think also Chris's answer. I mean, with all the oxygen tanks and stuff. That was pretty good.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So cool, you know, lots of books space. Right. Yes. You're going to help us out. Maybe the article can teach you a couple things to that'd be pretty cool expand your knowledge.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you see how we could use that information.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Wonderful. I'm glad you're all here. Did you all read the assignment that I send out to you about finding water on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Yes, we did.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, so I would like all five of you to take your papers out and have it in front of you, because we're going to be using highlighters and the pages.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,To find information within the text. Can you all do that.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Um, well, actually, our story. It's on our tablet right in front of us, so we can see it there.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So we do we all agree that The main point of the first paragraph is that there's water in craters on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I'm seeing some nods. Well done. All right, let's move on to the second paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Right. Give me a raised hand to show me that you are done, highlighting the main point in the second paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Thank you. All right. Who's ready to move on to the third paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Doing good. Thank you for asking. So you all read a passage about discovering water on the moon. Is that correct,",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yeah, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And together we're going to come up with a really good answer that uses all of your really great answers. We're going to come together. We're going to make a much better one.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So I see Farrah, and Oliver had the same answer. And I'm going to give all of you. Some targeted feedback to help you work on re answering this question,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Try to expand your knowledge about equipments that's astronauts might use they use things beyond suits and oxygen tanks as well. There is some equipment in this passage that maybe you've never encountered before. And you might discover yet another thing that's that astronauts us,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Okay, yeah, I'll look for all look for some new stuff.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Very good. So we are going to do some discussion of your answers to the second question that was posed to all of you. And one thing that I want to tell all of you guys about this question. Yes. Luis,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Um, I just want to remind do my dad as actually an astronaut.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"so you all have some really great answers, but I want to dig into them a little further.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Great, are there any other questions.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so we've all had some responses and I want to talk about them a little bit more.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"and you've all had some really good answers, and I can see you're working really hard.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All of you have done an excellent job and I know that you all are great thinkers, I think that we can work a little bit harder to make your answers the absolute best you can. Do you have a question.",,,,
Luis,150.1,Excuse me.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,You do Luis You absolutely do. And your answer was so good that I think we can make it even better. Are you willing to be flexible and think with me.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Um, yeah, okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"How's it going,",,,,
Chris,150.1,"Well, I'm sure because because I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yes. Great, great. I'm sorry if that was a little confusing for you, but yes. Does that make a little more sense.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Nice to see you too. So today, we can do something really fun in this small group, we're going to be reading detectives. Okay, so I need us all.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Cool detective hats and we're going to be looking in the text for answers. Okay Luis Do you have a question.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yeah, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So today we're going to be reading detectives.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"connecting the information in your brain is also going to help you a lot, but I just want to make sure that you're getting the best answer. You can, is that okay",,,,
Luis,150.1,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,I mean that is going to really be helpful. Were you listening when I was talking to Chris early earlier.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Right we have this knowledge in our brain. And then we have this stuff on the text.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Are you ready to be a reading detective.,,,,
Luis,150.1,And protective caps on here we go.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And you know what that might add to that information that's in your brain, you might learn something new.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Okay, yeah. Good for him.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So can anybody tell me what you guys were just reading about,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Can anybody tell me what this article was about,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Yeah, I can.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Tell me what was this article about,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Well, it was about how they found water. The phone craters are full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does anybody else want to add anything else interesting that they weren't from this article.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does anybody else want to add anything else while we have a few minutes left. Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Um, well, I also sent them microscope like Oliver and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Luis I'm sure you do. And there's always more room for us to learn more about space which is exactly why we're here today. I've been reading over your answers and I wanted us to take a second look at this text to see if there's any to see if we can make our responses. Even better.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Raise your hand if you have questions about what you're supposed to do right now.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,I don't see anybody raising their hand. This means that we understand what we need to do.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Welcome to reading task water on the moon. Have you read it?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Yeah, we've all read it already.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Did you have the chance...,,,,
Luis,150.1,We read it. We read it already.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you agree.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Any other questions.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Hello, boys and girls I'm, what I'm going to do today is to introduce you a new strategy together, then you are going to practice it, and in a small group and I will come to talk to you a little more individually later if you still have some progress. Okay.",,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Yeah, that sounds great.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"If you understand what I'm saying, please. Nod your head to let me know.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Great so do you Notice what Luis said?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Um, yeah, he he read the whole sentence. And so it said the name of the machine.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yes, so the machine is the Lunar Orbiter, do you agree?",,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Yeah, yeah. That's what it says in the text.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And if you understand what I'm saying please know that your head to let me know.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Teacher : That's okay, Luis. We're gonna talk more about space today. My name is Miss Teacher and I'm going to be working with you.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Teacher : Correct?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,That's correct.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Teacher : Does that make sense. Luis,,,,
Luis,150.1,"So you're saying like, because it's, um, it's not in the story.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Luis That's awesome. That you know so much about space, but we're going to expand our knowledge today as a group. Okay.",,,,
Luis,150.1,OK. OK.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright. Are we all set, or do we need more time.",,,,
Chris,150.1,I think we're ready.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Right. So you have some background knowledge. So let's read and see if we can find any other pieces of equipment. Okay.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Okay, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay so Oliver. Can you summarize what Farrah just said for me?,,,,
Oliver,150.1,All yeah I sure can she said that on the,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Reading. My name is Teacher, so we're going to be digging a little bit deeper into our discussion questions on reading about water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh yeah, I believe it, but there's always more to learn. No matter what the subject and even if you know all about space right now.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So I like a lot of these answers, but why don't we, I think that we need to take a step back with some of these answers.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"My name is Teacher, and today I'm going to be helping you with our comprehension questions from the text that we read about the moon.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So we're all here together because there's we all know we all answered the questions individually, but we all could use a little bit of work on just fixing those answers. Just a little bit. Yes. Luis",,,,
Luis,150.1,"I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you have a question.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Yeah, so actually I went to NASA. So I know that scientists do use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,We're going to be going over our responses to our comprehension question regarding the text on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make a little more sense. Luis,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I thought. That's kind of what I thought our first place that it was was most like that. The lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does anyone else have any other questions to clarify this response.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So you all read water on the moon. Right.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh, that's wonderful to have your background knowledge. I just want to make sure that everybody understands this text. This particular text okay by this author",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Okay, okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All right. It shouldn't take too long. If there's just a double, double check that you understand what I want you to understand. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh, that's awesome. So yes, we all revise and corrected our answers. I just wanted to take some time today to reflect and make sure",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"That it's really our learning is really set in stone. Okay, so, um,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,We are going to take a few minutes to reflect on our takeaways from our revised answers.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,That's wonderful. We all corrected our answers and be revised it and I just want to make sure that,,,,
Teacher,150.1,I just want to hear your takeaways and reflections.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Right. Does that make sense Farrah?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Yeah, can I try again.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, let's just let's use the same approach we used for Farrah, and then answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Why should we look for you worked with Jazmin and Luis right?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Awesome. So today in our small group, we are going to be discussing our reading that we did have about water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does anyone want to add to that anything that they heard while I was reading,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Right. Nice job. All right. Does anyone else have anything they want to add to this discussion, Oliver. What do you want to add",,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Well, actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Awesome. I'm excited to learn some more about water on the moon with you guys today.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Wow, I'm sure you know, tons about space, but we're always open to learning more and more so.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Alright so what we're going to talk about now. Did you all get a chance to read through the text again and maybe come up with some new answers about the machine that was used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Yeah, we all, we all took some time and we read it again.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you understand why I had you do this.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Oh no, not really. I just added more details.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Yeah, okay. So in the part about where they actually find the water are talking about the small machine.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, well, we're just going to talk a little bit more",,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay I love talking about space.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yeah, I do too. That's our we're gonna all talk a little bit more about this so that we can keep learning",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Yeah, so I guess I was picturing like all this water but really it was just like, like a little, little ice deposits",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Is that makes sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does everyone understand these instructions.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yeah, I think so. So we're talking and sharing and then rereading to find our partners answers.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so let's continue reading through and seeing what else we found that we can add to our answers.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So continue from where we left off. I'm gonna keep talking to Jazmin.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So, Jazmin. You were looking at Chris's answer.",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Chris Chris, and he said, scientists found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,I think the last one. So you were looking at Luis's answer right.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"He looked at Luis's answer, and he was talking about the oxygen tanks and stuff, but it sounds like that's not really the right answer.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,I'm going to go back over to Oliver and savannas group. So keep working.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Okay, okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"How did we enjoy that text, the water on the moon.",,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Oh, it was so cool.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,I'm glad you liked it. Does anyone want to share anything important that they read,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Luis You said you know a lot about space, you want to share anything else.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So I like that we were thinking, did anyone else want to add something?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"You too. Okay, so today we are talking about our article that we read about water on the moon. And I see that you've all answered your questions here.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Um, yeah, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,I want to go over a couple of things. So did we just read an article,,,,
Farrah,150.1,About about water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, friends, usually in my classes when students agree we go like this, but if you agree. You can raise your hand if you disagree with savannas thoughts and just keep your hand down and we respectfully agree and respectfully disagree. Right.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Great. I love space to I want us to put on our science minds and only think about the article that we read. So in the article that we read a read it out loud for us.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,And I'm so excited that I got to hear all of your answers because together we can explore more about the moon and more about scientific tools and what scientists have used for their equipments to discover some moon aspects and I hear every student has a different answer.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,That's so important because what does that tell me,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Well, some of us are right and some of us are wrong?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Very good. Jazmin. Thank you for sharing. So here, nobody is wrong or nobody is right, we're all going to learn together and we're going to explore",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Why there are different tools and different equipment to help scientists to make different discoveries,,,,
Teacher,150.1,You're going to listen and fully listen to your partner.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,For number one the first task you have two minutes and for number two. The second task you have two minutes. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Any questions.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,I think we're ready. I think we're ready to go.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Let me know if you have any questions.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so we're going to continue right where we left off, Farrah. Did you go back to your texts and reread paragraphs one and two?",,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Yes, I did.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, are you ready to share what you got what the new partner.",,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Well, I didn't work with a partner, yet I just rewrote it and I found that they talked about a machine.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Are there any questions.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"No, I think that sounds good.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Are you able to add to your Answer.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Not yet i'm i right now. I mean, I know what the microscope is a tool.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Thank you for asking. Luis. Then I'm going to work with you.,,,,
Luis,150.1,Sweet.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Right, and no student is wrong. We all have different ideas and together we can put our ideas and put our ideas together and have a whole list of tools that help scientists discover the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Good to see you too. I think that we should talk about our answers and relating to the text that we just read because I'm on getting the idea that you  May not have completely understood the equipment that was used to find that water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does everyone understand that. Can you give me a thumbs up or raise your hand if you if that is making sense.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"I'm still a little confused, actually.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense when you go back and look at the question that was asked.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Oh yeah, well, I was thinking, like, how could you find something if you couldn't see it but i i got that maybe you have to find it first and then you can observe it.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does anyone else have any more questions.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Or need more clarification.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch. Actually, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for coming today and for helping us understand why I'm the lunar orbiter was the best to answer for the question. Um, so thank you so much.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"It's good to see you, too. I'm Teacher and I'm going to go over this question based on the text that we read",,,,
Teacher,150.1,When you know you can raise your hand and I will call on you.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So I'm going to give you a minute to go back,,,,
Teacher,150.1,And look for that word and see if it changes your answer in any way.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So I'm going to give you a minute to go back and read,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Ready when you have a new idea. You can raise your hand.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So let's do that for another minute.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"When you're ready, you can raise your hand.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Ways that it can be valuable. If we look back in the text. The text will give us so many different examples.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So I hope that we can modify. I hope that we can change our answers. After reading the text because now we have sources of evidence.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Well, I was thinking about another meaning of the word value like I'm like money and it talks about money and it says it would take a lot of money. So I was thinking it's not valuable because it takes too much money.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And can we find one more example because I want us to be prepared to re answer this question and in complete sentences, to the best of our ability and finishing our thoughts.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So right if you know things about space, but there's always more that we can learn. It's not that you don't know things about space as to why you're in this group because we can have a better understanding.",,,,
Luis,150.1,Oh ok ok ok that makes sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you understand what I'm saying.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So today I would like to go over some of the questions. Two questions that you guys have answered.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,That's good. This group wasn't formed because you don't know about space. It's just sometimes we can learn more when we work together.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,In small groups are like first of all to work together so we can learn from each other and work on bettering our responses to certain questions.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you understand,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh, that's pretty nice. Luis right now we're answering the question. Okay, so once we answer the question and finish what we're doing here. Maybe they'll have extra time to talk about stuff that relates to a question. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,For our next part of our discussion we're going to talk about why it's such a big deal that water is on the moon,,,,
Luis,150.1,um yeah I you know I really got this figured out I think I'm all good.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh well, let's let's talk about your answer because maybe if your answer so great, if we can probably help some of the others who are here",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"let's get back to the tax, have you found the correct answer Chris.",,,,
Chris,150.1,"Okay, so in the second paragraph, I saw that on them the equipment that Jazmin just said, the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So, have you found your answer.",,,,
Chris,150.1,"I think, so let me look back at.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,High. So today we're going to be talking about water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And we have a reading that I, I understand that you read it already. That is called the moon is a desert, right?",,,,
Luis,150.1,Excuse me.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so let's just start. Okay. So raise your hand if you are ready, read the lecture there. That is cool. The moon is a desert.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so you are ready, you have the knowledge of ready. Okay, so tell me about it. I want to know. After reading these these lecture, I want you to",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So remember, um, I want to listen to all of your thoughts.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Um, because I really think that all your thoughts are important. Okay. So because of your, of your opinions are important in their contribution good information for this class.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So I want to hear all of your ideas.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,Hi I'm Farrah well,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Nice to meet you too. I understood that you read the text already that the text is called water on the moon. Am I correct you read it already.,,,,
Luis,150.1,We read it already.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,That's great. But I think that all the time. We can learn something new.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So maybe you can learn something here and maybe we can help you to improve your knowledge or maybe you can help us to enter or knowledge or knowledge. Okay.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Okay, yeah, sounds good to me.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so we will also talk about it later. Okay, so in the beginning, I just wanted to know if you have the main ideas, clear and then we can talk more about it. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so yeah.  I'm going to be your teacher today. OK, so the you read the water on the moon text already, raise your hand if you read it.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Is that clear.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,Okay. So should we just talk to each other or,,,,
Teacher,150.1,That clear?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,I'm going to work with you in two different groups Farrah and Oliver. I'm going to start with you first.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,I know that you know a lot about space and I'm happy that you can bring that knowledge with you. I just wanted to work with the three of you to see if we can dig a little bit deeper into this question.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,I wanted to work with you three to look a little bit further into the question.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Hello class. Thank you for joining our group today I wanted to start off by reading the question to everybody and then thinking about what the most important part of the question is,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So we were we were investigating the water on the moon text. First, I want to ask you guys. Did you guys enjoy this test, did you learn anything from it, Luis. Go ahead.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Excuse me, I don't, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"The question. Let me ask you again, actually, who did you guys enjoy this. The short text, did you guys learn anything. How'd you like it.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,See some head nods. Anyone want to share,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Here this is Chris. I thought it was really cool that scientists, they found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"anyone else take anything from the text that was the main idea, but anything anyone else notice anything or think anything was cool.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I just want to, uh, before I wrap it up. I just want to come together and see if someone can give me A refined answer from what the what everything we just talked about, like, another answer maybe building on the original answer that you had to the question.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Jump back into the text into what we were doing before. Does anyone remember what we were working on before,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"When I got all your answers back to the prompt, there was a couple of things I wanted to go back over just to make sure that we're all on the same page.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And that we all can come to a solid answer for the prompt. So you might even find that you might even learn some new stuff today and too. So I'm glad that you're the expert. I appreciate that. Thank you.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"But I'm glad you're here today. And we've been reading some exciting news about water being discovered on the moon, of all places, right.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And I know some of you are totally see it as,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Luis. Hang on one second. I know some of you were really interested in that and had the same question I did like how did the scientists so far away, find water.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh no, it's great. We're going to get together and think about how we can read even further. To find out more information about our answers. So that's why we're here thinking about when we're reading by ourselves.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"There's there's tools we can use to find out even more when we're interested in, in an answer. So that's what we're here today and it's good that there's a small group.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Is we can help each other and you can help me to kind of dig down into our article that's called close reading. Have you done close reading before,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,Like in an English class.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yeah, yeah. So believe it or not, we can do close reading in Science right and social studies to find out, we're looking for.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So to start, I'm so glad you're here today. We're all here today to help each other and we need to have some materials ready. So I wanted to ask you.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you all have your article and some cut something to market mark on it with,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Yes, we do.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Put your hand up if you have it in front of you just do a check to make sure you have your article and a pencil or pen or something to mark up to put your hand up if you have that. OK, I see four hands. Okay. Jazmin. Great. Good. This is early in the morning and",,,,
Teacher,150.1,I'm so impressed all set to go. Okay. You can put your hands down. And let's make sure before we continue doing any reading. Let's make sure we're clear about what we're looking for.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So one tool to help us is to make sure we look at the question really carefully that's going to give us some clues or some science to what look for.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Oliver. Do you remember that question from yesterday.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Yeah, yeah, I do.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, I want you all to look at your at your you Oh, do you have that question in front of you.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay. So you hit you see it Farrah. Is it on your paper.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so, and here I put it. Put your hands up and just show me that you can all see the question at the top of your paper.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All right. Awesome. Okay, you can put your hands down. Here's my first job for you.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, are we ready to go around and discuss a little bit more about what we read. Awesome. Okay, so, Farrah and Oliver. I'm going to start with you guys. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so what we're, we will take a little bit more time and dig into that in a bit.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh well, you know the great thing about being in groups is that you might know a lot about space somebody else might.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And whenever somebody thinks they have the answer just raise your hand and i'll call on you.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, you are right, but I also just want you to be able to you know, see the bigger picture and kind of say that was one part of the equipment, but.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,yeah so that's kind of like they use First they use the Lunar orbiter and then I use a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh well, you know that's the great part about being in a group, we all have different strengths, we bring to it, so you may know a lot about space, but you know I think there's always something you can learn",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,Yeah. Yeah,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that kind of make more sense about where you're kind of going and what we're looking for with the question?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense?,,,,
Chris,150.1,yeah yeah I guess.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So even if you know all about space right I think it's still useful to be able to read articles like this and find evidence for questions that we're trying to answer so hopefully you'll still get something out of this group today does that sound okay.,,,,
Luis,150.1,That sounds okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that sound right.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"yeah I think so, what do you think.",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,Great.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,That feel like a little bit more of a complete answer to you.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,yeah yeah I think it makes my answer more complete yeah just like you said.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,equipment is the answer to the question does that sound good.,,,,
Chris,150.1,yeah yeah That would be good.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,so maybe you guys can take a look at that does that sound good.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,Okay yeah sure.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay Luis well, I think that we are all here to learn from each other we're all here to learn from the article.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"You guys read the the article about water on the moon, is that correct?",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Yeah, we read that.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,so make sense Luis?,,,,
Luis,150.1,"yeah so like I should make sure that I, I guess, like look closely at the reading is, that is, that is, that right?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"But part of why we're here really yeah thanks is is honestly to understand you know one another's perspectives and maybe there's something that say Chris can share, about space that you know that I don't know or that Oliver doesn't know and vice versa,",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So I think we're all here just to support each other's learning and understanding each other's perspective so thanks for raising that Luis.,,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,yeah totally so let's let's dig into that now.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"i'm so pleased to work with you today, I always learned so much from each of you, so I wanted to let you know, so why we're here so based on the responses and I i've identified some areas that I think that we can revisit The text together to just really strengthen our understanding.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"As I mentioned, I learned from you guys every day so we're here to work together to just deepen all of our understandings on the text.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And, based on the responses that each of you provided, I do think that there are some areas which i've identified where we can revisit and strengthen your understanding about space about the moon, and about water on the moon that sound okay.",,,,
Luis,150.1,um yeah okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,That is precisely it you know what it's extra difficult when something is unfamiliar to us and.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"but for a lot of us and spaces just totally for, and I mean let's be honest, none of us have been there before right.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I brought you here because I would love to discuss with you, your responses to some of the questions after we read our article about water on the moon, yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,yeah um I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So I wanted to let you know that I brought you into the group because there's always opportunity for us to grow our understandings of a topic, even if we know a lot about them.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,does everyone understand that.,,,,
Luis,150.1,um yeah okay yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"To really comprehend what's going on there,",,,,
Chris,150.1,"Okay i've said that scientists found craters, full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So Please go back and read it again and then find out something you may find something new.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So you guys just got done with reading the moon, is a desert.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So we just read the water on the moon passage in class right?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,but we are talking about the moon specifically today and I just want to go over a couple of our response questions that we can make sure we all understand the vocabulary that we learned in this lesson and we can all be on the same page does that sound good.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"yeah awesome Thank you so much, and we know that the moon is kind of one big rock so it seems like there's a lot of geology that's going to happen going on in the moon, huh?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Yes, and that's how they found the water on there right.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,do you guys have anything else that you think that hasn't already been shared by Farrah and Oliver that you think that is super exciting that you think now that you didn't understand before?,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Um Actually teacher Oh, something that is super exciting is that it's time for lunch.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,awesome i'm really excited to work with you all to my name is Teacher you can call me Teacher if you'd like um and I wanted to get right into discussing the passage that you guys read yes Luis.,,,,
Luis,150.1,um yeah Teacher I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Do you understand the difference.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that make sense to Luis.,,,,
Chris,150.1,Ah um yeah I can see that.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,so when you think about it that way does it make a little bit more sense that the answer would be the Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oliver or Chris, I know you also had had your hands up was there, something that you either one of you wanted to share.",,,,
Chris,150.1,Oh yeah well I sort of like Farrah it really blew my mind that there was all this water on the moon like these craters full of water oh it's so cool to picture and I really want to go and see it one day.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"i'm really excited to meet you guys too and i'm also really excited to talk about this reading i'm a science teacher, so I thought this was super cool did you guys read anything that you thought was interesting in that passage.",,,,
Chris,150.1,yeah I I thought it was so amazing how how the scientists they found craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"yeah I think so too i'm really excited to get to talk to you guys about this text today because i'm a science teacher, so I thought this article was really, really interesting so let's dig in a little bit to our question today.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"i'll give you guys all a second. hang on Chris i'm going to give you guys all second to go back and revise then I want to hear from Farrah and to else haven't I heard from yet, I think.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Luis have I heard from you?,,,,
Luis,150.1,Nah but I'm ok.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Luis can I pause you for one second. we're going to hear what Farrahs was thinking and then we're all going to get a chance to revise before we continue okay.,,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Excellent they use the Lunar orbiter to discover it. Oliver, you said the same exact thing as Farrah. Does that make a little more sense to you?",,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Oh, I think so um but I guess um I don't know how I would have picked that I think I think I still I still would have picked the microscope um until you told me to look at paragraph two.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that makes sense Jazmin?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, that I mean we all have parts of knowledge that we love and are passionate about, but I just want to make 100% I just want to be 100% clear that we all have gotten it and understood it.",,,,
Luis,150.1,Oh yeah oh OK that's fine.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Well we're just going over our journal answers to talk and discuss in maybe learn more from our friends who are in our class with us.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,okay any questions before I say go.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that make sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,That you're necessarily wrong we're just going and pushing our thinking to think more deeply about what we're reading about does that make sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,hi it's nice to see you all again and I am excited for us to dig deeper and understanding about water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,150.1,does anyone have any questions.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Is anybody else confused um I don't know if you guys can do, and I agree sign, but we that's that's what I do in real life so i'm Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,150.1,"On yeah i'm confused too because, while we both said microscope and there's evidence and the text but there's also the machine and I don't know what the right answer is.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So while we're using space as a context for this actually our classes more about learning how to extract information from readings so it's more of a reading exercise, rather than a space exercise.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,And while you reread that Luis out i'll move on to Jazmin .,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense to everyone.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,um I have a question.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh that's great and what did you think of it, oh yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"yeah um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this room, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so who can tell me what the article is about.",,,,
Chris,150.1,"I can, I can I.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,What else do you remember from the article.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay does anyone else have any questions before we get started.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,I don't.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,You think you could do that?,,,,
Chris,150.1,yeah yeah yeah that's sounds exciting oh yeah i'll add that right now.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well you don't need to necessarily have background knowledge about space, so you read the article.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Hi class, so I just got through looking over your responses and I just wanted to probe a little bit deeper so Farrah look at yours again.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, so I heard some great ideas from the class. Thank you all for sharing. Why don't we start with Oliver and Farrah. So I saw some - actually before we get there, Luis you have a hand up. Do you have a question for me?",,,,
Luis,150.1,yeah well actually I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So right now, if everyone has their texts in front of them. Can I get a thumbs up or a yes, if you have your text still in front of you?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Thank you Luis and we got that straight from the text where Jazmin just read, for us. So now we have microscope and lunar orbiter. Jazmin was really nice and that she respectfully disagree disagree dwith Farrah and Oliver.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Thank you Chris. Anyone disagree or want to push back on that? Or we all agree that these two words can be used as synonyms?,,,,
Chris,150.1,So can I add something too about equipment?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So does anyone have questions or want to disagree with that statement? Oliver, you have a hand up what are you thinking?",,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Well, actually I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So it's really nice to have you all in a small group together, I know you just read your passage on water on the moon. oh yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,um yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that makes sense?,,,,
Oliver,150.1,i'm still a little confused cuz I said the same as Farrah. I said the microscope um and so i'm still a little unsure why it's the Lunar orbiter that's the right answer and how I would how I would have picked that on my own. I think I would still pick the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that help clarify?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"hi Farrah and Jen and Chris and Jazmin he said i'm excited to talk to you today, we were talking about earlier with discovering water on the moon so Chris Oh yes, even What would you like to say.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"i'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that help.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Here, because sometimes other people know more about other things than us, we want to make sure that we all hear each other out there Jazmin had a great answer and you just expanded on it, so we all get to work together here, which is awesome.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, students, so we just talked a little bit about the type of machinery they use to discover the water on the moon, and I think we need to- yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group. I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,If you think it's the Lunar orbiter raise your hand.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"OK, I see two hands two hands awesome okay you can put your hands down. if you think it is the microscope raise your hand.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,love the um does anyone else have any questions before we dive into the discussion prompt that you'll have given me answers for Jazmin house and the Farrah are you good.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,yeah I think we're ready to go.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"um so did all if you read the other three passages, but for the moon, is a desert.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Very good amazing OK, so now that we have a fair idea of what equipment means let's try to read let's try to figure out the answer this question in context um so before that that me.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Beautiful do you have a text in front of you as well.,,,,
Luis,150.1,yeah yeah it's right here.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And I love to hear from two other scholars and you, you can also comment on it, and you can also share your thoughts whenever while you're raising your hands but um.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,um why don't you um let's just hang tight for a minute okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Great Okay, so you guys just read a very short article. Yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"um yeah excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"yeah because you guys were right on the right track, we just had to make that one little jump.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,You guys did one small step towards learning and now we did another giant step towards learning so enjoy lunch thanks for coming.,,,,
Luis,150.1,By.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"hi everyone i'm so glad that you were able to come join me at for a small group, so we can talk a little bit more about what you were just reading and talking about related to the moon. So before we start can we, oh Luis, did you have a question.",,,,
Luis,150.1,um yeah I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Great i'm really glad to hear that so we're going to talk a little bit more about this and ways that we can go even deeper into our text.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"In a group of small, a smaller group, instead of our whole entire class as one.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,we are going to try to go a little bit deeper into our text today.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"You can shake your head, yes or no, if you can.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,But but let's go back to talking about the Lunar orbiter because I just thought that was so interesting.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Is that you mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like lots of oxygen tanks and I wanted to hear a little bit more about some of the other equipment they use and just kind of get your perspective on it and start a conversation with your classmates.,,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,And we're going to continue yeah definitely I really like it we're going to continue talking about legos as a way to help us understand what we're talking about in this article so Farrah what's the difference i'm sorry did somebody say something.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"Yes, me i'm sorry to interrupt.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,So the answer is just both.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So today we're going to talk about your responses to the reading that we did about NASA.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well i'm glad that you're really interested in space, and I think that being a part of this group you'll learn from your.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Luis why don't we listen to our fellow classmates and see what they have to say, and maybe we can learn some new things.",,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay okay okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that make sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh i'm excited to work with you to my name is Teacher and i'm here to discuss the feedback... i'm here to give you the feedback that, for your responses about the study of water on the moon right so let's begin, are you guys ready to begin?",,,,
Luis,150.1,um excuse me. I I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well i've reviewed all of your responses in detail and I noticed some very interesting patterns, so the aim of our discussion today is to Oliverelop your responses further oh hi yeah Luis you have a question.",,,,
Luis,150.1,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,stick with us and let's see what we can learn from each other as well.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So, are you guys ready to share back with the class.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Chris, so does that clarify the quantity of the water for you.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So, at the end of this entire activity i'd like to know if you feel that you have been able to answer this question in a more in more detail, yes Chris.",,,,
Chris,150.1,"it's not that question, but I was just thinking about some of the other equipment on the moon, and so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,because we are right now looking for a very specific equipment in response to a question.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So do you think all of you have a clear answer now, do you think our response has evolved to we can Can someone summarize the final answer for me in one clear statement.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, so can we look at some of the questions that you answered about what you've read about the moon?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Farrah do you understand,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"yeah yeah I was gonna say that does make more sense than it did before, but also, I just looked at the clock and.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Great, thank you for reading for us. Um Farrah. do you have more, a little more idea about lunar orbiter right now?",,,,
Farrah,150.1,So I guess it just it looks in the craters. Is that right?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"You got it now, Luis?",,,,
Luis,150.1,yeah I got it now. I can see why the orbiter is a better answer yeah than the oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"um you know today we're just going to have a little conversation and yeah i'd love for you to bring in all that outside knowledge, because.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,what do you think.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,um yeah I I could see that yeah I could see that because maybe they don't they don't have it yet.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"awesome it's great to see you guys, so you guys just read that article write about water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And Farrah the reasons why we wanted to in this group, so that you can bring your expertise to talk about that microscope for us okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So we thank you, we appreciate you for that anybody else have any other information that they read or anything that they got from the article that they want to share with us.",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"um yeah so I picked I picked something different from Farrah so i'm wondering, because I said NASA send a small machine and I thought that the small machine seemed really important.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,how do you feel about that.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Some responses on your questions and I wanted to work with you guys, to see if we could delve a little deeper into understanding the concepts yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"um yeah excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"yeah so Oliver it's so important in this space for us to know that everyone is doing their own thinking, and I know that you have such a valuable thinking to offer in this space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Great and there's a second part to that question that says circle, do you see that part.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"um oh okay yeah there are this circle, the evidence and the text where Oh, that we can use to answer this question.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"yeah great question and Oliver, I really want you to pay close attention to what's Farrah and I are talking about and i'd like you to jump into because you had the same answer as Farrah okay.",,,,
Oliver,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I actually chose all of you, because I think all of your insights are very valuable and I really want to hear a lot more about what you're thinking",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All right, thank you so much, so what I wanted I want us to do today is to take a step back from the text and take a really close look at the question that we're answering",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,I can read it.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All right, what do we think do we think that investigating is a similar kind of thing to discovering.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"that's really fascinating and makes me think that maybe sometime later, we should have a discussion about.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"i'm your teacher and i'm excited to talk to you today meet for a little bit to discuss what we all just read from water on the moon, which is pretty exciting hi yes Luis you have a question.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"yeah um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh well, that's really that's helpful, but the reason we're in this group is, I wanted to explore a little more deeply i'm really interested in what you understand about this article overall right and how how the whole process works.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,What they use to look at it was microscopic does that makes sense,,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that make sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense Chris yeah yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Good morning everybody- I guess it's afternoon now! so you've all just shared your answers with me and they were awesome answers. I think we can do a little bit better so we're going to push our thinking today. Yeah, Luis, I see you raise your hand, what can I help you with Luis?",,,,
Luis,150.1,um yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Look everybody's ready.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,I can go.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,awesome sounds good okay so before we begin does anyone have any questions about why their answer may not have been exactly correct.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that make sense.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Oh, the small machine.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that make sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,and revise our responses.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, everyone, so it seems like we all have sort of different answers to this question, right now, so I want us to take a step back and look back at the text and the question, to see if we can all come to an understanding yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"i'm excuse me, I shut me in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, everyone so it's so interesting to hear all of your responses, because it sounds like i'm hearing a few different things you know, the more everyone seems to have a different response yeah Luis have a question.",,,,
Luis,150.1,yeah well i'm I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, so i'm noticing a lot of different responses and I want us to make sure that we have just a general understanding of the text so everyone has really good specific details and different questions yeah even.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"But I want us to look back at this question and we're going to debrief as a whole group, and then I want you to think about how the advice that i'm giving the whole group applies to your question does that sound good.",,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,amen so look at your response and then think about like does your the response that you wrote answer both of those two things.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,You on musk such a card all right let's come back to this question up front right so everyone sort of has different answers.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And everyone has really good parts of answers and some parts that we can work on, so I want to give you a strategy that I think would be really helpful for us to like make our responses more concise and find out what we're looking for.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So, now that we know exactly what we want to find yes ma'am.",,,,
Farrah,150.1,"yeah excuse me, I have all those, so I don't understand why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,maybe even could could we get started looking at your your answer and maybe we can work together to try to see if that worked with the text and we can all learn from each other how's that sound.,,,,
Luis,150.1,That sounds great yeah let's do it.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So okay i'm wondering if we can maybe move to another student and let's try to see some of their answers and how we can get closer to the answer in the text. Sound good Luis.,,,,
Luis,150.1,um yeah yeah okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So um did you all read the text about water on the moon?,,,,
Luis,150.1,"Um yeah we all read it, but I I don't think I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So today what we will do is to probe into this comprehension question and to have a classroom discussion.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So what we are going to do first is to work, individually and then we will go into free discussion and some elbow exchange.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,so could anyone like to have a dialogue about that.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"But we are just going back over this question, we want to get as much out of this text as possible, even if you already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"they're still lots that we can learn from this passage, I promise, so if we could all just look",,,,
Teacher,150.1,that's a really good point anything I think that's a great explanation does that make sense.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,yeah so what they did use a microscope at some point right.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So Oliver are you still wondering about the microscope can we explain that a little better.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,are so um yeah i'm still wondering about when they use it.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, we are working towards the fullest most correct answers to this question possible together so we're going to try to help each other as a group, come to responses that completely answered the question does that sound okay.",,,,
Luis,150.1,um yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,hi everyone i'm so excited to meet you. My name is Teacher and i'm excited to be here. So we're talking about this article about water on the moon right?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh yeah that's great um so Luis i'm glad you're here because we're gonna be talking a lot about space, this is not a group for people that don't know about space, this is a group for people that are excited to learn more about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,hi everyone okay so we're going to keep talking about equipment,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Oh okay well let's jump to that one and then we'll come back to number two,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"um but after after hearing them, I think that some might be too specific and some may be too general, I think that you're all just slightly off. Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,um well I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"um and I think Luis although your response was very interesting, I think that we can fine tune it a little to make it even better okay.",,,,
Luis,150.1,yeah okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So I think that um do you guys want to modify your response now to make sure that it hat encompasses all that yeah def.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,"yeah well, we definitely will but right now we have to go to lunch.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I love that you guys Thank you so much, and if, when you come back next time, try to reflect a little bit about how you learned from this experience.  deb Thank you so much for that response you guys did a wonderful job today Thank you all so much.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,awesome i'm excited to hear about what you understand in these paragraphs.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,um do you all have some responses that you've prepared about the text that you read about water on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"On yes, we do um do you wanna do you want to hear them.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,that's awesome well I bet there are a few things that you don't know so i'm excited as you grow your learning today.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,On not yet I think we're gonna we're going to talk a little bit more about what Oliver had for his answer.,,,,
Oliver,150.1,Oh yeah I circled the same thing that Farrah did you.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"hi alright, so today we're going to talk a little bit about your responses to the question about the article, we read about NASA would anyone like yeah Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Excuse me teacher, I don't think I should be in this group biology know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that help.,,,,
Chris,150.1,yeah yeah yeah to kind of think more.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"hey also Farrah Chris and Luis have shared some revised responses and will we kind of need to go through them a little bit just as a group, to see where we're at",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"It does, I mean I just like don't like to write, you know I mean I feel like when I get the answer I got it and that's good.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well we're still going to go through the rest of everybody else's So if you could help us like us, are thinking and pay attention to the other folks is they waited for you, that would be really great.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So you might also help us be able to think a little bit deeper.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"That feels like a really thorough answer to me, does it feel like a thorough answer to you.",,,,
Farrah,150.1,"yeah yeah I wrote a lot more um I mean I wrote a lot more like not words but you know, like from my from my brain i'm in the second answer than because the first answer was from the story.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So we have the Lunar orbiter in there, which is specificity right Luis right Jazmin we were talking about specificity earlier great.",,,,
Farrah,150.1,So specificity.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay Thank you everyone for sharing i'm going to ask you to think a little about your answers and i'm going to ask for a little more detail from each of you.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All of it, I think we can always learn more",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay well we'll start with Jazmin and then we'll come to you how does that sound.,,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay that's fine great.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Quick does everyone know what a crater is.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,we're seeing how we can use different parts of the text to talk about an earlier part.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,The great thing about reading is that you can always ask more questions and deeper questions.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,I think we can push it a little more,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that help?,,,,
Farrah,150.1,yeah yeah that does.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Did anyone else have anything that they found very interesting? Oliver.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"and maybe they have something that they know that they can share with you, how does that sound.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, so hi class, so I pulled the five of you aside just because I wanted to take a closer look at our answers to the first question for this reading",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, did everyone have enough time?",,,,
Teacher,150.1,we're gonna figure it out together.,,,,
Jazmin,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,yeah so let's let's keep talking about it so.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"hi everyone thanks for joining me here today, so we just read a short passage about water on the moon, and I got to read all of your responses and I just wanted to see if we could.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,How does that sound.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay sounds good was there a reason you were unable to read this passage or anything that I can assist you with.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"i'm now, I think I was probably just thinking about my own space and watching videos on YouTube.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay sounds good, well, maybe next time we can try and read our passage first and then see if we can come back and spend some time on those extra tasks without sound Okay, so that we can make sure that we're fully in the conversation right.",,,,
Luis,150.1,uh huh okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"i'm going to go ahead and share the game plan with you for today and then maybe we can talk about why I felt like we should all be talking together in a small group to learn from each other, does that sound okay.",,,,
Luis,150.1,yeah okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"After that we are going to give each of you some time, maybe two or three minutes to revise your response, and then we will share with our small group does that sound like a good plan.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Can I get a thumbs up yeah yeah okay.,,,,
Luis,150.1,that's a good plan yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,okay does that sound good.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"that sound good i'll give you about a few minutes to do that, while I go talk to another okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And after you have shared your answer with me, I am going to have you listened to our other friends responses all right, and I want you to think about their thinking, as well as you're thinking yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, we are going to learn today after our conversation about ways in which all of us can improve our responses so, even though we may know a lot about space there's still room for improvement for all of us, and so that's why we've all been working together on the side all right Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so, while you work on that i'm going to go ahead and move to our other friends does that sound good Jazmin or do you have any questions.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Does that make sense.,,,,
Chris,150.1,Okay okay.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"that's funny I have heard about that I heard about that, on the news so that's great that you know something about Pluto I think today we'll talk a little bit about water on the moon, because that's what we read about in our article.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay um so yeah I think the one thing I noticed when I was looking at our answers to today's questions is that I think we've got a little bit of room to expand our understanding of the text.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So I think if we chat together and put some of these pieces together we're all going to end up with really improved answers, so I think for this first question.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So maybe if we kind of glue all of this, together, we can come up with a clear answer so, can you raise your hand if you said no, that the water on the moon is not valuable.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"teacher Okay, I think I got this all figured out now so i'm all good.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,because I was wondering if we could raise our hand if we said that no the water was not valuable.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that make sense Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And so, in our first question we were talking about different types of equipment scientists use you all seem to know a little bit about that now.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"And now thinking about like if we do make it back to the moon and we're looking for water, might it be valuable for our future scientists, Oliver go ahead yeah.",,,,
Oliver,150.1,"I see that it's almost time for us to go, but I am thinking now okay so like it's not ready yet, but i'm like Chris said, like maybe by 2024 if they build a base on the moon, then they could",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so everybody had such great ideas and responses to the question and I loved hearing everybody's.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Now that all of you have shared your responses i'd like for you to sit face to face and have a group discussion of your responses to see whether or not you guys can figure out like which yeah, of course, Luis.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"Excuse me teacher, but I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,You guys have any more questions.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"yeah I had that equipment, I said on oxygen tanks, in my answer",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, that makes the response more complete, I guess, in a way.",,,,
Jazmin,150.1,"Oh well, cuz you told me that at the name of it, so I just added the name of it, I didn't add anymore after that.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"You you, you could always just jot down the information in the text to support a full response so that's how you do that.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,hi Farrah high Oliver hi Chris hi Jazmin hi Luis So do you guys want to talk about the feedback um know your responses for the question.,,,,
Luis,150.1,um yeah this is Luis I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,do you understand what i'm saying.,,,,
Chris,150.1,"Well, craters craters are really big.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that answer questions the one.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"um, how can, how can you find something that's too small to see don't need a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,and Luis that I believe that kind of answers your question right.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,is that all right.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"hi class so i'm Mr Z and you guys are going to work with me today to work with the text about a moon is a desert and we're going to go through the reading together and all here to answer any questions, yes.",,,,
Luis,150.1,um yeah Mr see I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,can you do that for me Luis.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,And I loved your responses and I just want to know a little bit more about it because i'm looking at the text and i'm a little confused too,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Okay, so a microscope it's something you look through, and when you look through it, it makes really tiny things on So you can see that.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All right, so I think you all you all just shared your responses and you all have sparked some thoughts",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Just from hearing just from hearing your responses i've i've been enlightened and i've been thinking about this question and what it's really asking. okay? um so i've heard, so I'm going to review your responses out loud. This is what I've heard.",,,,
Luis,150.1,Excuse me.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Oh okay wait so sorry, you said you shouldn't be in this group, because you know all about space?",,,,
Luis,150.1,Sure do.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Have you guys read the test, I did you.",,,,
Luis,150.1,"um yeah so we read it, we read about the water on the moon and i'm thinking I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Well, so do own to talk about the question.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,You were a lot about space right.,,,,
Luis,150.1,"yeah so about the equipment, I was thinking that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Help us to understand this test, so we are going to get an answer, based on this test.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,but let's focus on this test.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"To help us understand the context of the question, so now i'm going to read the question again and then we're going to keep what Farrah and Jazmin gave us um for us to understand the context of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So I put us to sit in this small group, because I really liked you guys's answer, but I wanted us to think more and think about what we read and try to reflect on our answers",,,,
Luis,150.1,um yeah so I shouldn't be and that's group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"I know, but we're just talking about it,",,,,
Luis,150.1,Okay yeah.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Exactly so that's how you know it was a good answer. Cuz you answered it.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,"Okay, so.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Okay does anyone else have any questions.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Okay, so we're going to go through and i'm going to ask you guys a little bit more about what you said, for your answers so once again, the question is.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So, not a problem um does anyone have any other questions about it.",,,,
Farrah,150.1,i'm i'm still kind of confused.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Great so I know you guys had a good mix of answers which is really good because it actually helps us get down to the root of.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,The actual answer that we're looking for right.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"All right, let's come back in 321.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Alright, so before we go back to her desk and just a moment let's make sure that we all come to agreement on a on a group answer okay.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"we want to make sure that you can combine the park, so you guys can all get the full answer does that make sense.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,So I know that we had just recently read a short exit water on the moon right.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,oh how's that sound?,,,,
Teacher,150.1,We've all read the article,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Are we good to start.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"sure when and remember this is not really a group for who knows about space and who doesn't this is more just, have we written an answer that completely answers this question.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"So, again it's not that your answers necessarily right or wrong there's always a way to make something better though right so let's take a look actually your is end of.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that make sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,who thinks that this is answering the question being asked raise your hand.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,so i'm curious to hear some of the ideas that we've come up with to help explain why water might be valuable there on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that sound good.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,does that makes sense.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Any other questions as we're updating our answers.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,Great fantastic so you just read water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,"Right fantastic Okay, so you read the article water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,"You circled evidence in the text, you can use to answer the question.",,,,
Teacher,150.1,Can you try to do a little rereading and find some more evidence.,,,,
Farrah,150.1,yeah that sounds like an interesting like ranking all of the equipment  I think just i'm still a little about why my answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,150.1,So Oliver and Farrah i'm going to ask you to try that suggestion first,,,,
Chris,150.1,yeah. yeah so basically,,,,
Teacher,210.1,"An action word is like a verb, and it tells us what you're gonna do with that equipment to that water.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Okay, do you want to share your answer with us.",,,,
Jazmin,210.1,"So I think I was really close, it's the lunar orbiter, the lunar orbiter's what discovered the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,Right to help them survive.,,,,
Luis,210.1,"Yeah. Yeah, exactly.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Right, so they wouldn't, you would need more than just a microscope to look at it right",,,,
Chris,210.1,"Right, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,Scientists aren't sure if there's water out there or not they are going to investigate. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.1,Right now on the moon. We've seen water before but they people haven't seen water on the moon yet.,,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Well, there can be multiple and there are multiple answers for a question. Can't there.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,It's this is kind of there's multiple reasons or multiple arguments or convincing evidence that you could use to say why water is valuable.,,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Well, but to get to get out of the Earth's atmosphere. Okay, takes a lot of force. Right.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,So if your rocket doesn't weigh as much and it'll probably be a little easier for the rocket to get into outer space. Correct.,,,,
Chris,210.1,Yeah yeah yeah yeah,,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Okay, so then that means that they have less gas when they start right when they take off from Earth.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Right. They use different equipment. Right? But remember, you're looking at the the passage. Right? But a question actually relates to the passage. So what we want to do is to find the equipment that was mentioned in the passage. Right, Chris?",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Yes, it's asking for this equipment the scientist use but not just the equipment, the scientists use, but the equipment the scientists used for what?",,,,
Oliver,210.1,"Um, equipment scientistis used to discover water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Say there it says that, you know, one day, you know, they'd like to have people living on the moon and being there for longer periods of time. Maybe not leaving, but at least be in there longer and spaceships can't really carry heavy",,,,
Teacher,210.1,I can't really can't carry,,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Yeah, they used to go home. That's right. Yeah, because they have to get NASA has to be really careful. They have to right now they have to have enough fuel to get them somewhere and to get them back and that takes up space on the own the",,,,
Teacher,210.1,Spaceship so down here later in our take to talk about how,,,,
Teacher,210.1,"But the question says, is it convince if we have the convincing evidence",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"What they used in space to find the water was a lunar orbiter. But if you look at number three, it says to look closer to actually see it, you would have to use a microscope. So your answer actually would be correct.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"You would need a microscope. But what they, the machinery, they use what's called the Lunar Orbiter, but you'd also need a microscope, like you said, to be able to view the water molecules deep in the craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"But the, the question specifically wants to know what equipment they had to use to find the water in the craters and so they didn't necessarily have to use the oxygen tank on their back for find the water, they have to use oxygen tank so they can continue breathing and live",,,,
Chris,210.1,"Oh,",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Yeah, that that was a very good answer. And it can be broken down into those two elements oxygen and hydrogen. You've probably heard water all through maybe have H2O, The H stands for hydrogen and oxygen. And so if you can break it down into those two elements, then you can use it for other things.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Exactly the room you're in now you're breathing oxygen. And because we have it in our atmosphere, the moon has a very Limited atmosphere and there's not enough oxygen to breathe. So you have to take action with you or if you can use the water to make oxygen you take advantage there about hydrogen.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"And so certainly being able to drink water and using it for other things. Maybe brushing their teeth and simple things like that, or to cook with water, it's very, very important to have. For the most part, astronauts will take the water they need with them, but if they could find a way to get water from the moon, and that would save them having to bring it.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Okay, they do use that in space. But I think the question is asking, what did they use to discover water. So, do you know what specific tool they use to discover water.",,,,
Luis,210.1,"Oh, I didn't really read that closely because I thought I kind of knew this stuff.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"That's absolutely right. Find, is a perfect word. So when you discover that means you're finding something for the first time.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"To address Chris question, I would just like to clarify. So when we talk about NASA here were first of all two things, you know, we're talking specifically about the scientists here. So not just not just astronauts that might be actually exploring space, physically, but also the scientist on the ground.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,Water on the moon be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,210.1,Now the question is asking for the tool that we use for this.,,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Each each Oliverice has a particular purpose it is designed for, for example, like you said the oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"The question was looking for the specific Oliverice us to find that one doesn't mean that all the other stuff is a used, it just means that's not the is the specific item that they were looking for.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Right, so they used to help people to breathe air, to breathe in space.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,But is that the specific Oliverice used to find the microscopic water samples?,,,,
Chris,210.1,"No, no, that that was the the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Yeah, so like yeah for I'll do an example so that you can like hear an example of it.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Um, so there's a small machine that cleans the house. You guys have heard of vacuum, right? So say the small machine that you said in your sentence was the vacuum, you can expand upon it by saying this small machine caught a vacuum is used to clean up stuff off of a rug, or hard like hardwood floor but like you don't really have to say, both of them. You could just say a rug.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Did you see the lunar orbiter or Microsoft that was referenced, you can answer that Chris as well.",,,,
Chris,210.1,"And we didn't see the Lunar Orbiter. But we did see something also be sent up to the moon. I don't remember exactly the name of it, um,",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Yeah, it's probably a s machine just like a little Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Chris,210.1,I'm not clear on. So which one is the right answer is usable microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.1,I think of a lot of people put their minds to it could be done a lot quicker but there's a lot of things like money and time and just everything that goes into it so hopefully it'll get done sooner than that but.,,,,
Teacher,210.1,Yes.,,,,
Teacher,210.1,"on savannas answer was the one that I was more posing the question for, but I understand how.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Right. So they would feel like maybe they were wasting it. So they have to have enough evidence to show that the amount of water that they could extract from the moon, that the uses that they could use the water for on the moon, that those uses and the amount of water, that it would be worth it to them to spend the money and to build the equipment.",,,,
Farrah,210.1,"Yeah, I see what you're saying.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"So one of the things that I'm going to, I'm going to mention about this kind of question about whether or not you think that there If there is convincing evidence that water on the moon might be valuable. This is a a question that asked for your opinion.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"So, people might have different opinions, but all opinions, need to be based all these opinions and to be based on evidence in the text.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,So we might disagree with each other. Some of us for all going to rely on the actual text that we have in front of us to inform our answers and inform our opinions. That's okay if you disagree with each other.,,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Okay, so I put all of us into this group because everyone here has a partial answer. Does anyone know what a partial answer means?",,,,
Farrah,210.1,"Well, this is just a guess, but it sounds like maybe it's like you have part of it, but not all of it.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"Think through this, this question like how did scientists right so far away on Earth, find water. I was like, Well, I thought about this all night.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,that's that is precisely it so we're not looking to discover water ourselves right on the moon we're leaving that up to NASA,,,,
Teacher,210.1,"I want us to focus on how it could be valuable right now, like if we could just We could transport to the future and we're on the moon, and we have all these things, and we know that there's water there, what can we do what would be valuable about having water there, why would having water there be helpful for us, I want to draw your guys's attention to the fourth, yes, so the fourth paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,And that is absolutely true scientists do use all those kinds of equipment. Now they use these types of equipment for very specific things right? So an oxygen tank is something that we use when we can't breathe really well.,,,,
Teacher,210.1,Possibly. You need different tools for different tasks right? Oliver.,,,,
Oliver,210.1,"Um yeah i'm so sorry but I just looked at the clock out, we have to go to lunch right now.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"But they can identify it without a microscope the machine can, but we cannot as humans.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"So um going back to the text and the question, so the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon, right, now, who are the scientists working with?",,,,
Oliver,210.1,Um NASA,,,,
Teacher,210.1,yeah perfect that's great so the scientists are working with NASA,,,,
Teacher,210.1,"That is absolutely right and in this question, we are looking for the machine that found the water on the moon,",,,,
Teacher,210.1,and think about maybe going to a family member's house there's a certain way that you get there.,,,,
Teacher,210.1,"So if we're going to have a moon base right that's why we're trying to figure out what they sent right, so that they could discover this water Farrah and you find something yeah okay.",,,,
Chris,210.1,"So, in the first paragraph you're talking about how there was there, there was water on the moon, and now they think that there is water.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,Yet we're not taking a day trip to the moon they're they're there for a little while.,,,,
Luis,210.1,"yeah if we could take a day trip to the moon, I would have done that already.",,,,
Teacher,210.1,"yeah absolutely so that's why, in this particular response you don't have to include oxygen tanks",,,,
Chris,210.1,um yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.1,"And that's how they discovered the war that's how they were able to see the water, so your answer wasn't wrong you guys had similar answers, but I just wanted to know what you're thinking was when you came up with those answers.",,,,
Farrah,210.1,"Oh, oh okay yeah.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So let's think about before we actually look at water with the microscope what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water they found on the moon, so they use the microscope after they had found it, but what did they use to find it Do you remember.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"It says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and so that is the question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, not to look at it afterwards, does that make sense.",,,,
Farrah,210.2,Oh yeah okay okay so First they find it with the orbiter and then then also it's like they then they like study it they study it with a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Absolutely so so let's first like talk about that question when we say the word equipment what what do we mean what does equipment mean.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Absolutely so let's say I asked you to write down your answer on a sheet of paper, what kind of equipment, will you be using for that.",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"Oh, like a pencil.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Vecause we're thinking about this this word evidence evidence is basically just it just means proof.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Absolutely, yes, that is what evidence is it's called textual evidence, it means you're drawing your answer. from that source.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Alright, so we're talking about the sort of evidence or the sort of equipment that scientists use to get to that water or to find that water, not the evidence that sort of looks at it.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So we're specifically looking for a piece of equipment that was used to discover the water or to find the water,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"We're trying to discover it. We're not trying to look at it, Chris, did you have something to tell me",,,,
Chris,210.2,"Um, yeah, I was just thinking like, Well, I went to NASA with my dad so I know that scientists use a lot of other equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, and I guess I was like that when we talked about like what equipment. It feels like that's missing from the, from the reading or I don't know. Like, that seems like it's important",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yeah, all those things are really important. And I think it's really cool that you got to experience that. But in this article. What is it, it's specifically asking us about water right",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So in this one it's going to tell us about the equipment that's used for water. So what does equipment main guys,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Now they sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So what is a small machine, what's another word, maybe one that's in our question. That means the same thing.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Good. Does anybody know a synonym for the word investigate,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yeah, they're looking at it really closely, they're not looking. They're not discovering it yet what in order to look at it really closely, they have to have already found it right",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"I understand. Yeah, so they they found it using the Lunar Orbiter and they and they studied it using the microscope. So it was like two different things. They say, I understand.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So when we look back at our text. We're trying to figure out what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"You did, you did say that, but if we look, it says What equipment. So I think it's asking us to say like the title of the object.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,You're right. But if we look back at our question. It's telling us to talk about what equipment. So they did use it to find a lot of water in the craters. But what tool where they using?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So we need to find the equipment that they used,,,,
Teacher,210.2,They did find water. But the question wants to know what equipment did they use,,,,
Farrah,210.2,"Well, in my answer, I, I talked about the equipment. It's me, Farrah. I said that they they used a scientific tool called a microscope to, to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,But what equipment did they use to find it?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"That are used on the moon, but we need to figure out exactly which piece of equipment they use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,They need oxygen. But we're specifically talking about which piece of equipment they used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,210.2,"Ah. OK, gotcha. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,It yes is a specific tool or equipment that they used,,,,
Teacher,210.2,And the question. It talks about equipment but there can be another word for equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,What are the ways that it's being used.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Or how can it be useful.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"If you would have read [unintellible] see where it says, NASA send small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate because you have to understand what the question is asking",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"What equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon. That would be your question. So that question didn't ask anything about what they found, as what did they use to find it.",,,,
Chris,210.2,"Um, oh, okay, okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yes. And, um, if you refer back to the question, it did mention equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So do you think one of the important words could be equipment?,,,,
Chris,210.2,"Yeah, and it's okay so it's asking what equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Good. Okay, so the two words that we really want to focus on is equipment and discover,",,,,
Farrah,210.2,"I just, I was just wondering, Well my answer was wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"That scientists use. But remember, the second word that you circled or underlined in the question was, discover so they in the paragraph. It says that they use this equipment to discover water to find water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,but we said when we circled in the second key word.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"In our question that we need to also look for the word discovered what they use to discover, discover is an action word. It's something that they did",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But yes, the two key words that I was wanting you guys to find was evidence and valuable yes def",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"I wonder, it's asking about the equipment. So that's kind of like the machine that was used to discover it. So we know where it was. But now we're asking about the machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"You right equipment and tools, the equipment is another word for a tool. So when we have something that's the same word for a tool we would call it a synonym. So they're synonyms of each other.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,do you know the difference or can you explain the difference between discovering and looking,,,,
Luis,210.2,"Excuse me Ms. Teache while she's thinking I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So when you discover something, have you ever seen it before?",,,,
Farrah,210.2,"I guess like I'm when I discover on I was thinking more. It's like when you find something, I guess.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Finding it but planning it for the first time.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And remember, we're looking for equipment.",,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"But you said, my answer is right, my answers in paragraph two.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So we're discovering water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,but that doesn't tell us what equipment they used to discover it.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yeah, we are looking for this specific tool used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"We're trying to figure out which one they used to discover water but, plot twist.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Can someone raised their hand and tell me what is the question asking us for what are we trying to get the answer of. Someone raise your hand, what is the question asking us for.",,,,
Farrah,210.2,"I think the questions asking us, okay, so it says... Scientists discovered the water and then like what equipment did they use to do that.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, what equipment. Did they use to discover the water that's what Farrah is saying.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Gotcha. Yeah, so that's a really good question. Um, remember that in the question we are being asked to determine like Farrah says the equipment that's used to discover the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Equipment discover and water. Good job. So you guys picked out some really good keywords, the two key words that I looked at was equipment and discover",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Good. Okay, well equipment is the same thing as a tool right but we're trying to figure out the equipment that they used to discover and. Do you guys know what discover means",,,,
Oliver,210.2,It means like when you find something,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yeah, so we're trying to figure out the equipment that they used that the scientist is to find the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So I want us to look at the question and it said the question asked what equipment did scientist. He is to discover water on the moon. So we're trying to figure out what equipment so what what sort of tool did scientists to use to find the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But let's look more at that question. So it's asking for equipment, what kind of equipment searches for what, what are they looking for?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"but in this question specifically it's asking what piece of equipment. Did they use to search for water on the moon. Specifically, right.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,They're looking for specific piece of information are specific piece of equipment. I'm sorry.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,They're looking for quick the equipment. Right.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So what's the thing that was the equipment, that they use to find water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"let's say, you know, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on Mars.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"I'm glad we're able to see that. But then we also have to remember right, we're looking for equipment, we're looking for, you know, these mechanisms that help us get there because that's what the questions answering. Right. Can you remind me what the question says,",,,,
Chris,210.2,What equipment all yeah okay what equipment scientists use to discover water on them. Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But the way they use equipment here means it could be plural. It could be more than one. So maybe a good response could be talking about, you know, including multiple ones that we read about it there. A Luis Do you think that's a good idea. It talking about more than one piece.",,,,
Luis,210.2,"Um, yeah. So I felt like that's what I did. I took off the oxygen tanks. And so I said a lot of equipment so that it would include more than one. But you said that's not I wasn't",,,,
Teacher,210.2,And so when we're giving our response to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,key word there is look in the question asked you to see what you need to look at the water,,,,
Farrah,210.2,"Oh,",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Discover the water right so it rereading the passage, what would you think led the scientists to discover the water",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Right. So now let's look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So putting that together.,,,,
Jazmin,210.2,That equipment is machine.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Is it saying about the value of water on the moon, why is that very valuable.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So potential. That means it may it that is going to be valuable. Right. It has the potential to be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,The water on the moon. So when I think of that word discover. And when you think of the word discover what are some things that come to mind when I'm discovering something. What am I doing,,,,
Teacher,210.2,When I first discover something. What are we doing Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"You're finding it like you're you're seeing it for the, for the first time.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So what what might they have used to first discover. I remember Jazmin said when we discover something I'm finding it. I'm looking for it. I am seeing it for the first time I'm able to locate it. So what might the scientist have used to first initially locate that water Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,210.2,So basically nothing stops and it's not like I shouldn't do that. It's the Lunar Orbiter. That's the small,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So when we are discovering something we are locating it for the first time we're finding it right.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So what equipment. Did the scientist use and send out to the moon to first discover and locate water on the moon.,,,,
Chris,210.2,The scientists use the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So, so we needed to find the equipment. But the key was what equipment. Did they used to discover. Because remember, there's lots of equipment that is used for lots of different things.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So the key was what equipment. Did they use to discover. So always locate the key word right we had to figure out what they used to discover the water, which means to thirst locate it to first find it.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Well, your answer was correct. It was. That's one of the machines that they use was the rover to explore the moon's surface, to be able to locate the particles of water, which we would have to look at through a microscope",,,,
Jazmin,210.2,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Now, the specific question was what kind of equipment they used to dig up the water or find that water with, and that was the Rover. Remember that?",,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"Yes, but that's what I said. I said NASA sent a small machine. And that's the one, right there. So what's wrong with my answer?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yes, definitely. We need to know that we're looking or what's where we find and what equipment was used to find water. Anything else anybody",,,,
Chris,210.2,"I thought I thought water was an important one, too.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yes, I believe equipment discover water. Those are all three key words that we need to look at for this for answering this question. Alright, so what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. So when you discover something.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yes. Now with them what the moon right there. Did they when they were on the moon, looking for things on the moon, for sure. Now when you discover something. Have you looked at some when you discover something new. Does that mean you've already looked at it before.",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"I don't, I guess. No, I guess not",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yeah, so when you discover something. It's the first time you see something so you're really not being able to Really dive in and examine and look at it. And so when we go to discover something, it's, it's the first time we've seen it.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So what was the piece of equipment that was used to find water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So, not to look at water but to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, now with this question. It's a new question. So is there convincing evidence That water on the moon could be valuable. Now there are some key words in this question.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Well, for the question. It's asking exactly what they used to discover water on the moon,",,,,
Luis,210.2,"Gotcha. Oh, OK. So they did, like, Okay, that makes sense. So it's really like what was in there reading",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Right. So when the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. So microscope isn't isn't a piece of equipment, but the word in the sentence that we need to look at is discover.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,But the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"What are our key words in the question, what are we looking for?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,We're looking for a piece of equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so we're. The question was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon. So you're right. We're looking for equipment. But what did the equipment do",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Or what was used for to discover what?,,,,
Oliver,210.2,Was covered water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So discover water. So we're looking for a piece of equipment to discover water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Right to discover is to look for.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"To look at something, but to discover you're going to, you know, look for.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,And looking for and discovering,,,,
Teacher,210.2,What piece of equipment. Did the scientists use to find water on the moon. What was that small machine called,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so then what equipment that they use to find the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Or what do they sent to investigate.,,,,
Farrah,210.2,"Oh, they say, simple Lunar Orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,How could that be beneficial how could that be valuable.,,,,
Chris,210.2,"So if, if you don't have to carry the water, then you could have room on the ship for some other stuff that you wanted to carry.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Now, what kind of value, why would that be valuable",,,,
Farrah,210.2,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"However, that's not the question here is, and if you read the question. The question states or asks you what equipment, equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"The key word discover water on the moon. Right. The key phrase there. And so we're not looking for just any scientific equipment that it's used out in space. We're looking for this specific one. This article says discovered the water on the moon, which in this case like Luis and Jazmin had said, is the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,let us look back at the words. So we talk about discover and we talk about equipment. Okay. So what is an equipment we say it's a?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,It's a tool right,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Very good. Now what about the word discover,,,,
Teacher,210.2,You know what the word discover means? Yes Oliver?,,,,
Oliver,210.2,And discover is like when you find something,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Right. So what we're looking for, then, is a tool that was actually used to find the water right?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, great. So you said discover means to find right and equipment means a tool. Right. And the question is asking you to identify the equipment that they used to discover. Or we could say the tool that they use to find the water. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, now we were looking at the word discover right and we said the word is. What does the word discover means",,,,
Teacher,210.2,And as we said the word discover means to find so yes truth.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, um, let us look back at the question.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And the word equipment. What does that mean, um, talk to yourselves about it for me. The word equipment discuss what it means.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Alright. Is there anybody who wants to share the answer with us. What is, what does the word equipment means? Yes, Oliver?",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"Um, yeah. So equipment is like something that you you like use to accomplish a task like it's something like a machine or like a tool that you use to do something.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Good. Now look at the word discover talk to yourself again about the word discover,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Share what it means, with each other.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Exactly right. So the question I asked you, what did they used to look at it, or what do they use to find it?",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"they said, what did they use to find it.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So we looked at discover because that was one of our key words because there was a lot of tools that the scientists used that they talked about in our text. So what does discover mean,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Jazmin, what is discover mean",,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"I'm discovering like when you find them, but like, it's when you find them for the first time.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yes, that is a very good question. So they were focusing more on what they used to find the water specifically",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So we know that there is water on the moon that the scientists had discovered it, but our question says, Is there evidence that the water could be valuable. Okay, so what do we think valuable means",,,,
Teacher,210.2,What do you think that means,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, awesome so valuable means that it's useful. So this is asking could water from the moon be useful. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So do we think that water from the moon could be useful to our scientist.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,You think yes or no.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So when you are reading this text, you're looking for an equipment that this text is discussing. So, um, do you know what equipment means? Do you know what that word means?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Let. Let's see, we're looking for some scientific terms. Who remembers what term.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,In the question. There's a term. And the question that we're looking for.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Oh, yes. Water is important. Mm hmm. Yes, because the question does ask about water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So what are the key words we already talked about water discover and equipment right,,,,
Farrah,210.2,"I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. I got that I'm in the third paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,There are key words.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"All right, I'm convincing is good. And there's one more word that we use a lot in science.",,,,
Luis,210.2,"Evidence evidence, our teachers always asked",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so what is evidence",,,,
Luis,210.2,"Evidence as one. It's like something that you can pro. You know, it can't be something that like you think but you gotta be able to prove it.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So yes, you're right. But remember, the question was just specifically asking how they discovered water. So all those equipments. Yes, they are very important to them so they didn't need them. But we was looking for the tool for water.",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"Okay, okay, okay. So thanks, teacher, it's time for us to go to lunch. Thanks for working with us.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So I feel like it's more of your opinion based on the details and the facts that are in your passage,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So it's more of your opinion based on what they gave you in the passage,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Teacher:I feel like the way the question was phrased. They were specifically talking about the Oliverice that discovered the water, not the behind the scenes like um",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Because the question. I feel like is a little bit more specific on what discovered the water because you could also argue that the astronaut discovered the water,,,,
Chris,210.2,"Yeah, yeah, I guess you could like, and I guess it's like, um, I guess just wondering, like, did the astronaut go or was it like an unmanned probe. You know what I mean?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Right. I think the question was a little bit wanting more specifics on what Oliverice actually discovered the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"You might have all that equipment and you might need all that equipment to get there, but I think the question is actually asking for, if I was holding that tool in my hand right now, would it discover water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"In the actual passage. It says, water is a valuable resource and then they list a whole bunch of reasons. You know why its valuable. So I think the question is really asking is, are you convinced that there that is valuable.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"That would be very beautiful, very. Did you find that in the text Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"Um lets see. I was looking at...Hmm, I guess, well, I was just thinking about what you could do with water, and seeing it's not really in there, I was just thinking that if you could use the water that's one thing.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So using the information in paragraph two, what equipment. Did the scientists use to find that water to investigate if there was water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So is there convincing evidence. So remember, convincing evidence means that we're looking for details are in the article. What it says directly. Okay. That water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Now this is a tricky question. Okay. Because valuable, we have to use the definition that they gave us in the article for that word.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So what is the meaning of valuable there?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Right. So the question is asking us what type of equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon. So what type of equipment did they have to have in order-- if it was there to see it?,,,,
Farrah,210.2,"Oh, excuse me?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Maybe if there was another machine mentioned, or how they how they discovered the water. I know they can look at the water with the microscope. But how did they discover the water",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Good, so I'm glad that you recognize that just have to have oxygen when they're in space. But if you look at the title, we're talking about water in space. So in the question asks us",,,,
Teacher,210.2,But in the question. It says what equipment. Did they use not. Where did they find it so,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Okay. So I agree. They used to look at water is it what they find the water with,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Is it talking about how they water or is it talking about,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And I want to specifically look at the question. It says, Is there convincing evidence.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So what is valuable mean maybe that's what we need to ask ourselves. So what does it mean to be valuable Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"We're talking about water on the moon. And so that's a little bit more in depth than just the oxygen tank. And let's see, I wanted to talk with with um",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Our question specifically says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Do you have any really important words in that question.,,,,
Farrah,210.2,Like other than other than equipment? Like discover.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yes, discover. So when you discover something you're looking for it.",,,,
Farrah,210.2,"Um, I guess.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,They have to investigate,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So they used. Um, well what machine, what piece of equipment did they use?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But we're trying the, we're trying to find how did they find all that water because it. What if they looked at, um, how did they know where that water is?",,,,
Farrah,210.2,"Yeah, I think that sort of makes sense. I feel like, well, so how did they, how did they find the water if they didn't use the microscope to find it.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And they also talk about craters. In the story, which Chris brought up so that everybody had a little part in the story, but we want to talk about what they found. How to find water on the moon, don't we, yes Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"Unfortunately, we have to go on to the next group, but thank you.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So before we even look into our text we want to look at our question. The question is specifically asking what equipment did scientists use to discover the water,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So right there. We know that we want to look for some sort of equipment and based around water. Oh, text evidence is something I wanted to talk to you guys about",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So text evidence is going to support your answers and pull it straight from the text so that you always know that your answers are close or semi correct,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So evidence is a really important word because it means that there's going to be proof in our passage. So we want to find proof to the question of what equipment. Did they use to discover water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Right. And they do use a lot of equipment such as that but our question specifically wants to know what equipment they use to discover water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,How about the word evidence and the word value.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Evidence means that we're going to prove our answer that in this passage, it tells us the answer to this question. So will there be convincing evidence or will there not we'll find out.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,It. There's a focus on what machine actually they which I actually used to discover the water on them.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"but the question is asking what equipment that scientists use discover water on the moon and so on and saying, equipment, it's looking for what types of machines or technology. Did they need to discover that water. So you're going to be looking for our",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"When, when a text is talking about discovering the water, you're going to be looking for the types of machines they used to do that.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"About discovering something you know like what they actually used to find it, not what they used to look at it. But before that, how did they find it so it would help you better to understand the question and understand",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So what from the text, how can you work, how can you focus to see when when you've got the question what equipment did scientists you discovered water on the moon. What, what are you looking for?",,,,
Luis,210.2,"um like, we're looking for like machines or tools like in the text.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Okay and machines and tools that do what?,,,,
Luis,210.2,um discover discover the water,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So, so which tool or gadget or technology even or machine is was used to discover or identify or reveal or find the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Both pieces of equipment which one was used to discover the water or to find the water,,,,
Oliver,210.2,"Hey, oh, are you know teacher. I just looked at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, well, you know, this is this is asking specifically based on the reading.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Know why they found Craters of what they use to discover define Craters of,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"That's I think that's the key part is, what did they use to discover the water or what did they use to find the water or maybe we could even say identify the water",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So when they were first going into space on the moon when they first got to the moon. What did they use to find that,,,,
Teacher,210.2,but what did they use it first to discover it so,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Right, you need so because our, our question and what was what equipment it scientists use to discover water so they're asking the question is asking what scientists use.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So specifically, what do they use not their suits. But what they use to find the water. Does that make a little bit more sense.",,,,
Chris,210.2,Yeah okay that actually. Okay. That makes a lot more sense. So like it's. Yes. That makes sense.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,But if we're looking specifically at a question it's asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But like I said, we're if we're looking at the specific question is. Want to know what did they use to find that water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Good, because we are wanting to know what specific equipment, the scientists used to discover all right there. What do you think buddy.",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"Um, yeah, actually, I agree with Farrah. I said, equipment and discover as well.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay well equipment is the key word. But we got to figure out what's, what is the whole point of the equipment. In this question the equipment is to discover water on the moon. Okay, does that make sense.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,I agree with you. Those are all very important words Chris. What do you think buddy.,,,,
Chris,210.2,"Um, okay. So for me, I thought, well, I thought, water and value.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay well valuables and very important word, but we also need that convincing evidence on why water is valuable. OK, so the convincing evidence is also very important. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Well, water is very important because we're wanting to find out, you know,",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"How can water be valuable. So we need to really find the evidence in the text on why that water is valuable. So water is an important word, but we want to find the evidence on why it's valuable if that makes sense. Okay.",,,,
Luis,210.2,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So hopefully you'll remember us talking about that. But if you look at it, it says what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. So our key word here is equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So our key word here is equipment and discover.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Right. Okay. And so let's go back and look and see what's the word that goes with that word discover, so we know discover means to what somebody does anybody can answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"All right. Now, what, what does it mean if something is valuable.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"It's expensive. Okay, so something that's expensive is considered valuable. Good. Okay.",,,,
Luis,210.2,"I'm like something you can use or something that you need like valuable is, you know, like, yeah, like something that that you want.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Right, something that you can use. Okay, that's great.",,,,
Farrah,210.2,I was gonna say the same stuff.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Another way to say or state. This question is,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Why would water on the moon, be very valuable or very important right so what, in what ways so that word convincing evidence. It's just asking.",,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"It's like when you find something, or when you when you when you find something",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Right. It's like finding something so finding it versus looking at it closely are two different things. So the question is asking what equipment did they use to find the water,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So that equipment is something that they use to help them breathe. So what equipment do they used to help them discover water.,,,,
Luis,210.2,Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So we think of convincing evidence. What does that mean to you, Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,What does convincing mean,,,,
Oliver,210.2,convince me that,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, Chris what does convincing mean?",,,,
Chris,210.2,"If, if your friend wants to do something and you don't want to do it and they like the try to get you to do with a big that's convincing.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Luis what is convincing for you.,,,,
Luis,210.2,I'm well I convince everybody that I'm like I'm the best at Minecraft ever,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So we're talking about convincing evidence. Evidence means information that supports the statement being made. So we're going to look at the evidence, the information that supports.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay. And that is a great answer. But if we look at what the question is asking, it's asking what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon? That word discover is really, really important. Can anyone help me explain what the word discover means?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Within within the actual text. What does NASA send to the moon to actually investigate for the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,but this is there anything that they would take with them to possibly try to investigate and sort of study the water on the moon with them.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But what what tool or piece of equipment, would they actually did the scientists used to perhaps find that water on the moon within the craters.",,,,
Chris,210.2,"Well, okay. So I went to nasa with my dad and when we went there I saw that scientists, a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and and stuff like I i was thinking maybe that was something that that you know what I mean, that's the tools that they're using",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, let's talk about evidence.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"What do you think evidence would be, what do you think evidence would be Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,210.2,Evidence is like in detective stories like it's like how they proove something. So it's like proof.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And we're going to discover evidence and proof. Very good. Alright, so, Jazmin. She's exactly right. Like, we're looking for proof, what are we looking for proof for proof of what?",,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"We're looking to see if the if the like. Okay, so is there like good proof I guess they're like strong like convincing proof that the water it's valuable and I think it is and I think you could even grow a garden on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so they they can't see it without the microscope. Now, how do you think they originally were able to get the water though? Remember we're seeing how they discovered water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Back, here on earth. And we're looking specifically at the equipment, if we if we pay close attention to the question I want you to read after me. It says what equipment that scientists and then can you finish the question.",,,,
Chris,210.2,"Yeah okay so what equipment that scientists use to discover, oh!",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So we're looking for specific equipment and equipment is doing what Harrion?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, that's the question. And so. Does everyone here know what the word equipment means",,,,
Farrah,210.2,"Okay. Oh yeah, because we will use equipment in PE class.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Correct. Those are all types of equipment. And so what about the word discover. Do we all know what the word discover means,,,,
Chris,210.2,I think discover is like,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Excellent Harris and that is when you find something. So our question is asking what equipment did scientists use to find water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, good job. So you're talking about some equipment that they needed or that you knew happen on the moon.",,,,
Luis,210.2,"Um, I know that it's something that like basically goes up to the moon. And I'm like, it flies around the moon orbits and and it studies the moon from from or is",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Whenever we're talking about the equipment that scientists use the key word in this question is to discover water on the moon. So to answer your question, Farrah and deaf so far.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,It's not the question is not asking necessarily about,,,,
Teacher,210.2,The way they found the water because the water is very small. It's asking the machine or the equipment that is used to discover the water. The key word is,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Discover a microscope helps you study the water, whereas the lunar orbiter helps you",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Discover the water,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But again, we're focusing on the equipment, the scientists use. So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So the the question itself establishes that there's water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But really, a better answer would be, since it says what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon is what equipment are they actually using to discover water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"We look at that question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon, what are we really looking for.",,,,
Luis,210.2,"Um, okay, the equipment they use to discover the water?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"That's, that's true. So it's a new. It's new to you. It's new to whoever finds it. That's absolutely true.",,,,
Luis,210.2,"Yeah, no, no, no, no. You're right. Yeah, oxygen tanks, we don't we don't discover water with the tanks, we just, we don't need them to breathe on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So if we go back to the question what equipment that scientists us to discover water on the moon. What is that question asking?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,We're just looking for what equipment led them to finding those Craters of water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But if we look at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be value. So this is an argument piece. So you can say yes it is valuable, or no, it is not valuable.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Absolutely, you are on the right track. So we're going to, let's look back in the texts and see what equipment was talked about. Does anybody take a second to look back in the text and tell me what equipment... Well, first of all, can anybody tell me what equipment means. Can anybody give me another word for equipment?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"What equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. First of all, I want to make sure that we know what the word equipment means. So can anybody give me a synonym for the word equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so what can you restate that question, what is that question asking what are the some important words, guys, I want you guys to",,,,
Teacher,210.2,turn and talk or take a second to really look at the question and see what exactly how else could you ask,,,,
Teacher,210.2,what that question is.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Asking, What are those important words. Go ahead.",,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"Okay. I think it's saying like, I'm like, um, what, what kind of things did the astronauts use to find",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So what kind of things. So specifically, it says, what kinds of equipment. So first of all, I want to make sure",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Because I think, judging by some of your responses. I don't think we fully understand equipment so equipment is what we're going to be looking for equipment that helps the scientists discover water on the moon. So can you give me",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Another example of a word for equipment, Oliver.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"What does it mean, what does it",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Mean,,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"Okay, well, there's another word story. It's a tool, a scientific tool. So that's how I know the microscope is right, cuz that equipment but but I think it's machine because that's what I had. And that's equivalent to so I don't know what my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So let's look it specifically we want to look through our passage and make sure that we're looking for equipment that helped,,,,
Teacher,210.2,The scientists find water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Very good and Farrah. What do you think the most important word in that question is,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Equipment. Okay. So we are looking specifically for equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Right so discover is our most important word in that question. And so when we look at our text, we're trying to find the thing that helps us discover the water or find the water",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"My question for you is, what other equipment does our article say that scientists use to discover water right because we also need water in order to survive in space.",,,,
Luis,210.2,"Mm hmm. Um, maybe they use like I'm a shovel to dig it up.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so let's look at our question. Again, we have what equipment we used. We already know about the different types of equipment what keyword",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"In this question, lets you know that we're looking for a specific piece of equipment.",,,,
Oliver,210.2,I thought it was something that would find some water. But I feel like that's not it now.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,The question uses the word discover which is the same as find,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So what we need to look at in our, in our article is what was the first piece of equipment that was used because discover is like when you find it for the first time, right.",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"Oh. Oh, OK. OK, so the lunar orbiter comes before the microscope in the story.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Alright so what I'm asking you is based on the ways we can use water do you think it is worth  Investing in.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Do you think it is worth trying to get the water out of the moon.,,,,
Farrah,210.2,"Okay, okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so now that we know that we're looking for equipment that discovered it,",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So we are going to use the same strategy, the same technique and take about 30 seconds and find any keywords in that question. Okay. Keywords something important to help us find it back in the text.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Excellent. So what key word from our question. Have we already found from this heading.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,What's the word in that question that gives you a hint at where to look in the passage,,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"Well, I don't understand why my answer is wrong, cuz I did pull from that I said a small machine. And that's a word to look for like equipment machine, you know?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Exactly. Chris when you hear the word equipment, what comes to mind.",,,,
Chris,210.2,"Like those oxygen tanks, so that they breathe and like, there's the suit so that they don't like freeze to death, you know,",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Good, so we can take the word equipment and we know that equipment means a physical object. So when we're reading the passage and looking for this answer we know that we want to find physical objects that scientists used to discover water on the moon. So when we read this passage. We know that water has been found on the moon. And then we need to find the equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Wery good job. So when we're reading and we know that we want to look for equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, and good. I like how you underline the equipment and discover because those are the two key words to help us answer this question, Chris and Jazmin. What words did you guys underline",,,,
Chris,210.2,So we actually had a kind of a decision about,,,,
Teacher,210.2,That's correct discover is the verb that is going to help us answer this question. So the equipment used to discover that is how you know what type of equipment you wanted to find so,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Well, that's why it's important that we know the action which is discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"I like how you said discovered that is correct. Discover and equipment are two very important question or two very important words in this question. Okay guys, so let's come back together as a group.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Great. So those are two correct words that you would want to underline in that question because the equipment. It's wanting to know a piece of equipment that scientists did use and then discover is our action word,,,,
Teacher,210.2,To help us answer this question.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so we all did. I think that's what it's mainly asking. So we know that scientists discovered water on the moon. So we know that part already",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So now we get to figure out with the equipment was,,,,
Teacher,210.2,That's exactly right. So the question what equipment did scientists use this river water on the moon. It's asking from the passionate itself.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Good job. I like that you Circle the word equipment that will really help you find in the passage, what the answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Good job. I like that you circled the word equipment, just like Farrah because that'll help find the answer in the passage will have to look for the word equipment and see if you can find the correct answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,I like that you circled water because that's the key point of that question we're trying to find out how they found the water on the Moon. Very well done,,,,
Teacher,210.2,What did they use to find the water. The what the designed to send to the moon to find the water do you can you find that in the text.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,But that's not what we're looking for. Right now we're looking to find what equipment they used to find the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But right now we're looking to see how they found the water. What equipment, help them discover the water on the moon. So could you tell me what made you say the oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"They did need the microscope as Farrah, and Oliver mentioned.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But that doesn't help them find the water. What helped them found the water was the Lunar Orbiter. They did need the microscope as Farrah, and Oliver mentioned.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"However, if we read the question itself specifically what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. That's our buzzword right there, discover the water. So if we go back up and we see that",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, great. So the three of you guys have chosen equipment as a key term which is really good because it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Jazmin. You also said that discover and investigate were really similar. So maybe we can use a combination of equipment and see what equipment helped us discover water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And although it was microscopic. Um, let's see what NASA sent to the moon and if there any other equipment pieces that you guys think are really important Chris, would you like to add something.",,,,
Chris,210.2,"Yeah I okay so I went to NASA with like that. And when we were there. We saw that scientists like use oxygen masks and two and things like that. So I was wondering, like, is that part of you know what I mean is that part of how they found the found the water?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Sure. I think that um, you know, earlier we discussed how discover and investigate were two really big key terms in the question and the article,",,,,
Teacher,210.2,And that and what do you think about that. Does this text actually support that idea that you need a microscope find water on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,210.2,I think so.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,And what part of that passage do you see that reference that you need a microscope?,,,,
Farrah,210.2,I would say okay so in paragraph three it talks about how you need the microscope. You wouldn't be able to see the water without the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Well, you had the right idea about the microscope about the microscopic water molecules. But if you look closely at the question, it was asking what the tool was to get that sample,  your answer was the tools to see it",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"In a way, yes. But this is also why science questions are a little tricky. If you look back at the discussion question it's looking for the specific tool or Oliverice specifically used for that purpose.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Now for this particular article that we're looking at. We are focusing on the specific action of locating water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,This question in particular is asking is there is there convincing evidence of water alone can be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,But it's asking what the name of the tool is so let's go back and see if we can find what the name of the tool is even.,,,,
,210.2,See if you can look the shark.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,This question was specifically looking for,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"it's kind of a two part question, if you think about it, because you're weighing out what would be valuable about the water to the astronauts like",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And so, some would say yes, and some people would be no",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Well, to me, when I think of the word valuable, I would say that I think that could be either now or in the future so looking at the question, the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So when we see it could be valuable that kind of implies the future,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so the question asked what equipment did they use to find water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,210.2,"Um, well, I mean they have to use oxygen tanks to breathe because they can't breathe on the moon, without the oxygen tanks, you know,",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"now if you go back to the question, the question asked how did they use this machinery to find water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"now, they did find water on the moon, but what equipment, did they use to find that water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,That okay so next time we'll really read the question through a little bit harder i'll read it more myself to help you understand the question better and then we'll we'll find the equipment okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And that's okay um if we think back to Jazmin's response she talked about the spaceship and, if you think about it equipment can be anything that you really use to get to the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So equipment is considered to be anything that helps you get to the water in this point or helps you get on to.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,The moon so basically you could even say that the food on the ship is equipment for the people to stay alive to get there.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So it can be taken in multiple different directions, some people could be very like how you guys each said, one thing, but if we bring it all together, we have all the equipment, we need to find the water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay yeah no problem, so the reason why it wasn't the answer we were looking for is because we wanted to know the machine that help find the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So going back again, the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so the key words, and this is for all five of you, the keywords are equipment and discover water for the passage.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,And then look for equipment that helped to discover water. So those are your key words.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"As i've been saying to everybody those keywords equipment and to discover water on the moon is really, really important when finding the answer in the passage",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"um So the question is, is there evidence and you said no, not for a long time, so the reason that the question is saying is there evidence is when you read the passage.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So the word evidence, what is it what is evidence, can you tell me what evidence is?",,,,
Farrah,210.2,it's like facts.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"facts yeah yeah so it's facts, information, details that can help. So and then is there, so is there facts that can show if water is valuable. what does the word valuable mean?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yeah, so when we think of value most of the time we think of money. So valuable can also be something that we need.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So something that can be helpful. Helpful is another word instead of using valuable. It's something that's helpful to us.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So is there evidence that let's rework the question just a little bit, so it can be easier to understand, because there are some big words in there, like evidence and valuable So is there facts information that can help the water that water on the moon can be helpful to us?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Equipment as well. Okay, so the two words that I think are the most important that I heard from was equipment and the second word would be discover.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Does anyone know why discover would also be an important word in the question?,,,,
Chris,210.2,Because it's an action word?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"It's an action word, yes, because what, what are we doing? What is the question asking?",,,,
Chris,210.2,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So they're trying to discover the water, does everyone agree? So now I want everyone to look at the reading. Yes, Luis.",,,,
Luis,210.2,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"All of these answers are correct, but I want to look at the word equipment and the second one, I noticed no one circled was discover. Does anyone know why discover would be an important word in the question?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Because it's an action word, because the scientists are discovering water, but how does -sorry discovering it. That's the action word. Excuse me, sorry I was confusing.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so I see where you're coming from but let's think about this a little differently we're trying to see is there convincing evidence that could it be valuable Do you know what the word valuable means.",,,,
Luis,210.2,Like important.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,so at this point we're just trying to figure out what we what what what machine was used to investigate if there was water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So i'm just trying to get the answer of what equipment started is used to discover the water itself.,,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"Thats why I think mine is right teacher, because I mean they did use that one, and I think it that it was the ice is water so when they were looking for ice deposit they were looking for water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"That's true, but the question is asking what equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So craters full of water means what they found. But we're asking what equipment was used. So, what tools do they use to find those craters.",,,,
Chris,210.2,"Well, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks in suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,The to look at the water. What did they use to find the water,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So the question is asking what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon. So let's think about the words in this. Equipment usually means tools or systems.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And then discover is another big word in there and discover means, how did they find water. So find something or know that it exists on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"However, the question is asking, how did they find the water. So they use it to look at the water, but what did they use to find the water?",,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"Okay, so I saw the part where I found it in the story where I i saw it at the beginning of paragraph two, and it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So breaking down the question does everybody know what the word equipment means.,,,,
Oliver,210.2,"yeah it's like something that you use to do something. Like in PE class, coach always says okay go get the equipment and then we get like the balls and thing.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So does everybody know what the word equipment means?,,,,
Jazmin,210.2,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Can someone raised their hand and offer to explain it for us?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So yes, that is what equipment is. Equipment is just some tools or machines that we use to decide to do an action",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So, for example, in the text we can say that some of the.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"equipment that astronauts use or maybe not in the text, but just in general astronauts use helmets. Yes, Jazmin?",,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"Ok I I used equipment in my answer, so I don't understand why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay um well just by going over the word equipment, I wanted to make sure that everybody knew what the word equipment was just because sometimes not everybody understands the question and then sometimes.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So everybody understands the question. Can somebody explain the question to me real quick?,,,,
Chris,210.2,I can.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,yeah So what we can say what tools or what.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Instruments did they use,,,,
Chris,210.2,"Oh that's good, yeah yeah. You know I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But that wasn't necessarily what the question was specifically asking the question was asking for what types of equipment and I know you circled the same thing as Farrah, but I want to hear from you.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Well, I think that the question was asking was sort of asking that if you knew that NASA used oxygen tanks and microscopes that's what the question is asking, would you say that's good equipment is.",,,,
Chris,210.2,"I would say that's equipment, because we were talking about equipment, but then it's saying specifically to discover water on the moon, and so that you don't use their suits to discover the water they use their suits to stay warm.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But the question is,",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"What equipment. Did the scientists use to discover the water, not where is the water found.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But what would be used to help scientists find water on the moon, and maybe use your texts to answer that question.",,,,
Luis,210.2,"Hmm, OK. OK, I'll",,,,
Teacher,210.2,But I was wondering could you find an instrument that helped the scientists find this one on the moon and for your tax.,,,,
Chris,210.2,An instrument.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So i'm going to reread the question and once I finish, I want one of you to raise your hand and tell me what the question is asking for and it's answer. So the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So what do you guys think the question is asking for.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Right so in the question, it says what equipment did the scientists use so now when you're looking back at your paper with the sheet describing all of this.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"What you should be thinking about what equipment specifically you saw that was used to discover water, the key words in here, I think are equipment and to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,But the question was asking for what was what equipment was used to find the water not look at it after it was found.,,,,
Oliver,210.2,"Ok, ok.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But for this specific question, we are looking for what equipment was used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Chris,210.2,"REach Every Reader: Ok, ok.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So um first let's go over it, so the question can anyone tell me what off the bat the question is asking? yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,210.2,"Okay, I think I got this all figured out so I'm all good.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay so Luis, then, can you explain to me what the question is asking?",,,,
Luis,210.2,"yeah okay sure, and so it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,mm hmm So what is the question looking for and it's answer.,,,,
Luis,210.2,um it wants us to say.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Good right so when we read that question we're trying to figure out based on the reading if water is valuable or not,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Next, Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, but how what equipment did they use or in the text. What equipment did it say they use to discover these things on the moon? Do you know?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Right. But what more specifically did they did they use to discover water on the moon,",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"that's all right so yeah i'll clarify that a little bit when I say let's think of examples of why water is a valuable resource or a valuable resources, something that we can use, so we are highlighting what are some ways we can use water, the water that's on the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,210.2,Oh that's okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,You're right. Does anyone have any ideas of how we can share evidence? Sometimes we can use a quote. Does anyone know what that means?,,,,
Farrah,210.2,"Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. I do remember that. We learned that if somebody says something, then you can say what they said, I think. OK, I don't know.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"You're right, Farrah. You can quote someone that said something, or you can quote what the author says, what the text says. It doesn't have to be a quote of what someone says in the text. It could just be anything that's written on the text.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But maybe, we just need to look at the question a little bit further to know that, OK, you know what this says, we need to focus on the tools, we're going to focus on the tools.",,,,
Chris,210.2,OK. OK.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,And this tools that we talked about in the passage are tools that use to discover something there was another machine.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So we definitely use the microscope to look at the water, but the question asked which equipment, we use to find the water first",,,,
Farrah,210.2,"yeah so they use like some other kind of equipment or tracker or something like the Jazmin said the Lunar orbiter that's what found the right, and then they looked at the water, maybe later after they found it so they didn't use the microscope buying the.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"The evidence that we put out here is wrong, it is valuable, but then, how do we get that water is also another question, we can ask ourselves to see if that evidence of water being valuable is actually convincing. Chris just something else to add to the class.",,,,
Chris,210.2,"I was gonna say I think Oliver and I were talking about this, that they are going to maybe try to make up base by 2024 so maybe they will figure it out by that.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"We still see that as valuable, so I think that, just because we can't it's hard to get does not make it not valuable the water is still valuable not what we're trying to prove in our argument right.",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"yeah that's a really good point, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you for working with us i'd like, in particular, I really wanted to",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Do you remember what equipment do you use to find it?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"I think what the question was asking was for you to talk about what kind of tools, help them discover more water on earth, excuse me, not on earth.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So they do use oxygen tanks. But for this, we're wondering what they're using for the water, you know? So we're wondering instead of just in a general sense what they use, we're thinking what are they using for the water.",,,,
Luis,210.2,"OK. Instead of a general sense, what are they using for the water? OK. OK. I mean, they need the oxygen tank to breathe on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,but something that they used in order to find it is the question that we're asking.,,,,
Chris,210.2,"Well, I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks and tanks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"All right, and what's, the key word that they're asking for.",,,,
Chris,210.2,What equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So we could reward that you find in the text, what equipment they used.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Anything keep the craters We just need to you know the equipment that they use to find the water in the craters okay.,,,,
Oliver,210.2,Excuse me.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"yep so you do need oxygen to help them breathe to find the water, but what equipment was used directly to find the water is what we want to know.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So, for example the question i'll use is what color is my sweatshirt? So when I look at that question, there are a couple of very important words that question.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,color and sweatshirt. The other words and the question don't really have much meaning.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"What makes it a question but it's it doesn't connect to anything you can't see what, but you can see color and you can see the sweatshirt.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"The important words in the question, are the ones that helped create the question and then they connect to what you read, so you want to look in the question and see.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Alright Chris Jazmin Luis and why do you like to share the word that you guys chose for um that was super important and the question or even why you share.,,,,
Luis,210.2,"So I was just thinking, like, I think I got this all figured out, so I think good to go.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,I think that's a really great response you guys I think equipment is one of the most important words in the question.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"so let's go back to our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, what is one important word and that question Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Okay so Chris your answer of scientists found craters full of water on the moon. I had a they did find craters full of water. But the question was asking what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But spending the money, building the equipment, and doing the research, do you think that it would be worth it? Is the amount of water on the moon and the uses for the water on the moon valuable enough for NASA to spend the money and do the research?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Were talking about with our question that we were talking about referring to before it was what equipment just did scientists used to discover water on the moon. So who can tell me what is discover mean?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,We're talking about discovering the water. Yes. Chris.,,,,
Chris,210.2,It's like to to find something,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"The key words in the question where to discover the water. What did they use in that one, that one tool.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,that were discovered was the key word we were looking at,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So they they said right in the question convincing evidence that means we're going to use right,,,,
Teacher,210.2,But our question was kind of asking more broadly in general is there possibility. Our question is asking if the water on the moon could be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Right. So you weren't convinced, but the question. Listen to the word, and is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"Yeah. That's science, so yeah.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,It'll be a verb.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Indeed specifically what kind of equipment is the question asking,,,,
Farrah,210.2,"Okay so well it's asking for equipment that they use to find the water on the moon, and so on. Well, I said it was the microscope, because if the water is so tiny that on in order to find it. You need a microscope to see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yeah, this is going to be a lot of fun. So I first want to go over the question, the question that was asked was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Can somebody tell me what this question is looking for",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"Yeah, so the question is looking for a piece of equipment that's what the answer needs to be",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yeah, now Oliver. Can I challenge your thinking, what is what is equipment mean do you do, you know,",,,,
Oliver,210.2,Equipment is like something you use so could be like a tool or something.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So again, where are we going to look for the answer. Are we going to look around the classroom. Are we going to look to our friend.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Where do you think we can find our answer Jazmin?,,,,
Jazmin,210.2,we have to look in this story.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Well, they used. Right. So the question was what equipment did scientists use",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Now, we need to figure out how they find it. I mean what equipment or Oliverice they are using to discover the water",,,,
Chris,210.2,"Oh so, I have to say the machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yeah, right. But the question is asked her as to find what equipment did the scientists used to discover the water not observing the water",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"Hey, okay. Okay, so they use the Lunar Orbiter to discover on the microscope to observe",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Um, but the question is asking you to find the equipment to discover the water. Not for the oxygen, right?",,,,
Luis,210.2,"Uh huh, uh huh.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so first one off of the key words that are used to cope",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Discover, yes, great this the word in the question and this is the action that we are looking for in the passage.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Perfect that is exactly right and equipment can be some kind of  scientific tools,,,,
Farrah,210.2,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yeah, great sometimes we look at the question. And if we look at an action. The word, but the question is talking about that is also an important a word. So did anybody circle the words in a question that was important to establish equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Good job. Excellent word in the question and it's the action, we are going to look for it.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,But how did they find that ice is the question.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"The first. So I guess if we rewrite the question, what we would say",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Is that the equipment that scientists used even though they weren't on the small machine, it was still a piece of equipment right that they used",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Mm hmm. That's a good point, that's definitely an important piece of the question. I was thinking more along the lines of which word tells us the exact question being asked so that word that I was looking at is what goes on with equipment",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So we're going to be looking for what they used right not how they use something or why they use something just what so but you are right that we are looking for the equipment use,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Great. So we're looking for the equipment used.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Exactly. In an equipment, like you said, Farrah is a tool that they used in order to discover the water on the moon, right.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"The particular equipment that they, the scientists used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so you have the equipment part, you know, that part is important, what action which which equipment. What equipment and scientists used to do what, what is the purpose of this equipment Oliver or Farrah, can you go",,,,
Oliver,210.2,Oh yeah I got it. It's discover,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Right, what specific equipment. Did they use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But when we're looking at our question. We will. This one is asking for us to see in the text, what tools were used. So, although this answer is right astronauts and to use that what we want to see us in the text. What exactly did NASA use?",,,,
Chris,210.2,"Right. Yeah, so that was more like Jazmin's answer cuz she said the small machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Well, so we're looking for what equipment. Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,But we're looking to see what equipment they use to discover the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,They said something about investigating what did they used to investigate.,,,,
Oliver,210.2,To investigate. Let me look for that water in the story,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So let's just say for this question. It says, What equipment do we know what equipment means",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yeah, it's kind of like a tool. So they're asking what tool. Scientists used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,210.2,"Well, it's like, um, maybe. I mean, they might not use the oxygen tanks to discover the water, but they would need to have oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,And our question is about the equipment that scientists used to discover the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So if the question that asked us what what equipment did scientists use to better look at water we would absolutely say the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"What equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon, not which equipment was more important.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But the question that I'm asking is what What piece of equipment was needed in order to find that water they used to different, um, they used a different source of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But the question was, um, what what equipment was used, so that they could find the water to begin with. So it's a different source of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yes, the answer is yes. I'm the question, however, access to think about, um, is there convincing evidence. Can someone tell me what evidence means",,,,
Teacher,210.2,What's the evidence mean.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yeah, it's still valuable, though, you're right, value can mean money to that value has a double meaning, but in this sense, the valuable in the question means",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Is it a good resource that water on the moon. Is it a good resource and why. And if we go back in the text weekend find detailed descriptions and examples of why the water is valuable.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,The fact that water on the moon is being discovered. So now that we know these two things we know what we're looking for a while reading the text,,,,
Teacher,210.2,We know that we're looking specifically for equipment and the equipment is used to discover water on the moon. So thank you for that. Thank you for answering the question.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,But Oliver Do you remember what our key action word in our question was.,,,,
Oliver,210.2,"um yeah I think Jazmin said it, and it was discover.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,discover great and Farrah Do you know what another word for discover might be.,,,,
Farrah,210.2,Find.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yes, exactly so discover means to find.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yeah, like whatever you think that was equipment to discover water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,We have two main questions too many words in this question is discover and equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so what is another what is another main word of this question.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"You say equipment. So what is another word this question, Chris.",,,,
Chris,210.2,"Okay. So I said, the main point was water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,But there is another another word that I want to talk about it.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,What is the verb of this question.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so thank you. So now we have discover water and equipment. Okay, so let's think about it. So now let's think what equipment this science is used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So if we are trying to answer the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. The discovering is the aspect that we want to be focusing on. So was the tool that they use to discover the microscope, or was it maybe the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Farrah,210.2,Oh well.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"What part of the question, did you pull out as being the most important part",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Jazmin and Luis What did you pull out as being the most important part of the question.,,,,
Jazmin,210.2,I picked discover,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So while we're working together. I want you to to you all to keep those two points clear in your mind that you need evidence and that you need to be convinced.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Yeah. So remember when we first started we talked about the question and how it asked you to be convinced based on evidence that it's worthwhile.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,What equipment do they use for this specific job so they do have different kinds of equipment that they use for different things.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Good discover. So we have equipment we have water we have discovered, we put all those things together.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,I think we have the perfect three words so we can combine the words you guys all said: equipment to discover water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So we're actually looking for the piece of equipment that they use to find the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Discover that might be a very important word too. okay so everyone is a circle of equipment and discover,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, well, you know, I think these words are going to really help us when we're looking. We're looking for this information in the test. So the first thing is, um,",,,,
Teacher,210.2,But the question was specifically asking what equipment they used to discover the water,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"what we're looking for is the equipment that's in the text that we read, so I want to turn now to some of your responses.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so friends let's think we all seem to get really different answers and that's always so interesting there's A couple of words that I really wanted to focus on when we were thinking about our discussion questions when we think of the word discover what does that word mean can we think about what maybe it means to discover something?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So um, for example, if I was going to start if I wanted to discover a new element or a new planet Luis we've been learning, you said you really like space and there's been a lot of planets that have been discovered recently right So if I, what do you think that means?",,,,
Luis,210.2,um so like when they discover new planet it's like they find out that it's there they they find it or yeah something like that.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,yeah so to to discover some things means to find or to locate something,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"I want us to think about what equipment like what things did scientists use to find water on the moon right, we want to make sure we are thinking about how they found it specifically.",,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"yeah um, so I think that's why I picked the answer from paragraph two, so I don't understand why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,I want to focus on the word valuable specifically.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,so to be valuable is similar to what Oliver said it to have great worth it to be worth a lot and that could be money like um how we think of it often or it can be in other ways,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But, did you understand that the question was asking how did they find the water and what did they use and so that's why Jazmin circle, the Lunar orbiter the small machine",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Right, the question doesn't ask us how did the scientists see the water, the question asked us what equipment that they use to discover the water",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"Okay yeah i'm starting to see the arm oh oh I just looked at the clock on so sorry we have to go to lunch, right now, but I just wanted to say thank you so much.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yes, I think equipment is a great word to circle.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"We're not asking how they got there, we're not asking how much water was that we're asking the question is asking what exactly did they use what equipment that's a great word i'm going to write that down on my paper as well, what equipment didt the scientists use?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Yes, exactly because equipment, again, that is a good word just circle because we're trying to figure out what object what tools they use to find.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And the water, of course, that is the object that they were, that is what they were trying to find is the water so it's important to know.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"What equipment they used and what they were actually looking for and water like you said Farrah is what they were looking for So yes, i'm also going to write your word down as well.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Does someone think they could start us off by rephrasing that question in their own words?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Well let's think a little bit more clearly about that question right so we're trying to see what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon right like you rephrased. so when the Lunar orbiter actually got there.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,what was the question actually asking us to determine about this NASA mission?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Right so maybe there's not a lot of water. And now let's go back to that question so we're asking what scientists use to discover that little itty bit of water that we can find what tool do you think they are using to find that teeny bit of water?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Hey everyone. So you gave really great responses to this question. I want us to backtrack and think about what exactly is equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So Luis, do you want to try answering that question for us, what does equipment mean.",,,,
Luis,210.2,um yeah okay so as it's like a tool and it's something you use to do something.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So Chris brought up a great point what equipment means. So these are tools, people can use.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"so before we dive into the question I want to ask one of you, what is your understanding of the word equipment, what do you think it means give me an example of equipment from maybe your daily lights.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Right so who knows, just in one word what is this question about what is it asking us about.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,You got it so we're gonna have to find a equipment some type of equipment and what did this equipment do.,,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"Well, it discovers the water and i'm i'm a little confused because I don't know why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,it's asking us to answer this question based on what we read in the article,,,,
Luis,210.2,um I guess it's not really in the story.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Well that's Okay, now we know that the question, the key word was the equipment,",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Well, there you at the end of the paragraph, it says you decide so it's your opinion on whether or not you think it's valuable",,,,
Teacher,210.2,And maybe you don't think that that's a good investment so there can be multiple answers it's all about your opinions as long as you support it.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so now we have all of these big important words that we need to use to figure out what the answer is going to be so we know the answer is going to be a piece of equipment right and it's the piece of equipment that was used to discover it.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So our question is what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon, which is how they found it at first, right?",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"Oh, I didn't even realize I said that.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But before we even look at the article again and start our discussion, what do you think are the I don't know, maybe two or three keywords in that question things that really got you got you thinking.",,,,
Chris,210.2,"Oh, I figured it was about like discovering and water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"and I mean we're talking about the moon right we got to know where we're talking about so it's not all of spaces it's about the moon in particular ours is there, maybe one other yes Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"kind of answers that question right to to discover water on the moon, and then you named it, I think that might be that might be.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,that's really observant of you i'm wondering if the specific question is looking for more of the equipment that they're using,,,,
Luis,210.2,um yeah okay um I can go back and look.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,That helps us to see if we were going in the right direction with our answer.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"In this context, it looks like the specific question you guys identified some verbs you identified the verb to discover, and there was also this word about equipment used to discover so.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Thank you, so if you see with her response what we're looking for is an actual piece of equipment that did the discovery and can you see how Jazmin's.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Alright, so what is it really asking for, what information does it want to know.",,,,
Oliver,210.2,um equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"that's true what kind of equipment, or what kind of equipment that scientists use to discover water are we looking for. Are we looking for equipment that we can use or equipment that we did use?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"What is this question looking for is it looking for a person is it looking for a place, what kind of answer do we need to give to answer this question death.",,,,
Oliver,210.2,it needs to be a thing.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Now we're going to ask ourselves is there anything else in this question that helps us know what we should be looking for so def has identified that we are looking for a piece of equipment does this question say anything else about what we should be looking for.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so let's talk about this Jazmin your answer was that NASA sent a small machine right, and I think we can all agree that a small machine is a type of equipment right.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But, as you and Farrah also pointed out, is that this question is asked me for a piece of equipment and then also a piece of equipment that discovered water on the moon, and so one thing that I am missing from your answer is.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"That is absolutely true our scientists are using a lot of equipment, which is why it's going to be kind of tricky for us to just narrow it down.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And I want to remind us that we are trying to find an answer that talks about discovering water, so do we think that, looking at water and discovering water are the same, are they different.",,,,
Farrah,210.2,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"All right, i'm seeing some nods, so I think we're really onto something here, and I agree, I think this is a phenomenal sentence to us to answer our question can Somebody tell me the two things that this sentence have that our question is looking for.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"The one thing that I want to point out here is that our question is asking for something that helped discover water, which means that before they use the equipment they didn't have the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So something I want to share with all of you is all of your almost all of your responses had something to do with equipment and Jazmin you're right in that we're talking about the equipment used to discover so.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"I want you each to take 30 seconds and just think about what are other words that might mean the same thing as equipment, so what might be a synonym.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,A word that means the same thing as equipment i'm going to give you 30 minutes 30 seconds right now to just jot down some notes write down some notes about what might be a word that means the same thing as equipment okay go ahead and do that now.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So we're going to spend another 30 seconds doing the same thing with the word discover okay so spend 30 seconds writing down other words that might mean the same thing as discover okay go ahead and do that now.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,And here's in brings up a good point that that's exactly what our question is asking us for and what we want to learn from this text what tools are the scientists.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"circle, the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question, so we need to make sure that we identify a specific piece of equipment that scientists used, and then the equipment is used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So when we're answering this, we want to name the equipment and we want to make sure that it's used to find the water",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"yeah sorry about that, let me remind you, so what is another word that means the same thing as discover.",,,,
Farrah,210.2,Oh um find.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"but once again thinking back to the question itself, what do we want the specific equipment to do.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"With the word equipment, because that's what we're looking for right, we want to make sure we include a piece of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And then Farrah to go to yours, I think that's also a key word because that's telling us the action that the equipment is doing so, we need a piece of equipment that's going to discover and to pull it all together Chris, we need to discover water right.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So in our response we're going to look for a piece of equipment that specifically us to discover water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"let's think back to the question right, what do we specifically want our equipment to do.",,,,
Chris,210.2,And to discover the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so the question is asking us about discovering water on the moon, and where are we going to find the answer.",,,,
Luis,210.2,i'm.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, good so if there's a question about maybe where or what is it asking us really.",,,,
Chris,210.2,Okay it's asking what equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But the question right is about the purpose there's a specific kind of equipment right that the equipment, what are the equipment, help them do.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, to discover right discover. When I discover something right did I know where it was before that.",,,,
Farrah,210.2,No.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, for the first time right and is it always obvious like Oh, I know exactly where that is.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay Jazmin I noticed that yeah so first of all, you on finding up the keyword discover is really great",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"which I think is an awesome keyword because, although discover and water are also great keywords.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"But remember how we circled we did circle equipment, but we also circled the world's water and discover so we're looking for pieces of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Great discover what's another important word in the question that we might want to focus on to make sure we're answering it completely.,,,,
Farrah,210.2,equipment equipment and discover yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Does anyone want to talk about those keywords again who's got a key word for me Luis.,,,,
Luis,210.2,"Chris, it's equipment and also discover.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"yup Chris, do you think there are any other words in the question that you would circle, in addition to those.",,,,
Chris,210.2,yeah I was thinking water.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,But I have a question for you so we're talking about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Does anyone know what the word equipment is? or do we want to talk about that a little bit more?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Does anyone know what the word equipment is?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"yeah Jazmin, what do you know about the word equipment?",,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"equipment is like a tool, or like something you use to do something.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"yeah exactly so I brought a few examples, so if you were a baker some equipment that you might use would be a whisk.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And if you were an artist, maybe some equipment, you would use would be a marker. So equipment is a tool that you use to do your job, and if you were a scientist, you would be using some equipment to help you discover water on the moon right?",,,,
Jazmin,210.2,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Did everyone hear that we're looking for one piece of equipment,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"huh what can someone tell me what what is equipment, I was saying it's my mouse and keyboard and we were talking about our supplies, but what what is equipment to you.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so um let's see I also wanted, before we begin, I really wanted to clarify that the word equipment means a necessary item that is used for a specific purpose, such as discovering water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,because the question's asking what what equipment the scientists used and I want you guys to find that in your response okay so go ahead and circle that.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"I want you to so i'm a little concerned that the question you need to answer is asking about the equipment, okay, so we really want to make sure that we can find that equipment in the text um",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And so, for this question because we're talking about what scientists used to discover water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Sure, it was easy to find so when you're faced with the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what's what's the important word of that sentence, do you think.",,,,
Chris,210.2,Oh. Discover,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So what I would like to do is take a minute to think about the WHO and the what and the how so who do we need to focus on?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"In this text and thinking about the question, who do we need to focus on? Luis.",,,,
Luis,210.2,The scientists.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Sure, well let's let's think about it. So the question asked us what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. So what does it mean to discover something?",,,,
Oliver,210.2,Like to find it for the first time.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,But do we know how they discovered and found the water is there a place in the reading where we know what Oliverice they used to find it.,,,,
Farrah,210.2,Is it not a microscope because how how could you discover something if if you can't see it.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"yeah so as far as we know, in the reading the tools that we have our microscopes and lunar orbiters and the question we're answering is which tool to the scientists use to discover the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And so, based on this What could we guess what do we think what piece of information is this question asking us to find.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,but what are we looking for for this specific question?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,We decided that we were looking for equipment that is used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"yeah and so let's take a look at the question again, what is the question asking us to find.",,,,
Farrah,210.2,"Okay, oh what equipment is used to find water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So what what do we think the question is asking.,,,,
Farrah,210.2,"um Okay, we are it's asking us about equipment that used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,yeah so we're looking for equipment that you should discover water on the moon,,,,
Teacher,210.2,do you think you can rephrase that question and put it in your own words.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Great so what what is the question asking for, are they asking for um what was found on the moon, or are they asking for what tools or equipment was used to find water on the moon, what do you think.",,,,
Chris,210.2,What tools or equipment was us.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"yeah I agree, so I think that that's exactly what the question is asking it says what equipment, did they use",,,,
Teacher,210.2,what are some key words.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,but i'm going to pick the one that Farrah mentioned about equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,So it looks like you guys have come to the understanding that the question is asking what equipment did scientists use,,,,
Teacher,210.2,can either you guys tell me what discover means.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"because that's what the question is asking for it's asking for a piece of equipment Chris, did you have a question.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,great and so if we think about what we read in the text and we try to consider this word equipment that might give us a little clue for what we're looking for and so.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,Jazmin I really like how you found the word machine in the text because I find that that word machine is kind of similar to the word equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"because I think of machines and equipment and in us in the same way, I think that those words are synonyms um.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"yeah that's very good Farrah so as you just said, you guys are looking for the water, so if you go into the text and find the similar word to looking for or discover it's going to be investigate,",,,,
Teacher,210.2,Oh that's interesting um do you think you understand the word investigate.,,,,
Chris,210.2,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,investigate can be somewhat equivalent to discovery right.,,,,
Chris,210.2,Oh yeah yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,The equipment is used to discover water right?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"that's I, and this is the thing about the question that we're going to get into, which is what is the wrong or right answer in this question because the question just kind of asked us about equipment right?",,,,
Teacher,210.2,What equipment is used right?,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"And so, if we're thinking about equipment, what piece of equipment is used, based on the answer that you gave?",,,,
Farrah,210.2,a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,so and which equipment did they use?,,,,
Jazmin,210.2,A machine.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay they're not in the story Okay, so this is a good, this is a really good point too um so whenever they ask a question right.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"let's go back to the question, which is what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon. Circle, the evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question right? so what part of those instructions kind of help you remember, oh I got to use the text or useful knowledge?",,,,
Chris,210.2,"Oh, so the part the circle part because I guess I don't have anything to circle when I talk about the oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,when you hear the word equipment what comes to mind Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,210.2,"I would say, when you hear the word equipment, it makes me think of a tool.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"So what does that mean in terms of what scientists are using to get water, what does the equipment mean def.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"so when we think about equipment and we know that scientists used equipment to get water off the moon, what does that mean to you.",,,,
Oliver,210.2,"Oh Okay, that means that the astronauts they couldn't do it like just with themselves, they needed something like a machine or a tool to help them do it.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"you're right no very good job and having it split, how can that help, how is that valuable.",,,,
Luis,210.2,"You remember, if you look Oh well, it's.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,So I see from based off of our answers Farrah Oliver and Luis you guys all did a great job of understanding that you know from our question you know where we're looking for equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"we're looking for specific equipment that will help us find one on the water right and Jazmin and Chris, I also noticed that you guys did that to.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Right good so using those keywords like using building alright, so we got two parts of their so Luis said.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"tools is another way that we can help us find the word and then Jazmin said that we're also going to look for clues like digging and building, so that we know that we're using the equipment right anybody else anything else.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Okay, so how about I build off that again So what are we looking for with the equipment that we're using.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"All right, so in order to so we already have our background information, we know that we're looking for equipment or tools that's going to help us find water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"so also build enough that remember the tool that we're looking for specifically it's supposed to find the water, you know it's supposed to help us collect the water search for the water, and so you guys mentioned the cups.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,"Good alright, so we see we have different pieces of the context of what we're trying to find here, so the main part of the question is what equipment, did they use to find the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.2,And it seems like there's almost two parts to this question right what tool was used and how was it used What did it do.,,,,
Teacher,210.2,"so let's think about how does this answer the question about is it valuable, is it helpful right um.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Farrah and Oliver are you ready to come back to us with an answer, or do you want me to to investigate some other answers first.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Okay well um so we we saw where it said lunar orbiter and we also heard you tell Jazmin that lunar orbiter is the right answer, and so I guess, I guess, I know that now, but I don't know um how I how I would have picked lunar orbiter instead of microscope does that make sense.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"but do we know for sure, does the paragraph tell us that they they had to does it say the scientists used one.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,awesome so Jazmin how could you rewrite your answer to include that piece of information.,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,i'm okay um NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, and our question is what equipment did the scientists use so does that sentence mentioned that the scientists actually use a microscope Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Oh um in that sentence, no.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Did scientists yeah so we're thinking about equipment Chris Chris does your answer mentioned equipment.,,,,
Chris,210.3,It,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"We are trying to use this text, so does this text mention those oxygen tanks at all Luis.",,,,
Luis,210.3,Um,,,,
Teacher,210.3,My question for both of you is did the scientists actually use that equipment when they were working on the moon,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Absolutely. So Oliver if I asked you what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,  how would you answer that using this textual evidence.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Okay, well, I mean I guess it sounds like the right answer is, you know, lunar orbiter um, and that's in the text, but I kind of think there's evidence that um the microscope's the right answer too.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,You're right you did talk about the water. But let's look at our discussion question.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Does it say anything about the equipment that they used?,,,,
Chris,210.3,"Oh, no, no, it talks about the craters not the equipment",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Need you to narrow down your answer more specific.,,,,
Luis,210.3,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, Farrah, which what, what, where did you circle or words.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Did what important word or words did you circle in the question.,,,,
Chris,210.3,So I circled water.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"And they do use that, but I'm just like with Chris. I asked him, did they use that to discover the water",,,,
Luis,210.3,"I guess not. Like, I guess they must have used they used it, but they didn't use it to discover the water like that's not the job of like the tank or the mask.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So Chris. When we read deeper into that passage, and the answer that you gave us. How else could they have found or what other Oliverices could they have used to find water on the moon in the craters.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Ah, well I guess that's I kind of was thinking about what he was saying because I went to NASA with my dad and we saw that they use masks and suits an oxygen text to explore them. So I guess I was thinking maybe they use that stuff to go in the craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Farrah. Do you think that could be is an important way to express that water can be valuable in the future.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Yeah, I think what's interesting, because I do think that it could be valuable. Maybe sure I see that in the reading.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But how can that equipment, find the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yeah, which that really isn't telling us",,,,
Teacher,210.3,What the machine was right.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Luis Did you find anything was talking about oxygen.,,,,
Luis,210.3,"Um, yeah, yeah. Okay. Um, well, okay. No, it wasn't about oxygen. It was just about ice and ice and water in this first part.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Now did scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon?,,,,
Luis,210.3,"Well, I mean, no. They didn't use them to discover water on the moon, but they use oxygen tanks to breathe on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"And I think Luis That you had told us about oxygen tanks. Did they use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon, or did they use it for something else.",,,,
Luis,210.3,I might use oxygen tanks to breathe.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, so we know, we know that much, but we still don't know what they used to, to discover the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Luis Did you find any evidence when you were looking to answer that different question.,,,,
Luis,210.3,"To two pieces of equipment. The small machine that Jazmin was reading about, and then the microscope that Oliver and Farrah were talking about.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So do you think Chris, that if we're asking about the equipment that's used for water, we would need all of the different equipment or only just the parts that would help us discover the water?",,,,
Chris,210.3,That's a really good question.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do you think--,,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Sorry, sorry.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Right, so that's why I was looking at Jazmin's answer. And she said, NASA send a small machine. And what else could she have put instead of just a small machine?",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Ah, I'm not sure.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Well, yeah. What else could you have put in your answer instead of just saying a small machine, how could you have made that more in depth answered it more in depth?",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,NASA sent a machine to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Bus a small machine that could be anything. Couldn't it?,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"yeah, I guess so.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,So what else could you put in your answer?,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do you know what the small machine was called?,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"As a, as the teacher, you know, if you want to put yourself in my position a little bit when I see response like that. It's hard for me to know what you meant, because maybe what if I grade your paper before I grade Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Yes. Okay. So there's definitely some room for improvement there and you gave some good information but,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Improvement and tell me what changes. Did you make,,,,
Luis,210.3,"Okay, so, um, I heard that you when you're talking to Farrah and Oliver and you're asking them to think about the idea of the story. So I took out the oxygen tanks and I just had that scientists use a lot of equipment on the mode.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Um, depending on size. Could a lunar order maybe also be a small machine.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Yeah, yeah. I think that fast, the probably the one that I was talking about, I guess.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Just to kind of circle back a little bit. I think a Farrah. Now that we've kind of talked to some other people in the class there. How do you feel about your answer. If you were giving it another shot at it. What might you say instead,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Okay. Um, so like you told Jazmin and Luis that they had to have more more",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Perfect. Now, what was the microscope attached to?",,,,
Farrah,210.3,I'm not totally sure,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"You didn't. You didn't actually name the machine, right.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,So if you look into your statement. Does that answer the question.,,,,
Luis,210.3,I guess.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,So that's going to be very valuable. So what else can be valuable there. It talks about in there.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,How are you going to is that all of the information or just one part of it.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"That's right. What else, what other purposes. Does this takes point two for that answer.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Oh, there's more.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Right, so it can be used for what else",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Right. And they have, what do you know, there's one more. I think",,,,
Oliver,210.3,I can help help cars malls own could be stopped for spacecraft. It could be a gas station.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Very much and Farrah. There's one more.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Right. So what would the use of being able to split the hydrogen and oxygen apart? What benefit would that give the astronauts?,,,,
Luis,210.3,"Well, I don't know. I just saw it in the story, and that looked like that was the important thing. And I know I learned about it in science class.",,,,
Luis,210.3,OK.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So that's a good answer, Luis. You just need to go in a little bit more detail on that. OK?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yes, they would have to do that. But they would have to work on their atmosphere, right?",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Um-- um--,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But like I was discussing in the last session, about what we thought was science fiction a long time ago, like with Wrinkle in Time, it can actually happen, possibly, in our lifetime, to where they're able to do that.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,Oh. So is my answer wrong?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,You need to go into a little bit more detail on it.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Right now, you may not see a use for water being on the moon, but in the future, as we continue with our space journeys and explorations, then possibly water will be very, very valuable on the moon.",,,,
Chris,210.3,Mr. Lawrence?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So according to that. Do we think they people were actually on the moon. At that time, or did they just send that machine called the lunar Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Chris,210.3,Not sure,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Jazmin or Luis, did you have any other keywords.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yes, there could be and that would be great for for another reason. But let's look back at if we have people on base. Don't they need oxygen to breathe.",,,,
Luis,210.3,"Yeah, yeah. Okay, so then that's so. Okay, so then that's my answer so that they can breathe.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,So they would use the oxygen breathing. Now what about the hydrogen part of it. Why would the hydrogen be useful for,,,,
Luis,210.3,Look back at paragraph. I don't know.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Farrah and Oliver have your answers changed at all. After discussing Chris's Jazmin's and Luis's,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Oh, I mean, I can see I can see where they're coming from, but I still think that I was right. I said, not for a long time, you know,",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"What, what can you go into a little bit more detail for that.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"I'm here. Yeah, they're not gonna be able to have water for like a long time so. So the answer's no.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Yeah. And so since they're small amounts are we going to be able to use it as use it like the amount of water that we use on Earth.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,Nope.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Good. Okay. So you did you found a piece of equipment you found a tool that was used, but did it say that this microscope was used to find the water to begin with. Was this the first machine that they use to find the water",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Well, I guess I'm guessing not",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Hmm. Why do you think your answer is wrong.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Like I'm thinking about, like, who cuz you know how we're all here together like to to like better find our answers and our thinking. So like I think the microscope like, they definitely used it. And I think that's how they discovered it, but maybe my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Now, Oliver. You have the same answer as Farrah. Did you follow along with what we just went with",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Um, yeah, I followed along. So I think like",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, the oxygen tanks allows them to breathe better when they're on the moon.",,,,
Luis,210.3,It does cause they can't breathe without oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Well, did they take a microscope to the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,I just want a little bit of clarification on.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Well yeah cuz you think about like what use it uses talks about a microscope right and microscope is small, right, or it could it be talking about, you know, oxygen tank or I wanted to know specifically if you knew what equipment they used, you know what I mean?",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Yeah, that makes sense. I understand.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"That needs to be clarified,",,,,
Teacher,210.3,To do what?,,,,
Luis,210.3,To discover water.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, so how could that be valuable for the astronauts.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So, all right. So what do you think you can do to add to your answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, do you think, do you think take off for a spaceship could be easier without the weight of the water.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Well, I know that like weight matters because like when we get on the airplane, you know, they weigh our suitcases. And so, um, but I know that rocket ships go out into space and there isn't any arm gravity in space. So",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Hold on you just said they haven't been to the moon yet?,,,,
Oliver,210.3,I don't think so.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Yeah. So how would that be a valuable resource to have,,,,
Luis,210.3,"Well, I mean like if I needed fuel to get back home and they could like make the fuel I guess on the moon and have it be like a gas station so they could fly back home.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay. And so what is. I mean, what is water essential for.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,To drink or bath.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Right, well yeah, take it literally essentially central to take a bath right it's essential to drink water.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, well, did you read the the article that was with the question.",,,,
Luis,210.3,Maybe I didn't really read it.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, what is the question asking us",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"the question sayas, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Now, Oliver. I have a question for you. You said I circled the same as Farrah. Did you actually read the article?",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Um, I did read the article, and I did circle the same thing though, like a section in paragraph three about like you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, but I heard what Farrah was saying about and why you're saying like the dhe difference between like like looking at something and finding or discovering it",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Does that mean they already find the water?,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Oh, you mean---",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"There you go. Okay, so Oliver, where were they finding this water?",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Um, so they found the water in polar craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,But did the microscope actually find the water?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So okay, so are those reasons that it could be valuable.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,I think it's valuable.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay art. So did you read that in our paragraph, or did you listen. Did you hear that somewhere else.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Oh, I, I heard that somewhere else.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Is there any other words that are important. Yes. Chris.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, you do need it to look closely, but that means you already found it right",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Oh yeah, yeah, to look at it. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, so NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So let's look at our question again and see if that answers. What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,It says it's good. So it's good. I don't have to carry on the ships anymore and that's that is some good information. But does that convince us that water on the moon can be valuable.,,,,
Chris,210.3,"No. No, I guess not.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Um, so do you. What do you think, do you think that that's partially convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay. Um, well, just because we can't use it right now, at this moment, does that mean that in the future It wouldn't be valuable? What do you think",,,,
Farrah,210.3,I guess that's a good question. I guess it could be valuable in the future.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Maybe instead of using the word tool we could use a different word, what would be another word that you can use.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Well, I guess, like, I mean, I guess you could say, like, you know, you said equipment like definitely microscopes, you know, it's in a piece of equipment that they looked at, because the water was was microscopic right.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But we're we're expanding our thinking. We want to learn more. Okay, so it's important that we read so that we can discuss and learn a little bit more about water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Improve that in response. What could we do to improve that response.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Can anybody else answer that question, though, why did they need a microscope to see the water. Was there a lot of water in the craters, or was there, just a little bit of water in the craters?",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Yeah, so I thought",,,,
Teacher,210.3,But what did they use to discover it with before they saw the microscope.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,Before they saw the microscope?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yeah, before they had the microscope they have to use what to discover it?",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Well, normally use the microscope to see the things, um,",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But do they use the microscopes on the moon, or would they have to maybe collect the samples, and then we'll get back to Earth?",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,210.3,But is that the type of equipment that they used to discover or investigate the water?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Or is there a better answer?,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"[Reads to herself] The moon is still the driest desert on Earth, the water that is found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,There any type of equipment they might have used to investigate the water?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Does anyone know,,,,
Chris,210.3,I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and spacesuits and masks.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,However Is that the best piece of evidence that we can grab from the article to use?,,,,
Luis,210.3,"Well, I guess I'm not sure. Like when you say the best the best evidence like what do you mean exactly?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, so if I just told you water was split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen, did that tell you any information about it on the moon, or about astronauts?",,,,
Luis,210.3,"I see like I gotta say, like, I gotta say the whole sentence like, you like work with Jazmin when she needed to say like the whole thing about the Lunar Orbiter and the small machine like I need to say like what my opinion is, and then I need to say like what it could be used, is that right?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Right. But did they? After reading that last paragraph we just read?,,,,
Chris,210.3,"Well, in that one, it was talking about a microscope, and how it said the water is microscopic. Meaning you won't be able to see it. You need a microscope to look really closely at it.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"And just like Luis, he had mentioned some as well. They use a lot of equipment. While that's true, is that what they used?",,,,
Luis,210.3,"Well, no. I guess it's not in the text that they used it.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Sorry. Guys, it says, you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Okay. So does that say that that's what NASA sent though Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Oh, um, I guess not.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But does that say, that's what they sent",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Yeah, I can see that.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So they used, how can we",,,,
Teacher,210.3,How could we restate this question.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,How can we restate that question in our answer so that we know when you're reciting a,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Question.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,What will know by the number but like if somebody that didn't know what we were what this passage was even about how could they read the answer to this question and know that we're taught what we're talking about. How could we restate that question.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Can you can can dig a little deeper for me and tell me how, how is it not really valuable right now but it or",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Let's see, let me think about that. How it is so you feel it is valuable, but not for a while. Can you go a little deeper and tell me why was it not going to be valuable for a while.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Like say that those things were, say that time and money wasn't a problem and it could, you know, think about",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Um, you know, trying to think about if those were issues, how it could be important. Now try to think about that next time. Okay. Yes, Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,I'm still kind of confused.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Is the fact that water can be split telling us anything about if it's good or not to have in space. Does that tell us,,,,
Luis,210.3,Is this convincing.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But it just says that they found evidence that there was water. Not that they found a lot of water, they just not evidence, meaning that they seen water there. Does that mean that there's a lot?",,,,
Chris,210.3,"I guess I guess not. If it's just evident to not the water. Um, but, you know, I went to NASA. And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like how Luis was saying, but also masks and suits too",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But the whole the whole thing that this article is about was about water on the moon. Do you think that the spacesuit could help you find water or is it just a tool, the that the astronauts had on them to protect them?",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Oh, so like so, like what it's used for so like the spacesuits are just like to protect but they use other stuff to like find it and study it. Is that right?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So your answer talked about a microscope being the tool use, but what did the microscope do did it discover water or was it used to look at the water",,,,
Farrah,210.3,Used it to look at the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yet, that's right. They use it to examine the water. So if they're using a microscope to examine the water is that our equipment we used to discover it.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"I guess. No, I guess not.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, water could be one. Do you see any other words that could be important.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So it's already telling us it's valuable now Farrah and Oliver. I know that you saw on here that you weren't quite sure if it was a valuable resource or not. But do you see in our heading and in our first line, how we can already start identifying that it is a valuable resource.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,But I'm still kind of confused.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So it says what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon, but a small machine could mean anything.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"No, no, I understand what you're saying, but at the same time, if you're able to find water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Moving forward, this could be very valuable",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Um, yeah, I guess so.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Right. So what does the oxygen tank do Luis,,,,
Luis,210.3,And helps them breathe,,,,
Teacher,210.3,And one way,,,,
Teacher,210.3,astronauts could do what with the water,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,We can drink it.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But if there was water on the moon, but that help us.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"And so, I mean, for example, a small machine could sort of, I mean that could be anything, you know, from maybe even a remote car to even a clock on the wall. But you can't use those to sort of discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,But let's say for example the do you need. Do you need water to live on Earth.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But if one day we are able to, you know, perhaps, expand our you know space traveling capabilities to be able to actually use the water on the moon might be a little bit more inexpensive inexpensive than actually having to transport it to me.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,This can anybody does he might know of another reason that it might actually sort of be beneficial to have water on the moon. They might actually help out astronauts?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But do you think perhaps, like you said, perhaps in the future.  Is there enough evidence. You know, you know, at least going forward. If it were to have some type of, you know, human habitation there on the surface of the moon with the water become more valuable than for those who live there.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Oh yeah, I think in like, Sure, it could be very valued. It just seems like people, you know, like it would be hard to build it and yeah i i could see. And I just think it will be valuable. You know, long time.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, so when we answer something. Do you think sometimes maybe it's we can be a little more specific. That way there's no confusion.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So you, how do you think if we took your answer. They send a small machine which your correctly did what else how could we make that a little more clear for somebody if they had no idea what you're talking about.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Like if we could say what the machine is that's like being used.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay. So we could say what machine is and what, what was the machine here that was being used?",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Machine was the lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,That we need to expand upon some of the answers.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"And they did use a scientific tool called a microscope, but the microscope. What did it show us",,,,
Farrah,210.3,All it showed us,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So now when we look at your answer was oxygen tanks, is that the equipment they used to discover water.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yeah. And then also, um, so when I'm talking to you. I'm gonna say Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Yeah, my name.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"No, it's not. It's, you just need to support it.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Okay, okay. Um, okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yes, absolutely. So I see that we have. Let's look at back at some of our answers. So I see that we looked at our question what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. So I see we have our answers are a microscope, A small machine and then we have some other equipment. Which answer makes the most sense as to what would be found on the moon Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"I'm actually, I'm so sorry because we're really enjoying this. But we have to go to lunch. So before we go, though. I just wanted to thank you like this was really interesting for us the way that you let this class, like we were really able to like think through really clearly like what we were studying and and like able to sort of like understand better and I think like you really led us through that process and it was really interesting. Like, thank you so much.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Now that you've had time to look back what equipment do we see in this passage,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,circled to but the one I circled i think is right. So I don't understand why my answers wrong.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So, Jazmin that you said that NASA sent a small machine. So what two words did you find what two words or what two pieces of equipment. Did you find",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,The small machine and the scientific tool.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,In why microscope wasn't the best choice.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,It makes sense but they still use the microscope to look at the water. So why why I don't know why that's not the best choice because they're both they're both equipped,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"because the microscope was a tool. In fact, so",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So that makes sense that to be able, they're saying to look really closely at the water, you would need that tool. But how did they discover it or another word. How did they find that water. So the only other piece of equipment in the text is a small machine called",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Right? So the microscope does help us see the water. But what's the thing that helps us get to the water in the first place.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So you did point out that NASA a small machine, but a microscope is a small machine, right.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"My question for you would be how do you know that water is valuable, even if it can be split. What can we use those two parts for would be my question to you.",,,,
Luis,210.3,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,But there are other ways in which we can use this water that's found on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Farrah. Can you think of any other reasons why water would be a valuable resource because based on what we've talked about today.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Okay. Um, so I was thinking about what everybody said, and I'm. Oh yeah, I would say. The thing about us breathing the oxygen to",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Oh, Farrah, would you change your answer or do you want to keep it the same as what you've already put down",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"No, no, I would change it because now we can see that there's a bunch of stuff that that does say that waters valuable in the in the story.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay so water is important, but how many since the article is about water. It says that the whole time throughout the article.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,So did they need oxygen tanks on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"That's true. That is very true. Did people go up on the moon, though.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Did people go up on the moon in this article, what we just read. Did it say anything about people being on the moon in this article.",,,,
Luis,210.3,"Um, let me see.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,That is true. Is there a title of that machine. Is there a name of that machine in number two?,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,The lunar orbiter,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yeah, and after number one where you got your answer, did you read the rest of the response. The rest of the article?",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Yeah. Yeah, I read the whole thing and and I wanted to tell you when you were talking Luis about, you know, the oxygen tanks, that I went to NASA with my dad and so I know also that like scientists use a lot of different equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, too.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yeah, so they did talk about using a microscope and that is equipment, but is that what they used on the moon. Was there a microscope up there on the moon that they use to look at it, or do they need them something else before they could use the microscope.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Well, I have the same answer as Farrah, and I remember when I was looking in the story, it was saying, the water they found is microscopic I'm told me that they found the water and and and it says you need a microscope so I figure, they must have brought a microscope to to see the water",,,,
Teacher,210.3,They used a microscope. But what was the name of the machine that they needed to use in space. Do you remember?,,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Well, a microscope is a machine",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Luis What,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do you underline,,,,
Luis,210.3,"Yeah, so I underlined. Let's see, when I looked at it I underlined equipment and",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"OK. So now that you've had time to share with the person beside you. I would like for one person in each group to share their answers with the group so Farrah and Deb, you want to view, give me what words you guys underlying the question.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so what we underlined when we were looking at it we underlined.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Farrah, you had a question on you were wondering why your answer wasn't the best answer correct",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yeah, okay. So, do you know why your answer could have wasn't the best answer.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Well, I guess, I guess I'm still",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Luis What key words, could we underline in this question to help us answer with the best answer.",,,,
Luis,210.3,So I put in for my answer. I underlined equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay. I like how you underlined equipment that is a good word to underline, you are correct. Is there another word in that question to help us under to help us answer the question.",,,,
Luis,210.3,"Um, well, maybe discover",,,,
Teacher,210.3,That may not in depth. Can one of you tell me what words you guys underline,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Oh yeah. Okay, so the underlying",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Jazmin. How could you be more specific and answering your and your answer. Yes, Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Well, I guess I was just gonna ask if",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Farrah. How could you be more specific in your answer.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Teacherr: So how could you look back,,,,
Teacher,210.3,To find that answer.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Well, I guess when I think about discovering the pot. I think like they used the microscope, because they they say in the in the meeting that they can't see the water, unless they look through my school so I thought like, that's how they discuss",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Chris. Did you notice how anything that you could be more specific and your answer.,,,,
Chris,210.3,"Well I, I went to NASA with my dad and I know that, um, you know, scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks asks, and",,,,
Teacher,210.3,So talking about equipment that can be anything from a microscope to a giant rocket or anything.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yeah, so I guess Chris also soften your answer. So if the water is microscopic Chris, can we just see it from, let's say, a lunar orbiter above the above the moon, or do we have to see it with a special kind of equipment.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Well, I guess I'm not sure like which equipment. Exactly. Because you could do a scanner or like, something like that. You know what I mean, like, I'm assuming they're like Probes stuff like that. So maybe you didn't need the microscope. I'm not sure.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So Chris after, after reading, paragraph three, do you think that they were able to see the water with their eyes?",,,,
Chris,210.3,"[Rereads to himself] Oh. No, it says the water they found was microscopic, meaning you would be able to see it if you're looking straight at it. Oh okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Does anyone want to share what they circled,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, Farrah. Did you find anything that helps you to change your answer by circling The key word in the question?",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"So I when I went to circle the key words I basically ended up with the same answer. And that's because I was thinking about what equipment was used to discover the water. And I still think it's the microscope. So I thought, extra hard about it, but I still have the same answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Farrah, did you Farrah and Oliver. Were you able to find in the in the paragraph, where they were talking about the air answers and why it is a yes.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Yeah, we saw the answers. I think that, well, do you have any thoughts.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Do you think that your answer answers the question, Chris.",,,,
Chris,210.3,I'm not sure.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So Oliver, do you think there's another part to your answer other than the small microscope.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Um, yeah, I guess, actually. Okay, so when when we talk about it together. Like, I guess you need the Lunar Orbiter. But, um, I guess it kind of still think it's like I kind of still think it's the",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Your text doesn't say if there are astronauts does it,,,,
Teacher,210.3,But is that all we use to get there and be able to observe said water?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,But is that all that they used in order to find the water. I don't think it quite is,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yeah, maybe not. So if we look back down at your answer, which was there, full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Is that completely accurate.,,,,
Chris,210.3,"No, because they're not as there's just a little bit of water like not a lot of water.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,I want to ask you guys after you've talked to your partners or your group members and we circled are underlined key terms in the text and in your questions. How do you guys think you could reconstruct your answer to be just a little bit more detailed,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Remember, he uses a microscope. Humans look through a microscope right scientists look through a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Were their scientists on the moon to use that microscope to see the water deposits,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Interesting. Um, I'm not sure I have to look at again.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Right, so the microscope. If a human or a scientist wanted to see those water deposits, they don't have to use a microscope. However, scientists were not on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Absolutely. That's a great answer. So your initial answer kind of got started on that process. You said it can be split the oxygen, hydrogen.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"You did kind of explain that you said that they need water. But why can't take a spring water with them. Could the astronauts, you just bring in the water with them. What do you say,",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Okay, let's really see cuz I'm like I was still use like maybe why my answer wasn't quite right. But actually, that makes a lot of sense.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,But it's even more valuable because they,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"And but let's let's consider this hypothetical situation where we do have, yes Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. Again, we have to watch this. But, um, I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us today.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But the water. When you think about water on the moon, are you thinking about oceans or are you thinking about those small those craters filled up with small amounts of water.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Oh,",,,,
Teacher,210.3,What can the astronaut use,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, well, what do we know that the moon doesn't have",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Of plants.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Right. What are we trying to make by Chris tanks and Luis's two elements. Oh.,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,It doesn't have enough water to grow things,,,,
Teacher,210.3,So is it going to have a moon garden.,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"No, that could be something valuable.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So, hmm, is this patient, very large.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Ah, I think it's got to be pretty big. Yeah, maybe.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Maybe, but do you think they had to have a lot of equipment on there.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Um, yeah, to go to space. I figure you got to have a lot of stuff.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,I would tell you. So do you think that they would have enough space for gallons and gallons of heavy water or do you think we could use something on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Okay, okay, thinking about that.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yeah, I like that. Chris, do you still feel like it would be craters full of water on there. Do you think it's gonna be a little bit less than what you said?",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Well, because it sounds like, I guess. It sounds like there's a little less water, but there's not that much water, but there's just a little bit of water.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But is that the only thing that they sent, the only thing that they used",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"They will if, as if an astronaut went to the moon, they definitely would have to, but when we look at this, this text, do we have evidence that an astronaut or a person went to the moon, or was it machines.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Oh, okay, yeah. I guess they don't really, I guess they don't really say.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,I just would like the answer what the machine is called,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Do you think that they would use both parts one part, what do you think?",,,,
Luis,210.3,I think they use both parts.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,that's definitely an aspect of it. um So do you think that it could be used as oxygen or water for the astronauts.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"I mean yeah that makes that makes sense, what the said.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, so when you say NASA send a small machine, do you know what the name of it was?",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Oh, the lunar obiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Teacher:, maybe we can rephrase that what do we use the microscope for? Do you remember?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,yeah nor did you notice anything about will you circle anything special about the microscope.,,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Well, I noticed that he said.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"is asking could water on the moon be valuable at any point um and so you said no, but i'm wondering if you think that the answer could be yes um and why it could be yes.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,So why could it be yes.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"awesome yes it is um, but I do want to ask you, while that is from the text does that tell us if the water on the moon is valuable.",,,,
Luis,210.3,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So even though it's not ready yet Farrah, do you think that the water on the moon could be valuable in the future.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,yeah yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Right you you did mention that in your response, which was great. I'm glad that you could acknowledge that. It's just the oxygen tank. Could you use an oxygen tank to find water on the moon?",,,,
Luis,210.3,"Umm, huh.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,It would help you to get to the moon right?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"there's the possibility there's what Oliver said what he said, is there any others, that you have found.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,so how did they use the oxygen tanks to find water.,,,,
Luis,210.3,"wow Okay, I guess, I guess, they didn't use oxygen tanks to find the water they use that to.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"right they didn't directly use that as a piece of equipment to find water like a microscope would be looking at water, but in order to be on the moon like you said you need an oxygen tank because we can't breathe on the moon right.",,,,
Luis,210.3,Right.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Were the scientists using oxygen tanks when they found the water.,,,,
Luis,210.3,"If they're on the moon, then I have to Christ you can't you can't be walking on the moon, without an oxygen tank you can't breathe.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"i'm so Chris, you said, water is heavy so it's good and they don't have to carry it in the ship anymore um is there any other reason why it's good that they were not to carry it in the ship, other than its weight.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"On what your answers could be changed, how would you change your answers exactly based on the information that i've given you explaining a little bit more of what I was expecting from you guys who'd like to go first.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yes, orbiters what found the water on the moon, so how would you change your answer from what you originally had.",,,,
Luis,210.3,um I would say.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,So the question asking what equipment did scientists use So is there any way you think that you could expand on your answer yes Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,I don't understand why my answer is wrong even though you say we really want to expand.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Okay awesome alright Oliver so your answer was just circling the same as Farrah is there any more in depth that you'd like to go and your answer.,,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Farrah is usually right, and I also thought that too.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But since we've kind of brought in our knowledge now about how it takes time and equipment to get to space to find the water, how can we brought in our answer.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,Oh well.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Now, Farrah, did you see where it said the equipment.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,Is I guess the one that Jazmin said,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"And I would like you to just dive a little deeper and either add on or revise your statement to like either add on or say something different to what Farrah said so, is there anything you wanted to add on?",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"um well I guess what I was thinking about was kind of a same thing that they used a microscope to look really closely because I was thinking like if you're gonna see the water, like the ice crystals they're really small, and so I was thinking like that's, the only way to see that.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Has everyone had a chance to reread the question in the passage?,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,yeah,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, so your answer, you're almost there you're almost there, so you talked- you got stuff from the passage, but there is evidence from the passage that can be used on why it is, so why water can be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,So what is the overall goal with this machine? I want you to say it in one complete sentence for me.,,,,
Luis,210.3,OK. So the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Does anyone want to share what words they circled?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay. Oliver, what did you circle?",,,,
Oliver,210.3,I circled the same thing. I circled equipment and water.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Okay anyone else? any other words?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,You only circled water. What about you Luis you're one who hasn't shared yet. What did you circle?,,,,
Luis,210.3,I circled equipment and the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,So what is the answer to our question?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,yeah What was it called.,,,,
Luis,210.3,I know,,,,
Teacher,210.3,So can someone new share out what our new sentence could be that helps answer this question in a lot of detail.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So do you see how they're a little different so while they did use the things that we talked about suits and mass and oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon, they only use a lunar orbiter and a microscope.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,i'm really sorry but we have to go now.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"They could drink it yeah so if astronauts right now it's something about the water there, what do we know, is the water light or heavy.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"that's true, but how does that relate to water.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,I don't I don't know.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Exactly So what does that mean, how is that valuable.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,well.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So, knowing that we could have more people on the spacecraft knowing that water is really heavy and knowing that water um and knowing that it's already there, so people could drink it do you guys think that it's valuable that there could be water there.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Chris. Have you found anything,,,,
Chris,210.3,"No, not in that paragraph. I don't see anything about equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"And that's true, but we want to talk about what, what else they used. So, yes, they use the scientific microscope to look super closely at it. But let's think about what else they used",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"The reading. I know you can tell me what small machine they send, and I know you can tell me what what they used to see it. Chris.",,,,
Chris,210.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, so you, you did the reading and you found that they found oxygen or that they needed oxygen tanks to dig up so now, my question is did you see any other types of equipment, besides the oxygen tank.",,,,
Luis,210.3,I don't remember.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"A small machine, a small machine What else do you remember.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Oh, I just underlined it that's the Lunar orbiter machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"that's perfect, do you know any other tools.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,teacher well Jazmin's looking I don't understand why my answers wrong.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Perfect anything else.,,,,
Oliver,210.3,Was that was the one you were looking at.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,can you add another tool to that.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"The question asks what small machine to do to discover the water, so if the if they're using a microscope to find the water they're already on and you look back at the reading what small machine, do you think found the water?",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"that's a really good question i'm not totally sure because Well, I can look and see because i'm not really sure, is it still seems like the microscope would be the first thing I guess I could second look at.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Luis Do you have anything. Have you thought of an answer. Yeah.,,,,
Luis,210.3,"Um, well, I see a couple of pieces of equipment and the text, you, you, you're right. There isn't anything about the oxygen. But they have talked about a lunar orbiter and I talked about the the microscope, like what Farrah said",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Luis. Did you figure out any answers. After giving yourself a little bit more time.,,,,
Luis,210.3,"Okay, so I I read the whole thing again. And I think the answer is about the Lunar Orbiter, because I know that, um, I think, Chris said that it doesn't talk about water but it talks about ICE. And ICE just frozen water. And so that's why I think that's",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Great job Farrah. so in some of your answers, Farrah and Oliver, I realized you say, you both said no it's not ready yet and so now, after talking about this little bit um do you think your answer has changed at all?",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Okay, well, I mean I see how the that title says that it is a valuable resource, but then in the story, it says something different all right",,,,
Teacher,210.3,It although it's being a little bit expensive don't you think that some of the points from the text would say that it is a good thing,,,,
Oliver,210.3,Ok.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Ok, so if you had to redo your answer Jazmin What would you say now?",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Well would I, I think I'd still keep the first sentence right?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,mm hmm and then what would you add to it?,,,,
Chris,210.3,that's what I put in my answer um I did read that they they might have a moon base on the moon by 2024 yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yes, so you said you brought up a good point from the text that water is heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore, but why would that be valuable to people in space in scientists?",,,,
Chris,210.3,Cuz then maybe they wouldn't have to burn up as much fuel.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"but if you look at the question, can you tell me what a key word you're missing is.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,So if you build on your answer that you already have what might you add to strengthen your response.,,,,
Chris,210.3,Scientists phone creators for water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"can you tell me, building on the response that you already have what might you add to make it a little bit stronger?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"yeah so that equipment is used for the scientists themselves right and but do they need that equipment to actually discover the water on the moon, does the Lunar orbiter where that equip excuse me equipment on the moon?",,,,
Chris,210.3,"No, no it's a machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,So what two examples in the text did you highlight that shown that water is a valuable resource on the moon.,,,,
Chris,210.3,"Okay, so I saw a couple things that jumped out to me so one thing I saw is that, like astronauts could drink the water and like that's really important.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"All right, you guys did an awesome job Jazmin after I clarified that for you do you have any new answers.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"yeah so Okay, so I think when I look at it, one of the things that jumped out was.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,That's a great question. So when. So who thinks. Who thinks that the scientists only use the equipment that they talked about in the passage or do you think the scientists use other equipment as well as the equipment in the passage,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do you think the passage list all the equipment they used or just a few of the common,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"SO I'M Farrah in your response. You kind of talked about a tool, did you want to kind of expand and talk with that tool and what it does.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,Yeah okay so i i said i was talking about the Microscope is the tool that they use.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Jazmin, you actually mentioned it in your or just mentioned a small machine in your response. Do you want to kind of broaden that a little bit.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Yeah. When you say, how would I broaden what would that look like?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So, knowing that now, now that we've rerouted do you think you would change your answer.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"yeah, I guess, because the question was what equipment right did they use, so I guess, I was talking about the craters because I was thinking that like that's where they had the water, you know, and I mean with the craters so, but the question is what.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So, which is absolutely true scientists may be using oxygen tanks, but did was that listed anywhere and Article didn't say that we use oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do you remember from the passage what the scientists are using this tool to look at.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,yeah you're looking at the microscopic water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yes, small machine, the name of that small machine, if you look back into paragraph two, it actually tells us the name of this machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,now they have room for what Chris?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yes, so evidence from the text shows us tell us that water can be broken down into two parts, like you said, hydrogen and oxygen and which one of those two do the astronauts use for breathing Luis.",,,,
Luis,210.3,oxygen.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But if you are an astronaut, think about yourself if you were an astronaut wouldn't you want to enable it you found it, even if it was a little amount of water.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,yeah I yeah I.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So Deb. What is something else that you notice from the text or from the question like, what can you expand on your answer. A little bit.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Um, can I ask, how about Jazmin, do you have anything else you would want to say about the reading or your answer that you answered before john expand a little bit",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So I do agree with you, but maybe we could like talk about that if if we had the resources to make that quicker, do you think it would help the astronauts have water on the moon, instead of bringing it on their ship or now well, I mean if they could do it faster and quicker than.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,yeah but the story says that that it it'll take a long time.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"yeah, but do you agree that if it was ready, that it would be awesome to have it on the moon",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Okay i'm still kind of confused.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,So Farrah would you want to maybe like how about Farrah and Oliver could you make a sentence or a new answer to the question that we're trying to answer.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,With the information that we just talked about all together.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Right, so let's go back to your response real fast. You said scientists found craters full of water on the moon. So if there's just a little teeny tiny bit of water that you have to look through a microscope to see, are the craters really full of water?",,,,
Chris,210.3,"No, I guess not, but the story did say that it was like deep in the craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"That, how is that valuable, so we can do that right, we can split water water molecules into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen but what does that do for us, how is that valuable to the astronauts that are on the moon.",,,,
Luis,210.3,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"On the moon, they use a microscope but what but what really helped them discover like what was the tool that really helped them find the water okay",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"yeah so in the question, the question says what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon, do you think oxygen tanks to help them to discover the water.",,,,
Luis,210.3,"Well, I mean it helps them breathe.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Were there any other things in the text that you noticed that were different than Farrah's idea? Well, I think the microscope is the right answer because it's such a scientific tool, and the question asks about equipment, so I didn't see any other scientific tool in the story.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,so was there a word that you guys picked in your group that you got that you thought was important to a question.,,,,
Luis,210.3,yeah we thought so Chris and I both thought that equipment was a really important word and that we thought that equipment was the most important for.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,So what words are what equipment has mentioned.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,That is also used to find water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Would anyone like to raise their hand and share the word words that they circled.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,The lunar orbiter So how can we incorporate that word lunar orbiter into our answers?,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,I could just say NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Chris, how could you incorporate the word lunar orbiter into your answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Where do we use a lunar orbiter?,,,,
Chris,210.3,On the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"On the moon, and where can we use a microscope?",,,,
Chris,210.3,anywhere.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,How would we make our answers a little bit more specific?,,,,
Chris,210.3,"You know now i'm going to add that to my list of equipment, because I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,but also because the water is so small on the moon right?,,,,
Chris,210.3,yeah yeah it's microscopic.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,So how can we add those into our answer?,,,,
Oliver,210.3,Okay um,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Chris, how can you change your answer?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"All right, let's go to Jazmin Jazmin, how can you change your answer?",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Oh, excuse me teacher, I was just thinking about the water on the moon, I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"yeah all right Jazmin, how can you include those into your answer?",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Okay um,,,,
Teacher,210.3,So in this answer we're talking specifically about the moon. So which one of those things do you would you think would be more specific?,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Definitely, the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,awesome So how can we change your answer a little bit Jazmin to include that evidence and then also include the little the Lunar orbiter?,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Okay um NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Luis, how can you change your answer?",,,,
Luis,210.3,"Oh, I gotta do this, too?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Well, your answer is not completely wrong. You did say that NASA send a small machine, but can you tell me what that small machine is",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Oh, okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"A lunar orbiter. So the question of what type of equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, what would be a good full answer, Jazmin?",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,What type of equipment did scientists use to INAUDIBLE,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"You are probably right, NASA does have a lot of money. But if they do the research, and they spend the money, and then they don't get a lot of water, then what? Do you think they would be upset?",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Oh yeah. My mom gets really upset if she spends a lot of money on food, and then my brother doesn't eat it. She gets really mad.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,That they use to find that water. So what would you add Chris to your response about finding the water in that specific equipment.,,,,
Chris,210.3,"Oh, well I guess what you said to Jazmin is it that is the Lunar Orbiter. So I guess I would say they use the Orbiter to find the craters full of water.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,So do you think they would use a microscope to get through these tough exteriors. Do you think that would be the best equipment that they used to specifically find the water?,,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Um, no. I guess before you use a microscope, you probably need something else.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,So thinking about it that way if there's not think taking the logistics out of it and all the specifics that they've stated in the last paragraph taking all that out of it. Do you think there are valuable ways we could use the moon water for astronauts and whatnot.,,,,
Oliver,210.3,I will show like the whole drinking water thing.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"That's really, really cool. Do you think that NASA used astronauts suits in oxygen when they sent a machine to the moon.",,,,
Chris,210.3,Oh well.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Very good. Does any of that equipment that you listed. Do you think that that equipment would be useful for finding water on the moon.,,,,
Chris,210.3,"Well, I mean, if there's astronauts there.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Because a small machine could be anything. It could be,,,,
Teacher,210.3,It could be a computer later right,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Yeah, right.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Because if I was somebody that didn't read the text I could think of small machine was anything right?,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Yeah. Oh, okay. So, I should say, I should say that in my answer. Should I should say Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,That would make your answer spectacular.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yes, but I'm going to challenge you for a minute. Can I challenge you, as a detective.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Totally know it's, it is important, but I would like you to look for the other one too, okay?",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Yeah, okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Is it possible that there's more tools that scientists use to discover water.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,So can you tell us what to the oxygen tanks used for.,,,,
Luis,210.3,"Well, because there's no oxygen is based on the astronauts would need them, or else I couldn't breathe up there, they need them to survive.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yes. And because you told me an equipment is the most important words in the answer. So what do you think, how will you revise your answer to include the equipment.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Oh, well, okay, so I went to NASA. And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, so what was one of the keywords that are you circled, Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Oh, so the word I picked from the question, but I thought was most important was equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,And anyone else do want to show you your keywords.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yes. Great. And I appreciate that you used the evidence from the text, but do think microscope is the best answer?",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Um, yeah, I do. Because it's a scientific tool just like it says right there in part three microscope is a scientific tool. Um, yeah, so that's Aw.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,When you add reading a passage and talk about what you will change and why you change that in your answer.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,How you will make your answer more specific?,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Oh, well, what if I use the keyword like I could said I could say NASA sent A small machine to discover the water",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Teacher : Yes, it's very, very cool. But is that equipment. Were craters equipment?",,,,
Chris,210.3,"No, no craters not equipment. But that's where they've had to find the water",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Teacher : Right, so how did they get there though what equipment do they use to find it.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Oh well, um, I actually went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like like oxygen takes like Luis was saying and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Teacher : Right, so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, but that doesn't necessarily say that NASA sent a microscope to look really closely, it does it.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,I guess it doesn't say that NASA sent it.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,But what was the key word that help the scientists find the water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay. And so, Farrah after hearing the equipment and what it was used for in the question number one. Do you think that lunar orbiter is the right tool, or do you think the microscope is after doing more research?",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Well, I guess I'm still a little confused like it definitely sounds like lunar orbiter is a good answer, but I guess I still think microscope is a good answer too.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Right, so the microscope helps us see things that is really small, but Not necessarily found the water on the earth right?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Right so Jazmin, which tool. Do you think found the water. The Lunar Orbiter, or do you think the microscope did?",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Well my answer to begin with was the small machine. So I still think that's right. And I don't really see what was wrong with my answer. NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,The small pieces of ice. So did the Lunar Orbiter find the water or did the microscope find the water?,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Oh,",,,,
Teacher,210.3,So do we think that maybe we just should include both of those responses to make one response together.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,That's it.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So is that referring to any equipment, that the scientists found or used?",,,,
Luis,210.3,Nope nope nope nope nope nope Chris. You didn't even say,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yeah, discover and so you're going to go back to your answer for microscope it it's not asking which equipment they used first, what are they asking?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Discover and let's analyze your answer and see if that really answers the discover part.,,,,
Chris,210.3,So I said the water the scientists found was microscopic so,,,,
Teacher,210.3,If we had a microscope in our classroom. Do you think we would be able to see all of the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Or do you need more than that.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Well, they said it's really small. So if you don't have the microscope, you can't see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Right, they did and they did that through what equipment.",,,,
Chris,210.3,Lunar Orbiter I guess.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Did you get to find what equipment they use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Chris,210.3,"Oh, like the stuff they say in the story.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Great. So do you understand why your answer might have been not complete last time and now it is,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Because,,,,
Teacher,210.3,But what is our question asking us,,,,
Luis,210.3,"Okay, why did scientist us to discover why",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Did they use their oxygen tanks to just be like, Okay, I'm gonna throw this oxygen tank at the moon's so that it discovered water.",,,,
Luis,210.3,"Okay. Well, well, they were using the oxygen tank star for you.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,And that's one part of it. Do you remember any other parts from the reading.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Well, I read it, I read the whole thing. But that was the piece of equipment that I thought because a microscope is like a tool.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do you remember what it was called,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Yes. And in addition to finding your partner's answer you're going to also look for things that you would add to their answer.,,,,
Luis,210.3,"Oh yeah, okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,I see. And as you're reading. Is there anything that you think you might want to add to that.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Oh, well, no, not really. I mean, we have the same answer. And I guess I still don't understand why that answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Okay. And as you're reading. What are you able to see in the reading that you might want to add?,,,,
Luis,210.3,"Well, I was thinking that like we could add some other equipment like oxygen tanks, because that was my answer. And I'm Chris was talking about how he wants to NASA. And so he knows that there's like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,I can see how you're starting to put together what we're talking about here about partial answers and why sometimes we need to just add a little bit more to them.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So we probably didn't need the equipment and and oxygen tanks and masks and things like that. But I really liked that we were thinking maybe the next step, maybe in the next step would be to bring an astronaut.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,So Luis You answered equipment like oxygen tanks. Do you think that oxygen tanks were used to discover the water,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yeah, and that's a great microscope helped us to look at the water, but do you think it helped us to discover that water.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Well, I mean, how could you discover something if it's too small to see. You have to be able to see to find it.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"and so do you think that if we look back in our texts, there's something that says  A piece of equipment that helped us to find that water before we used a microscope.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,You want me to read it again or,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Luis, and Jazmin. Do you have any suggestions on your answer how we could improve upon your answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do you notice anything else about the equipment that they mentioned,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Like about the machine or about other equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yeah, so that's a great answer. But I'm wondering if you can give me any more details for that.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Looking at that question now and looking at what you just read. We read in the text. Do you think that there's a way that you could improve upon your answer.,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Well, I guess I could put more more like from the text, so I could add",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Yes. So I saw that NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So let's take the next two minutes to read through the article, you can have your previous answers. I love just add to them and then we'll talk about it.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do you think that there are more or different kinds of tools that scientists use on the moon.,,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Um, yeah. Um, there's definitely other things like I was working with Luis, and he has had his answer was the oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,So did your original answer change in any way after working with Luis,,,,
Oliver,210.3,"No, no, because, um, I don't really think the oxygen tanks have anything to do with discovering water.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Has anyone is thinking changed.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Luis Would you like to answer my question of how we can use everything from the tech to support our answers.,,,,
Luis,210.3,"So does that mean, like, I'm like, you have to use a word from the story.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So you said a small machine, but what some machine would you be talking about.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Yeah, yeah. Um, so",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So now Luis going back to your response you did a great job talking about equipment that scientists use, but do you think that the oxygen tanks themselves were what was used to disk to discover the water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,210.3,"Well, what oxygen tanks would do, was they would have the astronaut stay alive, while they were looking for the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,In a microscope we're talking about seeing things so do we think that the microscope itself helped to find the water or maybe they they looked at the water with the microscope.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Oh Okay, well, it sounds like maybe they just use the microscope to look, but I guess what I had been thinking is, how can you find it if you can't see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yes, so I see that you had said that the craters were full of water on the moon, but does it seem like there's a lot of water in these craters or maybe just a little bit.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Well, I mean that part definitely just a little bit.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,The sentence and your previous answer.,,,,
Chris,210.3,"yeah yeah cuz i'm this one, the one I just read says they'll look for ice deposit in a large polar crater in my sentence says.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,what's The purpose of this equipment.,,,,
Luis,210.3,To find water.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, so can you go back to your answer and then now does your answer like address this question.",,,,
Luis,210.3,"Oh, and okay so so no it doesn't address that question because you know accident tanks are used to breathe, but I guess.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Just the machines name right.,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Yes.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,You're right. But the you think that for these experiment they send a oxygen tanks. Do you think it was necessary to send oxygen tanks to discover water?,,,,
Chris,210.3,"well if there were astronauts they'd need them, but",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"I wanted to prompt you to think about what happened before they looked through the microscope in order to look through the microscope, you need to have a sample.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,You can turn and talk and you can look at the first two points and think about how they may have gotten the sample to look at through the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Do you want to rethink your response and see and see if that maybe makes sense to you that if the moon is drier than the driest desert. Do you think there's water on the moon, a lot of water.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Well, there's definitely water but",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Can you maybe think of what that machine did in order to get the water. If we look at I'm at point two. And we read past that first sentence.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, did you have any different thoughts.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Well, I guess, in part two. It talks about a machine, but I don't really understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yeah. So, does that sound like an answer to the question that we are trying to answer.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Um, I guess. Yeah, that sounds like they use the Lunar Orbiter to help find the water, but I don't know if I would have picked it the first time.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do you have a question. Do you have an answer for for the vocab words you would choose from the question.,,,,
Luis,210.3,"Oh yeah, I have an answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Farrah, have you chosen a vocab word yet.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Um, yeah, I guess.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,And when you come out of that. I want you to have a revised answer.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So maybe your answer is already right but maybe I want a little more, maybe your answer is not really right. And you can just change it completely. So go back into the text.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Alright, I see people looking up. So I think we're gonna I'm gonna ask for some provide answers. So maybe, maybe some new information that people found to help me answer the prompt",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Anyone else have any information that they can share with me, Oliver. Go ahead.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"I. Yep. Okay. Um, so using those three words we picked, I would say the equipment to discover the water was a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So what it, what word. Did you circle then.",,,,
Chris,210.3,Um equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,What did you circle Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,I circled discover,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Farrah, and Oliver were you able to find a little bit more information about what equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, so do you believe that this could have been part of the equipment that was used to discover water on the moon",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"I mean, I'm",,,,
Teacher,210.3,You know what else did they use,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Oh OK so it's kind of like they a tool like work together.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank is not the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,210.3,um well yeah because if there's astronauts up on the Mon discovering water they definitely have oxygen tanks 100%.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do you think that your answer answers that question.,,,,
Chris,210.3,"Oh, what a scientist use to discover.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Um, did they discover the water with the microscope or did they find something else to find the sort of source of the water?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,What might be the effect that where we just read a text one time,,,,
Teacher,210.3,some of these texts are pretty pretty dense pretty complex if we only read them once what could be the consequence of that how that,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Well, if you only read it once.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"so can anyone explain to me how the water that was found on the moon, is perhaps different than the water that we have here on earth.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,so Chris we'd love for you to share with us if you if you would um how water exists on the moon differently than it does on earth do you happen to know the answer to that.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do they go to the moon? The astronauts? Or is it the machine was sent to moon? What do you think Chris?,,,,
Chris,210.3,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"When we were thinking about what we were what scientists were using specifically to find water, though, do you think that there's anything else that maybe they could have used that wasn't oxygen tanks.",,,,
Luis,210.3,"um I mean there's probably some other staff what I know that if there are astronauts on the moon, they definitely have oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"yeah so um I love that you guys were thinking about them that equipment, because that is an important tool but  were they using it, the microscope to find it or to look at it.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Well, I know they were using it to look at it, because that's exactly what it says in the answer um.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, and was there any other tools are parts that machine that helped it do that make it had to get it's all from the moon that you're talking to you had to discover some more ice so.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Does anyone else have a reflection on how they would go back and try to edit their answers.or revise I should say yeah Oliver.,,,,
Oliver,210.3,yeah yeah okay from from what we talked about it sounds like there's kind of two right answers like you could say um so they sent the Lunar orbiter and then the Lunar orbiter used a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"yeah awesome Okay, so how would you revise your answer to include that equipment part?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So Oliver, you also wrote your response about the microscope. So looking back at the text, are there any other details that you might want to include now.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Well, I, since you were telling Jazmin the thing that she said was was the right one, then I think i'm gonna change my answer from the microscope to um the lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, so if you got to -when you revise your response, what do you think you'll change?",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"um Okay, so I was saying that it was the microscope that they're looking at the water closely at, but now I think it's the Lunar orbiter that they're looking for the ice with.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So if a scientist is looking for just a little bit of water on the moon, like all the rest of our friends here said, think about what kind of equipment that kind of scientists would use to look for water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,210.3,"Okay, I think I get what you're saying like um all astronauts need oxygen tanks, but um certain astronauts need something different to find the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"I want to push you a little bit to think about what the scientists, be able to use the microscopes on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So an astronaut or a scientist if they were to use a microscope on the moon like Chris said they would need to wear one of those big suits to keep them safe, do you think it might be a little challenging to use a microscope with a big suit or do you think they'd be totally okay.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,It seems like that'd be pretty hard.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So, yes you're 100% correct So if you need to look at those really small bits of water does that help you discover all of the water on the moon, or just bits and pieces of that water.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, and that's correct, do you think the oxygen tanks help them discover water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,210.3,"wow they need the tanks to stay alive, while they discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Correct yeah that's great and then do you think that there's other equipment that they probably used in order to discover the actual water.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Would you be able to describe why it's not a microscope.,,,,
Luis,210.3,"um, no.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So were there other things, that the astronauts used to look for water, other than the microscope?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yes, I think they're really cool. So if you thinking about a microscope from where you are right now using that do you think you would be able to see something on the moon like that far away, just like the water on the moon that far away.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,From earth no way.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So Farrah excellent analysis. But they did need the microscope to look closely at it, but for that first discovery, what did they need?",,,,
Farrah,210.3,The orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do you now see what the name of that tool was called?,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"yeah yeah This makes this makes a lot more sense now, it makes sense that the the machine the Lunar orbiter they had to use that to to find the water discover it like it says in the question on that makes a lot more sense.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,do you see the name of that tool there in the text.,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,I think it was in there um let me look.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do we find the name of the tool that found the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"one thing we want to pinpoint, though, is figuring out what's the difference between the types of tools they're talking about.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,So let's think. was the Lunar orbiter the machine that found the water or was it a microscope that found the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,So do you think you could add something to your answer Jazmin to make it more complete in more correct.,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Well, I guess, I could I could just say that name the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Farrah, you are right that the microscope is a piece of equipment, but is the microscope what they use to discover the water on the moon or.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Oh, so the oxygen tanks are helping the astronauts survive not really helping the astronauts in discovering the water.",,,,
Luis,210.3,"Well, I mean I guess you need to breathe to discover water that's kind of what I was thinking.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"can you tell me a little bit more, what do you think are astronauts and scientists one in the same?",,,,
Luis,210.3,um astronauts are a type of scientist?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But in this case are we looking for information from your brain, or are we looking for information from the article?",,,,
Luis,210.3,I guess the article.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,So what do you think is something you might need to do right now to check your answer.,,,,
Luis,210.3,and read it.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,So what do you know about a microscope.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,Oh lets you see things that are really small.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Very good, so do you think they took a microscope to the moon to like look around like this, to try and find all of that water.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do you remember the name of the small machine.,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Now that you have a little bit of a better idea of what a crater is, do you think a crater is a piece of equipment that scientists would use to find water?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So Chris, do you think you know you mentioned some pretty some pretty big goals there in that in that idea, do you think we're ready to do that, you know, in a year you think we're set up for that well.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"No, no, not not not now.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,do we remember what the small machine was called.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,so do you see how you could add more to your answer and use the question and the keywords to find what kinds of things we want to use to answer.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay So did we we read about those things in the paragraphs, though? Did they talk about that in the paragraph?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Those are all great knowledge or information about scientists and scientists use a lot of different equipments for different purposes right?,,,,
Luis,210.3,"yeah like they need the oxygen tanks, because they can't go find water on the moon without the oxygen tanks or they couldn't breathe.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,So oxygen tanks help the scientists breathe. But what exactly helped the scientists find the water?,,,,
Luis,210.3,"um well, I guess I said oxygen tanks because I was kind of thinking it would help them find the water, because it would help them breathe.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"If we have oxygen but not this small machine, the Lunar orbiter, can we find the ice?",,,,
Luis,210.3,Oh no no.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Perfect so your answer you wrote down your answer NASA send a small machine, if you are going to level that up like a video game, if you just want to like little extra boost to your answer, how might you get a little bit more clarity there.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,More clarity um level it.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,does that machine have a name.,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Oh yeah yeah okay I didn't think about that.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"what about that discover component, do you think the microscope would help NASA discover the water like actually find it.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,hmm because thinking about Jazmin's answer she's talking about lunar orbiter and i'm wondering if what i'd love to hear your thoughts what's the difference between a lunar orbiter and a microscope in terms of what they do for the scientists.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,What are your thoughts about how the scientists actually found,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"yeah I think you're spot on so how might you change your answer the second time if we could scribble that one out and you could write a new answer, what do you think you would say that hits that discover part as well.",,,,
Luis,210.3,um Jazmin's answer?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Right, what, why do they want to use those oxygen tanks though.",,,,
Luis,210.3,to breathe of course. they can't survive on the moon without them.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"then Farrah, what do you think they could do once they really find that location where they know that they're really sure that there's probably gonna be some water.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"To see if you could find the answer which we're looking for, which is in regards to what type of equipment they're using to find water Luis do you think that they are using oxygen tanks to help them find water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,210.3,"um well, I mean it's not like it's not like they look with oxygen tanks, but they need the oxygen tanks to breathe when they're on the mooon.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So here's the looking at these two sentences and thinking back to what you wrote about the water filling the crater and do you think that, based upon the clues that this sentence these sentences gave you do, you still think that there is a crater full of water, what do you think.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Well, I guess, I pictured that at first when they said water on the moon, and I was picturing like big pools and lakes, but on that part yeah that part says it's so small, you can't even see it, so I guess I guess what I pictured wasn't quite in.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Absolutely Farrah I guess, I want to ask you did the scientists take my microscope up into space.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"as well, he then said there's no astronauts so no.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Or is a more of once the water is found, then we can say oh it's a microscopic amount, what would you say.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,yeah yeah that's beginning to that makes more sense now.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,but did you do that second part where you circled information in the text.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,yeah. So do you think adding lunar orbiter to your answer could make your answer even stronger?,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Yeah, I guess so.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yes, you can't see the water out of microscope exactly right.  Does it say that scientists did use that equipment to discover it on the moon.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"I guess, I thought that's what it meant, but now that you mentioned it, it doesn't exactly say that.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,yeah so are looking to bring in our answer from outside information for when you went to visit NASA or are we looking somewhere else for our answer.,,,,
Chris,210.3,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,So do we think that the microscope has discovered the water?,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Oh, oh no.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"so what lets the scientists, know that the water is there.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"After you thought, and you have a good solid thought let's share, what does that mean.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So a microscope is a piece of equipment that does something, but does it discover so think about that piece of feedback and see how it applies to your work.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Right and is that what we're looking for is a.,,,,
Luis,210.3,"lot of equipment that scientists used to just go over water um, I guess, not because now, I guess.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Beyond right so just by what do you think would make your response one bit higher so you tell me the equipment.,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,And I told you.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"What I want you to look for right, so you pulled out the word of discover does your piece of equipment discover water or does it do something else, is it just one equipment to find it are we using it to discover it think about that.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,It looks really closely.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Exactly so in your response, did you name an equipment that discovers water.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"No, I forgot to put that part in.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,And the text right was the oxygen tank information in the text or was that from from all your knowledge you already have.,,,,
Luis,210.3,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Yeah what equipment. Okay, and did your answer have anything about the equipment in it.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"No, but but I went to NASA actually I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but also have masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"yeah yeah I agree that scientists did find some evidence that there was water on the moon, but do you think that the crater the craters are full of water?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,But did they use a microscope to find the water on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Oh well, I guess, I was thinking, yes, because how can you find something if you can't see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,and so i'm savannas answer was scientists use the Lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon do we think that answer the questions completely? Oliver.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Are there any other words you would use to describe this marker?,,,,
Chris,210.3,I would say it's like a thin marker.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Do we know what kind of small machine because, like my my mouse right here is also a small machine, but I don't think that they sent this kind of small machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,What kind of small machine did they send?,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Well, it says, I don't know what it looks like or anything but it says it's a lunar orbiter right that's what Farrah read.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"that's true yeah, and so I wonder if",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do you think that they're using those when they're using the small machine?,,,,
Teacher,210.3,When they're- Do you think that they're wearing their oxygen masks and wearing the suits?,,,,
Chris,210.3,"yeah well, they would have to to stay alive on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Oh right right, so I wonder Chris if they're if they're wearing all those things and they're using their lunar orbiter, then what how did they use the Lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"I wonder if we're missing some pieces, I think we might be missing some pieces for growing things on the moon Jazmin like what about soil.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"so i'm curious if any of you guys could look over paragraph two, to see if perhaps um any of you want to add to your response uh.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"and I really want you guys to just circle um in your responses, the equipment that you that you answered in the the question with, okay,",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"And I also want you to think about um if, after looking at the text, if you want to modify your response at all. does anyone feel like they want to modify their or change their answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Are you are you asking, are you telling.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,Oh man okay i'm telling i'm.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Which one, do you think is correct microscopes or lunar orbiters.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,me or anyone.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"um so let's try to combine some answers So what did they what did they use to get to the moon, in the first place.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,um well definitely not a microscope,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Which piece of equipment, did they use if it's not a microscope.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,Well gotta be the Lunar orbiter,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So if there is a base on the moon,  if we have two pieces of equipment lunar orbiter and microscopes ,which piece of equipment would they not need any more if they have a base on the moon.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,"Lunar orbiter because, like you're already there.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,so how can we add that into Jazmin's response.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Where did they send it to did you include that Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,No.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Right, so I think that that would give you a more complete or a stronger response.",,,,
Chris,210.3,"Okay, scientists, is the whole that's the same.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do you see a spot maybe where you could just add that in there.,,,,
Chris,210.3,hey oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So do you see Jazmin how a Microscope, microscope along with a small machine is used to find water on space.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Oh yeah well, I guess, I just thought that the machine is what they use to do the discovering.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,yeah yeah so so what what does everyone else thinking so now that we've had this discussion are we thinking that the Lunar lunar orbiter from the water or that the microscope on the water or do you think that they're playing different roles yeah Chris.,,,,
Chris,210.3,"Well, I I really like what you just said about playing different roles, and I think it's I think it's that because it sounds like.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Luis so, can you tell me what other tools or equipment may have been used to discover water so oxygen tanks are used to help the scientists breathe it if they go out to space, but what do you think they use to discover water.",,,,
Luis,210.3,And um well i'm I gotta admit I didn't really read this but I listened to the conversation and I heard myself and I heard lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Are those pieces of equipment that you saw NASA used to discover water on the moon, or they used for a different purpose.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So I want you to think about that a little bit okay and see if you can use the answer to that question revise your answer, thank you Chris alright if.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"so Chris, how do you feel about your response at this point.",,,,
Chris,210.3,So I know that Jazmin's answer was the right one um that you um NASA sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter uh to discover water um so I guess i'm trying to think about why.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"i'm going to give you a few seconds to kind of think about that all right, and then we're going to go around and talk about it.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,so this finding Equator are saying that they found the Quakers answer the contexts are connects back to the context of the question.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, what we're going to do we know that so thinking back to the context of the problem, it says what equipment does a small machine connect back to the context of the problem does it tell us exactly what type of machine they use.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"I got it right from the text in part two, it says NASA send a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"so with That being said, they need the you say you need a scientific to call a microscope to look really closely, but then does that help us yep does.",,,,
Oliver,210.3,um i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Okay, so for that, how would they get the microscope to the moon.",,,,
Farrah,210.3,"Oh, oh i'm not sure I guess on the spaceship probably.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,In the reading I didn't see anything that said anything about oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,So what is the small machine called.,,,,
Luis,210.3,lunar orbiter yep.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,Do you think that's what they used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,210.3,um I mean it sounds like something that could be kind of useful because it says loner and I know that that means moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,"So Jazmin I know your answer was that they sent small machines, but you know what those machines are called Do you remember.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"Oh, I think, was in there.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Exactly, and do you remember what they do, what do they look for.",,,,
Jazmin,210.3,They look for the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,um Do you remember where they were.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,yeah Do you remember what a microscope is used for.,,,,
Oliver,210.3,"yeah um a microscope it lets you look up things that are really, really small like you can't see them um just in real life, you have to look through the microscope to see them because they're so small.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"yeah they do so Chris Chris, I know that you said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon Do you remember how they found them.",,,,
Chris,210.3,How they found them.,,,,
Teacher,210.3,yeah Do you remember what they used to find them.,,,,
Chris,210.3,"Well, I mean i'm Jazmin just said, the machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,Good yep so that's one word tool that's one that we could use. Jazmin you have a different one?,,,,
Jazmin,210.3,"I'm just thinking that anytime that you're like making something or or taking in something like I will look for words like making or building or taking like you have to use equipment, if you are doing those things.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"But they do, they do, what exactly.",,,,
Teacher,210.3,"Why would it be helpful, though, to have it on the moon, rather than to bring it with them on a space shuttle right Chris was just telling us that it's very heavy.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Do you remember what they called that machine science has all sorts of wacky names for their machines so that's what we're looking for we're looking to see if we can find The name of what that small machine was,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yep totally yeah look at the text look back, I think it's close to that same line about the small machine i'm not sure, but let us know.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,I yeah totally um so the microscope if you look at the are three sentences Here are three paragraphs.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"In paragraph three, it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you would need a scientific cool tool called a microscope to look really closely so there's the part with the microscope but, if we go before then.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,We see where you found it called the Lunar orbiter and paragraph two right?.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah and what does the machine call.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,A.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"tiny water well can, yes I love that, so we have this lunar orbiter and it's going into this polar crater and it's looking for the small water and where's the small water located in.",,,,
Luis,210.4,and greater.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And what form so so, is it like.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"we're looking for a giant lake so we're looking for what can we yeah well for me, what form is the water in what is the same, the text in part two, yes don't.",,,,
Luis,210.4,fit as a water as ice.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"What equipment, did they use okay so i'm i'm looking for a name to what's the name of the small machine and he came.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That is yeah and I think there, we can see, even in this very short text that we see two different pieces of equipment mentioned right we sad the.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,did they did this third paragraph tell us that the scientist used the microscope to find the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"awesome Luis and which piece of equipment, do you think is the most important here.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Oh, I don't know.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,awesome so this little machine it lands on the moon.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,uh huh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah that's right it doesn't really say that the scientists are using that.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah so that's awesome so it's in the text you both found this in the text, so my question for you is what does this small machine do Jazmin what is the machine doing.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,It lands at the moon South Pole and looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Alright um and does that sound.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,They could yeah so we have to look for something to discover it.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,yeah yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So if we're talking about what the equipment, maybe the equipment has a name right So what does that small machine have a name does anybody anybody circle what that small machine is called.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"I can, I can look.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So microscope is a great example of one piece of equipment that they use, but they also use this use this this thing called the Lunar orbiter to investigate, and those things work together.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So if we're looking at both of those sentences, if you guys want to look at your sheet of paper if you're looking for those two words that lunar orbiter and that microscope, are there any words that kind of signal to you what the equipment is?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And is there a second part of that sentence that tells you maybe what it's called or like the name of an equipment.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,called a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"We are going to be in paragraph two, and I'm going to read it to you. And while I'm reading, we are looking for. Yes, Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"I'm so sorry I'm unfortunately we have to go to the next group and have to end this session, but thank you so much.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So we're going to look at, paragraph two, okay. So I just want you to listen while I am reading and if we find a particular equipment we might stop and talk about it. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You need a scientific toll called a microscope to look really closely. So what is that microscope, helping them do guys",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"It's helping them see it, when they study it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Because it's in our passage. So let's look back and see if we can find it. So it says, NASA sent a small machine called a Looper Lunar Orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. So what is the name of that machine called?",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Um, well, I talked about the polar craters because I said that they found a lot of water in the craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, the small machine. But let's look back and see what that's called. So let's read the sentence. Okay, so we're on number two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh, it's called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Now, what does a microscope do? What did it say a microscope did in the text?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Um, you use it to look at the water",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So you have to find the water before you can look at it right. Does anyone know what discover means?,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Yeah, it's like, um, it's like, um, you said already. It's like when you find something",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right so discovers when we find it so we have to find it first. And we're going to use the Lunar Orbiter to find it. Before we can look at it.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Um, we have to say that need a scientific tool microscope to discover the water instead of just to look it",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, but can we do we use the microscope to discover the water?",,,,
,210.4,Because let's look back at our passage and see what a microscope does,,,,
Teacher,210.4,You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Yeah, Farrah, she said discover means to find it and and we we thought the thing said to to look at it which is different from finding it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So look back in your passage, what equipment did they use to find the water",,,,
Teacher,210.4,If we look at number two.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,This Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small and what is what is ice?,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh, oh, yeah, ice is the same thing as water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Let's go back to our text, we have these specific answers from the text. What equipment did they use?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So we need to go back into the text and find specifically where it states what equipment they used to discover water on the moon and,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Let's go back into the texts and look,,,,
Teacher,210.4,It says it in the text. If we go back and look,,,,
Teacher,210.4,In the text.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Go back and look what's another word that we can use Jazmin.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, a small machine. All right. And what was the name of that machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So let's go look what what he says, Can the astronauts to use",,,,
Teacher,210.4,The water on the main for,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What do astronauts use the water for,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,You that like the water,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But what does it say in the text about how astronauts use the water, it should be under the bottle of water is a valuable source. So why is it a valid valuable. So resource. What does it say",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"All right, and how do they use the hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Well,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"If you go back to the, I think it's the second paragraph, you'll see that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit and a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, and that's where they found it. I think right?",,,,
Chris,210.4,I you know my dad took me to NASA. And when we were there. We saw that like the astronauts used like suits and oxygen tanks and tasks and stuff.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It landed on the moon South Pole. That's where they found it and it looked for ice deposits. So, since it was ice and it wasn't necessarily water, it is but frozen water and And they look in the large polar craters. I guess it was really cold the",,,,
Farrah,210.4,It seems really cool.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So you underlined equipment and discover. Great. So tell me, just reading our passage Jazmin. Can you tell me what the word equipment might refer to in our passage, what kind of equipment. Did the scientists discover water on the moon with",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Yeah, so that's like something that you use to find or do you use, like if you need something. They have to discover certain equipment has the evening mean I use it to discover. And so I said that it's the small machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"but the ice deposits are, what can you tell me what that says the ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Very small. So if they're looking for something very small and they're having to take that lunar orbiter in there. We also read in paragraph three. Yes Oliver.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"I'm, I'm so sorry. But unfortunately, we have to go to our next class. I hate to interrupt, but we have to run. But thank you so much for working with us. It was really fun to work with you. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That word could that's in the second sentence. Can you circle that word could with your pencil, if you will, in the second sentence of paragraph four, it says, it could be useful in lots of ways.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So would you think that the word useful iss also the same as maybe valuable if we look back in that paragraph and it's telling us, it could be useful.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Let's stop for a second. And what did that first paragraph tells us? Do you know?,,,,
Luis,210.4,That scientists have found evidence of water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters. These craters are dark places where the sun never shines.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Okay. Can someone paraphrase that paragraph for me?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, what would I deposits be, what do you think they would look like?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Um, I don't know, like, like ice. I guess.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Is a tool that they use because the deposits are so small you can't see it with your eyes, you have to use the tool of a microscope to be able to see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay that is moisture. But that's still bigger than the moisture they found on the moon. We can see frost with our naked eye, but what they found on the moon, we would not even be able to tell that it's there without the Lunar Orbiter and the and the microscope, being able to see that.",,,,
Luis,210.4,Okay--,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Okay. Do you think the water on the moon looks the same as a glass of water that we would drink.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,I don't know.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"In paragraph three, what does it say about",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"When, when it says we're not able to see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,What does it say right after that.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Good. Yes. So if we're having a glass of water with our lunch, we can see that. Can't wait. We can see that there's something in our glass.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So what does that tell us that the water on the moon is what compared to the water that we have here.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"It's like really, really small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, they might have a because I found it in the in the crater. So there might be lots of it there, but it's so small. We can't see it with our naked eye. Do you know have you turned before naked eye. Yeah.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,My mom says it a lot.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So how do you think that lunar orbiter is being able to do that.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"How's the lunar orbiter able to do that. Well, um, they they taught it how to fly and it flew to the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes. Because remember, in paragraph three, it says, we wouldn't be able to see the water",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Yeah, yeah. That's why I said that that the equipment was the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So they can be found. Did it say that it was there.,,,,
Chris,210.4,Scientists have found of,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right. But this passage was only talking about,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What they found on the moon. So is there anything in the passage that talks about oxygen.,,,,
Luis,210.4,I'm okay. I'm gonna have to look again.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"The Lunar Orbiter helped find the water, but I want all of you to look in paragraph three",,,,
Teacher,210.4,What does it say about the water in paragraph three,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"It says that you, you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So what do we need to do, how do we find that we can't see.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"That that was my answer. I said that you need a microscope to see, I'm not true. Um, yeah, but our answer was wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,If you look in paragraph to,,,,
Teacher,210.4,The fourth sentence. Can you look down at the four sentence.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,My cup right here is 30 ounces,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Would though the word water have to be to take a ton of surface which,,,,
Teacher,210.4,I couldn't even describe that would be trucks and trucks loads of topsoil okay the upload of the moon and it still would only fill this glass.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh ok ok ok I see that now. Oh wow, okay. I don't. Sorry to interrupt our class, but I just realized it's time for us to go to lunch.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"so, would you like to look back in your paragraph to see if you can find",,,,
Teacher,210.4,That answer.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Yeah, I can look",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, and Jazmin, you are correct. NASA sand, a small machine, but can you look back in your paragraph to see if you can find the name of that machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay. Did anybody see that in paragraph four, the word valuable is actually at the beginning of the paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,A lunar orbiter is doing a different job. They called a lunar orbiter to what?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Did they discover water with the microscope?,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Did they discover. Well. It says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, um,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Hmm, let's look back at paragraph two for a second.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So they sent the Orbiter to look for clues. They didn't talk to anyone on the moon, but they sent the lunar look for clues. And what did they find with the lunar orbiter",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"A lunar orbiter. Discovering orbiting, looking around. Used to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Jazmin remind me what investigating means again.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,look for clues,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Good, so they had to look for clues in order to figure out If there was water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,They also had to see the water firsthand what did they use to see the water Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"The microscope, the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Farrah, are you able to relate to what Jazmin was saying where the lunar orbiter is what we use to actually discover the water, but the microscope is what we use to study the water.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Yeah, actually. Okay. That does mean a lot of sense.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right to discover the water is the Lunar Orbiter. Okay, so someone raise your hand and tell me some of the other equipment that we've talked about in this reading",,,,
Teacher,210.4,What we've talked about the lunar Lunar Orbiter and we've talked about the microscope. Was there any other equipment that they've talked about,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"What we read in our, what we read in the paragraphs was there other equipment that was discussed in the paragraph that we read?",,,,
Luis,210.4,"You know, I guess not. Like, there really isn't other. It's just a microscope and the lunar orbiter in the text.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And you are exactly right. They did send a small machine, but they you know what that small machine was called",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"No, I don't remember.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, I want you to look back in the passage and see if you can figure out what that small machine was called",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh, oh, it's called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Okay. How many of you guys were looking for the word water in the in the passage,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So whenever we're looking in our passage we have to be able to  read and understand that ice on the moon is the same thing as water.,,,,
Chris,210.4,You know Teacher. I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like tanks and masks and suits.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And the lunar orbiter it, in paragraph two, it says it looks for ice deposits in large polar craters, the ice deposits are very small. So, do you see how that is our answer? Does that help, Jazmin?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Well, I know the answer. Cuz, cuz you just told me it is but um",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So let's look back in the text. So where in the text can you find the word um, Let's see, let's look for the word, um, machine, machine in there.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Exactly, exactly. Now let's go back and look at that text.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"What were they looking for, again, was it?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So it is asking in the text field like back in the text. There's one piece of equipment that they used looking for that water right,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Well, I saw on you know Orbiter and microscopes that was the equipment. I saw like in the reading.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, exactly. So do you think the microscope to help them. Look for water while they're physically on the moon.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Um, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right. So if you look in the text. This is it. They use the lunar orbiter right,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And microscopes, it has both of them there that but when it's talking specifically about finding water. See if you can look back in the texts and find where it says film equipment used to find water on the moon. Yeah. Chris.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"So we were talking and I was saying, oh,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So if you go back in the text and you look in that first part Where they're talking about the piece of equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,They've talked about the moon being a desert right and they think that there's no water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And then we're looking for what?,,,,
Farrah,210.4,He was looking for microscopes.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, they were looking for water on the moon. Right.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And what does it say about the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Um, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and then it says like it'll land at the moon south pole look ice deposits. So is the lunar orbiter the right answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so you have to think a little bit more about these questions because it says two words that are essential for your answer and one of the words is equipment and one of the words is water. So you have to think about these two words before you try to make an answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"and, let me read this, um, you said, it, Luis, you said that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but the question is not asking you about what they are using to be on the moon, you have something to say, Savanah?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"On. Yeah, I was. I was going to say that in my answer I did talk about the equipment I talked about the microscope and they use a microscope to look for the water. So I have both of those. So I don't know why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Now, what do you think that they use a microscope look really closely. What do you think that they need to look things really closely.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Good question. He said in the reading that paragraph three, that the water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you will look straight at it. So you have to use a microscope want to see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, that's amazing. So you really know what something microscope is something really, really, really small. Right.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"For example, why do you think that they you a microscope.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, well, yeah, I think the same reason like cuz they said it in the in the reading. They were like, You have to. Yeah. Like Farrah said you have to use like a microscope to see them microscopic particles",,,,
Teacher,210.4,If you read the text again.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh, I guess, like, I guess I would have to say a piece of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Let's get even a little more basic there. So, um, what equipment do they talk about in this text? What do we see what what's getting used?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Very good, very good. I'm glad you're seeing it. So let's take a look back, Oliver noticed, paragraph two could have some insight for us. So let's take a back and see what sort of equipment do we see mentioned specifically in paragraph two,",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Mister A, my answer came from paragraph two, but I don't understand why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,But we also have the part of that getting to the moon about searching them all there we've got this whole elaborate backstory. Right. What makes it very interesting to read,,,,
Teacher,210.4,While there is some water there. It might not be a whole lot of might not be buckets and buckets and buckets and oceans of water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Let me make sure I'm speaking, yes. So NASA, they're the ones that sent the lunar orbiter right",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And they're the ones that use the microscope to look at the small, small, you know, particles of water when we find those on the moon. So we know that they're kind of the subject. They're kind of who this article was talking about, right.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But, and that's the part of that actually goes down and looks very closely, but we need to figure out how they found the water in the the craters. Correct?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Once you take a quick glance at it.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,what did they find these with,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right. But what is the text tell you about it.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh, text",,,,
Teacher,210.4,That is correct. And what's the small machine called,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Okay, I found out to. It's a lunar orbiter. But it doesn't say anything about water and that paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It's what NASA sent it will look at the tax. I'm going to help you read it. Okay, NASA send a small machine. So what does that just that first little bit of text tell you",,,,
Oliver,210.4,I'm,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right. And what is it called,",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And what does it say about water can be split into,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,The thing that he said hydrogen and oxygen.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Bob, what does it say that could possibly be the water can be used in",,,,
Oliver,210.4,Other ways,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Or the NASA said a small machine and she pulled that from the second paragraph, so if everyone will look back at the second paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Discovered yes yes now Farrah, later on, they're going to use other equipment right now that they've discovered the water. Later on they can study deeper",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Into the water right they want to look closely at it. And that's what our passage says they tell us that if we if we want to look really closely in paragraph three, we're going to need another tool called a",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Microscope microscope so are scientists using a lot of equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yes or No are scientists using a lot of equipment.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Yeah, they're using. I mean, they're using a bunch of",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, so they are using a microscope. But what is the microscope helping scientists do.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right. That is correct. So they are using the microscope to study and look deeper into the water, but they first had to find the water with the equipment, the small Lunar Orbiter and that's what our passage is about. So",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And then later on in the passage we learned, they, they used other equipment to study the water deeper",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And where did you find that out in the passage,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"So it was in paragraph two, the first sentence. NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Hmm. Well, they do use the microscope to be able to look at the microscopic things on the moon, to find the water that they were digging with the equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right. That is an important thing. So it can be separated out. You can use the oxygen. The astronauts could use that to breathe. And they can also use that for fuel, with hydrogen and the oxygen, if they separate it out into the atoms, they can make fuel out of it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Remember, the atmosphere is what you breathe, the oxygen and--",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh yes, yes. Yes, yes.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So the moon doesn't have oxygen on it.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh, yes. Yes, right. I forgot about that.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, the rockets, the hydrogen will break up into-- it breaks down, and it's able to make rocket fuel, which help the spacecrafts move. And like in the story, it's like the cars. You know how you put gas in a car?",,,,
Chris,210.4,Uh-huh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And that helps your car to go. Without the gas, your car won't go. Just like the rocket fuel, which is made out of different strands of the hydrogen and also some oxygen. That would fill their gas tank, so they can move out and go throughout space.",,,,
Chris,210.4,OK. OK.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"The water is heavy. And if there was water on the moon, then they wouldn't have to carry it, which would be a lot of drain on their fuel supply, and it would also take up a lot of space in their spacecraft. So being able to stop somewhere and pick up water is a lot better than having to carry it around with you all the time. And water is heavy.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Excuse me, Mr. Lawrence?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so it looks. If we look back on our reading. It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So say if there isn't, they said if they didn't clearly say that there was people on there. I would assume as well that it would just be a machine, called that Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"So I think what I'm wondering is, like, okay, so if the lunar orbiter was this machine, and it went up there, did the lunar orbiter like discover something and like, was it the thing that like kind of found the water. Um, I wonder, like, I feel like I feel like, are both Farrah and my answer correct?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"If we can look back at paragraph two, so take a moment, look back at paragraph two.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And then on paragraph threee, it says that they found the water that they found was microscopic meaning it was super small that they had to use a microscope to use it to look at it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so with water. Now, in paragraph two, okay. Now, what is a different form of water. There's different forms of water. There's a frozen form, what is that called Oliver?",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, oh yeah ice.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes. So ice is just a different form of war, it's just water in a different form, it's frozen solid.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, oh, okay, okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, let's look back at the text, real quick.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Now when you discover something you're correct, it doesn't it doesn't say discover.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, so we know as people on earth we have to have water to live. And so if they have water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"They don't have to worry about bringing that water and so they could just drink the water on the moon, and they can stay hydrated.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Wait, I have to, I have to write down all the other stuff that you just said?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Second sentence that is correct. Right, so water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen now.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That is important, but what's the reason why they would want to break down what was the reason why they wanted to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen. What could they use hydrogen and oxygen for",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Well, I read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Look at paragraph five.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Oh, rocket fuel rocket fuel.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"We could use that. Have they split that water and they use that hydrogen oxygen for rocket fuel and that's how they could get to the moon and they can leave from the moon, right. So that's another reason why water could be such a valuable commodity.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Nope, because we've got a lot more of it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Perfect. Okay, so I want to start by us all looking over at question, paragraph two, okay. So let's look at paragraph two in our passage.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Can anybody tell me if they heard something in the two sentences we just read that sounds like it might answer the question, what equipment was used?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so what I'm seeing is that in paragraph three, the second sentence starts out by saying",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Yeah, right there.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So that's a very good question. And what I'm going to ask you is, have you considered to look back a little bit further before the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Perfect. Okay. And now I'll read the second sentence to you after you tell me what did NASA send to investigate. Can you tell me what that was called,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Yeah a lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So I know that the scientists back in paragraph one, they found out that there was water on the moon because they had craters that had ice in them. But how did they find out that the craters had ice in them. Do you remember how that happened. We just read a little part of it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,About oxygen tanks. So can you find maybe another type of equipment that they might have used to help find water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,210.4,So I gotta find something that's in the text like not like from my own like memory like I gotta read the text.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It says that that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it, even if you're looking straight at it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Did they go up there with their oxygen tanks and a microscope to see if it was on there. That's not what it says.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh, well, let's look at the first paragraph. If you could read that for me.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Um, yeah, okay, um, scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on Earth.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Correct. Now, did it say the craters where full of water or was the water below the crater?",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh, so like there wasn't much water like there was only some water because you had to look at it through the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,You're correct four glasses of water is that a lot of water on the moon.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"No, that's, that's, um, that's not very much at all.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,It's not very much at all. Do you think that could fill up a crater.,,,,
Chris,210.4,I guess not. So the craters aren't full at all.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"No they're not. They're not full at all. There's such a tiny amount of water that it's almost, you have to have a special tool to see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You're right, it is the lunar lunar orbiter they use that to find the water on the moon. And did they find a lot of water or a little water.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,No. He just found a little water is that was what Chris found.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Correct. They had to use something else to find it before they could use or identify the water with a microscope, because it was such a small amount of water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,You can use them for rocket fuel can do you can use both of them?,,,,
Luis,210.4,I'm like you could use like them mixed together and you can also read the oxygen And you can drink the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,But how much water is on the moon.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,You're talking about. I remember that it wasn't actually a lot. So I'm actually still kind of confused because it sounded Like it sounded like there was it very much. Why is there enough water for astronauts.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,There probably isn't enough in the drink on the moon. But what do you think they can do to get more water on to the moon.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Take it with them.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,They could take it with them take it with them on a what,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,On a spaceship.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,On a spaceship. Would that increase the value of water on the moon. If they brought it with them.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"We get, I think it would be like, yes, it would be more valuable if it was on the moon like already. And then they could just build their even, and they could see it right there.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Absolutely. I think that that would be a more valuable deduction. If they already had it or put more on the moon, good job there. Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Exactly. And in paragraph one, what does it say that the future astronauts could do",,,,
Chris,210.4,They could drink the water,,,,
Teacher,210.4,You can find that in paragraph six,,,,
Oliver,210.4,Lots of time and money.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, let's not stray too far and understand that, you know, a lot of this information, but we want to find the answer here in the paragraph that you read",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"As I'm going back and looking in, and it says that the water they found is microscopic which means you you can't see it with your naked eye. So you would need exactly what Farrah and Oliver said, you would need a microscope to look really closely to see it.",,,,
Luis,210.4,I guess I didn't really read it like I kind of knew the answer. So I just kind of didn't read the text.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So the water they found is microscopic so you would need the scientific tool.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So if you go back to the passage, you know, discover is to look for.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Go back and, the second paragraph says NASA send a small machine. Well, which is what Jazmin read. But if you were to keep reading that sentence, it would tell you what the small machine was called that they sent to investigate. They sent a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Yeah, I just found the name. Um, and so I added I added the rest of that sentence to my answer. So now my answer says, NASA sent a small machine cutter Lunar Orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So that's when you have to go back and you have to, you know, dig in a little deeper to find you know where they're talking about water on the moon and what they what piece of equipment. Did they use for that.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So if we go back and we look in the passage, the first paragraph is called the moon is a desert.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So in the second paragraph. If you look at the heading on. It's called water is a valuable resource.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So it's talking about the water in space.  And what a valuable resource it is.,,,,
Chris,210.4,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,but helping reading the text and finding the evidence within the text can help you learn specific answers to the question like what specific equipment was used and how the scientists use that equipment to find water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So it can deeper deepen your understanding about space.,,,,
Luis,210.4,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,and there's more details that we can add to our answer to show that we understand the text Chris your hand was up thank you for waiting.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so if you can go  back and let's look at paragraph number two, it specifically talks about the exact equipment that the scientist used to investigate and find the water on the moon. So can you reread paragraph two, and see if you can find a little bit more information there that will answer the question a little better?",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Um, I'm not sure.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Let's look at paragraph number two, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. The lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And then it goes on in paragraph three, to talk about how you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Which is very important, but the discussion question where you're trying to answer is the equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon. So look back in the text and you can kind of scan over it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"All right, there you go. That's, that's okay. You can stop there. So what did they send it to the moon to search for the spots.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,On the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so what is a small machine that they sent, What is that called?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so did the scientists use oxygen tanks to find water on the moon?",,,,
Luis,210.4,"I mean, they use oxygen tanks when they were on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But did it talk about scientists, going to the moon?",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Um, I mean, that's what the story is about them going to the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Is it is, it's about people going to the moon?",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Okay, well, okay, okay. In the first paragraph. It says, scientists have found evidence of water can be found deep in the moon's polar craters, and if they find that.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So did the scientists, go to the moon.",,,,
Luis,210.4,No.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, they just use the Lunar Orbiter. Right. So yes, they may when when astronauts goes, they may use all that equipment but they didn't send astronauts. They sent a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So what. So, for example, right now, okay, say there's no there's no water on the moon, right?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So there's no water on the moon, then what are they in order for astronauts to go to the moon and have water, what do they need to do?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,If there's no water in the mud in order for them to go to the moon. They'd have to bring their own water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"In paragraph four, what does it talk about when regarding water?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Water on the moon can be valuable. I mean when we say it can be useful in lots of ways. For example, future astronauts could drink this water. Yes. See, that's where I got my",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, and it's also what does it say what does it say about the weight of water.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"It says that water is heavy. You know, I also know you can use water to grow things so we can have like a moon garden on the on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, what is what is, what is the section to say, paragraph two,",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh yeah, we talked about the the lunar orbiter all yeah cuz they sent the machine there.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So they have been there right so they have been there and they have found evidence of water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,That's what it says in verse in section two.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Right. Like, like, I remember. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh, we already had the evidence of water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh, but it says that water is broken down into two parts.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What else does it say the oxygen and hydrogen could be used as?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right. Okay. So let's recap. Let's recap. So what are some benefits and valuable. Why is it valuable to have water.,,,,
Chris,210.4,You can break it up into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so I have a question will you read number two, for me, please. The second paragraph.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Okay. Okay, so paragraph two NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"OK you can stop you can stop now. Okay, so the first sentence that you read was NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Um, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so from the article what equipment did, did the scientists use to discover water.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Um, like Jazmin's answer the small machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, and what equipment from the article that you read and the Luis just read and in paragraph two, what did the article, what did the scientists use to find water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You know, microscopic meaning small tiny right so in order to to look at that in a larger sense they use the microscope.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,Okay,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And those are tools right,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, now did you find the word machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"All right, very good now. So the word machine is in that sentence right now. What we're looking for is the machine actually or the tool that was used to find the water. Now what tool is mentioned in that sentence.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,The Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Very good, and which word in that sentence sentence tells us that they actually find the water",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right. And what machine. Did we identify that was used,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,It was the lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Very good. And there was another word in that sentence that you've read that also has to that will give us a clue of the word discover. Do you know what that word is?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,When we discover when you discover what are you actually doing.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,You find something?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,You're finding. But in order to find it. What must you do,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Look for it?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,There's a word in the sentence. Can you can you go back to that sentence for me the sentence that talked about the Lunar Orbiter. Look at that sentence for me.Is another word in that sentence that helps us to know that we actually are discovering something. So what do you have to do to discover,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Is it investigate?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So the word investigate means that in order to find something you have to investigate. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Discover means to find something right. Okay, good. So what are we going to do. We're going to go back to the passage and we are going to look for the Oliverice or the equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"All right, go back and look again and see if there's something another Oliverice or another equipment that was mentioned. Yes, Jazmin?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"I realized that based on what they're saying, the small machine, I think was the thing that I think this small machine is what found that water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, so can you go back and look if there's another machine or equipment that was mentioned in the passage?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"In paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Exactly to investigate, investigate means what",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Look for?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,and then Chris. Did you go back and look through your textbook. I asked you to,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Um, yeah. So I did a look, I think. So I'm going to guess that I didn't, you were saying, I didn't answer the question, right, because the question was, how did the scientists what equipment. Did the scientists use to discover water and I just was talking about the creative. Right, right.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Okay. So the first part is I want you to take your pencil or your tablet pin and let's reread the part of the text where it describes the type of machine that was used,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, not just a microscope. What is the actual equipment called",,,,
Teacher,210.4,The Lunar Orbiter consent by you remind me what why the lunar rover is so important.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I'd like you to reread paragraph two, and see if you pair up together, Chris Jazmin to see if you can find any better information about the tool that scientists scientists use to discover water in the craters",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"now, Luis Farrah and Oliver to read paragraph two as well and see what extra equipment or what kinds of equipment could narrow this down.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Okay, we read through it. But, um, I have a question if that's okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But what was in paragraph two, in the very first sentence? Let's see if we can find exactly what they used.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It did not clarify, did it? So maybe this could have been an unmanned mission and they just send the machinery and the lunar orbiter was part of the bigger machine that discovered the water.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Yeah, that makes sense that makes sense. Okay, so maybe they didn't send any astronauts at all.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, that's what polar craters mean. Polar means the poles, the North and the South. So what is the main idea of this section. What is, for informational texts, what is the main idea. What is the target they they want you to know.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Um, do you mean for the, the three paragraphs or in one paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so who can tell me about the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Luis, can you tell me about the lunar orbiter. Go back to paragraph two. Luis, you go ahead and look at paragraph two.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,What does it say Luis about the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Um, okay. So lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,The ice deposits are very small.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So do you think the Lunar Orbiter was able to see the ice deposits or what how do you think the lunar orbiter was able to find the ice deposits?,,,,
Luis,210.4,"like, maybe it had like instruments on board like it had like very scientific instruments.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Okay. Does it say the microscope found the water in that paragraph?,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"No, I guess not.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Let's go back to paragraph two, once more, it does say NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. What do you think the word investigate means",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, like to look at, to like, look for something",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So if you're investigating something you're finding something. So what are you going to find about it. Once you find it, what else? What else you're going to want to know about it.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Well I guess you know what it is. Is it water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You're going to want to know what it is. Okay. So yes, Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"And so I guess like that's where basically like investigate can you find it, but also study it, but you have to find it and then study",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Exactly. We have to find it and then study it, Oliver, what do you want to add",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"So what I wanted to add was just that, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Today I would like for all of you to look back at paragraph number two. And if we can look at that paragraph and I want you to circle the word machine.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Okay that sentence. So what did. What did NASA send to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so what did the lunar orbiter do who can tell me",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Okay so ice and water. Is that the same thing. Yes Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"It's, it's the same thing. It's just that ice is frozen water. And I guess I just, I wanted to ask, I think I'm still a little bit confused about why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Exactly. So if we will let's underline that sentence on number two. The very first thing some paragraph to NASA send a small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And then the second sentence underline that one as well. This lunar orbiter will land at the most South Pole and look for ice deposits. OK, now let's go on to the third paragraph so.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Um, well actually it was more of a question.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so you said they could use it for rocket fuel. But what other thing didn't say right there that you just read.",,,,
Luis,210.4,They could breathe it,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so let's look in our text for a minute.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, awesome. So in our text it says that it is in small amounts",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So in the third paragraph, it's talking about a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Does anyone know or have you heard that word before. Microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it. So you would need to use a microscope to see the water,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It tells you in paragraph three, does everyone see that",,,,
Teacher,210.4,But what special machine did they use. It was in our reading,,,,
Teacher,210.4,All right. Where did you see that,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Um, okay. So I saw it in paragraph three, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. So I'm not totally sure like why my answers not right.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But there's another tool that was used to discover the water and so that looked more closely at the water, but it wasn't what was discovering the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,but an excellent place to look is in our text.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,We can look at the text and we can look for clues,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So that's the next step. So we want to find it. First, we can look at it until we discover it or find it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"If we look at, paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine, which is what you wrote what comes next.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Can you find some reasons in there so far that eventually, it could be valuable. Does that make sense Oliver?",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Um, yeah, I could try to look for reasons, um, I just think that like it just seems like it's not, you know what I mean. Cuz it's not ready yet. Like it would take such a long time to be useful. You know what I mean, so it didn't seem very convincing, because it seems like we'd hav to use. But yeah I can look and see.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So see if you could find some evidence to support that it may be valuable in the future.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so maybe if we look at the first few paragraphs. So paragraphs one and two, you will find something specific that they used it was a type of machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,That they sent up there so that they can find water because the moon is very dry. It's kind of like a desert.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Um, I don't know.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, let's see. Let's look at paragraph two, we see in paragraph two, there's a Senate's about how NASA send a small machine called a",,,,
Teacher,210.4,What is that machine called,,,,
Luis,210.4,Lunar Orbitre,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, so they sent that machine to investigate it will land on the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. So those ice deposits are made out of water. They had a hard time finding water unless they use that machine to help them search for it.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Right, yeah. Yeah, ice and water. It's the same thing, right.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,the microscope was actually to use just to see closer the water because the water was so tiny that they couldn't see it with their own eyes.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,But the microscope was used for something different. The small machine. The lunar orbiter was used to find the water. So there's two different machines and equipment things that they used,,,,
Oliver,210.4,Okay. One was used for to find the water. Any other thing was used for something different. Right. Which which one is the right one.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah. So if you look at your passage you want to use the passage. The second half, which is paragraphs four, five and six and find the details in the text that tell you that there's some actual evidence that water could be useful.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Like in paragraph five, there are a lot of examples about how the water could be valuable. How could it be used",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Well, I thought that you know that they could, like, make them own garden, you know, and so they could grow vegetables and pinks",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That is true. Also, because in the passage. It explains how hydrogen and oxygen could be split apart and they could use hydrogen for rocket fuel.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes. And you're right. That was a detail from the text, but the reason that they split it apart is so that oxygen can be used.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,For other things. So they breathe the oxygen. And then the hydro Jen can actually be used for rocket fuel. So they split that up apart so that they can use it for different things.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh wow, okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So you have to use all those details. So about hydrogen and oxygen about how water is you can serve can't survive without water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So if you all would look at paragraph two, it has a two labeled",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"In the first sentence, it actually says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. So this is the machine that actually went and explored.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But I kind of agree with Jazmin and saying that they just they brought the machine from the second paragraph to the moon and that machine, helped them look into those craters. But then the microscope helps you more analyze the water that they already found",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"So, um, yeah, it's it's speaking to me since I think, but I'm not quite sure why my answer is wrong because didn't they have to use the microscope to discover it?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So the way I looked at it was NASA send their small machine out to the moon and they analyze those craters and they found water. And I think the piece of using the microscope was for if I traveled to the moon with them and wanted to see the water for myself, I would have to check under the microscope",,,,
Teacher,210.4,But the small machine did it without having to send people out there.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh, gotcha. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,because one. We have a lot of water here on Earth. So why do we want water from the moon and to um,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And two, that's a lot of time time and money and as a, as a teacher, and we know we don't have a lot of money. Why would we want to spend extra money on something we already have.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And the text says that it can be used as rocket fuel.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,I don't think I saw that part.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What was the name of the small machine.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Okay, so it was the lunar orbiter so is that what I got wrong is that didn't say the lunar orbiter?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And can you remember what other equipment they use or other tools that we read about?,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Well yeah like I think that the thing that they did was they had to use like spacesuits and stuff like so I didn't really even read it, I just kind of knew that, like they had to use that stuff, you know, they had to use like space suits and stuff.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It said that scientists found that there's evidence of water really deep in them, in the moon's craters, but that when they sent the machine up there to look for those ice that it was tiny, tiny little droplets that you can only see with a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so let's go back to our text.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And in paragraph two, the very last sentence, it says these icy deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right. You're absolutely right. We just need to make sure what we're looking back in our information to make sure we can find the right answers.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Just because it's not in the text doesn't mean that it wasn't being used because we kind of know, like you said, you saw that they use those things to be in space and so it talks about that NASA sent a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"If an astronaut were in space then they would use those things because we can't breathe up there and we need those to help us, but they didn't send the astronauts. They sent a machine.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"I guess I didn't really, that makes sense. I didn't really read it closely enough because I think I hear what you're saying.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"All right. If you guys will look at the passage. If you look at number, the number two paragraph",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Let's look at that paragraph number two. What machine did they use in that paragraph?,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"A lunar orbiter. That's right. And let's look at number three, I want you",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Excuse me,,,,
Teacher,210.4,let's look at number two. This lunar orbiter looks like for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small. Can you--,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, let's look at number two, that paragraph number two again read that first sentence for me.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Um NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Let's look back Oliveron, let's look what was the question. Say the question for me again, Oliveron.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"It said, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So what is it asking us,,,,
Oliver,210.4,For the kind of equipment that the scientists used,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Mainly in, let's see, paragraph two",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And that means the moon is still the driest desert on Earth, the water that is found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Alright, so they use oxygen tanks but what other things do they use in the article.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Um, they use microscopes, because that was that was in my answer. And I don't understand why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Not sure. Okay. Well, you just read paragraph three again. Maybe let's backtrack a little bit before number three. What about number two?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Okay, [reads to herself] NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate . The lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. The ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It doesn't talk about the water. But before that, it talks about how they find evidence of the water right?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You're not sure. Okay, well let's read the paragraph together again. Okay, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,look really closely at what?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Water. Right. But the question is, how do we find the water. So what was used. What are the scientists used to find the water",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That's a really good point. So to answer your question, further, let's go ahead and look back in the article so paragraph one talks about how scientists thought the moon was a desert. Okay, but now I know that's not true.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, right. So we use the Lunar Orbiter to find the water",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, and we have to use the microscope to look at it.",,,,
Chris,210.4,So I went to NASA with my dad and I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that. And I guess I was wondering like did they use that to discover the water as well?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, and what was that machine called?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"It was, it was called the lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And the article talks about how the hydrogen might be able to be used for a rocket fuel which is awesome. I think that's really interesting. Don't you guys,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Oh yeah, it's awesome. Yeah, it's really cool that that's a possibility.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right. So would you be able to see it with your regular eye? Would you be able to look down at it?,,,,
Chris,210.4,"No. No, you need a microscope to look at it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right. So is there any water on the moon?,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh. No. No, it's dry. It says dry.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"OK. So let's look back in the text. It says, Scientists have found evidence that water can be found within the moon's polar craters. So where can we find water on the moon? Or where can water be found?",,,,
Chris,210.4,In the polar craters. That was my answer. Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,These craters are dark places where the sun never shines.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,The Lunar Orbiter. So what equipment did they use?,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, OK. I got it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right. So let's look at where it says that its on paragraph three, it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I know. So now let's look back in paragraph two, what does it say that they sent to investigate the water",,,,
Farrah,210.4,On they sent the small machine. The Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So in our first paragraph there, it says that you just read it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters. These craters or dark places where the sun never shine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah. Stop right there for a minute. OK. So paragraph 2 says that NASA has sent a small-- you did a great job rating by the way. But, and Farrah, you did too. Very good job reading. So paragraph 2 says on this worksheet that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in large polar crater. I'm sorry, in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small. So we know that the ice deposits are very small. So you're going to need something to-- small, right? Something that can look at small things, correct?",,,,
Luis,210.4,Yes.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yes to investigate. So investigate means that we're kind of,,,,
Teacher,210.4,looking deeper into it. Right.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"enough amount of water to subside people for a long time, right, because waters really heavy. And it's hard. You know, it takes up space on the spaceships. So do you think it",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And and kind of back to Space and you know we're not. We're not leaving. They are being able to inhabit the moon right now.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,They hope to one day in the future. But so right now if they went to the main the ships would have to carry it. So that's one reason it's it's really valuable that,,,,
Teacher,210.4,We can be able to find water there,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It was important. So let's, it was very important, because you can do so water is made up of hydrogen, oxygen, and you can take those things that",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Lead them and then you can use the oxygen, hydrogen for other things.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So let's say so in order to follow my advice or to found that base and be able to be able to what's some things that if orders split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"The oxygen just it's in, it's in here. It's in your text and about paragraph five,",,,,
Luis,210.4,I'm okay. Yeah. So I read I read that sentence after,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, it is. You're right. Yes. Breathing is very crucial. Great. So we can split the water. So with the hydrogen and oxygen and use the oxygen for air and that's very valuable and very important. Correct.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"We cannot live without oxygen. What's another I really, I'm really glad you found that. What's another thing in that paragraph that you could use.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"The oxygen and the hydrogen are not as same as water, but what's something else that they can be used for",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh, it says, oxygen, and it could also be used as rocket fuel.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yes. And what much Nate rocket fuel for here on the main,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Um, so that you can like go up to the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, very good. So, which one would that be the Lunar Orbiter, or the microscope.",,,,
Luis,210.4,Okay let me see.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What do you know about ice Oliver,,,,
Oliver,210.4,Like frozen water. Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh, kind of the same thing, isn't it.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh yeah, yeah, I got so",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, so they're having to take up this water in the space and its way in down that spaceship.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So I think that's in paragraph two,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Why don't you look at the first sentence and paragraph two,",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Okay, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. The small machine is called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It does, it does investigate what does it investigate read that second sentence again.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Okay, this will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Where does it say they found a lot of water? Let's look, look at that first paragraph. Does it say anything about finding a lot of water.",,,,
Chris,210.4,[Rapidly rereads paragraph one to himself],,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, so they found it deep. That means that, so think about um think about if you dug a really big hole so they found it deep within the moon's craters, they found it really far down",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Am I looking at stuff. Am I making it look really big, so I can really see it or am I zooming out. What am I doing?",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, oh, I'm sorry, teacher, I just heard the bell. That means that it's time",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So did I need, um, you said that they needed the microscope to look really closely. So did they use a microscope to find it, or just a look at it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, they, they have to find it first. So they don't even know where to look for it on the microscope. They use it once they find it.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh, so they have to find the first",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so in our text on the second paragraph, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Let's use evidence from our text.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Said  they sent a small machine does that small machine have a name.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Yes, it's the lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Alright, so, um, can anyone tell me what paragraph, did they think that gave the most information about finding water on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Um, what about in the first paragraph there? Do we see anything about any type of machine that they used to find it?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Um, well, let's see, uh,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right. So let's look at the second paragraph and see if it mentions any type of machine.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Did any of you find anything about a certain machine or equipment they used?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yes. Okay. So it says the Lunar Orbiter. It's a small machine to investigate. Now investigate means to?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Like it means to like find something or like, yeah, like to find something or to see something or to study something",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, we don't know for sure yet what they're going to investigate. So let's look at the second sentence in that paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Let's read it together real quick. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth. The water they found is mcroscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you weren't looking straight at it. You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Yeah, we've used it in science class before",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay. All right. Well, let's look at page, paragraph three, okay? Do you see where they're numbered each paragraph has a number beside of it. Can everybody take their finger and put it on number three, find the number three, paragraph 1, 2, 3",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Do you? Yeah, okay. Let the rear end of that paragraph, it talks about what kind of small tool, scientific tool that they would use.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So if we look at our passage right here in the first stanza it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters. These craters are dark places where the sun never shines. Does that stand to say anything about any equipment?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"No, I guess not.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"No, I don't see anything in there either. So let's move on to our second one, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small. Was there anything in that stanza that might have referred to equipment being used?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Yes, that's where they talk about the small machine that they sent to the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Correct. So we already seen stanza to that we can support our answer to the question, because we have found it. Yes, Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Okay, so here's my question. I'm, I'm trying to understand, like, why my answer might not be correct to say thought they use a microscope to see the water",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So the scientists needed to use tools and equipment to discover the water on the moon, and they use that by starting with the small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So once we investigated the moon, we could then use our tool to discover more about it. So you had to have both forms of equipment to figure out the answers that we were looking for in this passage. Does that make sense?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So, in the very first paragraph. If you all look at your text it says that scientists have found evidence.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Also says the word valuable. So now what I want you to do is look into your text before we talk about the responses to the question. Do you see the word valuable when we look at the subheading water is a valuable resource.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I see some nods yes, it says in the heading that that that water is a valuable resource. So we already know, sort of, the answer to our question that it is a valuable resource.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So when we look at the very first sentence, it says water on the moon would be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It then says water is heavy. So when you're if you are going up into space, would you want to carry all these loads of water in your spacecraft or would it be really convenient if the water was already at the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Well, I said that thing about them not being able to drink it. So I think I'm right too.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So if we keep going into paragraph five, it says, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. Now we have to",,,,
Luis,210.4,That's the thing I said. I said that one.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Now I'll continue we have to use oxygen in order to breathe. So if water can provide oxygen. Would that be a important and valuable resource to have on the moon.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"I mean yeah cuz you know everybody needs to breathe. That's, that's, that's, like, the most important thing that you can have in life is breathing.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Very important. So that could be a possible reason that it's a valuable resource. We can also look at it goes into further and says that hydrogen and oxygen can be used as rocket fuel.  So that would also take some weight off your spacecraft. If you're able to create hydrogen and oxygen in the moon versus having to take it all the way up into space.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So do you see that there's a few possible answers to this question because the text gives us some examples.,,,,
Chris,210.4,I read that there could be a base on the moon in 2024,,,,
Teacher,210.4,But I'm in the text.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Could you look closer at the text at the at the forefront of text, maybe, and",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And so it looks like you should you need to focus on the question more as well as the text.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So scarce and so microscopic on water and found you know only unlike little trace amounts and you would need a microscope to look at it, but",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, and paragraphs three and four. Let's look at specifically what the text is telling us though.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"We see that they used after the fact, after they found the water they used a microscope to look closely at the water like Farrah said,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,At paragraphs three and four. Those are the ones I think we need to look at again.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"I still think that the small machine. Is that what they used because you said discovery is like define and well, it says that they used it to investigate and like a detective kinds of discovers things, you know, and they investigate. So I still think it's in paragraph two,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"In a large polar crater. Okay. So you were right. It's in a small machine, but specifically the small machine was caled, what",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Yeah, I was a lunar orbitre",,,,
,210.4,So in the texts in front of you called The Moon is a Desert,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"In our story. It talked abou the water that they found on the moon was microscopic like you had said, and that's that the word microscopic means that you can't see it Without looking through that microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, let's remember that the title of our story ways water on the moon. So yes, astronauts do wear those as a protective measure. So when they're on the moon, they can survive because it's a really cool place. And if they didn't wear those they could die.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Great job. Is it just astronauts that need to survive with water or do we all need to survive with water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"The whole reading, she is talking about water on the moon. So really we wouldn't have to bring water from earth it would be discovered on the moon, and they would be using that water from the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, and in our texts did it talk about using a microscope that those astronauts or rather those scientists use?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"In paragraph three, it says, um, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, so in in here, it talks about the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So we know that that the planet or essentially what is being discovered is one, the water, but the water on the moon specifically, right? So, in the first paragraph that talks about scientists that found evidence that there can be water deep within the moon's polar craters. Do we all remember reading that part?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, perfect. So then in the second paragraph, it talks about NASA using this small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. So what they're doing is that they're using the Orbiter to investigate the evidence that they found deep within those craters. Does that make sense.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Yeah, I think so.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay. And then what they did was, in the third paragraph, they talked about the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes. And so you have to look at it under that microscope, and that's where what Farrah was talking about.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And it also says in the last sentence is that they looked at a scientific tool called a microscope really closely. So all of those tools that they've used helped discover that.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"If you look back in your text, it says specifically that they sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"They did find craters of water on the moon. And that's kind of why they went up to space. They wanted to see if there were water in these craters. They did discover that, in fact, there are water in the craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And if we look in number two in the article the machine that they use what's called the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay. And that makes sense. They do have to use the microscope to see it because it is so small, but to find the water itself. They didn't necessarily use the microscope, when they found the water, then the microscope came into play. So they can actually view it. Does that make sense.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh, so they like something like studied the water",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Correct. Now, does everyone see where she found that out because that is the specific name of the equipment they use to find the water",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay. And like you said everybody told me that were the key word was the equipment to discover and then up in the text it specifically says NASA send a small machine called a lunar Order, order to investigate. So does that make sense where we got that from",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Yeah, I think, that doesn't make sense. So okay, so that's the answer. That's the equipment that you to find the what, like to discuss",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, now if you go back into the into the text. Do you see anywhere in there that talks about, you know, how it could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So if you go back into the text.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,You see anywhere that specifically talks about how water couldn't be valuable.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Yeah, there's, um, let's see. Yeah. And the very first sentence right there.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"because if you go on the read further. It could, you know, for example, what you like the text says you can drink the water, they could use the water",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Eventually for like fuel for this spaceship.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Yeah, I guess that's true because I read that like there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and like they would definitely need water. If I did that.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Let me just kind of build off that. So by you saying they don't have to carry water. What does that essentially mean they can you do with the water that's already there.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well, they can pick it up on the moon and use that water than to fly around or like they don't have to take it from Earth.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, so they don't have to carry it. You know, because they can use it for fuel and they can also drink it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So that's less stuff they have to care or, you know, to bring with them on the spaceship, so they can have room for more people, more supplies and things like that. So that's a very good response they have you got a question, buddy.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Um, yeah. Well, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I really wanted to thank you for working with us.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"To find right so if we're looking to find something. What are some of those words, maybe in those first couple paragraphs 1 through 3 that go with finding something.",,,,
Chris,210.4,Chris: Find,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, investigate. Alright, so what, what did they use to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Oliver. What do you think they used to investigate if you go back and look at the text.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Well, I guess I'm not sure if it's not the microscope might take me a moment.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Perfect. Alright. So do you think that might be where we look for our answers, guys.",,,,
Chris,210.4,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so do you think that's a good place with are looking for answer about water being valuable.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yep Okay perfect, so let's go down to that section.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Though the paragraph that you guys read did it tell you what they meant by valuable.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Yeah. Yeah. Actually, yes, it",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Did what did it say valuable meant,,,,
Farrah,210.4,It says water on the moon valuable are very important resource.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Let's underline very important.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So make sure you're using the the text to look for answers too. Okay.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Yeah, we had a chance to look at and have the conversation.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,astronauts could breathe the oxygen right so they could use the water to be broken down and to make oxygen. So that's one way that the water is helpful or valuable right,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Yeah, yeah. My dad would totally need that.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"All right, everybody, underline that sentence, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So let's look back at the text. So you've all read this once through, right?",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Um, well, okay, so there's a couple places on paragraph two, they said on the lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and then paragraph, paragraph three, the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So what tool in here does it say they use to find it?,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh, oh, oh, so I just, this really",,,,
Farrah,210.4,It's like finding something,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What can hydrogen be used for?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What do you see there that that hydrogen can be used for?,,,,
Luis,210.4,rocket fuel.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so I mean like rocket fuel and the moon, I would that be by valuable.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Well, I was just gonna say I was looking at the clock out, it's time for the next group. Um, but I did want to say thank you so much Mr. Teacher for",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay. And so when you look at that word. Let's look at that word again where it says that, it says the water they found is microscopic and so do you think microscope and microscopic are the same thing?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Um, well, it's like, I think if it's microscopic like it's small and that's how like you see small stuff with like a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well certainly you can see some small things with a microscope. But there's other ways to measure things that may be very, very small. And it's called microscopic because often it is very small, and you wouldn't need a microscope to see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,They were simply describing the size of the water as being microscopic. That makes sense?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,But if we look at the the information that was actually provided. Let's go back to that for just a minute and take a look at it where it talks about water on the moon. So everyone look look at it together. And the first statement that it says there.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"See how it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate? Jazmin, what do you think a lunar orbiter would be?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,It's like a spaceship that goes up to the moon and can study things,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That's correct, because if you look at the name Lunar Orbiter and look at what each of those words mean. Lunar refers to what? Do you know?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,That's right. Lunar means something dealing with the moon. And so what would an orbiter be? What does orbit orbit mean?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Orbit's like when something's like flying around something or like circling something so like like I guess, like maybe like the spaceships like flying around the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Because Lunar Orbiter means orbiting, flying around the moon. And so they have a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,It's not actually on the moon. It's simply flying over the moon around the moon to take a look at that the possibilities of water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"For example, Farrah, do you now understand with what microscopic means and they didn't have a microscope, but they actually had a spaceship that orbited around the moon. Does that make sense?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Yeah, I think it does make sense that they like might study the water with a microscope, but they they might find it with something else, with the machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That's right. That's very good. And if they were able to get a sample of that water then they could certainly look at it with a microscope. But in this case, they haven't actually landed on the moon. They're simply using the Lunar Orbiter to study the moon from a distance. So, so Oliver.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,I'm so sorry. We have to go to lunch now. But before we did. I just wanted to thank you for working with us. And specifically I wanted to thank you for being so patient,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Exactly. They sent a lunar orbiter have up there. And so, Chris. Do you know what a lunar orbiter is",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh no, I mean I've been a NASA and I saw the Mars Rover, but I don't know what a lunar orbiter is.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, let me show you a picture of a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,This is a lunar orbiter simulation picture of it flying over the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Like satellite flies in space. It was launched on a rocket from Earth transition to the moon and then it can circle around the room. So around the moon. So it's orbiting the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And so that's why it's called a lunar orbiter lunar means moon and so lunar orbiter means something orbits around goes around the moon. That makes sense.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,But Mr. Teacher. I don't understand why my answers wrong.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, well a microscope is used to look at something really, really closely because the water on the moon is is there's so little of it and it's so small",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Certainly if you saw a water puddle, you know, that was water on the moon, the water is much smaller. So it's very hard to see. In fact, if you had a sample from there, you wouldn't be able to see it without a microscope. Yes, yes.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay Oliver or Sabina, what do you guys use a microscope for",,,,
Oliver,210.4,Us to look at small stuff.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"That's right. So, um, have you used a microscope in your other science classes.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That's right. So they use a machine a tool, similar to the microscope, like you guys said to discuss to investigate and discover, and that was called the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And you're right. So they did use a small machine. Do you know what the name of that machine was,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,I think it was the one you had Chris read,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Do you know they were trying to find,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So if we go back and read this sentence that I'm Chris read in the name of this small machine was a lunar orbiter. And what did that lunar orbiter do so.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Good job. So what did the lunar orbiter do Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Look for ice deposits,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Good job. And what did they discover in those ice deposits,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So those ice deposits held what,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So I'll read this in it for said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in about 32 ounces of water.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Water,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Water. So by using the Lunar Orbiter to decide to investigate the ice deposits those ice deposit sores. What was holding the water,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"What else, what else do we mean Oliver besides water.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,Air,,,,
Teacher,210.4,We need air to breathe. Did they have air on the moon yet.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"They can drink it, can we survive without water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So my question was, can you tell us what the lunar orbiter does? So I want you to read the second sentence in paragraph two",,,,
Chris,210.4,The lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for the ice deposits and a large pool crater.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"OK, so the lunar orbiter, Jazmin, the small machine that they sent, it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. Now these ice deposits are very, very, very small. Okay. So then, paragraph three goes on and talk about how the moon is still drier.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, that means if we go back to paragraph two, what did they use to investigate. So when we investigate something, we're normally discovering something. What did they use to investigate?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, so they found very, very small amounts of water, those ice deposits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"you would definitely, they are microscopic so if it was on earth you would definitely need a microscope to visually look at the water,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"but within the maybe perhaps the second paragraph, it says, you know what they sent with the astronauts to investigate the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You know, we human beings breathe oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And perhaps hydrogen can be used for rocket fuel for maybe traveling back to earth from the moon,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And that would provide ample reasoning for us to be able to use that water, even if it is barely sparsely spread out to enhance those astronauts and scientists labs there on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"and then do you remember from the text, what the lunar orbiter what it was doing",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,When I looked at it I sadi it investigated because it's small machine. That's what discovered it because it was investigating.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"When we look back over the text in paragraph two, um, what, what did it say we're looking for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Um, I can answer, well basically in paragraph two it says NASA send to small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So when looking at the paragraph, um,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,I know that there are two words that,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Students get confused and that's microscope and so microscope is a top of tool that we use to see different,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Different objects. And then there's the word microscopic and microscopic just means that it's something that you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking right at it. Yes. So, Farrah",,,,
Farrah,210.4,I use the microscope. And my answer. So I don't understand why my answers wrong.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"They do talk about the microscope and the water in that paragraph. The difference is the microscope is the tool that they use to see the microscopic pieces so microscope is the tool that they use. And then microscopic is the, um,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,The ice. It's a form of the microscopic ice,,,,
Oliver,210.4,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So when we look at our paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,If we're looking at paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Three.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It talks about that. No, excuse me, paragraph to",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Do you, do you see the name I'm looking through the paragraph.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,I'm looking,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What did the lunar orbiter do,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Investigated.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So we know the lunar orbiter investigated what did it investigate,,,,
Luis,210.4,"I'm all right there says, and I was looking for ice deposits and a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,They saw the US deposit. It's in the large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What details that it gave about they asked deposits,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, it set of eyes deposits were really small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So they use the Lord the Lunar Orbiter to to to,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Investigate and they found asked deposits that were really small.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,We know that we have the Lunar Orbiter and that it's used to,,,,
Teacher,210.4,That that NASA is using this to form the ice deposits,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Or to investigate the ice deposits, but",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Microscopic. So what does microscopic mean what does it tell us,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"That is really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Was used. Does anybody remember what it was used to do.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,To investigate ice,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And it was in what form.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"It was in the form of ice. You know, I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So when we look at, paragraph two,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,We know that NASA sent the small machine. What was it called,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,The Lunar,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Okay. The Lunar Orbiter and what's the lunar orbiter going to do,,,,
Luis,210.4,Investigate ice deposits,,,,
Teacher,210.4,The third and fourth sentence is that information that we really know to answer need to know to answer this question.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,We know that the water they found it was what,,,,
Oliver,210.4,I was microscopic,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What type of ice,,,,
Oliver,210.4,Microscopic,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Microscopic us. And where was the microscopic us at,,,,
Chris,210.4,Me.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And it was what did it do,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,It investigated.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Perfect. So how, so we've identified the equipment. So I guess back to Farrahs question. How do they use this equipment to look and discover water. So which one do you want to focus on. First, the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,I'm interested in the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Good job, Oliver. Good job. So what in that paragraph Farrah, what is that telling us about the microscope?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Like that the microscope. Um, I guess that it's something that like you would use to study something up close.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And if you need a microscope to see the water on the moon. What does that tell you about the water,,,,
Farrah,210.4,It's really small.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So what does that tell you about the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Is there a lot of it.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"No, I guess not a lot, cuz it um yeah I guess there's not a lot because there's just a little bit to see",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So, um, do you know anything about a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Do you know what a polar crater is,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"It's like, I think it's like a big hole like on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Is can you imagine,,,,
Teacher,210.4,The Lunar Orbiter landing at the moon South Pole and basically looking around for this water on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Yeah, I can imagine. I guess I'm still kind of use, like by my answer is wrong because like i think that the lunar orbiter had to use the microscope to be able to see the water find",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Based on what you just read what do you think about the, what is the point of the microscope.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Um, well, it looks like the microscope is there to study the water. Um, and, like, look at it really closely.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so that could be a benefit of having water. So let's talk more about that. Who's the they that you're talking about.",,,,
Chris,210.4,The astronaut and like the spaceship.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I'm glad you know that, but it's also in the text. Could you read the first two sentences at the fourth paragraph for me.",,,,
Chris,210.4,Oh yeah okay um water on the moon would be a valuable was very important we suppress it could be useful in lots of ways.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Great. So yeah, exactly. You're exactly right. And water is heavy. And because that water is heavy, it would definitely be a benefit if you know astronauts could",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You know, use what's already there instead of have to take up stuff with him in the spaceships, because it's very heavy and like I said very cumbersome.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, let's focus on the text.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So I see first. The second part, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So yes, just like if you can't breathe oxygen, you're going to need an oxygen tank.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Kind of like if you're playing basketball.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"For an organized sport, you're probably going to need a jersey right to play.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Yeah, that makes sense.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,But the important tool is the basketball itself.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So then that that is also true NASA send a small machine. We go back into the text, it is called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,But if we're just going completely off what the text says if you will read number four. That might change your answer. Just go back and reread number four.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so let's look back in the text. I see. Let's read it says let's reread the text quickly.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places, wherever, or where the sun never shines.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. There you go. That's our key word Jazmin. So a lunar orbiter to investigate. Can someone else continue reading for me to see what this lunar orbiter does,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Um, yeah, I can do it. this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. these ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so what exactly do the lunar orbiters do, based on our reading. Farrah. Can you tell us what do you think?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"So it sounds like rhey look for the ice deposits, but they they go searching for it. Like, they're the thing that finds it right?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"In the texts that are going to talk about equipment. So first of all, we know we're looking for equipment that was used to find what Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Find water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,But a small machine. Can you be more specific.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,About that small machine. What was that called,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Let's look back in the text. So once we have,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Found types of equipment. Then we want to look and see which one's the best. So let's look in the area where it talked about the microscope. So we are on the first page in paragraph number three. So, Farrah. Would you go ahead and read that paragraph to us, please.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Yeah, it says that means the moon is still drier than the dry desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so are they saying, Is there any evidence in that paragraph that leads you to believe that that's something that was used",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Or something that you would need to use to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Out of water, they found is microscopic meaning you want to be able to look straight at it and that you would need a tool, but is it saying that they've already used a microscope to look at it.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh, um, you need you need all okay okay you need a scientific tall to look really closely on",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so did it say that they used a microscope.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,It said you need. So you'd a contraction for you would need,,,,
Teacher,210.4,A scientific tool.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Oh yeah okay okay yeah we did learn about that you would need doesn't mean that you you are using it means like me. Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So the only other piece of equipment in the text is a small machine called,,,,
Teacher,210.4,A lunar,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Orbiter. I have a day. Yeah, that was my answer!",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yeah. And what is one thing that you know about space that can help us.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Okay, so I know that astronauts can't breathe and space. So they need to wear oxygen mask so that they can walk around and stuff.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So can anybody summarize this article and tell me what water and equipment have, how did they work together in this article.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And see what equipment we use before the microscope. We know that we have to use oxygen in space. And so, specifically in paragraph two, we have NASA sending not humans out because they need so much oxygen, but a different tool",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And we have found out that the lunar orbiter helps us find the water, which, in turn, we use the microscope, because we know that there's not a lot of water on the moon.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"You know what, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So you're absolutely right. We can use oxygen to breathe and that is one of the neat things about being able to find water in space is that we can use water on its own, which we use for what",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,We use it for drinking. That was my answer.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So I want everyone to look at paragraph five, and see how else we can use The water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Now how Jazmin, do you, can you tell me how we can use water as a rocket fuel because we can't just pour water in a rocket and make it go",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,No.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Do you think we use the water plain water as rocket fuel or do we have to split the water and use those two separate parts.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But let's go back and look at where it talks about the microscope. So that is in Question or paragraph number two, or a paragraph number three is where they talk about using the microscope",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yeah so found and discover they play hand in hand with each other. So once you've discovered it. Now you found it. And now you can look at it. So the microscope is what's looking at it,,,,
Teacher,210.4,now Farrah in your answer in your response you named a type of machine. What was that machine.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"In my, in my revised response. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, say, Farrah said that she found her answer in paragraph two. Oliver, What do you have to say.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Um, I just wanted to say. Unfortunately, we have to go to our next class. But before we go to our next class. I just really wanted to thank you for working with us was really fun to work with. Thank you so much.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So we know what headings are in our text. So there are two headings here. The first heading is the moon is a desert. It's the bolted words, who can read to me what the second heading is",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so if we go back and we look at this reading passage, does anybody know any reading skills we could have used to have answered these questions. What key pieces could we have highlighted in the passage to help us answer this question.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"I highlighted the part in the question that says discovery water, but I didn't see discovering there. So I just, I found that found and water. And so that's how I use that. You know, I also want to tell you that I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So as you're reading what physical objects came in the passage to your mind,,,,
,210.4,Like in paragraph two,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So we can look back in our texts and find where it talks about a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And in the text it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. Can you show me where it says that in the text. Can you point to it.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Yeah, it was, um, in paragraph two, it's in the first sentence.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So if you look back in the text and paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,What does that mean that the water is microscopic,,,,
,210.4,"Um, it's like really small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yes. And so from the passage Oliver. What do you need to see the water,,,,
Oliver,210.4,And you need a microscope to see the water,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So I think what might help us is to maybe, you know, over the passage, a little bit. I think specifically part to see if we can all find the passage.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yes. And what was that small machine called. Do you remember,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Yeah, it was just or big",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And Jazmin. Why was the lunar orbiter sent to the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,How small was it. What did. What did. How was the water described in the passage,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Um, so they said the water was like they said microscopic which is crazy small",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes. So according to that passage Chris, what is the what is the passage saying that scientists had to use to see the water",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh well, I guess, like the passage is saying like, you have to use the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Let's see what paragraph three says, Uh, maybe we can discuss the difference",,,,
Chris,210.4,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So if we look back at the question, what do you think the key words in the question are",,,,
Oliver,210.4,I thought it was equipment and discovering water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,They use the microscope. But before they could use the microscope. What did they use to get to the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, they did. Doesn't. Can anyone go back into the text and find out what the name of that small machine was called?",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh well, I was just gonna say that, okay. So I went to NASA with my dad and when he and I went to NASA together, we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks And masks. So I was kind of wondering about that.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I agree, but we're reading the paragraphs and we're wondering what based off of our paragraphs, what knowledge, are we getting from those",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Because the lunar orbiter helps with the ice right? And the ice helps...,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Do what Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, let's look at our texts and figure it out together. So in paragraph two, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"To be able to see it because those deposits were so small you couldn't see it with your naked eye, you needed the microscope to be able to really",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Zoom in and see it. So they did use other pieces of equipment to help them, but the one that helped them find it and investigate it was the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so, Jazmin, you said NASA sent a small machine. You know the name of that machine they sent?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"I think, but I think Chris has his hand up. Should you call on him first?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Why don't you look back at the text and paragraph two, and can you tell me the name of the machine that they sent that NASA sent.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Okay, let's see. So paragraph two, the name of small machine was the Lunar Orbiter",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"However, Luis, do you see in the paragraph, where it talks about the machine that they sent",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Um, yeah, I guess. So I guess. So I guess I just like I kind of know all this stuff, you know,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, let's look at paragraph two,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So what do we think Chris microscopic means,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Very good. So the water they found was microscopic you couldn't really see if you're looking straight at it. So it was really small. There's a small amount of it. So the scientists would need a microscope to look at it very closely.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"So,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So it did help them find the water and they would need the microscope to look very closely at the water because it's so microscopic, it's so little and such a small amount.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Gotcha. So did they discover it with the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Wrapped if they were going to really and truly look at it and try to see it, then they would need the microscope to look at it because it is such a small amount.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Very good, very good. So they did send them lunar orbiter up to investigate and then if they were to really look at the water very closely, they would need the microscope.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"So, um, we have to go to lunch, unfortunately. But before we go, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us today and also to",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Exactly. Now while I'm reading this, I see a lot of words that maybe I do, maybe I do not quite understand. In a moment after our answer Farrahs question I'd like us to go through and identify some of these words, Farrah, what's your question?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Yes. So, okay. I was just wondering, as we were reading it through like because I know we're in this group for for help. Like, I was wondering why my answer about the microscope might not be right or what was wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So look at this for just a moment on your own and see if you can find one or two words that maybe you don't entirely know what they mean. Or maybe just need some clarification, take just a moment, raise your hand when you find one.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Absolutely they did use that to get to the moon, didn't they? But really could they have seen such tiny amounts of water without the microscope as well.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Exactly microscopic. That's one of the words that pops out to me. What does that mean, Farrah. Do you know?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,It means really small.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, it means so small. We actually can't see it, just looking at it, can we, so we do indeed need that microscope comes from the word microscopic microscope to be able to see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"helped me look back, I'm looking at",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, absolutely. If you look back. Let me scroll up if you look back direct quote from it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate you read the rest of the paragraph, it leads them to the water right?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Good. Thank you for that. So let's look specifically at paragraph number two, both of them mentioned craters. Right. However, if we look at paragraph two it goes a little bit more in depth, from what I see.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,is that a lot of water Chris.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah. And if we go back. It actually says that we need a microscope to see the water. So it's really, really small and spread over a really large area. Isn't it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"If we look at the microscope. More specifically, that you're looking at it and actually seeing it in order to see it, you would need to have already discovered it by this point, right. Does that make sense.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Makes a lot of sense. Yeah. So does that make sense in that,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, so um in paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, and basically look for these ice deposits, and since the water was so small, we then have to use a microscope to see it.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Okay, gotcha. Um, well, we have to go to lunch, unfortunately. But before we go her just wanted to thank you for working with us today and",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And you type in your answer, you said they need the microscope to look real closely. Why do you think they need to work real closely at the water that's on the moon. What is it about the water on the moon that necessitates the fact that they need to look closely at it. Yes, Oliver?",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Um okay, so you have to look really closely because you can't see it with just your eye. You have to see it through the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Exactly. And why can't you see it with your eyes?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What is it about water.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Because it's so small, like the the particles of water are so are so tiny",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Absolutely, they're small. So, you know, you think about water on Earth. We look at ponds, lakes, oceans, we can see that water. We all need a microscope. That's going to make tiny objects appear large",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But on the line as conveyed in that passage, we can see that the water is small and we need this microscope to make it appear large and that's the purpose of the microscope. So, good job there. That's exactly why we need it because we cannot see the water that's in these craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I'd like you to focus on just the microscopes, does it mentioned in the text that the microscope was used to find water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"However, I do want you to look at that part of the text again and ask yourself.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Was the microscope used to find water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"What was on the moon. Was there a piece of equipment referenced in the text that was on the moon, and Chris get to in just a minute. All right.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Was there a piece of equipment that was mentioned on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So I would like you to do Chris is go back to the text.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You know, they found water in the moon, you know, they found it in the craters and that's great. I want you to ask yourself what equipment, did they send into the craters to find that water as on the moon. Oliver?",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us. Thank you.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Can't really bring that water with them. They could, but it's going to take up too much space and that when you go into the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Spaces valuable. You know, you need to save as much space as you can. And it takes a lot of money to get stuff up to the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So, the less weight, I can turn that rocket the more money I'm going to save.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,The fact that it's on the moon means they don't have to carry it on the rocket and that does make it extremely valuable right.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What else is valuable. Is there anything else in the text that you can add of why water might be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"As a stage to go further into the solar system like Mars. So they're going to need fuel, they're going to need oxygen, they're going to need hydrogen. And you're absolutely right.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Water can be used to make those fuels and that can be used for that base, they might potentially build",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Who don't want an orbiter. What did it say that we did with it.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"They said it lands at the South Pole and looks for ice to pass it, and a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Oh well. Hmm. If you have that machine and you have a microscope. Are you guys thinking that we're going to be looking for a big pond of water or are we going to be looking for water that is extremely small.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right. So do you think based off of what you guys just told me that. Are you going to see water that is in large areas or are we looking for little bitty areas of water is a main full of water.,,,,
Chris,210.4,When I read it.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,They do use those and article even talks about using those different things.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Is the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it. So from that scene. It's are we going to look at large bodies of water.,,,,
All,210.4,No.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, so we're looking at microscopic micro being small. The reason why you have to use a microscope, you can't see it with your naked eye.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"but Chris, you brought up a great point. They use other equipment to like oxygen tanks and there's another one. Do you guys remember what the other equipment that they used",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Breathe in.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What did you just breathe in.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Oxygen.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,But guess what the moon does not have,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,It doesn't have oxygen.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Macroscopic. Is it going to be very heavy,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"No, no.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Cuz it's right. But think about when you go to the grocery store and you buy two gallons of water is that heavy,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Yeah, yeah. My mom always makes me carry the groceries inside and my arms are always like, hurting so much",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so let me ask you to close your eyes and think and draw a picture in your mind of what you think a crater looks like.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Is it small. Is it big. How are you picturing it,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Um, I guess it could be a couple like it could be any size because depending on like how how big it is, like, it could be bigger or it could be small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So, what did you guys see in your mind when I read that? Jazmin?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so what so class. What would you tell me the purpose of the lunar orbiter would be based on the text. Yes Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Like is it. I mean, I guess it's to find the water to, like, you know what I mean like to go get the water",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Now we've talked about how we we have this small lunar module. Right. And this is one of those tools that you probably saw at NASA Chris when you went to go visit,,,,
Teacher,210.4,This lunar module again just like Jazmin said was sent to the moon to find ice deposits and large and large polar craters. This would help them find water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And now, what do you think we can use those two for hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"There's a clue in paragraph five, yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Um, yeah, I think, like, okay, you could use it or okay well you could breathe it. Um, and then it says oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Water can be valuable. Yes, we do have some Olivereloping to do with the technology to be able to move and transport the water and to split those chemicals up to form the rocket fuel.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, yes. There are a lot of uses for water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Day now is the technology ready,,,,
Teacher,210.4,I would say I would say probably no.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But there are some uses that we could use water for in the future, even for some now we would just have to use technology to make that happen. Yes, Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"And we unfortunately have to go to lunch. But before we go, I just wanted to thank you for working with us, and especially I wanted to thank you for really listening for answers and really making us feel like",,,,
Teacher,210.4,A small machine can you you know what that small machine called?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Can you go back in the text and fine what that small machine is called?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So let's look back in the story and see if we can find those tools. So there's two tools.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,can you look back and tell us what that small machine is called,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So we're going to look back and we're going to see if we can find it in the text. All right.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Let's look back in the text and see if we can find the answer to our question,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So let's see if we can find the answer in our story. So let's look back and see what we can find.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And then, paragraph three, this is where Farrah got her answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Do you remember what the name of that small machine was,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,I guess I don't understand why my answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Maybe we can take a closer look at the reading to and get some other feedback.,,,,
Luis,210.4,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So did you hear the beginning of what you said there was a specific name of a little tool that they used to investigate in water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,The Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, so that was definitely. It was a form of a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It was a small machine. I'm sure that they didn't use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like Luis said, but there was that one little piece in the text that gave the specific name of the tool. And that's what",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"We did read that. It's called a Moon, lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And that it investigates so that's why NASA sends it up there.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So you're both right because we read three different parts of the text where they talked about two different equipments that are used on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"The lunar orbiter is used to investigate what's on the moon, and the microscope like Farrah said is used to look at small particles, that the Lunar orbiter wouldn't really pick up so you're both re they're just used for different things.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"I circled the same thing with Farrah, so I guess I am right too.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So you could always write that to that, even though scientists use a microscope there might be so some things that are so small, they still can't see.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,It can you say that again you're talking kind of fast.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"All these tools contribute to scientists being able to discover if the moon is truly habitable, which means that people can live there for humans like us.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Usually, they try to find the similarities between the earth and the moon, try to see if anyone from earth can be able to live in the moon, yes Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll see you later bye.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Awesome. So in the texts that you guys read, they definitely mentioned the microscope at the very end there. But I want to kind of make it a little more clear for everyone because the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So this tool. It was mentioned in the text, and I want to see it. Does anyone remember what was said in the text about the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah so you're definitely right they need the microscope to be able to look closely at the water, but when they're doing this, they might not be doing this on the moon, so, if you look at the second paragraph, can you read the first sentence for me.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Okay, let me see.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"that's a really good question to ask and that's something that I think all of you should definitely be asking some sort of version of when you're reading, so if the water is not ready yet, is it not valuable.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Go back and look at the text, so in that first paragraph there paragraph four um it says, you know future astronauts could drink this water, water is heavy and it takes up a lot of room.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So do you have any idea of how you could connect astronauts drinking water to water being too heavy to put on a spaceship.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Okay yeah yeah yeah I have an idea.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, and that's why we're going to talk about that because when you read a passage",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Sometimes things be hard to understand because they use certain adjectives to describe the machine. But the real name of the machine was a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So we know you're reading everything and making sure you see everything in the paragraphs, right? So you you caught that first in paragraph two, but if you kept reading in paragraph three, you would have seen the real word for the small machine, right?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Um, ok.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, what is that small machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,What did the small machine do what was its purpose on the moon?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Um,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What specifically did it investigate? Use your evidence from the text.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Um,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right and ice is water correct just frozen.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh, yeah, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,The small machine as you recognized is the lunar orbiter that was sent to investigate and look for water on the moon. Good job. Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh, I did it? That was the right answer. I did it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So you discover that there was water on the moon. What equipment did they use? You can look back in the text to help you.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Um, so you're right, they do use microscopes to look really closely. So can you elaborate on why they use the microscope? What did they do using the microscope?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And how does that relate back to the question?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Why did they need the microscope?,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Because the water was really small.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"If you go back to the microscope that Farrah was talking about, how did they find water using the microscope?",,,,
Chris,210.4,You can't really find water using the microscope. It's not like it's like binoculars or something you could only look at water um using a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So they had to use the microscope to know that there was water on the moon. Right?,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well, how did they find the water first to even put it underneath the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Does it say it in the text?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Well, that's why I thought that maybe my answer was the right one. Because, um, cuz the the Lunar Orbiter, I think, that they sent to investigate. Um, I think maybe.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,That's how they found the water Chris.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Using small machine that Jazmin identified,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And then they took the microscope that Farrah found in the text and used that to look at the water. Oliver.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"I'm sorry to interrupt teacher, but I was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch. So I wanted to say goodbye and thanks for for",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"All right, so if you go back to the first texts and moon is a desert.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And microscope is one of the pieces of equipment, but remember equipment isn't always going to be defined as equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Equipment could be a machine a piece of technology, do you see anything in this text that is not a microscope but is a piece of equipment.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"teacher, I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Paragraph two all right, can you tell me what it is.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,yeah I saw lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, great that is a piece of equipment that they use, can you tell me what a lunar lunar orbiter is.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,Okay it's a small machine it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Now, how did they use the Lunar orbiter to find water, you said that they looked for ice deposits right.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Great and yeah ice is also what when it's melted.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,ice ice is also water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Can you find any in the text.,,,,
Chris,210.4,is the one that Oliver said.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,all right perfect good job finding that out the small machine is a piece of equipment that the scientists used like there you were able to find that same answer as Oliver. so. In reading that you also found that the small machine was called what?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,A lunar orbiter,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right and this paragraph, also tells you what a lunar orbiter does, can you tell me what the Lunar orbiter does.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,It looks I used to pause it in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Perfect, now what about looking for ice deposits in a large polar crater has to do with finding water on the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Okay well.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah absolutely they had to use.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so to review what you were saying they use the Lunar orbiter which looks for ice deposits in the craters on the moon and ice is just frozen water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So a lunar orbiter is a piece of equipment that finds water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So yeah like it said in a text on that the water if they find enough on the moon, they couldn't make like a gas station, so now it's time that could be important,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"a microscope is would not work because you need to discover the water, first, to use a microscope to look at the water, so you actually need the Lunar orbiter to find the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"orbit to discover the water that is already on the load and you would use a like semana and Oliver said you would use a microscope to look at the sample the water that you found on the moon, if that makes sense.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"was my answer is, it is.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"the creatives are not full of water, it was a little bit of water in the craters on the moon, that the Lunar orbit does that",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh OK, so my answer was right, I just said that, basically, there was too much water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I don't think they are exactly what it out of the reading I think they they didn't feel that it was appropriate to writing with what the reading was about which wasn't discovering the water on the moon, yes.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,But that wasn't exactly what it was about.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"gotcha Okay, thank you.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,You use a microscope to zoom in on something small that you cannot see with your eyes.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,gotcha so um I I read somewhere that they were going to try to build a base on the moon for 2024.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, and I think if we look back into our reading, we can find specifics",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Yeah, okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So in our reading we did learn a little bit more about what they used to find the water and the first question i'm sorry discovering the moon, so we found that.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,We found different answers and what you found and that that's okay we'll just have to look back in the text to find these answers.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"or anything that helps you find the water, so now thinking that way thinking anything that can be considered equipment to help us find the water is there anything more that you can think of that you saw.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah that's a great answer, thank you, so now we can see that we've used the microscope and the Lunar orbiter",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And Luis now that we've heard from everybody we've learned that we use the spacecraft and the microscope to see the water on the moon, is there any other.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,If you look in the second sentence.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking at it closely.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"No the one that starts with ""NASA sent""",,,,
Farrah,210.4,NASA sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate lunar orbiter when the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large public crater.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay. Do you see where it says the exact equipment they sent, Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,I'll let me read it again.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So you see how that was the equipment they used to discover the water and then the microscope was the equipment they used to go closer and see if the water was sufficient,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Well, I mean, I see where it's at that the lunar orbiter will land at the South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. But I guess I didn't, I didn't. It doesn't look like they found water in there.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,They um the water they found was microscopic that's why they need it on my microscope to look closer,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Exactly, but before they could see them water with the microscope they had to use an equipment to find the water in the first place.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And the microscope after they found the water they use a microscope to look closely at it, so the microscope help them to see the water better, but I did it help them find the water.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,makes perfect sense Thank you so much okay that makes sense I'm not confused,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Does anybody know what microscopic means?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Microscopic means that you can't see it with your eye that you need a scientific tool called a microscope in order to see it.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,but right now we're just going to focus on what's in the text and answering the question from the text.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So Chris, you may have gone to NASA but we're going to be focusing more on what the passage is saying, because the question is specific to the passage.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So in the passage you read that it talks about how NASA sent a lunar.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"lunar lunar orbiter to investigate and then, if you look at the sentence right after that, it says this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah so, which is why we this passage is pretty important since we need to know if the water and NASA can be valuable to us.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Where it says water is heavy and it can take up a lot of room on the spacecraft. Having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and other things, which is good because it's pretty much what you wrote in your response.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But I want you to look, I want everyone to look on paragraph 2 where it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. The lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small. Do you think that this refers to the question at all?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, so we're-- we're going to look at-- I want everyone to look at the machine it's referencing to. And I want someone to tell me what the machine it's referencing to.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,The machine is the lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What does it do though? So what does the machine do?,,,,
Luis,210.4,It investigates.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What does it investigate?,,,,
Luis,210.4,Lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits. Ice deposits in a large polar--,,,,
Teacher,210.4,I want someone else to answer this. Do you think ice deposits correlate with water by any chance?,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh, yeah, right. Oh, yeah, because ice is just frozen water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, exactly. So going back to what Luis said, the machine looks for ice deposits. So does anyone-- can anyone understand that ice deposit is water they're looking for. Does everyone agree with that?",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Yeah, I wasn't thinking about that, I was just looking for the word water. And I didn't even think about the fact that, Oh, yeah, like you said today, and ice and water is the same.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Good point of the storywise, they were looking for ice deposits. But ice deposits are water. So that's the important part of the reading.",,,,
Luis,210.4,It look and looks for ice deposits.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, and what are ice deposits?",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Frozen-- frozen water. Yeah, frozen water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And what are the ice deposits?,,,,
Farrah,210.4,They're very small. Oh ice ice deposits are frozen water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes , ice deposits are frozen water. And so they use that equipment to what?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,To find them.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,To investigate what?,,,,
Farrah,210.4,The ice deposits.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,The water because the water is the ice deposit. So they're using it to investigate the water on the moon. Does anyone have any questions about that?,,,,
Oliver,210.4,I don't have any questions but I did look at the clock and I see that it's time for us to go to lunch.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So when we look at the second sentence, we can see ice deposits. Does anyone know what ice deposits are?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Have a guess what is deposits are?,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, maybe like ice? That gets put down somewhere?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,It's ok. So is there any similarity between ice and water? Does anyone know the similarity between ice and water?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Ice is frozen water. So ice so ice and water on the same thing. They're both water just in different forms. So going back to what Jazmin said earlier, NASA a small machine called a lunar orbiter. That is a type of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So going back to Farrah's question before. When you said, why is the microscope the wrong answer. Well the microscope is looking for something.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But the way it's written in paragraph two, they first use a lunar orbiter to look for the water, then they use a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,I want you guys to think for a second in your head about why they would use a lunar orbiter before they would use a microscope.  I want you to think.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Ok you're done. So, from what i've heard from you guys, you guys circled two words. The first word was microscope and the second was the small machine. Does anyone know the difference between these two types of equipment? Anything, any guesses is fine, from what you see in the reading. Luis, go ahead.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"yeah well, I mean, I think that microscope is like small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Does anyone know why they might be different? Luis's on the right track, but does anyone know why they might be different? Look at the reading. I want you to look at the reading, I want you to think why they might be different, it might help you.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Well, no, it says on the small machine is called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,That is correct. What about anything else? anyone else noticed anything in the reading?,,,,
Chris,210.4,It said that the lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,But Chris you're on the right track with finding ice deposits. Does anyone know the similarity between ice deposits and water?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Ice is frozen water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Ice is frozen water. And ice ice and water are the same thing, because they're both water. And from what we know in the reading that the small machine called the lunar orbiter is finding ice deposits which are really -what are they really?",,,,
Oliver,210.4,they're really small.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"They're really small. What else are they? what are the ice deposits, what did we just say?",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, they're water. They're water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So the lunar orbiter is finding what?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"We're funding water. So do you think - does that make any sense? So what is the microscope, what does the microscope do?",,,,
Luis,210.4,"We use the microscope you know, to look at really small things in science class.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So what are we using the microscope in this reading? what are they using the microscope for in this reading?,,,,
Farrah,210.4,I wrote this one in my answer. They're using the microscope to look really closely at the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"At the water, that's right Farrah. So they already found the water when they use the microscope. So the microscope isn't the right answer because the water's already been found before they use the microscope. So if you have any questions about that.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,If you don't understand why the microscope would be the wrong answer.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"No, so no So what are they using the find the water?",,,,
Oliver,210.4,they're using the lunar orbiter to find the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What was the machine called,,,,
Teacher,210.4,look back to the reading,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,The Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And do you know why based on the reading. They sent the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,They sent,,,,
Teacher,210.4,A lunar orbiter to look for something in the craters. What were they looking for,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Deposits to look for ice deposit and a large crater,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So like the Lunar Orbiter. OK.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Why don't we look at the reading Chris. Let's look at the reading together. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So what does it say in the second paragraph.,,,,
Chris,210.4,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole. and look for ice deposits in a large pool of crater. these ice deposits are very small. scientists say one of the top layer of the moon surface will hold in total about 32 ounces of water,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Thank you for reading that. It was very helpful. So looking back in that. What did you find what kind of equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So if you keep reading that sentence, why did NASA send that to the moon, what about it, what about the water did that did they need to send something to the moon for do you know why.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Perfect so NASA send an lunar orbiter to investigate and they needed that they were using that to help discover the water on the moon,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,what do we know about the water can you see it with your eyes.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"No, it's too small",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"right it's too small, so they needed to use a tool called a microscope to view it",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Perfect alright can one of my friends tell me in the first paragraph, in paragraph four in that sentence there's something that tells us about why the water having it there could be important Can someone tell me why it could be valuable that the water is already on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Can you read that.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"i'm having water on the moon, would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Farrah. So I really liked your response. You said that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. And do you remember what we were looking really closely at?,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Water,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So the microscope really did help it helps you see something really tiny. And if you remember in the reading, we learned that they discovered that there was water on the moon, but it was so small that they had to use a microscope to see it.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And Chris, I also really liked your response. But do you remember what the scientists used to find in the craters to find the craters.",,,,
Chris,210.4,What do they use to find the craters.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So can you think of any of the equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"I'm on the thing that I'm like Jazmin said, or maybe that you said are Chris your set. I don't know. Um, I think that that's probably the equipment. The thing that they said",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yeah. And do you remember what the lunar orbiter did?,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Um, it's a center.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And what did it and what wasn't looking for, Anybody remember that one?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh, ice deposit,  it's it's looking for ice deposit",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So Luis, just go back. So the lunar orbiter was used. It was a small machine sent by NASA to look for ice deposits and craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So what it's really having us do here Oliver is it's having us infer that they use the Lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon, so I can see why you are confused, but am I helping you clear this up at all, but the Lunar orbiter help discover the water on the moon.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Okay, so I read a thing right and i'm I see where it says that it was looking for ice deposits I.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,it's the water so microscopic that it's still drier than the desert,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That you said you know that it's a small machine, they said, but can you tell me anything more about it, like what did you find interesting about it, maybe the name of the machine.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh, oh yeah the name is a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, let me see maybe we could think back to the first reading.",,,,
Luis,210.4,Oh okay yeah I see Jazmin why you said you didn't know why yours was wrong place yeah cause ice deposits is water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Did they use any equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Going to look back at your text is it on your tablets.,,,,
Luis,210.4,Excuse me.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Do you did you see any textual evidence in the first quote that says anything about equipment.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Um, okay. Let me look again",,,,
Teacher,210.4,That's good. There wasn't anything mentioned about equipment you want to move on to the next quote,,,,
Chris,210.4,Yeah yeah,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So Vana. Can you point out any equipment used,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Just the small machine. Can you specify what they called it though.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh yeah, they called it the Lunar Orbiter. That's great. Thank you.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Now let's move on to the last quote,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Excuse me.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So in the text explains the lunar orbiter does something. Can you tell me what it does.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And how it helps scientists, maybe",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Lunar Orbiter land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits it in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,def. Can you tell me if they use any equipment in that quote,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Can you explain to me how the scientists use it to look for water maybe,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"I'm yeah, I'm okay. And I said, you may use a microscope to look really closely at the water. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Or did they mention anything more about equipment.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Mmm hmm. Okay, I was kind of spacing out for a second there. Um, what you say def",,,,
Teacher,210.4,I believe the microscope is attached to the lunar orbiter,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Right. Oh, I'm, I'm all okay I don't know.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And in the second quote it mentions the small machine called the Lunar Orbiter. So that was the equipment that the NASA had sent up to the space. It's equipment using it. Um,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Help to find the water and then the second equipment that was mentioned in the quotes, where the microscope, because that's an equip up piece of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That can be used to help look at small little things, and the water particles up on moon were so small you wouldn't even be able to see it with your regular eyes.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, definitely. They use all that stuff, but specifically here in the text, where do we, where can we find that it talks about what tools they use to find those craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So although they did use a microscope to look at,,,,
Teacher,210.4,You see in the text.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"paragraph to paragraph two,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Let's go back to the text and see if that's true. Can anybody find in the text where it says,,,,
Teacher,210.4,where it talks about what tools they use to find the water,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Well, I mean, in my answer. I, I said a tool, uh, the microscope, because I use that to look at the water",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"However, um, the, they did use the microscope to look at the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But back to the text. Um Jazmin, I really like your",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And, yeah. They might -Also in the text, they don't really, when they say water, we don't really see the word water in the text, a lot right? Did you guys notice that?",,,,
Chris,210.4,I noticed that too. And that's why I oh I looked for the part that had the most stuff about the water,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, that's true. Right? So they say that they looked for so that like Jazmin said",,,,
Teacher,210.4,They use the they use the small machine. The Lunar the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and they found water in ice deposits. So ice is just dried up water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And sometimes they the text is saying that. In the third paragraph, the water they found is microscopic so",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"This in the beginning of the end of paragraph two, they say ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And then when you think of microscopic microscopic means that they have to look through a microscope to to see it, which means that it's really small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"If you put those two together, you can infer or guess from that, that ice deposits is where the water was stored.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So, if that's where the water was, what did they use to find the ice deposits? Can anyone tell me? Can anyone refer to the text?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So can anybody find in the text where it mentions um discovering.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Where it mentions discovering.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Or discovering something on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"I thought that, that's why I thought my answer was right, because in paragraph three, it says the water they found is microscopic so that means that they found the water and, and then they talk about the microscope in the next sentence.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Your response, which I think points us to a different part of the text that also mentions um discovering.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Something on the moon.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Yeah, sure. And you know I also, I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah awesome and that's awesome knowledge and thank you for sharing that with us. Um just to redirect us bit back to the to the text, and to the topic um.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So I think can everyone recognize that there are two places in the text that talk about where we find something or water on the moon?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,And my answer came from the second paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Now, if we look at the text where it talks about.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,These small the small machine can anybody find the name of the small machine?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And if we actually take take a, take a look back at the text, you can actually see that",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So you can see that they are using a scientific microscope to look at it.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And then, now that we've all understood that we're going to need a scientific microscope. Like Farrah said",,,,
Teacher,210.4,and now we also can keep looking at the reading. If we look in paragraph three,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"We can see that they said that the water that they found is microscopic so if you were looking straight at it, you wouldn't be able to see it. So definitely what Farrah said yes. Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,I don't understand why my answer's wrong.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, they use an orbiter. And then let's keep reading, paragraph three, in the last sentence that says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really clearly",,,,
Teacher,210.4,to discover water on the moon scientist used blank can you remember what the scientists use on the moon.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,yeah the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Now were there any others are those the only two that you could find I stopped after paragraph three, but if I keep.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, that is correct. And that is in the second paragraph, NASA did send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and the lunar orbiter just looks for ice deposits in the in the craters. But when you reach the third paragraph, you'll see that small machine they used",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So if we look back in the second paragraph, you're right. The small machine is called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And investigate. You're right. That's looking to find the water. But as we see it in the third paragraph. It says that the water they found is microscopic so the water that is found.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You need to look at it with a small machine called a microscope, because you can only see it with the microscope, not the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh, okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So if we take a closer look at the question and in the text we see that they use a microscope to find the water,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Then, all right, well, so let's move on. Um, so, Farrah, did you see, you said that you saw the microscope, and it was used to look really closely. So what did the microscope. Look really closely at",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So what did the lunar orbiter do to help find water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Um, well, it says that it landed on the moon, um, let me see what that means about finding water. I'm not sure.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,It says that this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Well,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And microscope and what is the microscope.,,,,
Chris,210.4,It's something you use to look at really small thing.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, so how did they use a microscope to find the water",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well, it didn't really say. It just says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, you know, I went to NASA. So I know that I just use a lot of equipment like",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"um, and what the question was asked before, and it is right because I",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Is being used to ISIS and different form of water. It's the solid for so the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in the polar craters, which helps them find water.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Thanks. Thanks a lot. Hey, I'm",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"The microscope was used to look at the water, but if they had the water already that's means that the water was already discovered on the moon, so the microscope seems to be used after the water was discovered and to analyze it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And then afterwards, they definitely used microscope to look at the water and they probably had to have oxygen tanks when they are trying to discover it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But that wasn't necessarily used to discover water on the moon more as an add on, so I think you bring up a great point Chris, that there are probably lots of different types of equipment used when people are on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That is a great point so off the bat guys, we should be thinking that we are looking for now evidence that proves water is valuable as a resource because off the bat the title says water is a valuable resource.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,um can you find a maybe a point in the texts that were explains a benefit to having water and why it would be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,The water is actually very heavy so,,,,
Teacher,210.4,it's really hard to keep in a spaceship so if we were able to have the water come through moon it would lighten up the spacecraft leaving more room for different types of materials.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So although, your answer was correct, that we do need to drink water, the evidence that would relate to the text would be more focused on how the water being on the moon would relieve space on the spaceship.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,so referring back to your texts.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So it's actually both of them. So in our text in the second bullet point, it says that NASA sent this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, they used both the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And the microscope to explore these things and the lunar orbiter helped look for ice deposits, which is another form of water right I use is just frozen water so they use both of these things to explore the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But if you think back to Farrah response, she said I referred to the text and I thought about the specific tools they used so if you look back into the text, what do you notice about the specific tools, it says they used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Small machine called.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Maybe even what what are they investigating, if you think back to the question, what are they investigating what was that tool used for.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,To investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,it's very similar though right like they're investigating they're thinking about considering how they can find water on the moon so.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right so just building on your response that you already have let's look back in the text it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So that's the type of equipment isn't it.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah yeah and it says that if it landed at the south Pole and looks for ice deposits and then, if we look at the next paragraph it talks about how the water was so so tiny that they needed a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"If you refer back to the text, and you think about what Chris added to his response you're correct in saying that you do need a microscope to be able to see this water, but if you look at paragraph two, can you tell me what machine NASA sent to discover the water?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,They said the lunar orbiter well how do you know that they sent it to discover the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,It says in the next sentence this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater and it says that how they're really strong and yeah.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,yeah I was looking for the word water I forgot I didn't because they didn't actually say water in this in the paragraph about the Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah it's a little bit tricky you have to think about other forms of water, like you have to think about ice or like gases, you know it give me a little bit tricky so",,,,
Farrah,210.4,you'd need,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right so so maybe if an asteroid is going to lower the things the moon, that would be beneficial and necessary for them to have in order to discover water on the moon, but the machines they send don't need that equipment in order to successfully explore the water on the moon right.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Right okay yeah I wasn't even thinking about that maybe they didn't have the astronauts on the moon that they just sent the machine by itself, I just I figured the astronauts were there with the machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, so the astronauts maybe they're up in their spaceship their rocket ship up there, and then they send this tool out to investigate before they would go right.",,,,
Chris,210.4,yeah yeah that makes sense.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So even if you're looking straight to it, you wouldn't be able to tell if it was there or not. So they needed an equipment that would help them. One second, Farrah. I'll be right back with you. They needed an equipment to look very, very close to that little block of ice, and then they would see if there is water in there. Farrah, you want to share something with us?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Yeah, I guess I was wondering. So it sounds like you were saying that they use something to find the small water, and I was thinking that-- because I said that they must have used the microscope. So I guess I was wondering why my answer was wrong?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But for that, they have something very similar that they take it to the space so they can actually find that. OK?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So that's kind of like a little microscope. And then it looks very, very close to the surface, and they look for ice deposit in li-- Chris?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Luis Can you think of any particular specific examples of equipment that they might use?,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Yeah, okay. So, yeah, okay. So I think that what they use was like oxygen tanks and stuff like that. Like Chris was saying. And I know a lot about space. So they probably use like some kind of like pack to like drink water from and like all that kind of stuff.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So i'm going to give you two minutes to read the text and really closely read it with the question keep the questions in mind as you're reading.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You are going to use one highlighter to highlight two examples of equipment that they used on the moon specific examples, at least two examples.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And then you are going to use the other colored highlighter to highlight at least two examples.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"of why finding water on the moon, is important.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Good i'm going to give you two colored highlighters they're going to be different colors with one color you are going to highlight two examples of specific equipment that they used on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,start with the other colored highlighter you're going to highlight specifically two examples of why finding water on the moon would be well.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Does that answer your question yeah that's that makes sense Okay, I think I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"and find two examples of equipment news done the moon, and two examples of why finding water on the moon will be helpful, after the one minute i'm going to check in and see if you guys need any more time.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,you're reading one through six but you'll find your first answer the equipment in one through three.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,That while it could be used as equipment to hold it's not necessarily something that the scientists used to discover the water.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh so it's the the equipment that like found the water so, even if it was in the crater it's not like the crater was equipment to find it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Do you, if you look back into our texts called water on the moon,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,What is a piece of equipment that the scientists use in that text.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Kind of look in the text and. Who can remember a type of tool that the scientists used while they were on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, so I so that the sentence that Jazmin is referring to is in the second paragraph, it says, NASA send a small machine Jazmin. Can you read us the rest of that sentence.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Yeah okay so,,,,
Teacher,210.4,They're not saying it would make it more it would make more sense if they said,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"NASA send a small tool because it's asking us or sent a small piece of equipment, since we're talking about the equipment they use, but a machine is also kind of like the equipment yeah Jazmin",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Since I was just,,,,
Teacher,210.4,About what those small machine is called. Do you remember what the small machine was called,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Yeah, okay. Okay, so I think I understand. I said, NASA sent a small machine. But I should have said, Like what the actual like machine was and the machine was the was the lunar orbiter right",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So let's talk about the actual tools that were used, which I know some of you used in your explanation. Anybody want to raise their hand and just list, maybe, one of the tools that were used, a specific tool that the scientists used. Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Yeah, I said that they used the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And that's right and we saw that in, I believe, the third part of the--",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Yeah, in paragraph 3.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"--the third part of the article. OK, and they used that in a specific line which Farrah noticed, when they set the water they found is microscopic, meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you're looking straight at it. You need a scientific tool called a m",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And that is true, they did. And we saw that in the second part of the article, number 2, where it said, NASA sent a small machine called-- and you'd see that in the text, they called it a Lunar Orbiter, to investigate what they found on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, so they use the microscope has any have, have any of you guys ever use a microscope before,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So you have used to it. Have you ever. What have you used it on usually use it on like a small thing, right.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Yeah yeah in science class last year we we saw Mr. Anderson use one and like, was he was looking at, I think it was like, I think he was looking at his spit or something. It was like, something like that. We were looking at, like, really close.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yeah. And what we what we learned in the passage was that we that we were using it to learn to look at the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Okay. So when you say NASA send a small machine. Do you know exactly what that machine was called,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Yeah, yeah, it was called the lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You said, you'll need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely, which is which is very true. But do you know what we're looking closely at?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,We're looking at the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Do you remember why NASA sent a small machine and maybe what it's called.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"No, I don't remember.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so if we look back to our reading. It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter a lunar orbiter. Does anyone remember why they sent the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh yeah, I see that NASA sent  small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will end at the South Pole and look for ice deposits and",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You know why they have to use a microscope, so do you. Why do they need a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Do you know what a microscope is,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Yeah yeah a microscope is is what you use in science class to look at really small thing.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So if you use a microscope. Look at really small things. Why do you think you would need a microscope to look at the water found on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So based off the conversation we're having now could you tell me what equipment they used to find the water and the craters.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,Oliver said the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But what happened first is NASA sent the machine, so there might not have been any astronauts and the machine just went on to the moon, to look for the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Exactly that's correct because the two equipments go hand in hand Chris what's going on.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"um so I guess, I was just picking.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So at NASA they have like Farrah said astronauts so they would use equipment like suits and.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"helmets to go into space and then scientists, a lot of scientists, they were special jackets when they're in the lab and sometimes maybe they'll wear masks to protect themselves.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So where that fits into our reading if scientists, so we sent the machine into onto the moon, we collected some samples with them lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And then that came back to a lab and then the scientists in the lab use the different equipment like maybe a microscope to look at the water that the Lunar orbiter connected from the moon, so it all goes together, like a big web of ideas everything connects.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh okay that makes a lot of sense so like Okay, so if there was an astronaut on food, maybe they use that, but the truth is that they did it is that right they didn't eat an astronaut, because they sent the small sheet.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah so the machine did all the work that an astronaut might have done on the on the moon, but a tiny little machine did it for us, so we didn't have to send anybody up there, that makes sense.",,,,
Chris,210.4,yeah that makes a lot of.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I just want to say that you want to make sure you don't want to confuse the amount of water that they found in the moon, so there was a very small amount.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So instead of saying it's full of water, the craters are full of water, there was a tiny bit in there that we can look further into using our equipment or microscope all right.",,,,
Chris,210.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So the Lunar orbiter he looks for the ice deposits in the polar the polar craters and so your question is how exactly the Lunar orbiter looks for that right.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,yeah like.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Now I want. I want you to think about what other things that we might find in look in lunar orbiters that could be helpful for us to have a closer look and Deb, I saw that in your answer. You had similar",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Answer to Farrah, so do. Is there any tool or gadget that you could think of that would be helpful to have on an orbiter.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Um, yeah. So I agree with Farrah. And I thought, basically, that like, um, you know, you would need the microscope, because they said in the reading.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So in the text. It tells us that the scientists actually send the lunar orbiters to to space that they don't actually go there themselves.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"They send these machines, like you said, Jazmin NASA send a small machine which is called the Lunar Orbiter to Earth.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Um, yeah, I was just gonna say that, honestly, like I already know all about space. I don't think I need any help. I don't even think I should be in this",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And as I was talking about with Oliver that the scientists weren't actually sent out to NASA. I'm fine. NASA. NASA sent out the lunar orbiters to look at the little to look at the craters in the earth so,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"In that sense, the lunar orbiter do not need oxygen. But why do you. Why do you think that using the text. Why do you think that NASA would send lunar orbiters instead of scientists or astronauts.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That is true. It was, it's like, it's so as Jazmin was saying it's a machine. So they send it up to space without the need or help of any astronauts.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"So basically just what I was gonna say was, I wasn't sure why my answer was, well,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And does anyone remember from the text, what the lunar orbiter does",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Moon. Yeah. So basically, it gets a closer look. I was thinking",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That one of the helpful tools could have been a camera right there could be microscopes connected to the Lunar Orbiter, but there could also be a camera that would help scientists here on Earth, get a closer look to the moon",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, exactly, and those are found inside the craters right the large pool of craters",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"things on the moon right, specifically the ice deposits.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"I was acutally kind of confused, because I wasn't sure, we're all here because maybe our answers are not fully right. So, I was kind of wondering like, why is my answer wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"The the fourth paragraph, which was talking about how water is used and that's one thing that we talked about in our second question,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,We know that water is made from hydrogen and oxygen so that oxygen can be taken out from the water and used for oxygen tanks like you said.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"is a small machine right that looks for ice deposits in a large craters,  that's what paragraph told us.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Now Can someone give me information on a microscope what does it say that the microscope does, can you look into your paragraph and find that and then you guys raise your hand and when you guys could share with the group. Go ahead, Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Okay. Basically,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"All right, let's get back to what Chris was saying about how the water is heavy so this paragraph is that water is valuable because, on the moon water becomes valuable because then astronauts don't have to carry the heavy water inside the spacecraft.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well, they have room for kind of other stuff so maybe they want to bring different kinds of food or maybe more likely they want to bring like other equipment and stuff like that.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,We also talked about the bottom talks about how we can use hydrogen for something else.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Farrah could you tell us what that something else is? It's in paragraph five.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yeah. Did you notice I'm a name of the equipment that they were using to look for the water,,,,
Teacher,210.4,How about Farrah. I loved your answer. When you talked about the microscope. Have you ever seen a microscope.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh yeah yeah we we use it in, in, and Miss Smith science class.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, awesome, isn't it, what do you use my microscopes for. Do you know. Does anyone know, raise your hand.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,How,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Have you,,,,
Teacher,210.4,ever used a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Before,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, do you think it would be really cool to have a little waters on it and see that there's water in the moon from the story that we read",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Oh wow, yeah. Yeah, that'd be man. I think so. Cool.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Jazmin that right that's me okay sorry I couldn't really see your name tag um so I was wondering, so I remember you were talking about how NASA send a small machine Do you remember what the machines name was.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You were talking about how, in paragraph three, it talks about the.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"hmm and do you remember, if there was anything from the article that i'm told us if the water was used is there anything else, that it can be used for.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"um I know they said, the thing about drinking it because I got that street from this text.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"No, it is much better, like the water was on the moon, because then the ship doesn't have to carry all that water, and it will make the ship more heavy yes even.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Okay, I I did say that it could be split into two parts, hydrogen oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah so I remember when I was reading the text that it was talking about how it can be used for fuel to.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Which is very helpful, do you guys remember reading that part.",,,,
Luis,210.4,I forgot about that part yeah I did read that part.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Does anyone want to like talk about how that could be very useful and valuable maybe yeah yeah I can.,,,,
Chris,210.4,And you know I read that there was there could be a base on the moon by 2024.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,know that could help us a lot right.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"yeah cuz, then the thing about carrying the water wouldn't be an issue okay astronauts could breathe oxygen hydrogen also be used as rocket fuel oh that's what you said.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah that could be really cool imagine if there was a gas station like on the moon.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, oh okay I just saw the time it's time for us to go to lunch.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Awesome. Hi, everyone. So I was just going over your responses. Farrah, you say that they need a microscope to look really closely. What are they looking closely at?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh, the water?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"OK, perfect. The water they found in the craters, right?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Uh, I don't know where. The water they found on the moon, I guess.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So let's read number one again. It says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters. These craters are dark places where the sun never shines. So based off of that, where do we think the water is being found?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,In the craters.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"OK, so let's look at the actual sentences, OK? So we've already talked about the microscope, but if you look at number two, it says NASA sent a small machine. Can you read that sentence and tell me what the machine is and what it does?",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Uh huh, OK. NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate. This Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. OK, so it's a Lunar Orbiter and it investigates.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Great job. What does it investigate?,,,,
Luis,210.4,Ice deposits.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What does it investigate?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,(WHISPERING) The Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits. Ice deposits?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Awesome, and why do you think it looks for ice deposits? What would the ice deposits tell us?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,If it's cold there?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, but what would it tell us that involves water?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,If the water's frozen?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, so can we have ice without water?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"No, because it's just frozen water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, so that proves that there was water on the moon because there's little bits of ice everywhere, right?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Uh huh, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"OK. OK, that's really interesting. So why don't you tell me a little bit more about what they did with the water that they found on Mars-- the moon, not Mars.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"What did they do with the water that they found on the moon? I don't know, maybe they drank it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, let's look at this sentence right here. It says that the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it. So what would they have to do with the water to know that it was there if it was too small to see?",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well, this says that you need a microscope to look at it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Exactly. But can we try to think back to that text we read in the equipment that excited. I can read you the sentence if you'd like.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It's an NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate this this lunar orbiter looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, and the end of the article says that.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,uh huh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So let's go back into the text and try to find that specific line that you were referring to.,,,,
Luis,210.4,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh, I think it's in paragraph number five.",,,,
Luis,210.4,Oh yeah that's where I found it okay okay astronauts could breathe oxygen okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Take a look at the second paragraph of the article. What machine did NASA said that they use to discover the water?,,,,
Luis,210.4,NASA sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, perfect. So then after they use the Lunar Orbiter. What did they use to look at the water?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Look at the third paragraph.,,,,
Luis,210.4,That means that the moon is drier than the driest desert on the earth.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Jazmin, you said that they use a small machine. So great job, recalling that they sent the small machine to discover the water on the moon. Do you remember what the name of the machine was called?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,I don't remember.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You don't remember. Okay, that's totally fine. Let's look at the passage and see, just like with Luis Let's look at the second paragraph.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,NASA sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And then, do you remember what the other",,,,
Teacher,210.4,The other thing they use the other equipment that they used to see the water?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Alright, let's look at the third paragraph. So they had to look very closely at at it because it was so tiny. Right.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,I don't understand why my answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Look at the third paragraph.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"I just read it, Jazmin. If you are listening.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So can you - before they found the water, what did they use to find it?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So they found the water and used the microscope to use - to see the water because it was so tiny. But what did they do to find it? Do you remember?,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Well, it's the same thing that Chris said, right?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And Farrah. So you said the scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Do you remember the second machine?,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Yeah, because everybody said it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,In the reading it did state clearly what kind of tool um or excuse me what the name of the small machine is Do you remember the name of the small machine.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Remember the name of it, no.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So if scientists are using a tool called a microscope. What does that tell us about this stuff on the moon that they're looking at,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"It tells us that it tells us that it's really small, like, whatever it is, because it says it's microscopic",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Exactly. And so we know the word microscopic means what,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Really small.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Luis have you used a microscope before?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, so the small water. What else do you think scientists use microscopes to look at it doesn't have to be on the moon. You can think about things. Maybe you've used a microscope.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Oh yeah. No, I totally we've done that before and science, like we've looked at like the plant like cells and stuff like that. So yeah, I've seen lots of stuff with microscopes.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Exactly. Because plant cells are also really small, like the water on the moon that Oliver mentioned.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Wow, that's a great connection Chris, because we are talking about scientists, but there's also many other occupations and jobs that people do were like doctors who use microscopes.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah. And then after that it also talks about small ice deposits, which then",,,,
Teacher,210.4,You have to actually get to the moon before you actually discover the water on the moon.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Yeah. Yeah, exactly.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Can you be a little more specific. What, what was the machine called, what they do.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And what did the machine do, what is used for?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"You mean the lunar orbiter, it's how they discovered the water",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"They do, but what are we using to get the water and to see what's going on?",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Oh. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So that's an example of what they used in specifically to find the water and to see what's going on because the goal of this question is how we're identifying the water on the moon. Because remember, they didn't know if we had any, and then they found it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But do you know-- like Farrah said the microscope, do you know why they use a microscope from the text?",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well, when she read it, it said to look at it really closely.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yeah. Do you know why they have to look at it so close?,,,,
Chris,210.4,"No. No, I don't know.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So it's because there's so little water that they need to look at it so close.,,,,
Chris,210.4,Yeah. I got to explain more. I got to see more.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So in the third one. It's talks about the water they found is microscopic.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So they use both. So they use the Lunar Orbiter to look for the ice deposits in the craters, and that's where they could find The water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So they had to use the microscope to look really really closely out that so they use them both.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Interesting. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Finding the water it's how they found it so they needed the microscope to find the water, because they had to look very closely at it and they needed the Lunar orbiter to find the water because that's where they used to find the.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,so can someone tell me what is what sticks out within that sentence.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Can someone tell me what sticks out to them in that sentence?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So I know that a lot of you guys did mention being able to use a microscope. So now, what's something where something that stands out in that sentence.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"All right, well, if you look at the story, you see in the second paragraph, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. That would be considered another piece of equipment that NASA used.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,OK. OK. Explain my thinking. OK.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And I also think that equipment is mentioned in the passage So when I want you guys all to do individually, I want you guys to look at the passage the moon, is a desert.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"a microscope have some study the water and helps them look at it, but the microscope itself did not get it all the way up to the moon okay.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, so they like.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And let's look at moon water found could be useful in other ways, water can be broken down into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen, which is where I think.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So um Jazmin, can you tell us the name of the machine from paragraph two?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,I read it it's the Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, so what we know that the ice deposits are very, very tiny, so I lunar orbiter is just another word for a microscope but it's more it's a more specific word for a microscope right.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"I didn't even realize that was that was the same thing, like a micro a lunar orbiter is a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so let's go back back into the text and find some evidence to include in our answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So Jazmin remember, we said that we use a lunar orbiter on the moon, but a microscope could be used for anything.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, that makes a lot of sense that you put those two together. But what paragraph three says is that the water that they found is microscopic.  And that you would need a microscope to look really closely to see that. So if you can look at, paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate to discover the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, you're right. It does. It does. The lunar orbiter was used to investigate to look for ice deposits and the big craters that are on the moon, but the ice deposits are very small. So they use a bigger they use the machine to find the ice and then the microscope would be used to actually see it to see the water. They didn't use it to discover the water",,,,
Oliver,210.4,Okay. They use a microscope to see the water but not to discover the water,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So they so let's talk as a group. So they use a small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate and they're investigating these these craters on the moon. Right.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And they're looking for ice deposits, but the ice deposits are very small. So the amount of water that they find is going to be very small. Right.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So then, in paragraph three, what does it tell us that they use it that they needed to us to look at to see these very small deposits of water.",,,,
Chris,210.4,Um the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, the microscope. So the first piece of equipment that they're using what's called what",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Lunar Orbiter. And the second piece of equipment was called what,,,,
Farrah,210.4,The microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"In the article, if you could go back and look, when they used the microscope, they get and use the microscope to find the water. The microscope would be used to see the water because the amount is so small.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Excuse me, Miss Brown?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,They did. NASA did use a small machine. Can you tell me what that small machine was?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. A lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Now when they discovered the water on the moon, did they discover large amounts of water or just little teeny, tiny amounts of water?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,I don't know.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"If you look at paragraph 3, it says the water they found is microscopic. And that means that you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking right at it. But Farrah told us that the article says that in order to see the water, we would need what, Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,A microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"A microscope. So Jazmin, they use the lunar orbiter to discover the water. And in order to see the water, they would need to use a microscope. So how many types of equipment were mentioned in our article?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,The microscope and the lunar orbiter?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And what does the article tell us about why water on the moon would be valuable?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Awesome. Yep, so smart. So why would it be helpful if it can be broken down into two parts? What could those things-- what could oxygen and hydrogen be used for? What do we use oxygen for?",,,,
Chris,210.4,To breathe.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So breathing would be a good use for the oxygen. What about the hydrogen?,,,,
Chris,210.4,I don't know what we use hydrogen for.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I have to read too because I don't know what we use it for. So we could do it together. So paragraph 5 says that water can be broken down into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen. Astronauts could breathe the oxygen. And oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel. Do you guys see that?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And what did they say was the problem with water and carrying water on the spacecraft?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Does the article tell us that water is light, or is water heavy?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Is says water is heavy.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Water is heavy. So taking a lot of water in the spacecraft to the moon, it would be a lot of weight. And it would take up a lot of space, right?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,The article tells us that there might be some problems with doing research for finding out why the water-- a convincing argument for why this would be useful. What does it tell us that the problems could be? What's the issue with the research? It's at the very end of the article.,,,,
All,210.4,MUMBLING,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So in paragraph 6 it tells us that scientists would need to come up with a plan for getting the water out of those big craters, and that making the plan, it would take a lot of time. And it would take a lot of money. They would have to do a lot of studying on the moon's surface. And they would have to build new equipment. So if NASA didn't have the money or the manpower or the equipment, those things could be a problem.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"We need to drink water. And I feel like if the astronauts were on the moon, and they get thirsty, then they do want to be able to have some water to drink, right?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Exactly, it's divine something. So did they use the microscope to find the water in the first place. Do you think",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Or maybe they use something else.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Good. And do you know what that small machine is called,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,NASA sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Teacher:. Does anybody remember where they found the water?,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Yeah, that was part of my answer. They found the craters of water and the craters were full of water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"OK, so the if you read on, in the second paragraph, it talks about how the craters were in  Deposits of ice.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And ice is really hard to get through. Right, so the water wasn't just clear and streaming and flowing",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So the ice is something they needed to get through to get to the water get through the crater to get to the water in the ice.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah. So what do you remember what it's called with right back into paragraph two,",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh yeah, um, I will, I will answer. Yeah, a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,It can be water can be broken down into two parts. The hydrogen in the oxygen. Can you read the next sentence and tell us why is that important that it can be,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Broken down into two parts, because now we have this hydrogen and oxygen. Why does that matter though to keep reading and see if you can find anything else.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Okay, the next sentence says",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"There you go, and is breathing important",,,,
Luis,210.4,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You see, right, especially when you're in space when there is an oxygen. It's great. You could get the water right there, split it up and have oxygen to breathe.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"What else do we use water for that talks about in paragraph four,",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Drinking,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Drinking water is important, right, do we need that to survive.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,We do. Right. So if the water is already there. The astronauts don't even need to worry about bringing as much or Storing as much on their spacecraft. They'll happen. They'll know it's there.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So then they maybe they can stay longer and do other things such as grow gardens, there are just explore and see what else they can find so that's awesome.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Because it does say that it's going to take a lot of time and money to see if they could do these things.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So thinking about such as using the water for oxygen is there evidence that we can break down water into oxygen and hydrogen into two parts?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, so that there's some evidence behind that and we breathe in oxygen, there's evidence of that. Correct.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,Definitely.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So those are things we all have our own opinions, but those are things that you can prove to be true.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Wonderful. Alright, so we have three different many paragraphs at the top. Can I please have someone be volunteer.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,To tell me what they think the main idea is for the main point of the first paragraph is,,,,
Teacher,210.4,The textual evidence that says the scientists found water on the moon. And when you found that and underlined it,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Whoever finds it first can raise their hand and read back to me the exact words in that first point, the talks about scientists mining water on the moon, and we'll see if we agree with Chris.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Everyone can review it in front of them. And then when you're ready, raise your hand and tell me what you think the main idea is in the second paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, okay microscopes are really helpful for letting us see things up close.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Let's talk about specifically what equipment they use to discover water, especially can we go back to the text and look at a place where it mentions discovering water.",,,,
Chris,210.4,Okay yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Can you reread paragraph two, for me, and see if you can find any other answers.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Like out loud or just on my own.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Who was doing the discovery in the question.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Um the scientists,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And the answer, you'll find is in the text.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Do you think you could try to Read the question and maybe look at the text.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Yeah, so the question is what equipment that scientists do stuff discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, in this story that we read",,,,
Luis,210.4,"In the story,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Totally because if if you ever get a question which might happen again and other classes or places you a question. And there's a text there. The text is probably very important,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, small that works. Does the machine have a name?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Yet it's called the Lunar Orbiter and it looks for ice deposit in the polar craters.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, there's actually another piece of equipment in there.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Could you maybe look at that piece of equipment too just so I know that you can find an answer in a text.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,And another one? The microscope. That's not it?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Can anyone explain how they did that.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Whoo. Does anybody know what that machine is called,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Oh yeah, I know this. I know this event. Um, it's the",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right now, I want you guys to take one second, just give her the text and fake. I want you guys to take a minute to skim through the text and to think about what you think the main idea of this text was",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Can anyone tell us what this orbiter Did?  someone we haven't heard from yet.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Can you explain to us, or is the function of the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes. Great. So, you know, wish and use a microscope to look closely on the water right but we can find the water first, and then, then we can look at the water closer later.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh, so before they can use the microscope. They have to use something else.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh, you have a problem here. Can you explain more about the small machine, what tell us more about what the machine is. I mean, what did the scientist call the small machine?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Let me see. NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Maybe it was through the thing about the questions, the scientists used the microscope or to discover water or observing the water left out. Do you think of which one to",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Well, I guess it's true observe",,,,
Teacher,210.4,and so please go back to the meat of the passage and see what a specific equipment is listed there. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, so did you'll find a place in the passage, you can do that.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well, I went to NASA. So I know scientists use a lot of equipment actually like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Teacher : Yeah, so it says it's microscopic so although microscope or microscopic start with the same beginning they mean two different things. So microscopic means it's really small,",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Well,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Teacher : Would you like to reread the article?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,I have a question.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Teacher : Did you hear the name of the equipment that they used this can go to anyone.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Teacher : Awesome. So let's read. Number three, so that we can kind of make an understanding of this. So that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Teacher : Is the water on the moon, big or small.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,It's definitely small.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Teacher : Right, so it's small, so it's saying. It's very small. And what does a microscope do",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Well, it lets you look at things that are really small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Teacher : Right. So, let us look at things that are really small. So do you think we could look at the water that's really small.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Well yeah, I think.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Teacher : Right, so where in the article. Do you see a sentence that starts with NASA sent",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Okay. And part two. I'm. Oh, oh man, oh I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to lunch, but",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right. What was that small machine name. Do you remember,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know. It's the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So you talked about the small machine that they used and what did they use that machine to do,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But so Chris and Jazmin, so that they found the two tools of equipment right so",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so let's look at both pieces of equipment. So the was the microscope. Did it help find the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Awesome. So you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water they found on moon right,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Luis Can you summarize what the paragraph said,,,,
Luis,210.4,"I'm the one that Luis read. I mean, the one that Chris read",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"What did NASA do. How about that, who can answer that first question.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So what did the, what was the first thing they did in that first sentence.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right. It says they sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate. So that was step one.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So we know that NASA found Ice deposits that were very small, but the first way that they found or the first step in defining that was sending a small machine there.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,That's what I said for my answer.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So the moon is so the water that they found. I'm sorry, the water is microscopic so it's tiny. And they even explain to us, it means that you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it. So what was the scientific tool needed to see something so small.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Well, it was a microscope. That was my answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So the equipment that the scientists used included a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And microscopes to investigate the small tight, the smallest or I'm sorry, the water that was found this tiny",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Oh, okay. So even though they didn't use it on the moon. It was like, they still had to use it like later.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"What do we think is the first piece of information that should what should go first, the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So let's see, paragraph number two, where we found out about the lunar orbiter that Jazmin's discussing",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Hmm. So I the text actually doesn't really give us that much information as far as how the lunar orbiter would have been able to find the tiny water. However, it does say that",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Um, so the text doesn't imply that the astronauts went to the moon. Right. So, so I'm looking at, paragraph two, right now it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So it doesn't necessarily say that any astronauts went there, however, that small machine was still necessary because that's what found The ice deposits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So that's what actually found the small little water so that I can and I found that information from the second sentence. This lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and the large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, so then with the microscope in paragraph three, it's suggesting that the scientists were using the microscope When they were examining it back here on Earth.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So we're in the process to reread it,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, I want you to skim the text and let me know which Equipment. In particular, they used to discover to make this discovery.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Paragraph two NASA sent to be small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yep, so you, you didn't find out and learn that the microscope was used for a different purpose of studying the water right. It wasn't used to discover the actual water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,but on what I'm going to do now is I'm going to read out loud.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,The three facts that are out on our paper called the water on the moon. And I want everyone to be listening.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Water on the moon, because in these three facts that I'm going to read out there will be some answers in there. So I want everyone to put on their listening ears to listen to the five figure out",,,,
Teacher,210.4,They did so once they actually found the water. Then they use the microscope to see it. So they needed to use a machine first to actually find the water and then they use the microscope to actually look at the water. Does that make more sense.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"It's like first the lunar orbiter goes and that's how they know it's there. And then, and then use a microscope to like study it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Do you know we just read about it. You want me to read it again.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"I think we know it's, um, well, it's an orbiter. So I guess that means like it goes around the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh yeah, I think that it goes around the moon and it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Was my answer my answer was that the scientists, they found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh, okay. So which one if you read further which one is used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Um, in that sentence. It goes on to describe what this lunar orbiter does. Can you read through that and then tell me what the lunar orbiter does",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, I'm really sorry I we have to go. But I just wanted to say thank you so much for listening to why we got our answers, instead of just like telling us that our answers were wrong, that really made us feel like like you really heard every single one of us.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So now what I want you to do is look through the text where it says where it talks about discovering water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I see. But what was, what was this water like, was it like like a cup of water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Or like, What state was this water found in?",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Oh, I know the answer to this one. I know.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah so wasn't just water. So here on earth you might find like giant lakes, full of water, but on the moon. It was ice.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So the reason that we're thinking about the microscope is because the water on the moon was microscopic,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So when you think of microscopic. What do you think,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh, like so tiny. You can't even see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah. So if we're thinking about the water found on the moon. Are we thinking about, like,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Are we thinking about, like, huge craters filled with water.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"I heard what Chris said, but I don't think he was right. I think, I think it was awesome. Chris said full of water, but",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah. So even though we're on the moon these ice deposits were in a big crater, but the ice deposits are little",,,,
Teacher,210.4,When you find when you think of this like small machine and you're finding the ice.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, that's fine. Let's look a little bit closer at the reading. So I'm going to direct you to one part of the paragraph, not the paragraph. The, the exerpt and then we're gonna look at it together and see what we can find. Okay.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Sure.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so the part that I'm going direct us to is",,,,
Teacher,210.4,The second paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Where it says, NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,In this paragraph. What do you think it talks about what's the main thing.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Well, I guess it talks about",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So when we picture craters. We just picture like giant things,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Good. Did they give a name for what the machine was called,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Wow. And do we know what craters are,,,,
Chris,210.4,They're like big on the kind of hard to describe. But it's like it's like a whole but with a bottom and it's above ground instead of underground. I don't know. They're hard to describe.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That was a great description. Yeah, I'm looking in the text now and I see that it describes craters as dark places where the sun never shines.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh yeah, that's a good description too",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So if we look back in our text. Maybe someone can read from the text. If you have it handy line that would indicate what equipment was used for science to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So do you think maybe they sent this machine to investigate and then once they found the water, they were able to use a microscope to see the tiny pieces of water that like it. The text says if you look straight at it, we wouldn't be able to see it.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"So you're saying like they use thought the lunar orbiter first. After that, on the astronauts to use the microscope, just see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That is kind of funny. So I'm Luis is right. It says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. Do we see anywhere in the text that it says that there was an astronaut present",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I don't see that either. I think that um Chris, you were absolutely right that if an astronaut got sent",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"To look at the moon, they would definitely need the appropriate protection to be able to do so. But now that I'm reading the text just like Luis said I din't pick up on this before either.  It doesn't look like There was an astronaut.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,That article had a lot of detail about what that's all machine was and maybe how it helped to discover the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Before they even got to look at the water they needed a sense of if there was water and so they sent something into the moon or on to the moon to help them discover that water,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So the first thing that the scientists did was investigate, they needed to investigate the Moon before they could even go in and see anything else.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So I think maybe our first step would be to think about what scientists did to prepare themselves what scientists knew or didn't know before they got to the Moon before they got some use a microscope to look at their water. Yes. Chris.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Yeah, okay. So I went to NASA. So I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but also masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So it does say the word astronaut and it says that water could be valuable for astronauts if there were astronauts present because they could drink that water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, but let me ask you a further question. Could they just send a microscope to space and find water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Or do you think that they need some sort of machine to discover the water.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Is this about like how there's no astronauts.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, so if we refer back to the text I do see your point about them needing a microscope in order to see the water, but before they get a microscope. They use some sort of other equipment.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Jazmin was talking about that machine that looked in the craters.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So we know that they needed the microscope to analyze it and to better see it but they needed something to help them  Understand if they're even was water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes. And so, Oliver, did they send astronauts. Do we see that they said they sent astronauts in the text.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"No, no. So what did they send",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Um, so it has to be that Lunar Orbiter. Yeah, I thought I was the microscope to Farrah, but now I changed my mind.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,But first we needed to even understand if there was water on the moon. And so that machine that lunar orbiter that we talked about helped us to understand if there was water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I want you to think of how, what is the processes that scientists go through to get to the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Once scientists are on the moon. They use more equipment even more to make more discoveries,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So I want you to think of what a scientist does throughout all of the processes.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And think of what different kinds of tools. He uses,,,,
Oliver,210.4,Okay. You want me to take some time and think about it or just try to tell you right now.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But there's a certain Tool and I want us to go back in the text and find where it says, um, that we use a certain that scientists use a certain tool or a piece of equipment, um, to investigate the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"you do need a microscope to find the part, the particles of water that they found  Because it was so microscopic that you needed a microscope to see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, I'm NASA did send a small machine. Do you remember what that small machine was called",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Can you go back and yeah maybe if you finish that sentence. You might be able to bring us to the right answer. Can you read that out loud for us, where",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That was what was used, so that they could discover the water when they wanted to observe the water further that was when like Farrah said they used a microscope. But when we go back and read the text. It was the lunar orbiter that was used to to discover that water. Yes. Chris.",,,,
Chris,210.4,When I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So if we go back and the text. Let me go back,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Number three, paragraph three, the last sentence says you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. So that is one scientific tool that would be used if you wanted to look really closely at the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Can someone identify the name of that small machine.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Who can tell me the name of the small machine that NASA sent to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Now they didn't use a microscope to discover the water they use it after they discovered the water to look more closely at it. But the question is asking what equipment was used to discover the water and that's where it gets tricky.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Because we might think it could be the microscope, because that's another equipment that's thrown into the text right but that equipment was used only after the water was discovered.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Because the moon is is really dry. It's like the driest desert on earth we only have very small microscopic amounts of water that was found on the moon. So,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, yes. I'm sorry. It is a microscope is used to view things that are small so being that water. I'm the components of water so small you need a microscope to see.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, thank you for sharing that information but in a connection to the text and the question.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,We have to think about the equipment that is used to discover water on the moon. That is true. They do use a lot of equipment.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,But to identify the water they use a microscope,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Okay, so since since story didn't talk about those things, then it's not the right answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And what about water on the moon. What's going on with this water.,,,,
Chris,210.4,So there are these craters full of water on the moon and the scientists discovered it because they used to think there wasn't water but now they know that there is,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yes. And what could the hydrogen,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh, I know there's, I know there's, I know there's, I know this.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Alright, and Oliver I see you circled the same as well, so we can address both of you, together here, so can Farrah, can you tell me what does a microscope do.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Okay, well, a microscope and helps you see things that are really, really small and in the story except the water was really, really small microscopic.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, that's an excellent point I think here in the text, what they did was they first found the water and they could see the water and then to look even close even a little bit closer they they had to use the microscope okay.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Okay okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,because the text does tell us that they found the water in the craters.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"In order to see the water, you have to see. You have to use a microscope. Okay. Because they find this water, it has too tiny that we can, we have to use this micro me with this microscope. So that's a good point there.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,but can you remember how that small machine was called?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,And let me look,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, that's it. That's the thing that they send and then in the beginning to discover water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So that was it. The first thing that they send, and when they discovered this, I let me see the number.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"When these discovered this tiny water. Then after that, they use the microscope carries and being",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh, oh, so they had to, they had to send the lunar orbiter first to find it. And then they had to use the microscope to see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, just see this tiny water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,In the reading these doesn't mention that they sent astronauts. They send that they just sent the Lunar Orbiter to find this water and the lunar orbiter is a robot. A robot doesn't need oxygen to survive.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Yeah, that's really causing me see. Wow. So it was just a robot. And it was able to go around the moon and and find the water for them.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, it was able to explore or the craters around it, then the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And find these little amount of water in there.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Well, I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but I just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand the text on such a such a deep level like",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"First of all, let's think about these texts. Okay. And let's think about the main ideas of these texts. Okay. So can you tell me where are the main idea of this text.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well, so I think the main idea of the story is that",,,,
Teacher,210.4,But so the you have another thought about what could be another main idea of this text.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,I offer one,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so what is the other subtitle that we can discuss about",,,,
Oliver,210.4,I don't know.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What is the other main idea that we can learn,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, I'm talking about. So what do you think about that.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Well, actually I'm still a little confused about the first part.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So can you tell me what is it, what is in the microscope for",,,,
Farrah,210.4,It's to look really closely at really small things.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yeah. And also we use microscopes to observe and to analyze right,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, so maybe the microscope we didn't they didn't use a microscope to discover water, but maybe they use the microscope to observe to analyze the water after they discovered that water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So we have to think about another equipment before that helped them to discover water since the beginning. Chris.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Yeah, so I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Can someone remember what is the specific name of this robot?,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Yeah, I know. That's one. It's the lunar orbiter Jazmin. Come on.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Okay so they found  this equipment to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So when they discover water on the moon. What happened next. What is the next step when they discovered these ice deposits in the craters?,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Next step, like so, after they after they find the water in the craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah. After that, they have to. They have to make an observation. Right. And how can you observe this water and someone told me what is another woman on maybe they can, they, they will need to observe this water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, the microscope. So can you tell me what is the main. Um, what do you use the microscope for?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Well, I thought, who was the answer to the question about, about what they use to discover the water. I guess I'm not quite sure why.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"When you think of a desert. Do you think of what do you think, what do you see",,,,
Chris,210.4,All like like lots of sand as far as the eye could see. And the sun beating down really hard and like cactuses and stuff.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yeah I noticed that you didn't. You didn't mention any water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yeah. So what do you think that it's doing once it finds those ice deposits,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Don't really know because I know that it looks for them, but I don't really know what it does. Next, I don't think it's",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, it doesn't say that. But if we read between the lines that I'm the machine is sent to go and look for them and then they're able to look at them underneath the microscope. What do you think that might mean",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Maybe they're studying it.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, can you two reread the second paragraph and see if that changes your answer.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Yeah okay, we can look at it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, in order to see it, you would need to but first they have, they have to find the sample to look at. So we're focusing on how they found the sample.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Can you find some evidence about how they found that first sample?,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, I, I don't see the word sample on in the story, but it talks about the",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Yeah. So how did they find those ice deposits,,,,
Oliver,210.4,Okay um they the lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Can you now take a look at the passage and see what that small machine that you brought up when you first. Then, what, what was that doing was that maybe discovering something be able to",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Come, I'm so sorry. But, um, it's, it's actually time for us to go now. But before. Before we go, I wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to listen to us and help us understand the importance of the word discover for our answers.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Um, I wanted to ask you to dive deeper into what would be required for their to find water on the moon. What exactly makes it be so expensive and take so much time for them to get the water on the moon. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,I wanted to clarify with you to what other functions of water are there.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And to find the evidence that it would make it worthwhile for them to mine for the water on the moon. Um, what other functions, water has",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Yeah, I got one. I got one.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,But we're looking for. This is this specific name of that machine. Does anyone remember what that's called.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And can someone remind me exactly what a lunar orbiter does. So like you said. They said the small machine. What did they use it for just. Can you guys just remind me.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, that's a great point. So the lunar orbiter is in helping investigate. So that's actually a great connection you made because since the water so microscopic maybe us humans can't see it. So we need to use that piece of technology to find the water",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Does anyone remember. Where's the, where's the water exactly on the moon. What part of the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So yes, that they're in these big craters. The large polar craters, but the so the ice deposits are in the creators. So",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It's very, very, very small. So we need to use that scientific tool called, like you said, a microscope to look at the water really closely.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Go ahead. Well, I went to NASA. And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So, they, they, the scientists, they go into the moon and they use the Lunar Orbiter to find the the water which is in the craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And then there's a microscopic amount of water, super, super, super, super small. So again, great. Like, what Farrah their first answer using the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"They need to use a microscope to be able to see the water, the small amounts of water. So again, if you if you're thinking about now going forward. When you think about the climate of the moon. Think about a desert. The, the text itself. Said that the moon is drier than the dry desert on Earth.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So even if you think as a moon because it's in space as like dark and it might look different than the desert. It feels like a desert. So when you think of like the feeling of the moon. Think of that. That's something that can help you remember this information.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, it's that so it said that if we're reading the text it says the water they found is very microscopic microscopic means small right?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, so it says. It says it will you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So we need to look at that word discover, and you wouldn't be able to get to the water, unless you had this Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,That was in that was in lunar craters. I think someone mentioned that great piece of information.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And the water is microscopic it's so small that they might even need a microscope to find that water. So even when they got there with the Lunar Orbiter. They might have had to use a microscope, because there's such small amounts of water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Was there any other equipment that was used in the text.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Um, well, I mean, when I was looking at it. I did see they they talked about the machine and in paragraph two,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, tell me a little bit more about that machine that you read about",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh, okay. It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will end at the South Pole and look for ice deposits or large pool of crater. These two positives, very small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"and see the exact name like if anybody can help me find the exact name of the machine that they use to detect the water, how you talk over it for about two minutes.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,See um well I do see that the size of the water they found was actually microscopic but.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"they're both part of the equipment that was used see yeah yeah because you need the microscope to see the water, since it was so small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"and now, what about you Luis did you, you know learn anything new from this paragraph, I know you love space, but you know.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah cool and how are you deaf did you, you know have anything that you learned from this paragraph and maybe anything about the equipment that scientists use.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"On your so well, I said the same thing I said about the microscope and I guess i'm just not quite sure why you need to have both on.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah well that's you know I think that's kind of like the bigger question here, I think the orbiter was part of the first step, they had the thought I wonder if there's water on the moon, they sent the orbiter to kind of you know.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Just do the initial discovery or initial I guess investigation and then the microscope was really what cinch the deal, and what.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You know they looked really closely once the orbiter got the larger body of evidence that there could be water, so I think they you know they both work together.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"and Chris, looking at the text, can you explain what the Lunar orbiter did?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"cool so that's kind of, what do we think class? that's kind of the first step. So there seems like there's two steps to this right? there's first the investigation period with the Lunar orbiter and.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Jazmin can you explain what the microscope did like what they use the microscope to do in this process.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"For this one, I mean I know what we use it for in science class.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oliver, can you kind of explain - it seems like there's two parts, Do you kind of see what i'm saying here there's two parts to this with the Lunar orbiter and the microscope. Can you explain to the class, you know how those two work together?",,,,
Oliver,210.4,Okay um so what you said is that um.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,The potential uses of water? Was that exciting? or like did you think it would be useful if there was water on the moon?,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Well mean I think any place that there's water would be good, because people always get thirsty and they want to drink stuff.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Did you think of could you think of any reasons besides just drinking that the water like looking at the text that water on the moon could be helpful.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Wait um so teacher, I didn't I didn't write the microscope or the Lunar orbiter in mine so.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So they actually yes look let's look back at the text together the ice deposits are very small so so I guess you did say that the they found craters full of water, and there the text says that there was actually very small ice deposits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"and actually the total quantity of water on the top layer of the moon's surface is only about the equivalent to the amount of water, you or I would drink in a day, so you know actually I like the spirit, you know you tried to answer the question, but unfortunately.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,and it says that there's it's drier than the driest desert on earth so yeah.,,,,
Chris,210.4,Um,,,,
Teacher,210.4,A moon crater you know those are deep craters but they only found a small quantity of water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And I know they might have used a lot of other equipment to get there right but was there a specific piece of equipment that helped them make that discovery.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well, I mean the thing Jazmin was talking about sounded pretty good.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah can you remind me what that was called.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,awesome yeah was that what they used to discover the ice as a water.,,,,
Chris,210.4,um well I guess so.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay um in the text, what did they What were they using the microscope for?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Well, they were using it to see because the water were these, I think the word microscopic type like little ice crystals they couldn't see it with just like the naked eye, so they had to see it in the microscope, because it was so small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so NASA send a small machine. What was that machine called?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,It was the Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah and what was the purpose of that machine, so we had a small machine, it was called the Lunar orbiter What did it do what was the purpose of it?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"I thought the Lunar orbiter was what found the water like that's to me like when I read that that that text really closely, it looks like they use the Lunar orbiter like maybe a sensor or something on it to find the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so when the scientist on the water we talked about that one word that was in the article that we read um that describes the water. Can someone tell me what that word was again? there was one word that described the water -how how much water there was. Yeah, Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"um well, it said that there was um well first off that the water was microscopic so like you could only see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,um so they found a very small amount of water right like um they found a very like a microscopic amount of water that they needed to use the microscopes then to look at right?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"The ice deposits in the moon were very small right, so we can tell that um it said in the text and didn't it say? Can someone actually answer this for me in the text, when we were reading it um What did it say anything about the amount of water that was on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, a lot of dirt and not a lot of water right um so Harrsion definitely and there's not a lot of water, we can see that but can someone describe how the water",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Why did they need a microscope, why do they need a microscope what was the the property of the water that made them need to use a microscope yeah Farrah",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,so you said that they have a small that they're using a small machine but,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So when we think about lunar as like an adjective as a descriptive word that's like basically of the moon, and then does anyone know the definition of orbiter or orbit can anyone share that with me.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Oh yeah up I got this one I bought this one, we talked about it on orbit means to like on to go around something like the planets orbit the sun, because we go around it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Exactly exactly so when we combine those two things we're talking about something that goes around the moon right, so that is the equipment that NASA send or scientist sent to the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And it circles around the moon and analyzes data collected at the moon now one other item here, you know that that could be a little bit confusing is that so if this piece of machinery is.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Not on the moon surface, how do you guys imagine that it actually was able to analyze dirt on the moon if it's above the ground essentially does anyone know that Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Well, I guess, I don't know I guess that's my question because I thought the answer was the microscope but if it's not on the moon, how can they get a microscope there and look at the little water particles.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"When astronauts do go outside of their spaceships they do need to utilize that equipment in order to you know, be able to breathe effectively in space because there isn't enough oxygen to breathe.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And so you know, going back to how we found out that you are found evidence that there's water on the moon, is that you know they actually.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Implemented a really interesting strategy, they basically threw a piece of the Atlas rocket at the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah they did, and this caused a big crash.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That sent a plume of dust 10 miles into the atmosphere from the moon surface and then, as we talked about that lunar orbiter it's in the air, you know circling the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And it was able to collect or analyze the dirt from that plume, and this is where your points Farrah comes in.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Which is where they're based basically able to take that dirt and analyze the dirt where they found that there's a 5% water content in that dirt so that's where the microscope comes into play.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,That microscopes not on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You know, to Chris's point utilize you know the oxygen equipment, because it wasn't actually astronauts that were on the surface of the moon collecting that dirt it was the Lunar orbiter the equipment and the Oliver what's up.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock and.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh, my gosh yes you're absolutely right so.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,But it's tiny right and it's actually in the soil within the craters so you couldn't see it if you were just looking at it you'd need the scientific equipment to analyze it more closely.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You wouldn't even know that it was there, why because it's microscopic and it's actually mixed within this soil and that really goes back to.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,you'll find that water inside the soil so it's actually invisible to the human eye and so okay yeah go ahead Chris.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"yeah we'll talk about that, like the microscope and stuff um I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Exactly, so there is not enough oxygen for us to breathe without oxygen tanks on the moon, and that actually brings up a fantastic point about.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,can anybody share with me what water can be broken down into this was in the article yep go ahead Oliver.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So they use a not use a little.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Water and moon by, but you can only look at in the human eye, so we just go look at your day I we weren't able to see it and.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Very scientific tool to.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah so that's quite I mean they use a lot of tools and then my my machine and then microscope or those still thanks to particle to find a water on them.,,,,
Chris,210.4,yeah I I bet they need a lot of different tools to to find the water probably probably more than one right.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"before they found that water What were they what tools, were they using to look in try to get that water out of the ground.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah it doesn't necessarily say anything about astronauts, but it is a lot more fun to kind of imagine that there was astronauts in there up there.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And I think when we hear the word NASA we our minds automatically are like Oh, we can think of the scientists and the scientists in spacesuits right that's what I think of at least I think of an astronaut.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But lately, especially NASA has been using a lot of other tools and a lot of the other equipment, like some of the other things that we were talking about and the small machines, the Lunar orbiters Jazmin that you helped us find.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And they have been able to send those things in space, instead of just people.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You don't know so i'm going to read you guys, paragraph three, and then I would love to hear you guys I would love to hear if you guys think that the microscope was used to help find it or maybe to discover it.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Okay well in paragraph three, they do use the word found it says All water they found was microscopic.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, that is very true so that the word microscopic is a little bit different than the word microscope right, so the water they found is super tiny, and if they want to see it, they would need to look really close with a microscope right.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,Oh okay okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,The lunar orbiter and what did that lunar orbiter do Chris.,,,,
Chris,210.4,It looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"so friends, what about other than just helping astronauts breathe, what else can hydrogen and oxygen be used for?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"um Oliver and Farrah and Chris you guys read the fourth paragraph right What did you guys think could be useful, there are, what did that tell you about the water.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Okay, well, it says that the astronauts could drink the water um and it says it's the water is heavy I mean I already had that part in my answer.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So I want us to really think about how heavy water can be if water is really heavy and we have to send something all the way out into space Using lots of rocket fuel and we spend lots of money on that do you think it makes sense to try to carry up all of that stuff with us if we already have it on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Do you guys think it would be helpful If we already had if we didn't have to Make rocket fuel here and take it up take extra up with us, do you think it'd be helpful to have it on the moon already too.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"What do we did we learn about water is it super light and easy, can I carry a bunch of water around super easily.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"No, so we know that it's heavy you know what teacher, I was reading that through could be a base on the moon by 2024.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Based on what you read, could you maybe tell me how they found the water, what did they use to find the water.",,,,
Chris,210.4,um I.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"A small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar crater and these ice deposits are very small so based on those couple of sentences Chris, what do you can you tell me what the name of the equipment they used was.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"um well, I think the name I heard was.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah Chris that's exactly right, so that is the machine they send actually was called the l cross mission, but they sent a space to try and discover where the water was on the moon awesome, thank you for sharing that with me Chris, that was a great job let's see Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Okay, so I said something different, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah and so we'll first let's see raise of hands, how many of you have used a microscope before.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah right so in depth, maybe our friend, can you share with you some of their experiences, but like you said Farrah microscopes are used to kind of blow things up and make them larger to our eyes that we can see them.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right and so that is correct it and they needed the microscope to see the water but they had to use something different find the water,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Well, how can you find something if you can't see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,mission that they had what they used was a piece of a rocket and they put that rocket into that piece into the crater which was.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,A big kind of like almost like an explosion of dirt and debris and dust and inside of that puff and cloud of debris and does.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That is where they found the hydrogen and where they found the water, but do you see how they needed that lunar orbiter in order to put that piece inside the crater and then they use the to look even closer and see how much water they bound.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,wow.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"mm hmm and that's what scientists definitely need oxygen tanks, because even what is oxygen and help us do we need oxygen to what.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,to breathe,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"To breathe exactly, and so the question is asking about what the scientists use to discover the water because does anybody know what water is made up this might be a tricky question for some of us.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Are you hearing person what is water, made up of.",,,,
Chris,210.4,Water is H two o,,,,
Teacher,210.4,that's right h2o does anyone know what he stands for.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"yeah yeah it's hydrogen, then the always oxygen because when I I went to NASA and I saw lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Exactly that's exactly right and so that's why they're so excited for this discovery of water, because if they find water, then they can use the hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"to fuel the rockets, or they can use it to help us breathe so Luis that was correct in saying that the scientists they use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You know what I think that's right dead and my research, I actually was able to watch a video about discovering water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So that's where I found that extra knowledge and maybe I could even share that video with you all some time to it seems like something you might be interested in.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But, based on the text right you're right did they did not talk about the food in the text, so if we're looking back at the text and we're really thinking about the question.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah and why did the scientists day to be able to look so closely in this case, does anyone remember reading that.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,yeah I remember.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Well let's get a little bit deeper into that what was the job of that machine once it actually got to the moon yeah Jazmin you can.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"yeah I think it said he investigated, and then it found the ice deposits in the polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"The robot that Jazmin was mentioning for them, the small machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,What tool do they use once they got that small machine on to the moon.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,I I looked at again.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"When you guys read this article, what did you guys think was the most interesting parts of it?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I wonder if we could find out more about what tools it actually used to find the water, right?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right so let's when we go back to the text, the microscope didn't get there on the on its own, and the Lunar orbiter didn't find the water on its own",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Did the did the NASA astronauts just send the microscope up to the moon, on its own?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,No,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah so Jazmin, why was the small machine so important in this example?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Because that's what they use to investigate that's what they use to look for the ice deposits, right?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so in our article that we had, talking about water on the moon, I agree that you would need a microscope if you were to look at the stuff those scientists found. What kind of tool are they using to find that water that we would use a microscope to look at?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Well, I, I guess, I thought the microscope was that tool because um how, how can you find something if you can't even see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I agree that is very difficult, but if we were to find that water right we're looking at the water and we're using a microscope, how do we get the water?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Okay well um paragraph two, it says there's a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Very good what's this small machine called?,,,,
Farrah,210.4,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So we're talking let's look at that microscope right so we're using the microscope to look at the water when our question's asking us how we discover water on the moon, when the microscope is used to dis-",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, can you tell me what a desert is?",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh well, um a desert it's really dry.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right right a desert is really dry, so if we're saying the moon, is a desert, what are we saying there's not a lot of there?",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well, water I guess.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So in this text, we learned that the scientists needed to use equipment on the moon, why do you guys think they needed to use equipment, why couldn't the scientists just look with their eyes or touch with their hands? Go ahead Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"So actually in the text it says the water, because we know that are looking for water is really, really, really, really, really small so they can't just look at it, they need equipment to help them find it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"that's a great idea what type of equipment, do you think they would need to look at water.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Um so me and Farrah um we had the same answer, and it was the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Have you ever used a microscope Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Oh yeah yeah we use them in science class.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah right, so what type of other equipment, do you think they might need to make it a little easier to look at water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Is there something else that they maybe brought?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So coming back to you Farrah so Jazmin helped you out, you pointed out this small machine. Do you think that's something that scientists would be able to use to help with the big suit problem?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"yeah yeah it sounds like the microscope it'd be kind of hard, maybe to hold um and look through with the with the circle last thing that Chris was talking about, so it sounds like they might need another tool instead.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Why would you need a microscope according to that sentence, what are you going to do with the microscope in that one sentence.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"i'm gonna look at really, really small bits of water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so keep going so you were reading, paragraph two, and what do you think the purpose of that small machine the Lunar orbiter is for.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, and then What else does the Lunar orbiter do.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Oh, I know um can I go, can I go.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And what it's investigating is what Luis shared with us from paragraph to sentence to that it's looking for ice deposits in a large polar crater if it's looking for ice deposit, what do you think it's looking for what are ice deposits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So what can the Lunar orbiter help us find.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,Oh so that helps you find the water or really small water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So when I say go you guys are going to pick up your pencils and work by yourself, look back in the text and really make sure that the evidence you put a circle around really has the specific equipment that is needed to find water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,210.4,You do need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so friends in those two sentences what I was looking at the words all around microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And that helped give us something called context um after looking at that context do is sorry, excuse me, does the microscope actually help get water out of the moon.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"And, well, it sounds like that helps someone look for the water and look out for water, because you can't see it without the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Is that actually telling me how they got they were able to see the water or describing how small the water is.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"That explanation makes sense, but they're just describing the water um, but I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Is there a difference between you would need and.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So do you think this piece was written for the scientists or for us to read.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That would be referring to us, we would need a microscope.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So maybe there was another equipment that they used in order to discover the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And what is the Lunar orbiter look for.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"I think Oh, I said I know this Okay, it says it looks for ice deposits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And what is ice.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,The scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"yeah cuz, I think, with what you said, with the part Jazmin read it says NASA NASA scientists war machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Did they use the microscope for discovering the water or is the water so small that if a person had to see it, maybe they would have to use a microscope.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Right right right yeah yeah I heard you talking about that was so valuable for yeah, thank you for reminding me.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And then the sentence after it says this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Now ice, what is ice I guess.",,,,
Luis,210.4,Oh. Um water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,These craters that they talk about these polar craters and it does analyses right in order to see it kind of samples the ground to see if there's any molecules but the machine itself doesn't need a microscope.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,that's really cool I I wish the story said that.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah well um I guess it's implied here that the Lunar orbiter has some sort of technology that is able to investigate and identify water through the ice deposits.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"and they so we're looking for something with NASA right or scientists right, where it says scientists use or NASA used or sent or deployed or something where it says that the scientists are NASA right.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,haha OK OK that's like the part Jazmin read that says scientists sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So we would need a microscope.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,that's really cool and I would love to go to the moon and look at the water and a microscope and I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh, and what is a microscope.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"It it's a tool, a piece of equipment and that's why I picked it for my answer, because it said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,What are some other things you could think of that you might use a microscope for.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Has anyone seen a microscope before.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,Oh yeah we use them in science class in the lab.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And what do you use them for in science class.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Obviously, one time we took a dirt sample outside and then we analyzed it and we looked at under the microscope and we could see so much more than we couldn't we just looked at it with our eyes.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"wow that's awesome and what kind of things, do you think you'd see if you looked at some dirt from the moon, or the water, the frozen water.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,well.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So, going back to the article, and now that we know about the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,What can you tell me about the machine that NASA sent to the moon? The lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh great, and can you tell me more about the ice craters because you have to like I don't know anything about the ice crater so I need you to explain it to me oh.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Okay, let me look at the reading Okay, well, it says that they're really deep and they're really dark.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,But how would you describe an ice crater if.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,I know they're deep their dark they have ice in them.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,but are they like the grand Canyon like deep holes in the ground. What do you think they look like?,,,,
Chris,210.4,Well isn't a crater like a hole but above ground kind of.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah so it's a, it is a hole off the ground, it's kind of elevated.",,,,
Chris,210.4,yeah cuz I went to NASA actually I went to NASA and and when I was there I saw I saw all sorts of equipment that scientists to use like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What else did you learn about the moon from the article.,,,,
Chris,210.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And what is a microscope.,,,,
Chris,210.4,is a tool that we use in science class to look at like teeny tiny things.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And why do you think the people would be looking for water on the moon.,,,,
Chris,210.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,So how do you think you could tie that into what you read in the article.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,I guess that we're looking for water on the moon um.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So NASA sent a small machine, why did they send the machine?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,To look for the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, well, do you think you could tell me what the microscope does?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And how it relates to finding water,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Like Why were they using a microscope to look at the water? What were they were hoping to find?,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Okay, it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at so they needed the scientific tool, called the microscope because the water was microscopic.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Because it's about trying to find water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"yeah well, I mean they use oxygen tanks to breathe, and so they can't look for water on the moon if they can't breathe up there.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Ok, well why do you think they were going there to look for water?",,,,
Chris,210.4,"um I don't know because, at first, I thought it was so that they could like we could live on the moon um but that wouldn't make sense I did I did read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah and what do you need to use to find the water and before you study it with the microscope?,,,,
Oliver,210.4,The small machine that Jazmin said.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"mm hmm absolutely. So how do we, have you ever used the microscope before.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,yeah yeah we have them on in our science classroom.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right that's what i'm thinking like maybe maybe not. So what do you think help the scientists.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And I don't want you to answer it now, I want you to take a second to look through the text again, but what do you think help the scientists be able to see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"How can you how do you get to the point where you can use the microscope right, because if you're just carrying around a microscope looking for all these small things you're gonna be looking for a long time, so we have to look at the text.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,The goal is to pro right so similar to my um NASA with the microscope when they have the microscope It means that they're looking at something very specific right.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But there's a situation there's something that they have to do, prior to that to where it's very broad, so your answer was was.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah exactly and so today you read a text about the Lunar orbiter and, if you look inside the word lunar where do you see.",,,,
Luis,210.4,So yeah it's got all the Lunar thing in it um but I shouldn't even be in this group I know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"cool great so we see the word Luna or moon Thank you Jazmin inside of lunar I also want to think about the word polar craters what word, do you see inside of the word polar.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, and when you hear the word pole what does that make you think of Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,i'm like the North Pole.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"uh huh and so, if we're looking at polar craters on the moon, where are they going to be located.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,Like on the top and the bottom.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"What is it telling us Chris, I appreciate you so much that your hand shoots up right away.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, and what is inside of the creators Chris.",,,,
Chris,210.4,And the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What are we learning from this paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Great so, can you tell me more about what the Lunar orbiter must look like and what it's doing.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Well, I don't really know what it looks like but it sounds like it, it can find that ice in the craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So who is sending the Lunar orbiter when you look at paragraph two,,,,
Chris,210.4,Think it's NASA and oh actually I went to NASA and so I know that scientists who they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What is NASA specifically sending in paragraph to.,,,,
Chris,210.4,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,To do what Chris.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"oh well, I think Jazmin said it goes in the craters and finds the the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Good so i'm going to add that, to my visualization I know NASA which Chris knows so much about.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"That I got a shirt with that picture on it, and everything.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,amazing and an orbiter which i'm imagining looks something like a rocket into one of the polar craters will find water good let's look at paragraph three together.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,The water they found is microscopic hold on i'm going to pause there the water they found who found that water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"In the sentence Farrah read, are the scientists, what are they using the microscope for?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Thank you Jazmin for reading from the text. So now we have two ideas on the table: that it was a microscope or this small machine. What is the small machine called? let's give it a name. Um someone can identify what is the name of this small machine? Luis you have a hand up.,,,,
Luis,210.4,lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Mm-hmm. But before, before you look at the water closely, how did NASA say that they found they could find the water on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Can you think of, can you think of a place in the passage where they talked about going to find the location of the water?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh well, so I guess what i'm thinking is how could you find it if if you can't see.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, so I think they needed to find it by exploring different parts of the moon. Yes Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Well, I I had a different answer and maybe will help Farrah so I said that NASA sent a small machine and so and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Did anyone catch what it was called?,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Um yeah I got it it said, well, I mean you just read it, it says lunar orbiter that's the name",,,,
Teacher,210.4,mm hmm so they use this lunar orbiter to try to investigate and to explore the moon's South pole.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But I think, looking at the passage as a whole, we need to look at what, how they even could get that water sample. So that's why it said NASA sent that machine to try to find evidence of water, through the ice craters.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,Yeah so it's like first they get and find the tiny water with the orbiter and then they look at it with a microscope?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,right they looked at it with the microscope to look closely and learn more about it.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"Yeah I wanted to say so, actually, I went to NASA and I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"so let's listen why don't you jump in Chris is the would you say the moon is dry, or is the moon wet, what do you think.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well, my answer, my answer is a scientist they found craters full of water on the moon so there's definitely water there.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That are there and you're right that they have now very tiny particles of water, they have not found just lots of water in the moon, the moon is one of the driest places in the world.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"yeah yeah my family, we went up on a trip, we went to the grand Canyon and it was really hot there and really sandy on the sand at would blow around and got in your eyes, it was so hot and the sun was beating down, and it was just dry and sand everywhere that you looked.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, I love that you brought the grand Canyon because that's honestly how I picture the moon, sometimes, because the moon, is very dry dry place but, just like the grand Canyon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"When we go there  we dig deep and find kind of the soil and everything to get to that ice, so we can't just use a microscope that had to be some other things for us to be able to get to that place",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Oh okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, you're right right, so we just have to have some extra they can't just like you know, maybe you guys have used microscopes in your class before.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"and so, with the oxygen tanks let's go why would they need oxygen tanks on the moonso let's go back to Farrah what they need oxygen tanks on the moon.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Well, they needed it to breathe.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, you're right you're right they needed to breathe right because they don't have Like the oxygen like we breathe in the air, they don't have that on the moon",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Alright cool so let's think a little bit more about what we read. Who could give me a quick summary of the text? two to three sentences.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, can you tell me how they found it.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Um okay um well, I guess, they had to use some some equipment um like um.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I want everybody to think, and then you're going to get a chance to vote: is it a microscope that found the water on the moon, or is it the Lunar orbiter that found the water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, and Farrah you said it was a microscope can you find a place in the text that tells us it was a microscope that found the water on the moon.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"yeah okay um at the very end, part three, um the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it. you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so i'm noticing Farrah that you are looking to, you're giving us like the definition of the water that they are finding is really, really small, and that is absolutely right.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Is there another place in the story or the text that we found that talks about a scientific tool.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so Jazmin just pointed us to a different part of the text that we can investigate. I want everyone to go back to Part two of the text and this time you're reading those first two sentences to see if that is the name of the tool that found the water. go ahead.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"and as Jazmin pointed out, it said they sent the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it landed on the moon and found some ice deposits, where the water was, right. and then it also talks about, later in the text, the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,and it's and it is saying that the water that they found was really small. so it's just letting us know that it was a small amount that they found. Oliver.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,lovely so can someone tell me what is is made up off.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"All the actually says very clear in the second paragraph, can you so if you circle back to the paragraph to as as NASA sent the small machine and what is that called Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Good and that was the outcome right, we now know that they found water and we now know the water actually exist in the moon, which is really fascinating.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"The answer is located in a paragraph two, and it's not too difficult and because it says NASA send a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate right and.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah and then it was confusing at first, because, as you said, it is a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That I love that question and then what it does, that that's another scientific tool that's another equipment, but they use it to.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And I can tell you that, because it tells you directly in the paragraph to.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And the ice deposits become a water and then scientists said that a ton of top layer the moon surface it hold a total about 32 ounces water, so I know that it is water being found in the moon and and they also use it to drink water and stuff like that okay okay okay.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So what was that small machine called.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,A lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Because what did the Lunar orbiter do.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,It it looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Did you guys watch the movie about how the Lunar orbiter worked.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so Are they really telling us that we need a microscope that they i'm sorry, are they telling us, we used a microscope or are they telling us that the water was so small, we would need a microscope.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"It sounds like it sounds like the second one, but also but also I I went to NASA so I know that that scientists they actually use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"that's I mean you're absolutely both of you are right that it's something that you, you need to use to find something that is very small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But if we look, does it say that the water is on the surface of the moon, or that the water is kind of buried underneath.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, I remember it's in these craters these craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I want you to take just a quick second and read over just the first paragraph of the text again and, if you think of any questions or any parts that seem confusing to you I would love to hear them so just take a minute and scan over just the first paragraph one more time.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Great job Thank you so I noticed in the first paragraph that it talks about craters that's a difficult vocabulary word does someone know what a crater is.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah absolutely a crater is sort of like a whole or a well that might have filled up with water, it sounds like that's what happened in this article.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,It also says that a crater is a dark place where the sun never shines we can learn all of that from just the beginning of our reading about the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So take a look at the second paragraph, read it over again quickly and then we're going to talk about it again.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"We know it's a small machine, but if my machine could be anything, how can we get a little bit of a better idea of what a lunar orbiter is.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Luis Thank you so much for sharing that Luna does mean moon so when you hear the word lunar it's going to have something to do with the moon,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,just like now is the Lunar New Year it's the complete cycle of the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"orbiter just like Luis said, has to do with going around",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"if you look back in your text, you can see that it looks for ice deposits in the crater.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Well, actually I looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, right now, but I wanted to say thank you so much for helping us read and understand the text so carefully and really look back at it and use it to answer the question I was so helpful Thank you so much.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Jazmin could you tell your classmates How was it that they found that there was water on the moon.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Okay well hey they sent the small machine and it investigated.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And Jazmin did the machine which is called the Lunar orbiter, by the way, did that have a microscope on it.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh, oh i'm not so sure no I don't think I don't think it told us in the story.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"They they kind of gloss over the fact that there's a step between the Lunar orbiter orbiting that part of the moon, making contact with that part of the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"What what's that step in between so Farrah, can you tell me how is it that that sample is collected and how we get from you know the Lunar lunar orbiter existing and then being able to look at a sample of the moon under a microscope could you go ahead and tell me that Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Well, I can try it's kind of, I guess, but I guess probably that lunar orbiter it must like take take samples take pieces, maybe of the ice or.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Why is it called the Lunar lunar orbiter, by the way, why, why is it that it's called that you think no it wasn't an article but Luis.",,,,
Luis,210.4,yeah well I definitely got this okay lunar means moon and orbiter means it like it goes around because that's what an orbit is.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,cool that that's exactly the two pieces of equipment that they mentioned in the article So what does the Lunar orbiter do.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"let's let's take a step back Luis What did you get what What did you get from this article what what did this article tell you, especially you know you're our in house space expert.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"For you, you know you were able to maybe fill in some of the gaps that the author of the article left out so give me a sense of what you took away from this article.",,,,
Luis,210.4,um.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, you could you could definitely say that they sent to lunar orbiter to investigate and what exactly why did they have to send the Lunar orbiter what what's the purpose of the Lunar orbiter and what what is it really besides, a small machine.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,The purpose is to find ice deposits in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Chris, how did you feel about this article, and what what sense, did you get from it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You know, being able to leverage and to use the resources on the moon, the natural resources, like the water that was recently found.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"really is something that it's going to that's going to be number one very difficult and number two it's going to be a long time, you know the technology and the science does not exist, to be able to do this yet.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"is there, something else is, is there a reason that it would cost a lot of money, in particular, that you see in the art in paragraph six.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"that's right they don't and and so, since they don't know what would they have to do to be able to get it out.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"that's right that's right and now, so why does that, why does building new equipment How does that tie together to time and money.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Cars it takes a while to build something like I have a whole like Lego house and ship and boat at my house and we're still working on it, because it takes a long time to build thing.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah that's great. in the text, they said that the scientists use a microscope because microscopes are used to look at things that are really, really tiny.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And the water molecules on the moon were really tiny Jazmin I saw your hand go up earlier, did you have something to add.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,um so my answer is NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah they did I remember reading that as well does anybody remember what it was called,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Has anybody heard those words before.,,,,
Luis,210.4,Oh yeah well I definitely have.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Do you know what they mean, you know what lunar means?",,,,
Luis,210.4,uhm lunar means... lunar means the moon,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, it does and what what does something do when it orbits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Exactly yeah it's when something moves around something else kind of in a in a circle usually yeah Farrah do you have something to add.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Well i'm just wondering, I mean I said the microscope so.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So the Lunar orbiter is in space and it uses a telescope or a camera to look for these water particles, but the water particles are microscopic they're really, really tiny, so the scientist has to use the microscope as well, to be able to see them.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Oh okay i'm starting to make a little more sense um yeah so.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah that's a great clarifying question I was a little unclear as well, but from what I understand it sounds like they just use the equipment and to find a water on the moon, and the scientists were controlling it from earth and that so they used",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"the equipment to find the water. They might have been on the space station, or something that was also in space, but it sounds like the equipment did a lot of the work.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"um so I just looked at the clock and it's it's actually time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for being so interested in everything that each one of us had to say it really felt like you valued everybody's contribution, so much so thank you.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Maybe look in your text it says it in the.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Do you see them in in the text where it talks about the kinds of equipment.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"yeah Oliver said it was in paragraph three, and I see Jazmin's in paragraph two.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Very good yeah so we can use the text as a resource to find her answers yeah.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,i'm sorry to interrupt but it's time for us to go so we'll see you next time okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh that's how you thought about it and there was a mention of oxygen in this article again if you guys remember reading the article, the article mentions hydrogen and oxygen. what does that make?",,,,
Luis,210.4,Water!,,,,
Teacher,210.4,so what kind of a.. how did they discover that they'd be requiring a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so now we have the name of the machine and it looks for ice deposits, and can you make a connection to the microscope now Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And it is at maybe and the deposits are optimized on the size of the deposit is microscopic.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right there's water on the moon super interesting and what does that mean? Now that they found water on the moon, what can happen up there?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Or what do scientists think we'll be able to do one day?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, what okay so let's think about a microscope what do we use a microscope to do Farrah you just said it a minute ago but let's repeat it, what do you.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"No, so they definitely use those things but we're trying to find the information from the paragraph, so what other pieces of equipment did they talk about in the paragraph? Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,yeah so they talked about a small machine and that was my answer.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"A small machine will, what was the name of the small machine.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So let's dive in a little deeper about what exactly do they first use to find it, and then they can use the microscope to see it. Why do they need to microscope again?",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, because the ice is so small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,mm hmm so the name of this machine is lunar orbiter.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah great and, what is this machine for?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Well, it says to investigate, so I guess it maybe looks around because that's what investigate means.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah and that's how this little machine, the small machine works right?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"yeah, I guess so, so it looks around the moon and somehow I don't really know how but somehow it finds those those microscopic ice deposits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,What do you think? How the Lunar orbiter helps to find the little ice deposits?,,,,
Farrah,210.4,i'm not really sure I didn't really get that part about the Lunar orbiter. I guess I was still thinking about the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Why don't we look at it all together right now. Chris, can you help us read the sentence about lunar orbiter?",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh yeah I could do that Okay, so it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah it looks into craters. Why do you think we call it an orbiter?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Luis, do you know why they call it an orbiter?",,,,
Luis,210.4,yeah I was just gonna jump in because I definitely know this one. Orbiter means like to go around.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah and we know that the ice are in the polar crater. Chris, what do you want to say?",,,,
Chris,210.4,yeah well actually I I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,and the Lunar orbiter is specifically for this purpose right?,,,,
Luis,210.4,yeah okay that makes so much sense.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And they they used all that over a course of you know, probably many months, and they and they somehow found.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Water in those craters which is really exciting, because when I was your age, we didn't even know that there was water in craters on anywhere. I'm curious Chris, do you remember any actual equipment that they use. Do you remember how they found the water in those craters.",,,,
Chris,210.4,Oh well.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Mike, their first microscopes my wife's a scientist and then we bought them their first microscope and watching them using microscopes they have to take something they already have and put it on the slides and then look and look into. Have you ever used the microscope before.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,yeah we have them in the science lab oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah awesome so I guess what i'm wondering is, if you have to use the microscope and you, you have that already have something available to put on those slides.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And so i'm wondering how did they get that water in the first place that actually maybe brings us to Jazmin,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And then maybe that's how they brought it back to use the microscopes or maybe they haven't even gotten to that part yet,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"This small machine, so we've talked about other machines, but I think she's thinking about the one that actually like got.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"and see what you can find, see if we can go a little a little deeper okay so see if you can identify that small machine that she's talking about let's get started.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"A lunar orbiter. What are those that's a that's a really big well phrase it's two words ,but what what is the Lunar orbiter what do we think that might mean? Luis.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"um yeah so lunar means moon, so you guys anytime you see the word lunar it means they're talking about the moon and orbiter as like well an orbit is when something goes around something else so i'm thinking as machine those around them.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Maybe this machine, the small machine this lunar orbiter as Chris said wasn't actually going into the crater maybe it was just going around the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But that's a little bit of a problem if it's going around the moon, and not actually going in the crater how, how does it find the ice it's in the crater. Farrah do you have any thoughts on that.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,I don't.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,In the large polar crater. Remember polar is like the top and the bottom just kind of like the North Pole but you're right it actually doesn't talk about at least in that paragraph how the Lunar orbiter works right.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"that's good and Chris it's nice to meet you well let's take a look at the article that we have here again, it is on spaces eaten pointed out, which I find super exciting Luis find super exciting.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You wouldn't need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, exactly Oliver awesome job so they found water on the moon right so there's h2o there's hydrogen and there's oxygen on the moon so kind of giving us what what Luis talked about.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Why do we think that it might be important that these astronauts are these people were able to find h2o or water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so your answer may not, that is not necessarily wrong, what did we talk about micro or microscopic that mean what does that mean, can you explain.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Like really, really small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"really, really, really small, so we do need a special tool and that special tool.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"detectives right and so detected they look for things right, and so that's pretty much what the what NASA wanted to do they wanted to send this small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"This small machine, so that they can investigate or look around or try to detect things on the moon so that's awesome um anybody else see anything else about this small machine or why they think it may be important.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah definitely they have to use all those things right, why do you guys think it's important for them to wear their masks and their suits when they go to outer space.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well, the astronauts they need to stay safe and the oxygen tanks and the masks it wouldn't it wouldn't stay alive without those.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"right because there's a lack of oxygen up in space right, and if you don't have oxygen and you won't be able to breathe so it'd be really tough for them to go to outer space.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"um i'm interested to hear um you know a little bit more about this small machine, why do you think maybe any ideas as to why they sent a small machine instead of a really big one.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Can I answer.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,okay Nice nice So what do we use a microscope for.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"um to look at stuff that's really small, so I don't understand why my answer was wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah so your answer is not necessarily wrong I love again how you use the, how you use the word microscope, um can you think of like another instance or another time or another example, when we use a microscope.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Oh yeah well we use them in science class and we put these little slides underneath to look at cells.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"it's full of these craters that have the water in them right, but a lot of times if we try to use a microscope maybe we don't maybe there's too many places for us to look right,",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Oh um yeah I guess if an astronaut just had a microscope um it would take them like forever to find the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"or can anyone else help us out, they did find these, They did find these craters right",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right um so yeah NASA they definitely sent the small machine um can we think of the name of that small machine, maybe um.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"um i think it's in there, um let me look, ok um",,,,
Teacher,210.4,can anybody think of another word that they may know of that has the same meaning as investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"In this context, it seems like we should be zoning our eyes into the the reading and looking specifically for a tool, or a piece of equipment that's used to do some kind of discovering.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Is that the robot that searched on the planet, can you read that whole section again for me.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the south Pole and look for ice deposit in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,awesome what did you find in that sentence.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What is lunar orbiter what is a lunar orbiter.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh well, I guess it's a machine.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Great so what was that part of the text telling us.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,That you can't see the water without a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That was used to discover water on the moon, and I want us to take a minute and go through and find a sentence that answers a piece of equipment and equipment that specifically was Hughes to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,right they didn't know where it was now in order for us to use a microscope do we if we're using it to look at the water do we already have the water.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh well, yeah in science class, we have to put the slide under the microscope and then we look at it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so we need the water already if we're going to use the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"What if you told me a story about how how they how the scientists at NASA figured out that there is water on the moon, which is super exciting What would you tell me if you just were like explaining it to your friend or to a sibling or to your parents, based on what you read what happened to lead them to that discovery.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"The story is that when when the satellite went up there, they decided to take part of their rocket and crashed into the moon into a crater and then a big plume Do you know what a plume is.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, so they they hypothesized, but if we send this we send a rocket and create a plume, then we can send our we can send.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And you can you can you see the text, right now, Oliver do you look at the can everybody see the tax that i'm talking about.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,yeah yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right, so that it kind of establishes that what they're trying to investigate and find right is the water.",,,,
Chris,210.4, okay yeah yeah yeah I understand that.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"awesome so Jazmin, can you tell me what the small machine was called?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh yeah Okay, it says this isn't a small machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"awesome so this small machine was called the Lunar orbiter- Jazmin, what did NASA do with that machine?",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,They used it to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah does anybody know what investigate means?,,,,
Chris,210.4,Oh yeah I do.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah awesome Chris and that's exactly what investigate means so NASA used the Lunar orbiter to look around the moon for water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Thank you Luis so Farrah I haven't heard your voice in a while Farrah does paragraph one talk about any tools or equipment that the scientists used?,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Oh... no? No.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah exactly right so only in paragraph two or three is any equipment mentioned.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Oh awesome he found it in part three.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,um let's unpack that a bit So what is the small machine do.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,investigate.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What is it investigating for what are we looking for and.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,The water well actually ice ice deposits in the craters.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah that's a really great detail, you found so Chris based off of that evidence, are we swimming and large bodies of water, what are we looking for.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"whoa whoa Okay, it sounds like it's not really how I pictured it may be.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It might not be like full bodies of water, but we have ice right and what does ice made out of.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Exactly so that's the kind of water we're looking for.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,That make sense.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh that's interesting, so we have equipment, both in Part Two and part three So what does that mean, how many pieces of equipment are we looking at.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh, I think there's two pieces of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah that's a really good point so we know that we're using the microscope once we know that there's water right, but in order to find the location, with the water, what are we using.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Oh so.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Exactly, so we start with the machine let's go ahead and look for that ice and then we're like oh look this looks like this weird substance kind of looks like something we find and then what.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah exactly so we take that ice right we take, we find the water particles and we want to use that in the future so that we can go to the moon, and we could stay there long periods of time and and Luis going back to you and how you know so much about.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Space and all that, what do we need for oxygen takes.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yet, so we use the oxygen tanks and then what is water made out of made up of.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Oh, I know that's one s H two o",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And what does the a stamp or what is the O stands for.,,,,
Luis,210.4,hydrogen and oxygen.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Great, so we will eventually use the water deposits and hopefully make that into the oxygen tank so that we can go to the moon and stay there.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"um I was sorry I I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now, but I just wanted to say, I really appreciated, how you found a way that each of our answers could fit together.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Alright, so you have the word equipment, but let's take it one step further, what specific piece of equipment is being used.",,,,
Luis,210.4,The oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"All right, what is the oxygen tank being used for.",,,,
Luis,210.4,to breathe,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"The small machine, what is this machine.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, is there a name of the specific machine there that you found Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Does anybody have that in the in the question, what was this equipment, helping them to do. Farrah yeah.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,i'm to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yeah, yeah definitely. Okay, so if we can look at the second if we can look at the fourth sentence: this lunar orbiter looks for ice the deposits in a large polar crater. So what do you think is this ice deposits refer to? Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Okay, well, it says so, the ice deposits are like the water actually, It's frozen water because it's ice and that's that's the water they found and um actually Chris, I think it says it's really small, it's microscopic.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"However, if we take a look a sentence earlier, like the water they found is microscopic. So here, the word microscopic, could you please use another word to replace it? So what which word would you use, Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,I would say tiny.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,tiny yeah that's great so microscopic here means tiny. So what does this mean is that the water that we can find currently on the moon is really tiny it's really limited.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It doesn't mean that we use the tool named the microscope to find it, but the water we find is very microscopic, which means it is very limited and tiny.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But here in this paragraph, they just name one, so what is the one equipment, if you look at the first sentence",,,,
Luis,210.4,um in part one or part two?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah Thank you that's great So here we saw the name of a lunar orbiter so could anyone tell me what is a lunar orbiter here in this paragraph? So what is this function?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh, I think I can I can do it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah, this is a really good answer, so the machine is used to find where on the moon the water is.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Well let's see the water they found is microscopic you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so let's see if we can make an inference who can tell me what influences.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Does anyone know what the differences yeah go ahead Jazmin,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"i'm so sorry for himself when he described it, this when when the text makes you think of something but it's not on the page.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,that's exactly right so an inference is when we use the clues that the text is giving us.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"If we know that first they use the Lunar orbiter to investigate and find those ice deposits, they found the water in those craters just like Chris said in his response.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,And then those water particles were so small that you would need a microscope to see them when would they use that microscope.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,Oh um maybe like after after the Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Absolutely, I think you're exactly right to the end i'm no expert on space exploration, but I think that, from the text we can make an inference that says First they go with the Lunar lunar orbiter and then they go in with the microscope yes.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,um well I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i'm going to say thank you so much for helping us use the key words to answer the question.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But I'm wondering, Farrah could you read out loud the second paragraph that starts with NASA in the moon is a desert and Oliver while, while she's reading, could you listen for what tool they talk about that helps them discover water?",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Okay,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, or we could all, so we could all look for what tool NASA uses to help discover. Okay. Go ahead, Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Part two Okay, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Excellent Farrah Thank you so much. So Oliver, what what kind of tool were they using there? they were they were looking for water. What were they doing, what were they using?",,,,
Oliver,210.4,In that part they talked about the lunar orbiter I guess.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"I wonder if you could, I wonder if you could read the the second sentence in paragraph two.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"yeah I can do that Oh, it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"ooh so we're building our details of what this orbiter could look like and we're kind of, even if we don't know what a lunar orbiter is, we're kind of making some guesses right? So what do you think it's a small, we know it's a small machine and Chris, what else do we know about it now?",,,,
Chris,210.4,um it can go deep into the crater to find the ice.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah, what do you think what kind of guesses do you have for what it's using to get into the into the crater?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so Luis would you say that a lunar what is a lunar orbiter what kind of task is a lunar orbiter trying to do.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"okay so what it says in part two, investigates in the polar craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So a microscope is a tool that does what.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,It lets them see the the tiny ice deposits.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,and um and I i'm curious if any of you guys um can pinpoint that a little more closer in the text okay so.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,On and i'm curious if you could identify what the small machine was called.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,yeah well i'm i'm actually i'm i'm wondering I I don't understand why my answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"and you had written. NASA send a small machine which is true in paragraph to it describes it as being a small machine, but then right after it says it's a small machine it says called and I feel like we need to focus on that word, because what does NASA call small machine in the paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,that's a really good point Farrah and I I think what they used the Lunar orbiter for was to investigate where there might be the deposits of water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,um and then after they got they collected the materials with the orbiter then they were able to put them under a microscope and really analyze it and see that it was made up of water and dirt and other things like that yeah def.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh well, um well, I thought it was the microscope to just like Farrah I circled the same the same the same thing, but what you just said.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, I think that's a really great way of putting it, it is kind of like a detector that discovers where the water might be, and then we can use the of the microscope to analyze it yeah Chris.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well, I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Then yeah all those other cool machines come into play, after the fact, after they're able to find the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,The sure do they sure do and all of that stuff helps them i'm sure um and I think that it's this part where it says they sent the Lunar orbiter to investigate what do you think they're investigating what does it say they're investigating with that.,,,,
Chris,210.4,oh the craters that was part of my answer.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, I love that and what what did they find in the craters when they used that machine. Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"um they found really, really tiny pieces of ice.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, and Farrah I think you might know the answer to this, but what what did they use to look at the ice",,,,
Farrah,210.4,yeah you need a microscope because it's too small to see without the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,I think when they're looking for water on the moon they're actually sending this machine called a lunar orbiter so they're not sending actual human beings are not sending astronauts.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah, I think, so I actually don't know I think it's possible that the Lunar orbiter maybe had a microscope in it, and then it was all done with robots but that's a great question.",,,,
Luis,210.4,Robots are awesome.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"mm hmm yeah so when we're thinking about what kinds of machines, they were using the right answers that they were using two different kinds of machines",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, perfect and do you remember what they were using the microscope for.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,Oh yeah I thought that I can add on that you'll start to look really closely at the little ice and i'm I just I just looked at the clock.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Because the article does say a little bit more about what that small machine actually is there's a name for it so.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"but thank you for that clarification that's a good point, because I think you're right that they don't use the word discover in the article.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,To find water on the moon so thinking about the context of the question in what specific situation or scientists using this kind of equipment and we know that it's using water on the moon so going back into the text.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What did you think was interesting about how they found the water did was there anything that stuck out to you.,,,,
Chris,210.4,How they found the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"huh yeah definitely So do you have any ideas about what type of machine they might have sent to you remember that, from the passage.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Let me see i'll call the Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,do you know what a lunar orbiter is.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,it's a machine.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"mm hmm and let's Maybe you can think a little bit, we can break down that nate, and so do you know what lunar means.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah Thank you you're right yeah and then or better does anyone know what the word orbiter means or the orbit.,,,,
Chris,210.4,"yeah that's that's the path that you when you go like around something you know, like how.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah definitely so Jazmin now using what your classmates have shared about what it is so it's something about the moon and it's something that's going around something else, what do you think a lunar orbiter would be doing on.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,um I think it's a machine that goes around.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,How do you think scientists were using that particular piece of equipment to find water.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Okay you're using this.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What is the actual name of the small machine.,,,,
Luis,210.4,Oh yeah it's the Lunar orbiter I forgot to put that in there.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Jazmin you said masters kind of small machine, could you look in take one minute and look in the text and tell me what that small machine was called.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,OK.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,The lunar orbiter now does anyone have an idea what the Lunar orbiter is.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Chris, what did those scientists fine, could you repeat what you said about what the scientists found with that lunar orbiter.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh yeah suit the scientists they found these crators, full of water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So how much water did they find could use to find in the text, how much water they found.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Okay yeah so in part one, it says they found evidence that water can be found deep in the moon's craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,microscopic the me thank you for finding that can anyone tell me what microscopic me.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Where they're using the microscope again.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,i'm okay yeah so um they use a microscope to look at a tiny on ice particles and polar craters.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, you can put your hands down Thank you just tracking it's Okay, if you don't care we're looking at the little divots or shapes in the moon, yes Chris oh.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well, I know what craters are because I actually went to NASA.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"that connects to something Luis said earlier, I think about the oxygen tanks, could you tell could Luis could you tell me what type of scientists could use an oxygen tank.",,,,
Luis,210.4,Oh yeah astronaut.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,But something tells me that oxygen that astronauts aren't actually on this mission could someone let's take a minute look in the text tell me why I don't think astronauts are on this mission.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"that's a good notice you just said so, even though we might be able to assume astronaut you're somewhere for this for this section, we can only assume what they tell us, but let's keep that in mind, just in case they mention it later yes.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh, I just locked up a clock on it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for working with us today and reminding us to really look for small details and add them into one answer that is so helpful Thank you so much i'm.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Did you find anything else about about the microscope passage that could help us talk about how much water there is.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Okay um well Farrah told us about part of it, but also uses the word microscopic on which it has just like microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,and just to be just to be clear could someone tell me what microscopic means.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,um yeah yeah that's like super super small,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, and I really liked how many supers you use because they have to zoom and even though, as Chris said the craters very big the amount of water, they can find is very, very small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But if they're already on the moon, they can have the microscopes already there there doesn't need anything to transport the microscope to the place so.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"take a closer look back at the text and it says in the second paragraph NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate so thinking about that, I think that Jazmin might be correct that the who would be NASA at least from reading through that sentence.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Thank you, wonderful so you guys read about scientists and the moon, and can anyone tell me what did they discover?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,I think that there's a word for that. Does anyone remember what word they use to describe how small the water i? Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"yeah I do because it's it's kind of part of my answer, they use the word microscopic and so that's why I said you'd need a microscope to discover the water, so you can look at it really closely.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, very good the scientists. And what did they find? I think we all know, this one.",,,,
Chris,210.4,yeah that's the water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Very good, and how did they find it? We know that the water was microscopic, it was very small, but what what type of tool did they use to find it? Farrah mentioned that they used a microscope to see the water, but what what i'm what type of invention, it was it had a really cool name.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So you mentioned a small machine. Does anyone know what paragraph maybe that they named the small machine in?,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Because that's where I found my answer it's in Part two,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Very good yeah so as i'm looking and i'm reading, part two, or paragraph two, I see that they called it a lunar orbiter",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"I guess I wouldn't be that hard, I mean I could say that the equipment is a small machine and it's called the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And, and so, when I reading paragraph two, it says that they sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate. But we also know that later in paragraph three, paragraph three, it says that, where is it, the water they found was microscopic.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"that's a really cool insight and I really appreciate that you're bringing all this knowledge to our group, but my question is, is there a place in the text in the reading that we could find how the scientists use what like what Oliverice they used to find the water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,210.4,um you mean like in the story?,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Was there a spot in the text, talking about what Oliverice things to find the water on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah so that's a really good addition Thank you yeah I see that in paragraph three, it talks about the microscope and that's how they're looking at the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,that's a really good question um but let's take a look at paragraph three let's see what it says.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So you're right, we do need the microscope to see the water but i'm wondering, maybe, if we take a look at paragraph two is, are there any other tools that the scientists were using.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Yes, I found my answer in paragraph two, but I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Can you read it to the to our group so we're we're on the same page.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Thank you for reading um yeah so you're right, so it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so you're right, it is a small machine, but what is the tool, called the specific tool used.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"However, I want us to take a look at the reading specifically",,,,
Teacher,210.4,But not everyone else has that but what everyone else does have is the reading that we just did so just to make sure that everyone's on the same page let's take a look back at the reading so again.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah that they both do sound pretty good and that's why we're talking about it so let's take a look at that sentence, again, the one that Jazmin read aloud.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,So NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate So what do we think the author meant by investigating what are they looking for.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"um well, it sounds like it was it was looking looking for is deposits right little teeny tiny ice.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah yes they're looking for the ice and so we're looking for ice and the question we're answering is about water So what do we think is the Lunar orbiter looking for ice is lunar orbiter looking for water is that the same thing.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh yeah yeah it's just water, so I guess if they sent a lunar orbit are looking for ice then then it's really looking for the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But my question coming after this would be what did they use this microscope for and anyone can answer this question, using the tax and using our discussion, what did the scientists use the microscope to do.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,so we already identified that in paragraph three there's a microscope as a tool can anyone find a tool in paragraph two.,,,,
Chris,210.4,um it said The lunar orbiter in paragraph two.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah So what do we think is the function of the Lunar orbiter in this paragraph.,,,,
Luis,210.4,"Okay, it says.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,it's looking for ice.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, great so you talked about a scientific tool called a microscope, can you tell me a little bit about what they use the microscope to look at.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Okay, so because, when they found the water, it was really small, they have to see it on they have to use the microscope to look at it, they can't see it without the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah great response, they use a microscope to look at the small small specks of water exactly have you ever used a microscope before.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Oh yeah we have them in the science lab we use them in science.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Oh great can you guys raise your hand if any of you have used a microscope dub Chris Jazmin or Luis.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,I just wanted to ask you if you could share a little bit about what this machine with this machine was used for.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"um Okay, so it says they sent it to investigate in craters to find that water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah exactly they sent these machines into or onto the moon, to see if they could investigate and actually look for the water perfect answer Jazmin do you happen to remember what the small machine was called or do you want to look back into the text, see if you can find some evidence.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Can I look back.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And we learned a bit about how this is a really big endeavor so there wasn't just one piece of equipment that scientists use there's actually many pieces of equipment and tools.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"That you got to see there which one of those has been mentioned in this passionate in this passage in which one of those do you believe, help the scientists get to these craters and actually find the water.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Oh, like pick one of the ones in the story.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, so oxygen tanks is a really important tool, like you had mentioned earlier, obviously, they would not be able to breathe, give me one second okay i'm just gonna ask Luis a quick question.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So Jazmin Maybe you can look at the text and tell us um what's the machine called that you were looking for, I think it was in the maybe the second paragraph.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So what Farrah just said, was in the third paragraph and she's talking about the tool called a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Does anyone want to tell me what they think the word microscopic means like what comes to your mind when you hear the word microscopic.,,,,
Luis,210.4,I got this one I got this one.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah that's awesome so if we think about what we already know from the text we've got this thing called a lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And so, has anyone here ever seen or used a microscope before.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,Oh yeah we all use them in science class.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"awesome Chris, do you want to tell me like what can you do when you use a microscope.",,,,
Chris,210.4,"Well, you can you can see things that you couldn't really see without it, you can see bacteria and cells.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah that's awesome thanks Chris, I always think it's kind of fun to consider the fact that, like we use our eyes to see everything around us, but there's so much more in this universe that we can't see without a microscope it's pretty incredible to think about.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,can you tell us now that you just read that sentence again what was the name of that machine.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,They might need tools from a traditional toolbox as well i'm sure they need lots of different things as they do their exploration on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah and so when we're talking about this specific article in what the scientists need to find water on the moon, it looks like we've got these two different components here the microscope because those water molecules are super duper tiny.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And then we've got that lunar orbiter as another piece of equipment, what do you think that they were using that lunar orbiter for.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Chris that sounds like a little bit of your answer, what do you guys think that lunar orbiter was doing on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah great and so I saw that as well, what Luis do you think that, according to the text astronauts might be able to do with the hydrogen and the oxygen.",,,,
Luis,210.4,"Okay, well, I know that we can breathe oxygen, and so they could breathe it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Chris part of what you read said future astronauts could drink this water, so I think right now we're still in this like hypothetical state where we're thinking.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, what did they use what did they say you need a microscope for can you find that in the text.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"um yeah that says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh OK, so to look really closely at what.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,I thought tiny teeny tiny water.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Oh okay these ice has a very small So what did we think what did we.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,What do we think of of what Jazmin just read so she said NASA send a small machine and what was the machine can anyone tell me.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Ah, OK so lunar orbiter do we think that might be the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh OK, so the water they found is microscopic so you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it okay so yeah they use that I guess choose so that is also evidence of the text that we can use to answer this question um.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So, I guess, they were investigating right with the equipment and they help the microscope the microscope also help them look closely.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,Oh umso like they're both the answer.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah then that's pretty cool it's a some solid individual independent thinking and then, how do you think you could locate that the textual evidence that Jazmin found in the text.",,,,
Chris,210.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"that word means that the water is small and you cannot just directly see it,",,,,
Chris,210.4,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Okay, good so um, can you tell me like what is lunar orbiter?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,what is a microscope and what does it do for us.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,And Oliveron when adept when we were using the microscope what the scientists want to fight.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh, so they wanted to find the water, which was really actually like really tiny pieces of ice.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Good good and Harry, can you tell me what was that machine that small machine that they used to find the water.",,,,
Chris,210.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Oh you're so well, what does that small machine do can anyone look at paragraph two, and tell me what is that small machine do.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"hmm very good and why can't the machine just see the ice, because what what was what was a what was what do they need more so just to ask her Jazmin's question, yes, there.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,"Oh wait, so you said why couldn't they see the ice.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"and unless add on a little bit more about this water that they found on the moon So where is this water that they what kind of place do you find this water is in in a very like right place, yes hairs.",,,,
Chris,210.4,On the crators and I think it says the really dark like the sun never shines there.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, very good, why is it important that is in a dark place what would happen if it was in a place where the sun is shining what could happen.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Yes, very good and in the ice kind of melted you think the scientists that see can find the water.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,Probably not because I think it would melt and then probably a very.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"and then, what do you need to see the the water itself.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Endless space suit in in the reading do we see that there are some slots on the moon and they're investigating it.,,,,
Chris,210.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,um yeah I don't think there's astronauts in the story so far.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah, we can see in the third paragraph to see the eyes is very small, so we need the microscope to look at it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,A small machine washing machine with that machine called.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Let me check Okay, it says NASA send a small machine called.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah you do really great job, so the second paragraph is there's no standard small machine on lunar orbiter to investigate and what does the Lunar orbiter fine.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Well, I guess it finds and that I in the craters.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah great the Lunar orbiter buying the eyes departed in Apollo crater right.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah so how did I get the water Chris.,,,,
Chris,210.4,On.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So we know that the scientists used equipment, so now I want us to think about our responses, yet, but Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"And I was just gonna ask about my response, actually, so my response was NASA said just small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,You have full so that takes us to the understanding what does microscopic actually mean.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"It is it's all so you're onto something, but what does microscopic mean.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"I think it means really, really small.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"so you had the right answer about a small machine, but then after they find the they found the ice deposits, they had to use something else to like look at it more closely.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"ice deposits in lunar craters, but if it's too small to see with the eyes, they have to go in with that microscope to try to find.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Oh so i'm the machine, it can do the finding, even if it can't see it.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah that's what the microscopes for.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,"Okay, so um for the answer we just say both.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah they actually send up the machine on its own to do the investigation so there's still on earth looking at what they're doing so the machine will go up there and discover the ice deposits and then they also have the microscope up there to help them look at it more closely.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"So cool machine can do it all, without any astronauts.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So there's still people controlling it it's just from earth, so they use computers and stuff to get it to do what it needs to do.",,,,
Luis,210.4,um yeah Jazmin it's like it's kind of like a robot right.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Exactly, and do you remember in the article why they needed to use the microscope.",,,,
Oliver,210.4,um yeah because well um because the water it's so small.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"So, in the third paragraph it explains that you would need a microscope to look at the water that's um.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,that's in the craters.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"But is there, another tool yeah find maybe in the second paragraph that um.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right okay so that's assumption.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Is that the amount of water that.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,is basically the amount of water that a person drinks a day.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,So it's not a lot at all.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"yeah so in paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, so the microscope was a really good answer, but the microscope is just looking at the water.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"At the bottom of the crater just that little bit, whereas the Lunar orbiter was sent to the moon, to look at it all and investigate everything does that make sense.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Instead of just the water at the bottom.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"You fuel, do you guys know what that is.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,rocket fuel is how you would how you would move the spaceship so it's like.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,it's like how i'm gas as for our car.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,it's the same thing.,,,,
Farrah,210.4,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right so once they can get the water they won't have to bring water bottles on to their spacecraft which will be nice because it takes up a lot of room and it's heavy so without that they can bring more things and they'll already have water provided Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,yeah I think you.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, once they get to the moon, they would drink the water on the moon, so I mean.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"i'm sure that they bring, maybe a water bottle each a little bit of water each, but I think this is more saying they don't have to bring a whole thing of water, because that's really happy, but you do still need to drink water so i'm sure they bring.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,A little bit each once they get to the moon there'll be enough provided for them to drink where they.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,mm hmm right right and we would need a microscope to look at something we can't see with our own eyes right.,,,,
Oliver,210.4,yeah yeah exactly.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Well, yours is correct, but do you remember what the small machine was called in the text",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Okay, it says NASA centers for machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,yeah so they didn't just use one thing they used.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,In the beginning that they use a small machine called a lunar orbiter and then.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,Towards the end they were saying that they used a microscope to really look at the.,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"Right yeah because it's cold so good good So these are all great clues that we all help on fighting together,",,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And what I want you guys to do is using what we just discovered from the question reread paragraph two, and see if we can find an answer okay so let's take about one to two minutes to do that and so Farrah have a question before we get started.",,,,
Farrah,210.4,"You have to go to our next class, but thank you so much, it was really interesting to meet you, Mr T and to talk to you Thank you so much.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,Right so there's more there's more to that What else does it say about the small machine.,,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Okay, a small machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,210.4,that's a fantastic question and that's why there's another tool that had to be used in order to find it,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"To be honest, i'm not a space astronauts so i'm truthfully not sure we'd have to look again at this article, to see if there's a name for that small machine did you happen to notice if it was called something.",,,,
Jazmin,210.4,"Oh yeah like it's the lunar orbiter, is that the answer?",,,,
Teacher,210.4,You might have even noticed in the article there's a title of a section called water is a valuable resource,,,,
Teacher,210.4,"And I also wonder if some equipment is used for some jobs in space and some different equipment is used for different jobs, so I wonder if looking for water on the moon requires some different different equipment than some of the things that you're talking about.",,,,
Chris,210.4,that's a really good point.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"I think these are all really great starting answers, and I just want us to really work on looking at this text, a little more, so that we can make our answers more complete and built on textual evidence that we see in the reading and so.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,I think we all have different strengths here and I just want us to really practice not just like knowing the content but also being able to use the skill of backing our responses up with text with evidence from the text.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay, I think, part of what we're doing right now is this isn't just about our knowledge of what we're learning.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,The first thing I want us to talk about when we're here in this group is I want you to think what is this question asking. what what does it mean to circle evidence. yeah Luis.,,,,
Luis,220.1,"um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"This lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposit in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one top of the one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water. So what is an ice deposit",,,,
Teacher,220.1,And we had some really great responses. So we're going to make sure that our answers can be proven from our text.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"But in a text. It tells why astronauts are using water from the moon and we need to go back into the text, all of us to figure out why we think that the water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Well, we're gonna learn some more.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Thank you for joining me at the small group table, guys. I appreciate the answers that you gave, let's go ahead and review some of the things that we've talked about",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Well, it's great that you know a lot about space, but we're going to specifically talk about the moon and the water that was found on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"And we're going to look at these questions that we, that we have. Okay. I want. I just want you guys to look at them together with me so we can get a deeper understanding of our reading passage. OK.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"But I want us to look deeper into that the question asked us, okay, because we all struggled a little bit with giving a specific answer to the question. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Hey everybody, so I want to challenge you to think about the answer that you have right now and see if you can find evidence in the text that supports that answer. Luis What's going on.",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Execuse me Ms. Teacher. I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"I am so excited that you are excited about space, but I do challenge you to go back into the reading and think about that response that you gave me. Can you read the discussion question for us. Again, Luis.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Uh, we're gonna figure out how to look back in the story and figure out a more in depth answer.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,But I need to do with every one of your classmate right now to explain them why they need to look for another answer. Okay.,,,,
Farrah,220.1,Um okay.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"And I wanted to kind of dive into these here. I want to make sure we're all on the same page and kind of understanding that test to text to its full extent. Oh yes, Luis.",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Excuse me. Um, but I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,So we should look at our responses and kind of see where we can grow and where we can improve with our understanding of the article. Now we got to read about something really cool. And I'm really excited to get to talk to you guys about it.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,To get more specific with our response.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Well, we're all in this together, we are just looking at this article closely together.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Just to see what we can take away from our just our reading and then our discussion. So we're just in this all together, just looking at this little reading together.",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Okay, okay, okay. I'll give it a try.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay, so what I wanted to pull us back here about is because even though we might have a lot of information that we've learned in other places about space we were reading a text specifically on a mission and finding water on the moon. Correct?",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"And our question was what equipment was used to find that water. Now, Mr. Luis a lot of us found different types of equipment or we used background knowledge, but that's not exactly what the question was asking us to do. Okay, so can we look at deeper into that question. Is that okay, yeah.",,,,
Luis,220.1,That's that sounds great.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,So I want to just say thank you so much for the answers that you have given and I'm here to just try to clarify the answer that you have and to see how best we can work around to arrive at a more suitable answer. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,And so we had left of where we were trying to actually locate the answer from the passage. So we are going to just briefly recap that we were looking at the word. Yes. Luis,,,,
Luis,220.1,"Um, yeah. So I just wanted to say. My dad is an astronaut. So I think that could be kind of helpful.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"but we're going to focus on a elaborating our answers. Okay, okay, okay. Alright. So my concern is while you guys use your text to answer the question.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay. Um, well, we are going to work together as a team to answer this question, this is a team effort. Not just one person answering okay",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"We are just diving deeper into the text as a team, so that everyone is on the same page.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Yeah. So what's some strategies that we can use to find that answer to that question. Who knows, have a strategy that we can use.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,And so in this case. That's what we're going to do. So let's take a look at your answers.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Yeah, well, we always have a good background knowledge of space. And that's really cool that you're interested in it, but we can always learn new names for machinery and things like that. So that's why we read this passage together in hopes that you would learn more",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Okay, gotcha.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay, I think we just wanted to have just a deeper discussion.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"And the, the question. So what equipment did scientist us to discover a water feel like we just wanted to have a just a discussion on what we all thought the answers were",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay, you've been, we've been reading about the water on the moon and we talked about the moon is a desert and we are going to think a little bit thorough. Okay? Do you know what thorough is?",,,,
Teacher,220.1,We are have been talking about that the moon is a desert right and you answered your questions and we are going to discuss and see how did we understand this questions. So we're going to discuss and listen to our friends responses.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay, now we are going to think of strategies of ways that we can improve our answer okay and find those words in our",,,,
Teacher,220.1,Writing that is going to help us connect and learn,,,,
Teacher,220.1,Better. Okay. I want. We want to see the process of how are we going to,,,,
Teacher,220.1,Reflect on our answer in think to improve our response. Can we do that.,,,,
Jazmin,220.1,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,Good thing. So we're here to talk about this information that we've just read and are learning about,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay. All right, great. So here's what we're gonna do, guys. So we're going to talk about a new skill, a new skill of circling or underlining key words from the question that are in the text. Okay, so what was our question. Can someone read that for me.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay, so let's look back at Farrah answer real quick. We're going to go through each of your responses. Okay, so let's look at your response. First, what did you say",,,,
Farrah,220.1,"I said that, basically, as I said, that you need a small a tool called a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,So we've already read the text about the moon in class and I just want to talk to you guys about some of your answers to your questions and try to see if we can discover more answers and and think more deeply about this passage. Does that sound good to you guys. Yes. Luis,,,,
Luis,220.1,"Trust me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"we want to really focus on what it says and our article today, we want to learn more details about scientists especially on the moon.",,,,
Luis,220.1,Okay. Sounds good.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"All right, so I see that you have all, um, did your best and answering the question, and some of you really went into detail pulling out specific sentences from the text, but we want to get this specific answer. So remember the discussion question is-- yes Luis?",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Um, yeah. So here's the thing. I don't really think I need to be in this group, because I know all about space already so I don't really need any help with this stuff.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Well, that's a very big statement because I don't even know all about space, space is so broad and there's so many unanswered questions that I think that you have be eager to learn about. I didn't even know about water on the moon. So this though you might think that you might know some of this stuff. I'm sure there's something new that you might could gain from it. So I think it's very beneficial that you're in this group.",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Yeah, that's, that's a good point.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,So we're going to look at some of your answers that you have and ways that we could improve some of them and some strengths that many of you did have in your answers.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Yeah, wonderful, buddy. But we're going to talk just a little bit more about text evidence and how it can help us with our questions. So I want you all to look at question number two.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Right, you, you probably have an extensive knowledge of outer space through you know TV and stuff, but we're in this group so that we can focus on",,,,
Teacher,220.1,extracting information from from informative text. So that's the main goal of what we're working on together. So I suppose I will start with,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Well, sometimes we feel that way, but you're, you might have some knowledge that wasn't really covered inside of the texts that maybe your other friends in the group can learn from.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,So work on all learn from each other and kind of discuss what we've read and if you have questions at the end [teacher name] will gladly to answer those. Okay?,,,,
Luis,220.1,"Okay, that sounds good.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"A lot of you have really great responses, but the reason why we're kind of in this small group is to kind of build off those responses. So although it asks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, there's a little bit more that we could probably add to our answers to help you better. Does that make sense?",,,,
Farrah,220.1,"Yeah, I have a question. Um, I was wondering if um like, so my answer. Like, if we're all in the group to work together on getting the more correct answer. Like, I was wondering why my answer might be incorrect.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,Well good. So what we're going to do today is look at the article that you all previous you read called water on the moon. And we're going to look at the discussion question in regards to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So what we can do is just kind of go around the room. If you just raise your hand. I'll call on you. And then we can look at your response and kind of figure out where you came up with that response and see if we're saying is correct or if it could use a little work. So, if you will, just kind of raise your hand and I'll call on you.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"But today, what I hope to do is kind of come together, work on some strategies that we can kind of hone in on the answer that, that is specifically wanting. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Well, I hope you're right. But I think with we go through this second question will be able to make sure that we understand how to kind of really dive deeper into a question. So we can find the evidence from the text way say sound good.",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Yeah, I can stick around for that.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Because we're not just. Yeah, we're not just looking at space we're looking at how well we read this text, and we're just working as a group to kind of share our knowledge with each other. Okay.",,,,
Luis,220.1,I can stick around.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"I saw bits and pieces of that in there. So does anybody want to volunteer to go first, where we can kind of critique and go through our answers and look and see how we can find maybe some more detail to support our answer.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"It's good to see you too. Um, so I have seen your responses to our discussion question and I wanted to talk to you about how you came to know those answers. Yes, Luis?",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Um, yeah, so like here's something that's kind of on my mind. Like I know like a lot about space. And, um, I don't really think I need to be at this group, you know,",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So I wanted to go over the discussion question that you all answer. Yes, Luis?",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Um, yeah. So I had kind of this question, like I already know like all about space. I know all this stuff. So I was kind of wondering like, I don't think I should be in this group.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Great. Alright, so what we were talking about your, your article or your passage, it was what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon. You're talking about space.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,So the reason why we're looking back over your answers. And I want to have help you have a better understanding of space and exactly why there is water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,220.1,"Okay. Well, that sounds. Okay. I guess I can hang around for that.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,but I want to dig a little bit deeper into the question and let's figure out exactly what they're talking about and see a we can expand on some of the ideas that y'all. Write down for your answers.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"You guys put some really great work in and had some good answer choices, but I don't feel that we have a complete understanding of what the question is asking, So firstly, what I want to do is",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Yes. Okay, so first I want to make sure that we have a clear understanding of what the question is actually asking so",,,,
Teacher,220.1,Yeah well that's good that you corrected your answer. And we are going to look at it again and we're going to see if we can dig deeper together and figure out a more precise answer something with a little bit more evidence. Okay.,,,,
Luis,220.1,"Okay, yeah, I can stick around for that right",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Yes, I noticed that you changed your answer. And we're going to hang out. I do like that you what you changed your answer to. And so we are going to use some of what you thought and how you got to your answer. We're going to help other people in this group use that same thought process. Okay.",,,,
Farrah,220.1,Thank you.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay, so when we are reading our question and we have found those keywords. We're trying to find those words back in the text, so that we know what answer to give.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,Okay well we're going to work on reading comprehension in this group.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,So today I want us to work on finding,,,,
Teacher,220.1,keywords in questions to help us better answer questions.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So I think that if we are able to work together and kind of pull their resources in there, we can come up with the right answer.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,We're all going to be in the group to learn together and discuss what we read,,,,
Luis,220.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,We're just having a group discussion now that we've read,,,,
Jazmin,220.1,"Oh, oh, okay.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay well we're all put in this group to help each other learn, um,",,,,
Chris,220.1,"Um, well, I mean I guess I don't, I  don't know. I don't really have anything to say about it. Like, I think it was like, I think in the in the in the text, it talks about like how the craters have a bunch of water. Um, and like that made me think, like, that's you know what I mean, like, that was what they had to find",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"And it seems like we have some understanding of what it is that we're trying to find out. But we're not all quite there just yet. So what I'd like to do is I'd like us to go around and read this little by little, one person at a time and then we're going to work through this question together. Sound like a plan?",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Fantastic. I love that amount of enthusiasm, real quick before we begin, I would like to just address one thing that I tell all of my students Whenever they walk into my classroom for the first time.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"One thing I like to mention to my students that I'd like to mention to all of you as well as my philosophy on answering questions might be a weird thing to hear at this age, but I'd like mistakes.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"That's a weird thing to hear a teacher, save right I like mistakes, you're probably not going to hear too many say make mistakes in my class.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Guys, let's bring it back together as a as one group. And let's see how our answers may have changed, based on your group discussion.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,And I want to make sure that everybody has a really good understanding of why it was the lunar orbiter that helped us discover the microscopic water.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay, well, we do want to focus your attention on the article we just read and we're going to examine this article and try to determine how scientists have gone about finding water and the craters on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Well, guess what we're going to learn some new things today. You might find something that you didn't know",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Okay, that sounds cool.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,The point in this group was to just elaborate more on you guys.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"No, we just wanted to talk about the answers and kind of see where you guys got your answers from.",,,,
Jazmin,220.1,So then mine is good?,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Well we're all gonna collectively talk to each other, if you wanted to add an aspect of another persons answer as well, you guys could totally add to it it's all about getting different parts of it.",,,,
Jazmin,220.1,Oh okay i'm still confused.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,For what I'm kind of hoping from you is that you search them a text and kind of show me what you learned from the text,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So for this group, we're just going to focus on some of the things that we read and how we can change our answers to better fit the reading. Does that sound good. Luis",,,,
Luis,220.1,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"tweak them a little bit and improve them and adjust your sentences to just show that you understand what the text is saying, I just wanted you guys to use examples exactly from the text that way. I know that you guys had an easy time reading",,,,
Chris,220.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay well today we're going to experiment with different kinds of groups, and if you know a lot about space, then maybe you can help your table mates that, we probably don't know as much as you do. It sounds good to you, Luis?",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Okay yeah Okay, I guess that's fine okay.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,good to hear so today I put you on a group because we're going to focus on today's lesson which is about scientific tools that are used on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,and other than that we're going to talk about whether the moon has valuable resources for people to be able to live on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"There was a short reading and I gave you guys two questions, just to remind you what the questions are i'll read them out loud for you guys, the first question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,220.1,The teacher said that we would only work on question number one right now.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay we'll just work on question number one, thank you for letting me know so did you guys will be time to write down your answers to questions.",,,,
Jazmin,220.1,yeah we put them down on our tablets to you.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Hi class, so I pulled you all into a small group, because I think you did a really good job in answering our discussion question about the water on the moon texts, but I want to work with each of you a little more and just make your responses more academic and a little longer. Yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So we're going to be discussing them and trying to expand more upon this sentences um so um, I would like to just ask one other passages yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So I think you guys all did a really great job thinking while using our text. So I'm going to go around the room and give a little bit of feedback to each of you. So, Farrah to start",,,,
Teacher,220.1,I know that you know all about space. But this isn't about learning about space. It's about we're going to work on creating better responses when we read texts. Does that makes sense?,,,,
Luis,220.1,Oh. Yeah yeah. Ok.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,So there's just a few things that we need to work on in order to create better responses and better understanding of the text.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,So we're here because I have concerns about each one of your guys's responses to the water on the moon passage and we're going to work on improving them. Yes Luis.,,,,
Luis,220.1,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"You may know all about space, but this doesn't really have anything to do with learning about space it's going to be about improving our responses to questions when we read passages.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So the reason that the five of you are with me today is because I have some concerns about your responses that I would like to address, so we can improve on them, so you guys can better understand.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,How -have a better of understanding of how to answer questions that are given to you after reading a passage. Awesome.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Hi, everyone. So today, I heard you read Water on the Moon, is that correct? Anyone? Did everyone read? Yes, OK. So I want to revise our answers because I saw you had an understanding of it but I didn't see that you had a deep, deep understanding. So we're going to try to fix that today. So I want one-- yes, Luis.",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group. I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,hi everyone so today we're going to be revising our answers from the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Everyone had a good understanding of the reading, but I do want to work out answers just a little bit, because I think we're getting a little confused between two big aspects. So first before we share our answers with the class, I want you to independently for one minute look at the question.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Oh well, I really want to work with you because I want to hear how what your answer is, and I want to know what we can do to make it even better.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So I think so. Maybe you guys do have a good understanding of the text, but I think we can go dig a little deeper and relate the text to your answers and pull out evidence from the text.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,In from the reading.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"However, I think it's important that sometimes even if you know the material. I think it's good to work on how we word things and just really working on our answering questions skills. So this really helpful.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"That can be true, however, today we're using science.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"to drive our reading skills so we're actually going to be using science ,a reading about science and about.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,As you guys have done we're going to be using that reading,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"and we're going to be reviewing our, our responses to those questions.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,And we're actually going to be using the reading as a to work on our reading skills. So we're going to be learning but we're also- about science,,,,
Teacher,220.1,But we're also going to be learning how to work on our reading and writing skills.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,And how we work to break down questions and such um.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,I think it was more that we can work on our answers to make them a little bit more to the expectation of using specific language.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"that the text uses and as well as just working on our writing skills. Like I said to Luis earlier, we're not just working on our science skills, we're also working on our reading and writing skills",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Um yeah, but we also are using today to not only does the reading help us know a little bit more about space like Luis knows a lot about.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,we're also going to be using that reading to learn and to practice our reading and writing skills and understanding how to break down.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,information that we might not even know about yet So how do we do that and stuff,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So we just want to make sure that everybody is using the right language and everybody understands how to find the find the evidence for their answer and such um Farrah you had your hand up well, I was.",,,,
Farrah,220.1,Well I was kinda gonna say the same thing as Jazmin because I used equipment and my answer too.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,So it's not about right or wrong here right it's about building on our response strengthening it with textual evidence in and looking at the key ideas in the question,,,,
Teacher,220.1,But I think we could do a little bit better and get a lot more of a specific answer so i'm going to have us do the same activity that we did with the first question.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Because part of what we're doing is not just to learn about science, but it's also to practice reading strategies.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Well, right now we're working on Olivereloping our responses. So even if you know a lot. It's about verbalizing what you know. So that's what we're practicing right now.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Well, hello. Okay, so I just heard all of your awesome responses. And I just want to know a little bit more what you've got from the text. So I'm going to start. Yes. What's up, Luis.",,,,
Luis,220.1,Asked me. I shouldn't be and that's great. I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Well, it's really good to have background knowledge on space. Luis But I want to talk about how we answered the questions, not so much the facts about the moon. Does that make sense.",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Um, how we answer the questions. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So Luis I'm really glad, you bring up a good point, so the point of this group, I just wanted, I want you guys to know is that.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"You guys made some really great points, some of the points that you well made all together or your in your work separately um some of them could use a little bit of improvement here and there.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"The questions were asking for some direct information from the reading and different things like that, and I think some of you might have missed some of it.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,Because you're in this group doesn't mean that you did something wrong or that you did something bad we're just here to improve the work that you've already done.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So we're going to be focusing on just this text, so that we can digest this and answer the question. So even if you do know a little bit you can bring in that background information, but we're gonna be focusing on the text that we read",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Okay, I can, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So i'm very impressed with all of your answers to the questions that we just went over, and so what I want to do now is to go over these responses and help you adjust them just to make sure that we get our complete understanding of what we're saying yes Luis.",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So first we're going to practice together how to model, a question or not how to model, a question we're going to practice how to break down a question so i'm going to give you guys an example first you guys can see kind of what you want to be looking for.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,Okay hi everyone so in our last lesson we learned that a lunar orbiter is what we can use to find water on the moon does everybody remember.,,,,
Chris,220.1,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Right, so we kind of changed our answers a little bit to include the word lunar orbiter into our answer.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So let's talk a little bit more about what we can - go ahead, Luis.",,,,
Luis,220.1,"yeah i'm sorry to interrupt but I got this all figured out now, so I think i'm all good.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Well, Luis. That's great. That's you feel like you know everything that there is to know about space, but there is always more that we can learn and maybe by listening to our friends answer is we can learn even more.",,,,
Luis,220.1,Oh. Okay,,,,
Teacher,220.1,Very good. So we are going to talk about The tool that scientists use to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"But we're all here together to try to dive deeper into this text to find more specific answers to our question,",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"That would be really cool. So Chris, we're working on reading informational texts. And the reason that we're doing this is so that you can start to learn how to write about informational texts. I know that you know about space.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,And look for those answers in the text,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Hey, so today we're going to do something super cool. We are going to be reading detectives. Okay, so that means when we get a question about the text we are going to answer it by looking in the text. Okay Luis Do question.",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Yeah, um, I shouldn't be in this group. I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"You know what you think. I have learned that about you and it's something I value about you, but I want us to work on the skill of answering questions by finding the answers and attacks.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Because when we read informational texts. This year, you're going to need that skills. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,We asked that to answer and test a dependent question.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Hello, boys and girls. And what I'm going to do today is to introduce you a new strategy, then you are going to practice it in a small group and I will come back to talk a little more individually. If you still have some progress. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,We're also going to be learning about answering a question fully And making sure that we're giving all the information that's in your head so that everyone knows that you have a full understanding of the topic,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"I know I remember that. And based on your answer. I can tell you included some really awesome information, but we're here to make sure that we're answering the question that was given to us and using the text that was given to us.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"However, we're working on a few different things in this group. We want to make sure that we're answering the question that was given to the fullest and making sure we're using evidence from the text that was given",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Well, Luis This group is actually going to work together to try and learn even more from each other. Because what's cool about partial answers.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,Is that everyone has different partial answers. And if we put some of these answers together and we think about each other's way of thinking we can get more complete answers.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay, so let's all read read through it. I think we have two minutes left and see if we can build on our answers.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,I also want you to think of the thought processes that you had in getting there.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,but we're going to go over this question together because I think that all of us.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,Had a little bit of misunderstanding with this question. So I'm just here to clarify the answer for us. And I want to lead us to the right answer today.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,But you didn't write that for your answer. Either we all didn't write it for our answer. And that's why I'm working with you today to get you to the correct answer.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay, I got us into this group because I wanted to clarify a question that we answered, because I want to reread some parts of the text so that we can find the correct answers",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Um, I just want to remind you, my dad is actually an astronaut.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So I've seend all responses, and I would like for you guys to use evidence from the text to support your answer.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,Does anyone know what I mean by using evidence from the text.,,,,
Luis,220.1,What excuse me.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,hi everyone I am your Teacher and it's so great to see you all today i'm excited to work with you on trying to Oliverelop really complete answers.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,I just pulled you all together so that we could have a discussion about that question I wanted to go through each of your responses and talk a little bit about what evidence you are using to back up what you said.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Yeah, so that's why I wanted to pull you into this group so that we can have a little bit of a conversation about how to answer the question, fully",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"so then we can go forward and make sure that we're all on the same page about what, what did they use.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So, thank you. I'm gonna ask one more person for what their answer was, so I can gather all this information, we can use it to work together to find an even better answer.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Yeah, yeah, some great stuff. So we're, we're here today because we're going to think about when we're reading. How do we when there's lots of information in an article how do we focus on the information that we need. So sometimes when I'm reading, there's so much information. I have a hard time finding what I'm looking for.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,Because sometimes when there's so much information in the text. We want to make sure we know what we're looking for with information.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"what we're doing today, why have you guys in a group is because we're trying to go even further we're going to",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Try to elaborate on and expand our answers a little bit, I want to know what you guys",,,,
Teacher,220.1,are thinking on both with your original answer and your new answer um so i'm going to be asking each of you,,,,
Teacher,220.1,What your initial answer was if you have a new answer what that answer is um and we're going to talk about it a little bit so while i'm asking one of your classmates,,,,
Teacher,220.1,I want all of you to listen to what they have to say and think about their answers and see if it can help you get a little bit of new insight into the text,,,,
Teacher,220.1,Or we can strengthen your responses,,,,
Teacher,220.1,But what I want to help you and walk you through today is helping you to think about what exactly the question is asking you.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"wasting your own time, because we really want to think about moving forward in the future, how to answer questions to the best of our ability.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Yes, that's totally fair so on paragraph three i'm looking and everybody else should be looking in their texts that paragraph three, just so we can all look and think critically about this piece of evidence, to see if it matches our question um.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,I just wanted to hear more about what you thought and to see if we can take your answers and to sort of expand them a little more.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,Get more detail in there.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"So it's fantastic that you already know about space, but for today we're kind of looking at your ability to read and pull out information So could you take a look at your answer Luis.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Fellow peers about maybe some other responses and we can build your understanding of the resources that I provided you with the texts that we learned about how to answer a question, using a nonfiction text.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Okay, so you didn't does that make make you want to stay and listen to the responses of your friends now just to see if you can learn more about how hydrogen can be useful, and also to refine your answer further.",,,,
Luis,220.1,"Okay, I guess, so.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"But this is not about background knowledge or even knowing about space what we're working on today is we're practicing using text to support our answers, so our group is going to learn how to use text as evidence so that's why we're here today Luis.",,,,
Luis,220.1,Oh okay that makes sense.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"And will also give personalized feedback during this process, and finally, we will reflect on the strategies and thoughts that led us to the revised response.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,I am going to either pair you up with a partner or speak to you individually about your response and we'll kind of talk about why you wrote that response and maybe some ways that we could improve your response.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"Well, thanks for sharing your responses to the second question guys I think again, we have a great opportunity to take a look at the text to share with each other how we're thinking about this question and how we found our responses, using the text.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,And the timing starts now.,,,,
Jazmin,220.1,"Okay, so Chris, do you want to change your answer or Luis you want to change your answer.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,"And who knows, maybe we could also teach you something as well right? Because really what we're what we're kind of focusing on here at during this time is about how to also understand what the questions are asking you guys, right?",,,,
Teacher,220.1,so let's say we are taking a test right and you write down everything you know about space. But what if it doesn't answer the questions they're asking right?,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"so we're all here we're going to focus more on making sure that we understand the question that's being asked of us, okay? so we're going to practice, these skills.",,,,
Teacher,220.1,Great so I want us to take in consideration the context of the question and we're all going to analyze our responses and think about how we can improve them or make them stronger or maintain the quality of our responses.,,,,
Teacher,220.1,"each of you have an answer that hits one of those two parts, and so, for pretty much everyone in this group i'd like to offer some suggestions of how you might get both of those two parts in your answers.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"i'm glad you brought this up, because I was just about to ask what other answers people had, so why don't you share a little bit about what you were thinking with your answer.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Okay, so.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Luis why don't you tell me more about your answer what made you say what you said.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"That scientists use oxygen tanks, while cuz I know that's something that they have to do is if they're ever going to go to space.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"All right, Jazmin, can you tell me more about your answer what made you say NASA sent a small machine.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,yeah I don't understand why my answers wrong.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"would be, can you tell me more about this small machine",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,It looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater and it lands at the moon South pole.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Farrah, can you tell me more about your answer and why you said what you did.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,Oh yeah so my answer was i'm a.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so Oliver you had the same answer is Farrah, can you tell me why you put that answer as well.",,,,
Chris,230.1,"um yeah yeah, I can tell you Oh, you know what while he's looking did you I went to NASA and I do know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"yeah so Chris you're right Those are all great examples of equipment, so you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, can you tell me more about that answer.",,,,
Chris,230.1,"yeah i'm cause I was looking for where they were talking about looking for water because that's what the question was asking about discovering water and in the first paragraph, they they say that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"All right, hi everyone welcome, so thank you so much for those answers Chris, I want to start with your answer so Chris, can you tell me more about what made you say your answer.",,,,
Chris,230.1,yeah I was looking for.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"yeah, so why don't you tell me more about your answer, let me just say your answer.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"And I will, because I know that scientists use oxygen tanks to read.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Farrah and Oliver you had the same answer so Dave i'm going to ask you to start Oliver what made you say your answer.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"say more, why is it the answer to the question Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,i'm cause the questions asking arm what equipment data scientists used to discover water on the moon and i'm in this in this part of the story house.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Farrah was your reasoning similar to Olivers for why you said this answer was it different.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"um I mean, I guess, he was pretty similar yeah I don't understand why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,That is absolutely correct. And does anyone know. Can someone tell me what discover means?,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Yeah. And what are those two different things. We had discovering it and we have looking at it, what are those two words. What kind of words are those that we talked about earlier in this lesson.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um, synonym?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why are you confused. And then we'll talk about the answer.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Yeah. So I think when I'm confused by is, um, I guess that they have the microscope and they said that that's like a piece of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Right. So did you say you have a new answer.,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Yeah, I think so. I'm like, I think that I could see like Oliver and Farrah, said the lunar orbiter was the thing that that found it like that sounds like that's the answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Oliver and were you a person who said no. Can you tell me your answer and give me some of the thinking that you had in mind.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Yeah, I would love to. Unfortunately we do have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to share with you.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Excellent. Why would a microscope, help us see the water",,,,
Farrah,230.1,Because you need a microscope to look at things.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Because it's so it's so big, or it's so small.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,Because it's so small.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you tell me more?,,,,
Luis,230.1,I watch a lot of--,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, well, was there something else about the reading that you found interesting. Aside from the question itself.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,Okay. A lot of it was just like what was really interesting is that like with water. You could do like so much magic stuff plant and you do all kinds of stuff with water.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,You didn't find that in the reading. Is that what you said.,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Yeah, like I know they use it but like it wasn't in the reading when i when i read. I was wondering, like, should it have been there. You know what I mean.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Do you think that they took a microscope with them to the moon?,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"I don't know but but it says, tt says that they put they had a microscope in the story.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"I like the connection you made there. All right. Hey, Oliver can you tell me a little bit more why you like Farrahs answer.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"It's not that I liked her answer, you know, it's like like I had the same answer as her or like she had the same answer as me. You know, like we had the same answer, but it doesn't like like I had her answer, you know,",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you tell me more about what you think about the craters full of water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Thank you so much for reading. So, Chris, did we discover that the moon is wet or dry?",,,,
Chris,230.1,"Yeah. We know that the moon is dry. Okay, I get it.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why did you write down the answer that you did.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well, because I was looking at the word equipment and I remembered in science class.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"OK, and Oliver why did you, why did you put down the same thing in Farrah was your mind going the same way as hers?",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Oh well, kinda cuz yeah I'm in the same science classes her so when it said scientific tool. I was thinking about how we use tools for different things. And so I thought, equipment and tool was the same thing. So that's why I set the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,I saw where Farrah. Where you revised your answer. what made you change your mind. What made you change your answer.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Excuse me. I shouldn't be in this group, I already corrected my answer. And so I know mind correct now.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So Farrah. What made you change your answer?,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"You had told me before that, that the microscope looked at the, the, the water but but it didn't discover the water. So then I was trying to find another machine in the story.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, Chris and you revised you're in. So you put that the water. Scientists found on the moon was microscopic and we talked a little bit about that.  What made you change to change your answer.",,,,
Chris,230.1,When it said that the water was deep in the craters that that meant was like a poll that was really deep in there was a lot of water.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,What did you change your answer to,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,I added the name of the machine. I said NASA some to small machine called a lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"You didn't know anything about the water, so you didn't know that water meant the same thing as ice",,,,
Chris,230.1,"Well, I mean, I remember we learned that in science class, but I wasn't thinking about it. I was thinking more about like the just water. Water. You know, when I was reading. I was looking for the word",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you list off some equipment that they used,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Yeah okay so they use like they use oxygen tanks and they use masks and like, they must have us rocket fuel and like rocket ships and all that kind of stuff, you know,",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"What your what your answer was, and sort of how you got there. So I'd like to start with Farrah. So let's hear your answer. And how do you think you got to that answer.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"So I said, I'm you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and um I got their cars that was a piece of equipment and they were talking about looking at what",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"That's okay. Jazmin, absolutely you can. You could give me one moment, Jazmin, talk to me about why you're confused what's going on.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"The answer. I mean, I use. I said, I'm not too small machine, but I'm in this group. So why is my answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What were you looking for?,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Um, so I was saying like that you can use a microscope to see the water.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Well, let's look at what made you think of that.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Yeah. And what led you that answer.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,I'll pass that says I just kind of take a long time.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,And how did you gather that information.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Well, I knew it already.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So Chris. Did you read our passage,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Ah, um",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"And Farrah then, actually Oliver you agree with Farrah. Will you tell me where you found your answer.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um, yeah. So basically, um, okay. So where I found my answer was the same place that Farrah did in paragraph three",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What do you think,,,,
Chris,230.1,"I'm, um, I don't know. Cuz I feel like they. It doesn't say that there were astronauts. But how could they be in space if there weren't astronauts.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Luis What are you thinking,,,,
Luis,230.1,"I'm like, I'm like, I'm kind of thinking that, like, I understand. I gotta look at the paragraph, so I gotta see. So if I look at it after I looked at it and listen to Jazmin's answer like",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why do you say that,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Um, well, okay. So first off, I feel like I should even be in this group. Like, I know a lot about space. And I know all this stuff. Like, I don't have to do the reading to know that you need like oxygen tanks and all that other stuff. I already know that.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why did you choose that.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Yeah, so, um, I said that because on in paragraph three, it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"And I've looked over your answers. Luis, what was your answer again, and why do you think that's a good answer? What's--",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What are you confused about Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Well, because if if he got the right answer. Then I thought that I had the right answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay. And I want to ask you, do you know what we use a microscope for",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"I'm like, you know, you use it to like look at small things like in science we look at like bacteria and stuff like that.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"I see a lot of good thinking. And Farrah, I really loved how you dug in the text. And Oliver. It looks like you dug in the text to you're saying that you said the same thing as Farrah, you circled the same thing. Can you tell me a little bit more about how you got to that conclusion?",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um, yeah. So basically, like I circled the same thing, like in the paragraph three, where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay. All right. Jazmin. I know that you were talking about a small machine, which is what equipment is right? Yeah?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Farrah. How did you get to that answer.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"That's a really interesting question. Like, I got to the answer, partially by listening carefully to Jazmin. And her answer and to our discussions together.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What did you change your answer to Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Basicallt my answer was incomplete, and I was just saying small machine instead of like that. It was the lunar orbiter, you know what I mean?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"All right, you mentioned oxygen tanks. Why did you mention oxygen tank.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Um, so the reason that I mentioned it was because I know that like astronauts have to use oxygen tanks when they're going up into space and they have to use, like, stuff like that, in order to walk around.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, what does a microscope look for? how do you use it.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well, like you use it to like study something. And like look at something really closely, you know what I mean like you, you look at it like like small things.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Oh, well, what exactly does the microscope do to help you look at small thing.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Um, so I think if I remember it's like you. Um, okay. So in the text is said that, um, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, so like I guess it helps you look at small things.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"All right, is there anything else that they could look closely at besides the water with a microscope?",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um, well, like, I don't know. Like, what if, like, it's not really in the reading. But like you could look at germs and stuff.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you tell me where they found the water on the moon.,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Oh, they found it in the craters that were full of water.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Did they find it in the crater.,,,,
Chris,230.1,"I thought that, um, I thought that's what they said.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Teacher:So, with it being in the future. Oliver and Farrah, you mentioned that it's not ready. And no, not for a long time. Why do you think Farrah and Oliver that it's not valuable yet.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um, so I think that's not valuable yet because it seems like it would be really complicated to actually get the water to a place where you're like,",,,,
Teacher,230.1,How did you come up with your answer. Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Um, well, I saw the question asked about equipment and so I was looking for a paragraph that talks about equipment and water. And so I found it in paragraph three",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you elaborate a little more on your answer for what equipment did scientist used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um, yeah, I can totally do that. So I circled the same things as Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"No. Right. Okay, so where did you get oxygen takes from in your.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Well, cuz i i know a lot about space, you know i i watched some TV shows. And sometimes I'll watch Nova on YouTube.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Alright so Oliver. Will you explain your answer for me?,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Yeah, sure. Okay, so, um, I said no. It's not ready yet because. Last paragraph, they talking about how hard it will be and how it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money. So it doesn't look like they're ready to pick up any of the water from the moon. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, that's great. That's a great you know comment I would ask you, what, what do you think your question. What do you think the question is asking you.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Wow, okay. So, ah, the question is what equipment did like scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, um. Now what did they say the microscope was used for",,,,
Farrah,230.1,I'm like in the reading?,,,,
Teacher,230.1,In the passage. Yes. What does the word what what was a microscope used to do.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Okay, so, um, let's see, in paragraph three, they said the water they found is microscopic me wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it. You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Did they use a microscope to find the water,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Oh, like like",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so let's talk about that. Jazmin, did, why did you answer your question by using, by saying the words.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so you your answer, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope scope to look really closely, so I can. What made you say that",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well, it says, it says in the question that they're looking for the equipment that was used to discover. So I said, Okay, the key word is equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, what are you going to use the hydrogen and oxygen for",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, what do you mean by that.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um, well, I guess the waters, not like it's not like immediately ready to use like they were saying in the reading. You have to do all this stuff to to get it and it's like it's in just like these like small amounts you know we were saying from the last question. It's like microscopic",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, what do you mean by that.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well, okay, so you know how they were saying in the reading, kind of like what I've said like they need like all this",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why do you think a scientist would need a microscope to see the water.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"She said a microscope is used to see things that are really small. Why do you think the scientists would need to use the microscope to see the water. Yes, Oliver?",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um, okay. So basically you need a microscope to see the water because there's not much water on the like moon surface and you you have to look really closely to find it and see it.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Yes, that is what they sent. And Chris, what did they investigate when they got there?",,,,
Chris,230.1,"Oh well. So I think like they investigated the craters and they found them all full water, which was pretty cool.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What would that be valuable.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Oh yeah, having more room would be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So why did you guys think that what was your opinion about that. Well,",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"I was just kind of thinking you know about the fact that, um, that it said that they need to come up with a plan for extracting the water so it seemed like",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Jazmin, could you explain your answer to the rest of the group. Like, how did you come up with your answer.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Okay, so my answer was the NASA scientists small machine and I noticed that in the reading.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"All right, Farrah. I noticed you said that the scientists were using a microscope, um, could you and Oliver try and explain why you picked microscope?",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Um, yeah. Okay, so basically the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Well, Luis if you already know a lot about space. Can you go ahead and explain why you pick the answer that you did.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Yeah, sure. Okay, so I was talking about how scientists need a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, you know, cuz they can't breathe on the moon. And so they're gonna need oxygen tanks to go on the moon to do",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"But I'm a little concerned with Farrah and Oliver on your responses, because you both said no, there was not convincing evidence. So I want to know from either of you why you say there was not enough to convince you that the water is valuable.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so, Farrah. You told us that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Did you understand",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Did you understand you answer?,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Yeah, so I, my answer was, in paragraph three, and I said on that said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. So you need the the microscope to see the water",,,,
Teacher,230.1,You said that you circled the same as Farrah. What did you understand,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um, so yeah, I basically did the same thing as Farrah. I looked at the same paragraph and it said that, um,",,,,
Teacher,230.1,You understand that answer?,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Yeah, so like I guess there's like all these craters. They got all this kind of water and all this stuff like um so they got like lots of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Yeah, how did you come up with that answer. Can you share with your, your students Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you tell me a little bit more about that.,,,,
Luis,230.1,Maybe I didn't. Maybe I didn't really read the text very much because I kind of knew about space.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you tell me why you thought it was a small machine.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Yeah. Okay, so in paragraph two, in the first sentence, it says a NASA sent a small machine called a lunar oribtor to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So that's one thing that they used. And so we can also collaborate and talk about what that small machine did right?,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Yeah, yeah",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What kind of machines do they use? Can you go a little further with that Luis?,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Yeah, sure. Um, they use oxygen masks and they use spacesuits and they use the like the space shuttle itself that's that's also a machine to you want you want me to say more, because I know like a lot more machines too",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"And why is that a big deal. How, what can I use the hydrogen and oxygen for",,,,
Chris,230.1,"Well, you could show you can breathe oxygen and you can drink the water that's a big deal.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Like what?,,,,
Luis,230.1,Like lots of things.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay so Farrah, they do use microscopes right?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Right. And is that lunar orbiter on the moon?,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Ah, well it's a story and I mean the stories about water on the moon. So, um, oh yeah, yeah, it says it in the second sentence, but it will land at the moon. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Do you know if it had,,,,
Teacher,230.1,A more specific name.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Oh, it was a small machine but didn't have a specific name.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"What's your quick what's, what are you, I'm sure.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Well, I think I, I think I answered the question. This time, and I added more detail to my answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,and Luis Can you tell me a little bit about your answer. You said water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. So how can that make it valuable.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Wow, I mean you that that's okay. So I saw that in a story and that seemed like that was important.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Well, I bet you do know a lot about space specifically and what you said, Why did you talk about oxygen tanks as the equipment.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Because I know that I'm TO GO TO THE MON astronauts have to use oxygen tanks, because they can't breathe on the moon without it.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"All right, Chris. So you talked about",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"and Jazmin. So you specified that they use small machines. Why did you, why did you look for. Why did you say that they use small machines.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Well, because I was looking for the name of up the equipment. Um, and so I I only saw two things in the arm. The story but machine. I know his equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So why did you say they use microscopes.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,Because that's what they used to look for water.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, very good. You said no because not not for a long time. Why did you say not for a long time.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Because it's gonna take a while for us for the astronauts to be able to find out if it's if it is valuable, or not.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So, Luis, the water can be. You said that water can be split into two parts. Why did you tell me, water can be split into two parts.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Um, because I found it in the story and I know you told me last time that I have to look into it. Look in the text for my answers and not just because I know it already. And so",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Now, why did you, why did you choose to tell me about that when answering this question.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Mm hmm. So that would be good. What it is that does that convince you that it would be good to have the water,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, it'd be good, so that they could drink it. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that sounds good.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Chris, you talk to me about water being heavy. Why did you choose to talk to me about that.",,,,
Chris,230.1,"Well, all because that was in the",,,,
Teacher,230.1,They you said they're not ready yet. Why did you say they're not ready yet.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um, well, because at the end, it says, making this plan will take a lot of time and money, they will need to study the moon surface and build new equipment. So, I mean, they don't have all of that stuff yet so so clearly they they are not ready for for getting water off the moon.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so it lands where?",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,On the moon.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So, Oliver, you said that was your answer too, so that's awesome. Can you tell me what that means.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Yeah, I can because they're talking about how you need a microscope to look really closely at the water. And so, and a microscope is basically a scientific tool, but the scientific tools also equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so it is an equipment. What does this equipment do? If I put something under a microscope, what does it do?",,,,
Oliver,230.1,It helps you look at stuff.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,So when you are listening and answering this question. How did you get to that answer.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Would you like to share how you found that or why you chose microscope.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, well, can you tell me why you might have chose that answer. What made that microscope stick out to you.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"I'm not really sure. Like I feel like I guess it's just because it's a piece of equipment and I know that, like we're we're working on the small group. So we can we can kind of get the right answer, but I'm not really sure why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Very good. And what made you think about the craters on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Wow, what were you using it to find?",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um, we were looking at DNA, like we did a, like a like a swab of our cheek and we were looking at like DNA cells. It was really interesting.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Yeah. So let's talk about that just a little bit. So what made you choose that as your answer.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"The question was asking about equipment and so I was looking for where the worst equipment and so the microscope. I know his equipment and also I was looking for where they talked about water and in this paragraph, they talk about the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Will you tell me what what,,,,
Teacher,230.1,your thought process was for answering that.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Well, well, like you said, you know, I know a lot about space. And I know that you can't breathe on when you go to the moon. So they need oxygen tanks in order to breathe on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What made you choose the word microscope. What made you choose that word.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Okay, so I looked at the key words in the question and I thought the key word for equipment and discuss and when I looked at the reading. What I saw was that the microscope was something,",,,,
Teacher,230.1,I think that we can add some more to your answer to make it a little bit stronger. Can you tell me why you put NASA send a small machine and nothing else.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So that is true. It does talk about water being heavy, how come you responded with that.",,,,
Chris,230.1,So I was thinking when I was looking at it that well. Okay. So I was thinking the waters heavy and you have to take it on the spaceship.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So we need to figure out yours and Farrah's.You kind of both have very similar responses. So Luis Oh no, sorry, Oliver, you talk, you said no. It's not ready yet. So what do you mean by that.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um, so I guess it's kind of, it's kind of interesting. So I when I mean it's not ready yet, like the water that's on the moon isn't really ready for us to do yet. So, um, it's kind of like, it seems like it would be really hard like so they asked if there was convincing evidence",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"You had responded similar and you had said no, not for a long time. So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable and you responded with no not for a long time. Do you care to kind of explain your answer a little bit more?",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Yeah, absolutely. So I, I wish I could unfortunately because you have to go",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So Oliver, I see that you had circled the same answer as Farrah. How come you do that.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So did you find that on your own prior to Farrah writing that or did you kind of just copy that?,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Oh, that's a, that's a fair question. Um, but I found it on my own.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"And then if you look at Jazmin's answer. It says, NASA send a small machine. What was the name of that small machine.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Or how did you come to that conclusion.,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Um, so I kind of was like, um,",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Good. Okay. Now, Oliver, you said you circled the same response as Farrah. Can you explain what you mean by that.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um, yeah. So basically, Farrah, and I both thought that that the microscope was the thing that they used to discover the water",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, how would they be able to use a microscope to discover water in your opinion.",,,,
,230.1,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why do you think that,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Okay, well in the last paragraph. It says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money. So it sounds like that. They don't have the money and it'll take a long time.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"But if they could get to it. And after a while, with the water evaluable once they were able to get to it. What do you think",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"I mean all yeah cuz water, it's definitely important. So I guess if they could get to it, it would be. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Jazmin, you mentioned that That the astronauts would need water to drink and to stay hydrated. Right. And why do you think that. Why is that true?",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Okay, because, well, you know, like we need water to drink. Um, and I feel like I read it in my book I read it in the story where they talked about that they need water to drink.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Yeah, and so that would make it valuable right",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,Yeah yeah cuz you need to drink.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Why do you think it would be valuable if they can get water on the moon, rather than taking it with them?",,,,
Chris,230.1,"How could it be soluble if they could take water on the arm instead of waters. Okay, so I said it was heavy",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Say that we do have enough money. And we do have enough time to get the water from the moon would then it be valuable?,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"I mean, yeah. Cuz, cuz you know water is valuable. Yeah, okay. Water is valuable.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So, Farrah, what, what did you mention in terms of the ability to find the water. You mentioned you would use a scientific tool called a microscope. Why would they need to use a microscope.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well, what I mean. Cuz it said that in the story that was like the last sentence of the stories you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So what made you think that that was the type of equipment that they used,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"I'm teacher. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch. Thanks for taking my time to work with us.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Right, right, Oliver. And you say that there wasn't enough convincing evidence. What makes you believe that there's not enough convincing evidence",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Equipment water. Okay, why did you circle equipment.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um I circled equipment, because they're asking in the question they're saying what equipment Did the scientists used to discover the water so it seems like the answer would have to be some kind of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Discover. All right. And why did you circle discover,,,,
Farrah,230.1,Discover because they were asking like you know what I mean like what they found the water like discovers like something that you like found the first time and asking like what equipment found the water,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Oh. So, what makes you think you could grow a garden on the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Because they talk about the water and they said, like the astronauts could be able to drink the water eventually and and be hydrated and you can't survive without water.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,How did you know that water's heavy,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Oh well, cuz okay so I actually knew already because, um, well I guess they said it in the reading, but they but like I knew that because I visited NASA and I know all about NASA. And I could tell you that water is like one of the heaviest things they have to carry on a spaceship.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What is it you know about space.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Oh man, I know all this stuff like rocket launches and like equipment and like all this stuff that like people would would use to go into space and like, you know what I mean, like, all kinds of stuff.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so that sounds good. Thank you. Luis But let's let's go back to our question about the equipment used on the moon. So let's go back and look at our responses here. Now I did notice Farrah and Oliver had the same response. So which one of you would like to explain your response.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so I Luis so you think are you know a lot about space. So, what makes you think that you wouldn't want to be part of this group, though.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Well, cuz you know when you're working with us because we we didn't have the right answer. Um, so you wanted to talk to us. So I feel like I kind of know everything.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so what's confusing you Jazmin. Let's see.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Um, can you expand on maybe your answer of a small machine.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Okay, so basically it's like the thing that they sent up to the moon to go in and like to find the water",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so what is, what is that thing. What is it called",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,It's called the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,What do you know about microscopes.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Um, so microscopes are like these things that you use to like study something closely, like if if something's really small, then you like look at it that way.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,How is it used on the moon.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Well, does it pertain to our article?",,,,
Chris,230.1,"Yeah, definitely.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,and how do you know this.,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Um, well, I guess I just kind of know that you know what I mean like that that waters really heavy and it, it's really hard to set it in a spaceship because humans need water, and it makes spaceships really",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Okay. Can you tell me why you chose Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Well, it just kind of looked like the, you know, man. Like it just kind of looked like the other like the machine, you know, they said, like what equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay. So when you say the small machine. Are you talking about the Lunar Orbiter, or the microscope?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"And what do you know, have you heard the word lunar orbiter before. Do you know that phrase.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So I just didn't really know what to like what to circle I just figured. Yeah, but I know in the lunar orbiter is",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Okay. Do you know what a microscope is,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Yeah. Yeah, it's like what you look in like a like a like a magnifying glass. But it's like you look at smaller things",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why do you think equipment is the most important word,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Um, because it's like the first noun in the question.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Water now Chris. Why do you think water is the most important question or word,,,,
Chris,230.1,"The whole the whole story is called water on the moon, so.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,All right. And what do you have figured out,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Okay, so I read the story and I looked for the evidence and I pulled something right out of the story and not out of my big massive brain.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What are you confused about.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well, cuz I found a different answer. And so if if they're right that it could be valuable. But what the story says that I'm",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why do you think it is a valuable resource Oliver.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Okay cause on the thing that Jazmin said about drinking it. I mean, like everybody needs to drink water. And then rocket fuel seems like pretty important you know you need rocket fuel in order to go to space.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"That would be crazy if there's a moon base on the moon, then that means what, what do you think that would mean",,,,
Chris,230.1,That they could use the fuel to like fill up the rocket and then to go back home.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,If we can refill up on the moon.What do you think that would mean,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you tell me some facts from the story that we read?,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Yeah, sure. Okay, so like astronauts go to space cuz are looking for water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Do you know what people are called when they go to space, like what is their job title.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Yeah, they're astronauts",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Good job. Oliver, what made you come up with your answer choice.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Well, I know that the question was asking for water. And I know that we have to find equipment. So I was looking for a place where they talked about discovering the water.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Chris, when you talk about scientists found craters will have water on the moon. How did you come up with that answer",,,,
Chris,230.1,"Yeah, sure. Cuz question was asking, you know them, finding the water like like how Oliver said, so I was looking at the text.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, Justin. Why did you underline discover",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"And so basically I repeat visits as he like the question say like, what did they use to define the water or like discovered the water so it seems like that would be",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So I saw responses and Oliver. My question for you just, you said that you sort of the same thing is Farrah. So can you explain how you also got the same answer for me.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um, yeah. So basically what I was thinking about was that, um, you know, like that the microscope was was the tool. And the reason why I thought that, and I think it's like",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What do you say that,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Um, yeah. Well actually it's a really good question. I think that why like here's my thinking on this like",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Wondering about that. In what way.,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Well, like it wasn't in the in the meeting, but I was thinking like they had to use it, you know, so like I was thinking maybe that's the answer with the equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Hello. So I saw your responses to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Um, Farrah, how did you come up with your answer.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Okay, so I got my answer from paragraph three and I basically was thinking like you have to use the microscope to see the water. If you were going to like discover it. How could you discover it without without seeing?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Chris, what do you have to say about your answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Chris. What are you thinking,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Um, so, like, I'm kind of just, I'm kind of thinking",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, I'm going to start with Farrah Farrah, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to really look closely, what made you say a microscope Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"So I was thinking about like what equipment like I know about microscopes from like science class. And so I was thinking like, you know, if you want to see like the water and it's really small that you could only find it with a microscope, you know what I mean?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So could you tell me what made you say the oxygen tanks.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Um, yeah, yeah. So I was seeking about oxygen tanks, because, like, well, okay, so I was seeing whenever I see like movies with astronauts or whenever I think about like like watching a moon launch or whatever. I think like the astronauts would have to have",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Chris. Let's look at yours. You said a scientist found craters full of water on the moon. Could you explain a little bit more to me about how you came up with that answer.,,,,
Chris,230.1,"I was thinking that when they were saying in the reading like they were saying, okay, so there's ice deposits in the polar crater.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Oliver. Let's look at yours that you told me that you circled the same as Farrah. So could you explain to me where you come up with your answer.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,What do you believe it means,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,It means something that is small,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, great. So what made you choose those two words.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Um, well, I chose them because I think that that's the equipment that the scientists you use. And I think that that tells us why.  It's the equipment, because it says that the waters microscopic and then you can't see it without the microscope. So I'm thinking like, you know, you can't find it. If you can't see it",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"They need a small machine. Could you elaborate on that, what exactly do you mean by a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"And what made you say that answer in relation to the question that was asked, and the text that you read",,,,
Luis,230.1,"So I thought, well, in terms of the question. I was thinking like what did they use to discover the water",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why did you say microscopes in relation to that question.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,And what was your thinking when you said that is your answer. Why is that valuable that it can be broken into oxygen and hydrogen.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why does that make water valuable.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"I was thinking, looking at the meeting because I made sure to look this up and I said, like they said, I'm",,,,
Teacher,230.1,and why does that make it valuable. What's your thinking there.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Okay and and what exactly do you mean when you say it's not ready yet?,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Like the water. First off, like the water is ice. So you know what I mean, like, you'd have to make it into something that you could bring and then like they said in the writing. They said like later on in it. They talked about how",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Do you remember what that machine was,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,No.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Awesome. What is the microscope D.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Is when you can look at things that are like really, really small.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why do you think that they have to use mass to breathe on the moon.,,,,
Luis,230.1,Cash because there isn't the same kind of air that we breathe here. So we can't breathe that era there.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,What were those two parts that you said,,,,
Luis,230.1,Hydrogen and oxygen.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so, um, Miss Farrah, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. What do you know about a microscope.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,So a microscope is like something that you like you use to see something that's really small.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so yes, they used a small machine. Does anybody, anyone have the specific name of the machine?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,You want to explain that?,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Um, yeah. So like, you know, like is there convincing evidence that of water on the moon could be valuable?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Mmmhmm, about what?",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"I had a different answer from from them, but if they're all right, then the my answers right too?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Not for a long time, why do you think not, for a long time.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Because the story says that it'll take a lot of time and a lot of money um and they'd have to build new equipment and do you think this will be a good investment, so I said no.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay i'm glad that you're feeling more confident um, why do you think you are feeling more confident.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Okay, because I I get it now that i'm supposed to like you know.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So where are you confused Farrah,,,,
Farrah,230.1,Okay um because it asks is if it's valuable right.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"That -you did discover that they use oxygen tanks. That was really good. However, can you elaborate? How did they use oxygen tanks to find water on the moon?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"That was a great answer so Oliver you circle, the same as Farrah what led you to seeing that a microscope is a piece of equipment that the scientists used.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,well.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,What led you to finding that waters are full craters are full of water on the moon.,,,,
Chris,230.1,In the first paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Now Luis your answer was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks what made you think of oxygen tanks is a piece of equipment that scientists used.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Okay, so I know about space, and I know that they can't breathe up in space and like Chris said, you know they use a lot of different equipment and so on oxygen tank is one that they have to use.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,i'm so Farrah your your response to it was no not for a long time um what what made you say that well cuz.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"In the story at the end of the story, they talked about how.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Oliver, why did you circle. The same thing that Jazmin didn't",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What was your reason,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Oh, that that's a good question. So okay, so my reasoning was basically that okay I agree that you need a scientific tool called a microscope like that's the equipment that the scientists use",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"and, why did you circle the same as Farrah?",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Okay, so here's what I thought was I was looking for equipment right because it said what equipment did the.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,and also how was your answer answering the question,,,,
Luis,230.1,"um so I didn't really need to read it, because I already knew the answer, because I know a lot about space, so I knew already that that scientists had to use that.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,yeah So let me ask you now How does that answer what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,You do?,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you explain what that means.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,When she read her answer. She had circled the last sentence. I'm an animal story and I I circled the last sentence and the story to,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why did you circle the last sentence?,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"On cars. Well, though the question asked about equipment and so I was looking for, like, an equipment and and I saw the microscope, and I know that that's equipment. Of course, we use it in science class.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so what made you say that, why did you say that.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Well, I said because there's a sentence at the beginning of Part two that says that.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"You could say, can you explain what you mean.",,,,
Luis,230.1,yeah so I could say lunar orbiter and microscope and oxygen tanks and masks on suits.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Teacher:but then I also want you to tell me the evidence that you have that makes you that made you come up with this quick answer.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,yeah what are you confused about telling me.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well, my answer is that i'm there it's not ready it won't be ready for a long time.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What won't be ready.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,The water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,And she went first and you're telling me that that's why you circled it but can you tell me why you what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,yeah sure I have the same answer as her because I I think it's the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can I just ask you what made you say that.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"I know a lot about space, astronauts can't breathe up there. So boom oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So I want to i'm I just want to wonder what made you say that.,,,,
Chris,230.1,"was looking for the keywords like how you said to Jazmin you know from the question because it talked about the question was asking about water on the moon so then in that first paragraph, I saw that it was also talking about water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,And Jazmin. Why do you think that is the correct answer to the question.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Um, cuz well we we got the answer sheet. And so I know our answers didn't all get 100 on them. And so that's why we got pulled into this group. And so the teacher told us that was the answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Can I ask you why, if you knew that you didn't write that in your answer.",,,,
Chris,230.1,That wasn't what they were asking I was trying to answer the question.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you tell me why you chose the microscope as the answer？,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"yeah so my thinking was that Okay, so if you're trying to play, you have to first be able to see it.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Did you work with Savannh on this question?,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"um I did the first time, and then I heard her say lunar orbiter and now I know it's the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Can you tell me why you picked that as your answer, I'm not saying it's wrong, but I want to hear where you're coming from with that.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Yes, so I was thinking.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Did you work with Farrah on the question.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,Oh yeah we work together a lot of help each other out.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you elaborate on that response.,,,,
Chris,230.1,That's interesting because I was thinking about crater. So you were saying that the question is like what equipment so well.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So, Oliver. I see that you said that you. I mean, you were all working in a small group which is great. You're using each other to help one another. But why did you circle, the same thing as Farrah. What did you fully understand this question. Do you need me to to re explain it. Why did you think it is a right answer?",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"I had kind of the same thinking and what I was thinking was basically that like the water was microscopic and I was thinking like, you can't. You know what I mean, like,",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you tell me why that's That was what your That was what you said.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Oh yeah okay um so cuz I was looking for like you said, the arm the words in a question I was looking for equipment and water on the moon, and I saw in paragraph three.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"and Oliver so Oliver, can you tell me why you circled the same thing as Farrah?",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"um yeah cuz I was looking for all of the key words in the question, like how you said.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Right, but why, why is it important to include both of those names of the tools.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,because  they used both of them to find the water.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,So did you think about how that knowledge relates to the question and the story that we read?,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So Deb, you said you circled the same thing as Farrah. What is, what does that mean to you, why did you highlight that answer.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Well cause when you asked everybody to say their answers and Farrah said hers, and I realized that she had the same thing that I had, I talked about the microscope and the story, the part where it says that they",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you explain a little bit more. Why you circle that,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Yeah possible question asked about equipment and asked about looking at water. And when I read the story that I only saw this was the only time where they talked about an equipment, looking at the water",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"All right, yeah of course Okay, so you told me that you circled the same answer Farrah could you tell me what the answer was.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"um yeah so basically I was saying that they use the microscope in order to find the water, because you know they couldn't they couldn't find the water unless they could see.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"For a couple of you guys so deb could you go more in depth with your answer, I know you did circle, the same as Farrah, but I want to know why you did, or if you had something else you wanted to add to yeah.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Sure sure Okay, let me look at what I circled in a story.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,awesome So what do you think the answer was just to make sure that i'm hearing you correctly.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,um they used a microscope to find water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Okay i'm Jazmin Do you remember what you were thinking about when you were saying the machine before looking.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"i'm looking at the story now, so I can see it, it says NASA small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Farrah do you want to talk about more about what you were talking about before do you have a house.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"yeah cuz, I guess, I was just trying, I was listening to what you said to Oliver.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"I just was wondering, so you said no, not for a long time what was your thinking when saying that like did you not find any information from the article that might have helped you well, I don't.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"know I think I was thinking that because the article says that it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money, so that means that you can't use it for a long time.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, what about you def could you like tell me more about what you were thinking about when saying your answer before yeah.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Well, I said it's not ready yet, because the same thing on Okay, at the end of the story, it says scientists need to come up with a plan.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So let's actually go to you now, Luis. So you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. What other equipment have they used on the moon with the water?",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Well, they have to wear spacesuits and gravity boots so that they can walk. I'm not sure what other equipment they need.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Perfect, great. Jazmin, I see that you were talking about a small machine. Is that the machine you were talking about?",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Yeah, so I don't understand why my answer's wrong.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,It's not wrong at all. I would just like to hear a little bit more detail. I want to know a lot more of what you know about it. So tell me about the machine.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"OK. OK, I don't remember. NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate. OK, so it's a small machine and it's called a Lunar Orbiter and it investigates.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"That's really cool, I love that. Did you learn about the Lunar Orbiter at all when you were at NASA?",,,,
Chris,230.1,"No, no, we saw the Mars Rover, but I don't remember seeing anything about a Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"The difference between the two answers and what looking back at looking back at the reading told you, can you tell me the.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Right, so why do you think that your second answer was the right answer.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Because, in the first instance I only said that well I said the microscope but that's not the piece of it that actually found the ice the water, like you, like you could study the ice in a microscope when it was the Lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Good and how did you come to that conclusion.,,,,
Chris,230.1,"um well, I was because i'm the well because the teacher asked about it, and what I was like asking if it was a lot of water or a little water, and I was saying, well, actually, it was when I had to go back you I saw that it was just a little bit of water.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Right um, can you tell me a little bit why you think that",,,,
Farrah,230.1,yeah cuz well basically like um well first off like they only have a little bit of it and it spread over like all sorts of places like.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Right um so kind of wha,t kind of the same thing I was sent to Farrah, can you tell me.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why it's not ready.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"yeah cuz Well, we know that the water is super small it's microscopic and it's really like all mixed in with dirt and everything so like i'm thinking that like.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So what makes you think.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"You wrote the same thing. What did you, why did you circle those things?",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Because, well, um",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"What do you know, so why don't you what are you confused about why don't you share so we can try to figure it out and work through it.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Okay, so.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Well, there is always textual evidence, but it's good to bring back our knowledge as well that could help you bring the text to life. So you and Luis kind of have similar responses. So can you elaborate more on like background knowledge that you have? Also oxygen tanks and spacesuits, things like that.",,,,
Chris,230.1,"Like you have to use equipment. If you're going into space. And I guess I guess the yeah yeah i mean i know a lot about like use like rocket fuel and you have use stuff like that, you know what I mean",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What makes you think you got all figured out.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Okay, because you know I mean I already know that they found water on the moon, I already know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff so i'm good.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So is this from prior knowledge that you like read or seen the show, or is it that you, you like you have a really good understanding of the text.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Well, I mean I I read a lot of stuff about space and I watch Nova on PBS so yeah like I have a lot of prior knowledge about this already.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What made you say that.,,,,
Luis,230.1,Okay okay that part I did see somewhere in this store.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,What are you confused about.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Well, because.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So, in your answer, why did you choose that.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"I guess, similarly to what it is that I was looking for something that was like equipment and and I was also looking for where they would like discover the water and so that was a piece of equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,it's the microscope and the Lunar orbiter so I want you to tell me why you chose those ones now what made you change your thinking.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Because because that's what i'm Jazmin had and what Farrah had, and you, you told them that was correct.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Really, so do you think they could use the Lunar orbiter or the microscopes to bother there and find it the water yeah yeah.",,,,
Chris,230.1,i'm wondering if maybe they would just leave some stuff there so that they can keep building up a whole piece there and then they can leave their their tools and equipment on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So let's Farrah, why do you think you need a microscope to look at the water on the moon.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"um Okay, a couple of reasons, one we've been using microscopes in science class and our teacher had us look at little water molecules water drops under the microscope so I know that they do that, and then, when I was reading the story in paragraph three, is the last sentence, it says.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why did you circle the same as Farrah?,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Well, I was looking in the story for equipment and looking for water, and in paragraph three, they say the water they found is microscopic so that's the place where they found the water and then the name of the equipment and that one is the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, Farrah. We're going to start with you. So you answered the question of what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. And your answer was that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. How did you get to that answer?",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Reach Every Reader:Well I was looking at the at the text. And I thought about the fact that the question asked about equipment. And so I was looking for some things that was equipment. And then the question also asked about water. And so I saw in paragraph three, that they were talking about finding the water and they were talking about the microscope, which is equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay. So Oliver, I see that you just answered the same as Farrah. Did you read the article.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Yeah yeah I had the same answer that Farrah did, that  they were asking about finding water and I'm paragraph three talks about finding water.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Mm hmm. Very good. Can you elaborate on that. Does it say what the name of the small machine is,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Could you tell me more about where you think we could have a moon garden or expand on that idea a little bit more. I want to, I want to see what you've imagined in your head.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Yeah. Well, if there's water.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Excellent. And how does that make the water on the moon valuable to astronauts.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"I can't remember, it sounds pretty cool.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Either you can explain why did you circle that.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"yeah I can say that, so, well it's right there in the text, and I know we have to find something in the text and well, that is a scientific tool it's equipment and we know we need equipment for the answer to the question.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So could you walk me through your answer a little bit explain your reasoning behind it.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Oh yes, okay well it's it's right there in part two, and it says that NASA send a small machine and it its job was to look in that in the craters at the ice deposits, and I think that means that that's how they found the water.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,But while I do that I was hoping that maybe you could reread your answer. Think in your brain. What made you answer that.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Well, first, Luis, before I became um what made you think that was the correct answer. When you read the question what relied talk me through it.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Okay, so it said what equipment to the scientists use to the spot or the water on the moon. And so if there are scientists and they're all my own that gonna need. I need a lot of things, but they're definitely gonna need oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Awesome. Okay, it's Jazmin. So I was wondering, what can you talk me through your answer.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Yeah. So I said, NASA sent a small machine, and I, I don't understand why that's wrong.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So Chris. Can you talk me through your answer really quick.,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Actually, I just looked at the clock.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why do you think that,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Well, because I got some little story. They say you need the Lunar Orbiter to investigate like Jazmin and Luis set, but I guess. Also, I mean if the water so small. Like Farrah and Oliver said, then you need a microscope, because how can you, how can you discover it. If you can't see it.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Do you know what this machine is called,,,,
Teacher,230.1,How did you guys arrive that you're thinking,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Luis I'm hearing that your dad's an astronaut. I'm wondering if that was what helped you come at your answer. I like,,,,
Teacher,230.1,What do you think you would have needed to see from this text to be convinced that it was valuable.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Oh, I think maybe I'm that",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Um, can you tell me more about this.",,,,
Chris,230.1,"Um, oh okay I'm oxygen and hydrogen could be used as rocket fuel.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Can anyone tell me how it feels, answering these opinion questions.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"And you said the crater of water, that is a fact, what made you say that?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, Farrah. Why did you circle equipment.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well, because when it says equipment. That means you have to look for, like, a tool for your answer. And so I said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope and so I don't understand why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why did you say equipment.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Yeah, I think, for the same reasons that Farrah, and I know because I know so much about space. I know there's so much equipment that you need and like you can't do anything without equipment. So it just seems like really important you know?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Discover okay why discover?,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Well, because that's sort of like the action, like what they did.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Do you have a name for the small machine.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Oh yeah, it's the Lunar Orbiter. We've been talking about it like this whole time.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Um, I know that does sound funny. So, what makes you think that the scientists were on the moon with the microscope.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Like, I mean, that's what I mean that's why i mean i don't think they use a microscope, because I don't think there were any astronauts there.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Yeah, jazz Jazmin's answer was right. But do you know why that is.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well,",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Let me ask Jazmin. Can you clarify to us Why you chose the lunar orbiter in your revised answer.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Yeah, so",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, awesome. Farrah. And what made you say that",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"So they talk about the microscope in, in part, in part three. And they say, the water is microscopic and so you wouldn't be able to see it. If you didn't have a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Oh, okay. So first, tell me what made you say that NASA sent a small machine.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,Well they say that in part two that they sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, Chris. So what made you. What made you choose this answer.",,,,
Chris,230.1,"Okay, well, so the text is. It's called water on the moon. And so I figured the answer should be about the water on the moon. And they found it in the craters like these critters full over water.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Oh, okay. So, why, why do you think the microscope is the correct answer.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Well, how can you discover something if it's too small to see",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, awesome. So you said that the scientists need oxygen tanks and what made you say this",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Well, I mean, since I know so much about space. I just know that if if you're gonna have people on the moon. They can't do anything if they don't have oxygen tanks and really like lots of equipment and stuff.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Chris when you've said that you found craters full of water. How big do you think the craters were?.,,,,
Chris,230.1,They were pretty big because they're on the moon and stuff and and I actually went to NASA.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Yeah. So what would you need a small machine for what did they use it for,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"What it says, then you start to investigate. That's the word they use in paragraph two.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So they used it to investigate. what makes you think that it's small.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Just because they use that word in the sentence. They say they say NASA sent a small machine. So I was just, I was using that word because it was in the story.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So you said that they had sent a small machine. Did you mean that this small machine helped to discover the water on the moon.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Yes. Yeah, so that was my answer. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, let's take a look at your answer. So you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and Farrah. Can you just clarify for me when you said you'd need a microscope to look really closely. What do you mean, what are they looking closely at",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"So they're looking closely to find the water because it says that it's microscopic the water is so they're looking at the, the really small water with the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Great Farrah, can you build to your answer. What else was that article about water.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you add any other details.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Well, excuse me. This is Luis I should",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What else was the article about Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well, it was also about the fact that the moon is a desert and",,,,
Teacher,230.1,But I want you to think about what made your mind think that,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"What made your mind, find that answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So thank you for sharing. I'm happy that you work with Farrah. Did you get any answer independently.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Oh yeah, I mean, I mean, we both just thought, if the same answer. I mean, so I thought the microscope and she thought our microscope. Um, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,And everyone's going to have an assigned partner to work with in with your partner. I want you to share your answer and explain why you had that answer for two minutes and then I want our partners to switch in the person who did not share will then share,,,,
Teacher,230.1,And explain to your partner. Why you found that answer.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why is that your answer?,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Okay, well, um, it said a piece of equipment and a microscope is equipment and you need it to look at the water",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Okay. And why not,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Well, you don't use them for discovering you just use them for breathing.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Excellent. And what did you did you work with your partner just now.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Um, yeah, it was Oliver. He said he thought my answer was wrong, but I definitely don't agree.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why not,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Well, if there's astronauts on the moon. They need oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Okay. What are you,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Um, I understand what you're saying. Cause the lunar orbiter sounds like it's still right answer, but I had the same answer. Also Farrah and I guess I'm just not sure, like how I would know that my answer is wrong, without without you telling us it's the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, why does that make it a valuable resource that's exactly true, that it can be broken down into two parts. But if we read on, and we get the complete idea if we finish the, the thought in the text and we keep reading. We may learn why that's important. Why does that make it valuable.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Um,",,,,
Teacher,230.1,And why do you think that's an important part of the question.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Well, I think it means that you can't just like think of something on your own, but you have to read what's in the story.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Why do you think valuable, tell me more, please.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,I think we need to come up with reasons why the water would be like important. That's another meaning for valuable.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Yes. So why is that valuable.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why is that important.,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Oh, okay, here it is. Um, so they need oxygen. The astronauts need oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Oh go ahead and tell us what you got figured out.,,,,
Luis,230.1,um I meant more like I have it figured out like I can go back to my seat.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"hmm that's so what, why is that such an important thing.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Well, because you can have those chemicals.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Is that why you found that piece of information as a key piece.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,yeah it's like yeah I think that's why water is valuable.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,what did you mean by that.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"And Luis did your background knowledge help you, with your answer to the question I see that you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, is that did you think about that from your background knowledge.",,,,
Luis,230.1,um yeah because if.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Chris and I just sorry or Sir, could you please just explain your answer a little bit to me.",,,,
Chris,230.1,sure.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,How can you come up with this answer?,,,,
Chris,230.1,um yeah so I was looking for the,,,,
Teacher,230.1,yeah just me and you tell me oh watch confuse you.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Yes, Okay, so you asked me what the name of it was in so I see that the name of the machine is the Lunar orbiter and but then I guess I don't know like do I just have to add that, to my answer, I guess, I don't know what when i'm supposed to write for my answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Discover, why did you pick the term discover",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,Because it sort of tells you what the machine what the equipment does,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Farrah and Oliver. I want to, to ask you why you think that the water is not ready yet or isn't going to be for a long time. What made you say that",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well, I guess I think I got it from the last part of the of the story. Part six because it says that in order to use the water it will take a lot of time and money. So it's not like they could just go to the moon and drink the water today.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Oliver. What made you say that it's not ready yet?,,,,
Teacher,230.1,when you said just then that there wasn't a lot of it. Does that mean that you think that it would be worthwhile or not to find it.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"No, I didn't really think of that.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Do you think that that would convince you that it's worthwhile.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"You know, I think the rocket fuel on the sounds pretty useful, but I think",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"I actually have a follow up question for you. Um, what made you. What made you say that as your answer what stuff. What really stood out to you. Why did you say that",,,,
Farrah,230.1,So it's in. It's in paragraph three,,,,
Teacher,230.1,What made you say that?,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Paragraph three. Remember, yeah, it's in paragraph three, and it says",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Okay um so Farrah can you explain are your what were you thinking on when you came to that answer,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"yeah so I was thinking that basically like Okay, so it says what equipment did the scientists right.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,um so Jazmin i'll ask you first um when you came up with your new answer um what made you come to that knew the answer.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"It was actually Okay, so I knew in the first and, today, I said that the scientists sentence small machine but I realized that I looked up the name of the machine",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Can you tell me um, what do you have figured out, can you explain that to me?",,,,
Luis,230.1,"yeah so Okay, so my initial answer when I didn't know was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that, but then after we work together and I actually looked at the reading, and all this stuff I said okay scientists found ice using a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you share more about what you mean by that by scientists spent or sent a small machine.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Yes, Okay, well, I found that in our in our story in reading and in part two it said necessary the small machine called.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay yeah that's all right so let's can you maybe clarify your statement, for me, certainly a microscope is involved in analyzing water crystals on the moon, but could you just clarify why you provided that response.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"yeah Okay, so in part three, they say, the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at so they have to use the microscope to discover it otherwise they can't see it.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay well how about if you just clarify for us to be in it, you tell me why you believe that your answers right okay does that sound okay.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well Okay, they said the waters microscopic on So how can you discover something that's microscopic without a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay did the scientists found the moon, I mean water in the moon?",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Yes, they did.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,How much?,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"so um Luis you were talking about the parts of water; hydrogen and oxygen, why are hydrogen and oxygen helpful what makes those things valuable?",,,,
Luis,230.1,"um okay cuz you know, like accident, we gotta breathe man, we need oxygen to breathe, so that automatically it's like really valuable cuz we'll die.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"I would love to hear a little bit more about what do you think what different ways, could we use water, why is it valuable.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Okay um and it's it's it's valuable cuz we could drink it on the moon, and we can make fuel on the moon and um it's really heavy to carry so, then they won't have to carry it on the spaceship.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"yeah, and so I also want to circle back to Jazmin because Jazmin I think that you circled right away that NASA sent a small machine so did you notice that that's what they use to find the water.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"yeah right and but seeing Luis, you said you know so much about space, I was wondering if you could share a little bit about your your answer to the question and then dead i'll get to you, right after Luis okay.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"um yeah so I said that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, because if they're scientists up on the moon, they definitely need oxygen tanks for sure.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so that was evidence you got from your own experience.",,,,
Luis,230.1,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,So Oliver where were you getting that idea from because i'm.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so we're still thinking about that microscope right? What makes you think that they want to use a microscope?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"yeah and why did, why did NASA astronauts need all those things.",,,,
Chris,230.1,Uh well those things they all they help them stay alive when they go out into space and they keep them safe.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,yeah could you tell me a little bit more about those suits. What do they look like?,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Oh, they they kind of look like sleeping bags with arms.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So um what makes you think that your answers wrong.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,um well since i'm in this group.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Tell me more, why does that make you think that that is what helps find water on the moon.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well, actually i'm i'm still kind of confused.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Could you describe more this machine that they use.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,And okay so NASA such a small machine and and.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Luis Can you explain to me how you came to your answer.,,,,
Luis,230.1,yeah well actually I was just gonna say that I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"And Chris, do you want to, in the meantime, while Farrah and Luis reread the text, do you want to Talk about how you came up with scientists finding creators of water on the moon?",,,,
Chris,230.1,"yeah yeah so um there's this part okay it's near the beginning, paragraph one, it says um well, let me find it Okay, it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Perfect So what have you figured out.,,,,
Luis,230.1,um the answer is the Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,So what is confusing to you about that.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,So there's no people it's just the machine.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"And I know you know, and I just need you to help me to understand.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Oh yeah that's interesting, how do you think you could work that into your answer.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"let's see I could say NASA sent a small machine and it found water but it's really, really small frozen water nothing like the oceans on earth.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What background knowledge do you want to add to your answer? Did you read your answer?,,,,
Luis,230.1,"yeah well, I said that scientists use oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Well, can you tell me what they use the oxygen tanks for and how it connects to the rest of the article?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Could you tell me a little more about how they're going about looking for water on the moon, and why they're looking for water on the moon?",,,,
Luis,230.1,Ah.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why wouldn't it make sense?,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Because like I said about the atmosphere like there isn't an atmosphere around the moon, so we can't like there's nothing that would protect us, we will die.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, what are you confused about?",,,,
Farrah,230.1,Well okay.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, and Oliver you had something, you have a similar idea as Farrah so, can you tell me what also what brought you to that same conclusion.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"yeah so well, I was thinking on how could you discover something if you can't see it, you need to see it to discover.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Jazmin do you want to explain a little more about why you disagree before we hear from other people.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Okay, well, so the one I picked the.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"I heard Jazmin I saw Jazmin and Luis raise their hand for the lunar orbiter. Could you explain to the group, one of you, why you think that is what it was called?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Farrah, can you tell me do you want to read out your answer, maybe we can all decide as a group, we can come up with what the best answer is um so in your answer you thought this equipment was a microscope so Can you help me think why you did that answer what led you to thinking that.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"yeah so okay in part three, it says that will basically it says the water is really small it's they said might grow Scott peck and so you can't see it if you don't have a microscope so I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,I read that you have the same answer Farrah What was your reasoning was it the same did you have the same reason.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,I was pretty much the same what caused the question asked what equipment they used to discover the water and I don't think you can discover something if you can't even see it so that's why I was saying to you need the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay amazing our event, so you don't you know a lot about science and space so Can you help me understand why did you pick the arms you did, and what do you think of your peers on so so far.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"um yeah so I mean their interests are pretty good, but I was thinking that you'd need an oxygen tank because if there are astronauts and scientists on the moon, they cannot sign anything without oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"For me, loud and maybe you can explain to us again what led you to choosing your answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"awesome great great great so um is Farrah said, is that the reason why you chose the same answer.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"yeah yeah I found it there, too, because you can't find something if you can't see it, you need the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"I really so good good all right now so have you heard about this story before, or is it your first time hearing this about finding water and the moon yeah.",,,,
Chris,230.1,"This is my my first time because we we learned about the MARS Rover and, like the.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"But sometimes like in this question they wanted us to find a specific answer in the text so Luis if you look at the answer to your question your answer to the question, can you find that in the text or did you find that appear in your brain, because you knew all about space.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Well, I guess um I guess it was from my brain.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Maybe, starting with Luis Luis could you explain how you came to your answer choice.",,,,
Luis,230.1,um well actually I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"whoa Okay, why are they definitely using oxygen tanks.",,,,
Luis,230.1,To breathe.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Was that a question or a statement?,,,,
Luis,230.1,Not sure.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Where is it.,,,,
Luis,230.1,In my brain.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"i'm going to talk to both Oliver and Farrah because you guys had the same answer so yeah Oliver or Farrah, can you tell me how you are can you guys actually talk to each other and i'll listen about how you came up with that answer choice.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Okay, well, I found it on Oliver in part three, and I circled the part where it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I guess I don't understand why my answers wrong.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Farrah, can you tell me a little bit more What do you mean you don't understand what's confusing you right now.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,um why isn't the microscope the right answer.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"looks like Chris saying no, it looks like i'm seeing a lot of nos. Oliver i'm seeing your head shaking no to, why do you think no.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Well a crater it's more like um on a piece of nature, I don't know if nature is the right word but it's not like something you use or a tool it's just kind of part of the moon.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What can you tell me about your answer.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Um Jazmin why don't you tell me why you said that there was convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"why, why did you say that?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So what are you confused about are you confused about the question or the reading?,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well I guess the right answer cuz I thought that I had the right answer because I found it in the text, you know how you said that we have to look for the evidence in the story.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,yeah tell me why you why you said that.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Okay, I.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So so let's start with your response Luis, you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, I wonder what made you see that.",,,,
Luis,230.1,um so what I was thinking as after scientists like astronauts on the moon trying to discover the water they can't do anything if they don't have oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"I think your answer is very close to what we're looking for, but i'm wondering what made you think that they would be needing a microscope",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So i'd like to start by asking some clarifying questions and said, even said that he knows a lot about the space i'd like to start with you Luis I think you had a very interesting thought, but i'd like to understand why you mentioned the use of oxygen tanks in response to this question.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Oh yeah sure Okay, because you know when you go in a space you can't breathe, so if you're thinking about equipment oxygen tanks are the most important ones.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"so Chris um tell me a little bit more about your response, what makes you think that the water, the creators are full of water.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Because, in the first paragraph, it says scientists phone evidence or water can be found deep within the moon's pool recruiters and I know deep means like a lot of water, because when I go swimming in the deep side of the pool it's got like a lot of water.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why did you do that.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"um well cuz um well, I was looking for a name of equipment and I was looking for a section where they're talking about finding water in in.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"that you have mentioned that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen so I want to understand how this is going to be valuable.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Okay well oxygen you know we need oxygen to breathe like I told you, they can't breathe in space so that's valuable.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Thank you so much for staying um Oliver I read your response and you said no it's not ready yet what makes you say that.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Okay cuz then we're talking about you know how how much it's going to cost and how much time it's going to take, and how they don't have that time so i'm like well.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Would you like to share more about your conclusion.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well yeah I mean cuz I thought that I answered the question you know where it said, could it be valuable and even at the bottom of the story, it asks do you think it would be a good investment, and so I said no, so I don't I don't understand why that's wrong.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you tell us why you have made a reference to the water being heavy and it's too heavy for the ships to begin what what's the benefit bike over here that you're trying to.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Oh, the cost part.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,And it's expensive but they're already spending a lot of money to do stuff on the moon anyway.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Luis, why do you think that's the right answer.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"um yeah so I totally agree with Jazmin here as the space expert in the group, and I think it's right because.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you tell me more about how the microscope helped the scientists?,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"um yeah okay so um when they found a water, well the ice actually was frozen water, it was ice. When they found is it was so small, it was tiny and they couldn't see it without the microscope so they needed the microscope to be able to see it.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"I feel you have a great evidence, can you tell me more about this machine?",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Oh yeah let me look okay in the story, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Well let's talk about Farrah's and Oliver's response of what they circled because they were talking about microscopes. Oliver, can you explain a little bit more about that for me.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"um yeah. Okay, so when they found the water um well actually what I use, and it was really, really tiny um and so they couldn't see it with just their eyes, they had to see with the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"mm hmm that's right and Farrah you are, you are thinking, the same thing right.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,yeah so I don't understand why our answer is wrong.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"and do you think Jazmin, can you explain a little bit more about what you were thinking.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,yeah so I read in the story that NASA send a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,do you want to tell me a little bit more about that oh.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay well well, what did you figure out a bit curious to hear.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Okay cuz I heard you tell him i'm Farrah and and mmm that we have to hit all the words in the question, like.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,I just want to make sure that you understand why oxygen tanks might not be the best answer for this question can you explain your thinking a little bit.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Tell me a little bit more about that,,,,
Chris,230.1,What do you want me to tell you.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, what are you confused about Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Well, I I thought that I I fixed my answer so now I have everything in it.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What did you find important about the small machine.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Oh well, if said they used it to what was the word investigate.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,But when we think about the discover the question right what makes you think about or what what pushes you to say microscope with compared to the word discover what kind of lead you there.,,,,
Luis,230.1,um I have something to say.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, why do you feel that you're not or you shouldn't be in this group, because you don't know you already know about space.",,,,
Luis,230.1,yeah um and so I know about my answers right because I already know about space and I don't need your help.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"cool, How did those oxygen tanks help them to discover that water.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"well, i know that if there are scientists up on the moon like astronauts they are definitely 100% using oxygen tanks, while they go around discovering that water.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay Farrah Can you help me what is your confusion, is it the question?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Tell me why.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,well.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"It does need to be a thing, and what made you say that.",,,,
Oliver,230.1, The questions asks what equipment i'm i'm so um you know your need to find an equipment to answer that question.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,And what made you pick this particular sentence Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,Well it's the same sentence I picked before.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you tell me why you're confused.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"I understand the Lunar orbiter on because it's a machine to investigate that makes sense, but I still think there's evidence in the text on that it could also be the microscope because that sentence has any equipment and it has a word like look for which is like discover.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"that's awesome Farrah, can you tell me what the scientists were looking at with the microscope.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"And yeah so they were looking at the ice deposits, the really small pieces of ice.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Okay um So could you explain a little bit more about why you're choosing the microscope over the Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,yeah so it says the water they found is microscopic and so you can't see something that's microscopic unless you have a microscope so you can't discover it if you can't see it.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,And how do we oxygen take specifically help us find water on the moon.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"yeah well, so if there's astronauts there's no way they can find the water on the moon if they don't have oxygen tanks to breathe.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,What was your what.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,And I said the who,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Alright, everyone thanks for sharing your responses with the group i'm noticing some things right i'm noticing that we each sort of have different answers, and I have a question to you, why do you think we each have different answers.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"guys, we are all different people with different ideas I mean I shouldn't even be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so it sounds like, where did you learn that fact.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Oh well, anytime that there are scientists out in space they need to have oxygen tanks that's just like basic space stuff.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Oh, and why do they need the oxygen tank.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Oh well, typically you can't breathe in space without an oxygen tank.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, so you just me you come up with the answer lunar orbiter, but I also noticed the other people who had different answers so for those who have different from lunar orbiter, could you please tell me how you come up with that answer.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"yeah i'm Oh, this is Farrah so I found my answer in part three, in paragraph three, where they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,when you read that question did you circle key words or underline things What was your strategy there.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,yeah I looked more at the word discover.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Oh exactly Luis so what made you think that the Lunar orbiter was the piece of equipment they're talking about in paragraph two.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"um well they say it's a machine, a small machine and machine can be equipment",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"yeah what what are you confused about, can you tell me, can you tell me.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"yeah well, you told us to look in paragraph two, but what about paragraph three and the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,and why.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,how do you know that the that the microscope is equipment and not like the water that they found.,,,,
Chris,230.1,They say it's a tool of microscope visit tool and we know on in science class miss Bradley always says okay let's take out the equipment on and so it's like the microscope and the bunsen burner and stuff like that.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Oliver What about for number two, how do you know that a lunar orbiter is a piece of equipment.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,I didn't really get at first that it was because.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,What what makes you think that.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Well that's a good use of water and if we're going to have a base on the moon, we need some food and sustainable food.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you tell me a little bit about your thinking thinking about the the microscope answer.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"yeah I kinda the thought question was asking about equipment what equipment it to us until I was looking in but text for everywhere, they said equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,awesome so um what's what what makes you say that what makes you say that scientists found is using a small machine.,,,,
Luis,230.1,Because that.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,that's your revised answer.,,,,
Jazmin,230.1,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"yeah so you you clarified response, which is, which is great what helped you find the title of.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So, how did you know that equipment was the most important word in that sentence or question.",,,,
Chris,230.1,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,What do you mean all figured out.,,,,
Luis,230.1,i'm like the answer to the question i'm all set I got it.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"On the directions, or something else.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,No about the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"which part, are you confused about.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well, because our teacher said that we're supposed to use the key words in the question um, and so the key word in a question are some equipment scientists discover water moon those are the ones that I underlined so.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,On what you meant by that.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"um, can I say something that is Luis over here.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"All right, thank you so i'm curious, so why did you decide to circle equipment?",,,,
Farrah,230.1,On because it's like one of the.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Oh great so Oliver do you want to tell me why you decided to circle equipment.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Okay, because it's like when it's asking like what equipment, the teacher says, right after the the question if it says why did blah blah blah, what did blah blah blah, then the blah blah blah, whatever the (unitelligle) is, is the important one.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"yeah so thank you for sharing that Chris so let's take a look at discover, so why did you circle discover.",,,,
Chris,230.1,because that was the action.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Alright, so NASA sent a small machine so, can you tell me why did you say that.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"Okay, I was looking for equipment and I know that a machine is equipment and that in that paragraph, they were talking about. Why did I say that?",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"All right, well, why do you think that's Farrah's right?",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Okay guys she said it's equipment I looked at paragraph six, and it does talk about water on the moon so it's got all the key things.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"yeah you're right they use tons of equipment, like the ones that you mentioned, and you kind of talked about how um they found craters full of water on the moon, can I ask you what makes you say that.",,,,
Chris,230.1,"Okay, so when part one, they say.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, and what makes you say that they use oxygen tanks.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"yeah well if there's astronauts up there on the moon, I know 100% they have oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Exactly and where have you seen that information before.,,,,
Luis,230.1,"Oh it's like and anything that space, you say the astronauts with their oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Okay sounds good alright so right now I am going to give each of you individually 30 seconds to read over your response and think about what made you write that response.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Alright, so our question is, why did you choose to write that response so starting now i'm going to give you about 30 seconds to think about that.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Great and what made you write that answer, can you tell me a little bit little bit about that.",,,,
Chris,230.1,"yeah our teacher told us to look for kind of the key word so it's looking for scientists and finding and water on the moon, and so that's how I found it in the first paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"run, one by one i'm going to ask each of you a question, which is what made you say that.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"All right, Luis actually why don't we have you start off first so your response to our question was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen things can you tell me what made you say that.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Well, they may say.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay perfect Thank you alright Jazmin let's go on to you, so you said that NASA sent a small machine So why did you choose to write about small machine, can you tell me a little bit about that.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,"yeah I was looking for the answer and well in the second paragraph, and when I saw machine I know that's like equipment and this one's talking about.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, great Thank you so they've been Farrah what made you guys really focus on the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Can you tell me a little bit about what you were thinking when you really highlighted or underline the word microscope and included it in your response, either one of you guys can share yeah.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"Well, I can share um Okay, so I was thinking you know um first off.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"yeah, so why do you think that scientists at NASA might want to use something like an oxygen tank when they're going to do their work on the moon.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Well, without oxygen tanks, they wouldn't be able to breathe out in space they couldn't do anything without the oxygen tanks they'd just die.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Still kind of confused okay well let's keep thinking through this um is there anything in particular that's confusing you right now Farrah.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Well, because if Luis's right, then that will mean that i'm wrong, but I think that I think that I, I came up with a good answer, based on the text too.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"yeah and so maybe you can clarify your thinking for us a little bit, why do you think that maybe they're not ready to use the water yet.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Okay, because they talked about how like it costs a lot of money and it'll take a lot of time, which means that it's going to be a long time before you can do anything with it.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,To look really closely is connected to discovering water.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,Oh well,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"and I want to go to, why do you think the craters are full of water on the moon.",,,,
Chris,230.1,"Well, because it says it in the story, it says that um let me see where was that.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Farrah I think your answer is quite interesting, can you explain a little bit?",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Oh, excuse me, excuse me.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,a microscope interesting can you talk more about why to send it to use microscope to look at what.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"So it said that the water well actually it's ice it's really, really small and you can't see it if you don't have a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Why do you say that.,,,,
Chris,230.1,"Well, because we've been talking about equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, what do you think about that, why do you say the microscope share your knowledge with the class.",,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Okay well in part three, it says that the water they found was microscopic and you can't see it without a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"So, can you tell me a little bit more about your response.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"um yeah Okay, so I said scientists use a lot of equipment like i'm oxygen tanks, because if there's astronauts on the moon, and are looking for this water they definitely are using oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,So why did you choose that.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"I picked it because, well, I found it in part three in part three, they say, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"yeah Jazmin had the small machines Jazmin is that, where you were referring to.",,,,
Jazmin,230.1,I was referring to the Lunar orbiter yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Right Okay, so how did you find that out because I didn't see that in the text, so how to use that.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"Okay, well, if there are astronauts on the moon looking for water, I know that they would have to have oxygen tanks 100%.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Okay, and can you tell me a little bit more why you.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"circle.on yeah so while a microscope lots to see really tiny things on, and if you see something you can discover it so that's why I picked a microscope because, being able to see tiny particles, but overall.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,On what.,,,,
Farrah,230.1,"Oh well, so.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"And so maybe your answer has one of these two parts, but let's see if we can make it even stronger so actually we can start with you Luis and i'm curious what made you say that scientists need oxygen tanks That was really smart edition.",,,,
Luis,230.1,"yeah so I was thinking when I was reading when I was like you're not talking about all the materials that they need like when I watched like space shows on TV they always have oxygen tanks and like suits and stuff like that, so it seems weird that they left that out.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,"Oliver, why did you say that this this does answer the question.",,,,
Oliver,230.1,"So, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but this was really exciting Thank you so much.",,,,
Teacher,230.1,Is that something you read in the article is that some knowledge that you're bringing to the conversation.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,Oh that's a good question um I read it online.,,,,
Teacher,230.1,Can you give me a little more detail about what that was what evidence was that.,,,,
Oliver,230.1,yeah so okay so survey and I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I think that that group because they talk about different sort of equipment which is a word that I circled and I saw that the equipment that I noticed was the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Like where where they found their answer in the texts, yes Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"OK, so my answer is that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely on and about my my thinking so I found it in part three, and it talks about how the water is microscopic and you can't see it without a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So Farrah can you read the line for me again where you found it in the story, what does it say.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"yeah i'm Okay, so it says, well, I mean that's the same it's this that's what it says it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"yeah so Jazmin can you say more about where you found that in the text, or why you said that.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Yes, you do. But did you read the article because I'm not sure that you really need that answer because you circled the same as her",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Did you have a chance, did you go back and look and find the same answer or did you find something different.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Although I see actually that confused because it kind of makes sense that all I was missing was the name of the machine, right. So I said, like NASA send this small machine, but I have to say, like, what evidence is, I have to say what it is, right?",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Maybe other equipment that they might have used to just find oxygen, or excuse me, just to find the water on the moon, what some other points that you made for us in our passage we read what were some other points, they made.",,,,
Luis,230.2,"Well, I have to be honest, I don't think I read it very close because I thought I knew all this stuff. But it sounds like there's other equipment that maybe I didn't know",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"And what makes you think that way. Farrah based on our passage, what makes you think that the evidence is not convincing.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Yeah, that's a really interesting question. So when I look at the, like, here's what I saw, I was thinking that okay a paragraph six",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Luis Can you tell me, can you read the paragraph, where it says",,,,
Teacher,230.2,The scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. Where did you find evidence that,,,,
Luis,230.2,"Okay, well yeah I I can read it. I also want to say that I don't think I should be in this group, I already know a lot about space.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Where paragraph, does it talk about the scientists use a equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Luis,230.2,"Okay, I'm walking",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Great. Can you tell me where what you found.,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Yeah. So, in paragraph three, it says that the water they found is microscopic and they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Chris. Let's talk about your answer. You said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon. Uh huh. What paragraph. Does that tell us that that happened.,,,,
Chris,230.2,In the first paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Can you help me find in the passage where it talks about oxygen tanks.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"I'm sure, sure, sure, sure. Okie",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"That's right, good job. It is the Lunar Orbiter. Can you tell me what paragraph you found. Yes, yes. Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Oh yeah, I can tell you, but",,,,
Teacher,230.2,So Oliver. Did you find that answer in the in the text?,,,,
Oliver,230.2,"Yeah yeah I when I looked on, and to find the answer and I had circled the part that's the very last sentence of the whole text it says",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Oliver, you told me that you circled the same answer as Farrah but I want you to challenge you and see if you can find in the text where it says or where it talks about a microscope, because.",,,,
Oliver,230.2,"I circled it in the last paragraph, but it was just hard Farrah said her answer before mine and she have the same answer as me. Well, yeah, it's the last, the last sentence. And the last paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Hmm so is that, again we're coming back to what Chris had told us about look and discover and how that's a little confusing. Which verb are they using in that paragraph look or discover?",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Okay, its got look and its got investigate",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Oliver, where in the reading you did you find some evidence to answer our question.",,,,
Oliver,230.2,In the third paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"If you will refer back to your article back to your reading. I would love to know where you think you might find the answer to the equipment that we use to discover water Jazmin, I see your hand up. Yes.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,And I would say that it's in paragraph two and that's where you would find that like where you will find the equipment used to discover the water.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So, Jazmin, could you please read us in paragraph to read us the sentence where you think it answers the question about what kind of equipment we were using to discover water.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"In the first sentence in paragraph 2. It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Wonderful. Okay, Farrah does Jazmin answer change the way that you would would answer or do you still believe it's in paragraph three",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Well, I guess I can see how the small machine or I guess the lunar orbiter is the small machine like I could see how that was used to discover.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Do you think that the moon is wet? Or did it say that the moon is very dry?,,,,
Chris,230.2,I don't know. They found water deep in the craters. They sent a machine to look for ice.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So did they find craters full of water, or were they just looking for the water to find.",,,,
Chris,230.2,"See what you're saying, okay, okay. Yeah. Um, well, cuz you know I went to NASA and so I know that the scientists like they use a lot of like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff. And so I didn't know that it was like really dry there.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Perfect and Jazmin. Where did you, um, can you tell me what paragraph you found that in",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"It was in the same sentence as the one that I i had my, my first answer in paragraph to, um, but I just added the name of the machine.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So you just provided the I'm gonna use a microscope to look really closely. So, but what are you looking closely for? Good job though.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Um, well, like you are looking closely for the water like the astronauts would have to use a microscope to like look at the ice crystals that make up the water",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"All right. Well, let's think about it this way, Jazmin, should you look very closely at the water molecules without the microscope?",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Where did you read that in the text.,,,,
Chris,230.2,"Hey, oh yeah, that was it.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"I have your responses in front of me but I'm curious to know what evidence did you circle in the tech. So we're going to go around and I would like you to share with me the evidence that you used Farrah, let's start with you.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Okay, so basically, so what I circled in the text was that the the microscope. Know what I mean like that the microscope was",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Oliver. What evidence did you use,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Chris, what evidence did you circle.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Jazmin, what evidence did you circle to help you answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"And I want to hear from Luis really quickly. Luis What evidence. Did you find, were you able to circle specific evidence in the text to help you.",,,,
Luis,230.2,"Um, you know, I actually was thinking about all that I knew about space and I kind of knew that, you know, the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and",,,,
Teacher,230.2,But what was the name of that small machine. Does anybody know,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"I don't know. Where would I, let's see, I guess it's like the lunar orbiter, is that the machine?",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Chris. What was one piece of evidence that you thought About this that some evidence that said water could be valuable.,,,,
Chris,230.2,"Yeah, so, um, info which paragraph was it. Okay, yeah. In the first one because it's the whole. The title is water is a valuable resource right",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Yep. And that can be water can be split in those two different elements all right now. Luis Where did you find that in the text.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"Oh, there it is. There it is. Okay, your paragraph five in my second sentence. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Good. Okay. And where did you find in the text that it talked about microscope.,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Um, let's see. It was, I think it was in paragraph three",,,,
Teacher,230.2,That's okay. Could I read to you the sentence that I'm thinking and you tell me if that's where you found your answer.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Is that where you found your answer.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Ok, so that's paragraph two, does it talk about a piece of equipment that they used",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Was there any other equipment that you think they used to discover water by, could you look back on the text and think about what they actually use to discovered water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,You know what the small machine was called?,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,I can look it up.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"All right, what, what part of this text that you read gave you the impression that they had to use them.",,,,
Luis,230.2,"Well, I guess I didn't really look at the text because I already knew this.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Well, your answer says they use a microscope to look really closely, but what are they looking closely at what can they use it to focus on, like, are they looking at something really small, or really big. Yes, Farrah?",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"So I guess they're looking at like something really small, they're looking at the water, they're studying the water",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"You could, but what is something on the moon that they could look at on the moon. They said the moon is a desert. What else could they look at if they say desert.",,,,
Oliver,230.2,"Ah, they could look at like the sand and like the dirt.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Well, I didn't say your answer was wrong. It is technically correct, they did send a small machine, but what kind of small machine, did they send? Can you tell me that Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Yeah, well, I guess, I guess in the reading. I guess I can look and see.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, and what was a small machine called",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"NASA send this machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate, so Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Do you remember what the small machine was called,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,Let me see. I can't quite remember.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So, Jazmin have you found some more details in the reading about what the machine was called?",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"And when I look back in. I saw like what it, what it said it said. Let me read it. It said NASA sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate. So was it the lunar orbiter?",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"And I notice Jazmin said that NASA sent a small machine so Jazmin, can you look back in the text and recall what was the name of that small machine that NASA sent?",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"I can do that. I guess what I saw, so NASA it's in paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbitor to investigate. So I guess it's the lunar orbiter, right?",,,,
Teacher,230.2,And we were looking at paragraph two moment ago to specifically answer that question. So what was the name of the small machine that NASA sent to investigate?,,,,
Chris,230.2,"Well, I guess based on like Jazmin's I guess the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,So where in the article doesn't talk about oxygen tanks.,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Okay, and Jazmin, what was the small machine called",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, from your text it says that you would need what to see the water?",,,,
Farrah,230.2,a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, so you're, you want to talk, the microscope. What paragraph does our reading talk about the microscope.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Okay, so it's paragraph three, and it says the water is, the water they found is microscopic um and then you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"And Oliver, what happened. How did they study that the small ice deposits",,,,
Oliver,230.2,"Um, so they basically used the microscope that Farrah mentioned and basically they use the microscope to study the the tiny little pieces of water like that you couldn't really see necessarily with with just your eyes.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Can you figure out what the name of that small machine is,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Okay, so in paragraph two, NASA scientists small machine called Lunar Orbiter. So it says lunar orbiter right?",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Just, um, can you go into more detail about what else, what other equipment might be used, other than just a microscope?",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Well, I mean, I, I guess. Yeah, but it seems like the microscope is like they can't see the water without the microscope, you know, like they have to be able to see it in order to study it.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Right. Um, but what did NASA have to send in order to use a microscope.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Oh, well, they sent up. It sounds like Jazmin, just like the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,So what do you guys think about that. Where is the evidence that might help you with this question.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Um, so does anybody remember what the name of that machine was called",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, and you understand what equipment they used?",,,,
Chris,230.2,Um yeah like I think they just use basically like um like spacesuits and like I know cuz I went to NASA. So like they use like oxygen tanks and and masks and suits like to go flying around in space.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"And we also read in the paragraphs. What else did you, what other equipment should they be they use and other tools.",,,,
Chris,230.2,"Um, well, I kind of know about space. Um, I didn't really read that.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"And what else did you, did you read",,,,
Teacher,230.2,So what can you tell me from that information that I just gave you what other tools they might be using to learn about the water on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Um, but can you tell me why they needed a microscope to find this water.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So, I see deposits are very small. Does it seem like we have a lot of water or a little bit of water?",,,,
Chris,230.2,I guess maybe not very much water. So maybe it's not like full of water.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,So it's using the equipment to do what?,,,,
Oliver,230.2,To discover the water,,,,
Teacher,230.2,All right. So did they use the microscope to discover the water?,,,,
Oliver,230.2,Um,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"That's right. Where did you find that in the passage, show us where you found that",,,,
Chris,230.2,"It's this paragraph five, but I guess it's the second paragraph, this next one.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Investigate, right, so we have to investigate our evidence. And what are we using to investigate our evidence?",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Oh, I'm not sure.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,So what are some things all of you that water could be used for on the moon like it says in paragraph four and five.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Can we look back for some details? Chris.,,,,
Chris,230.2,"Some details. Well, okay. So we know that, like, there's a few things that you could do.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Right. So did they actually discover that water was on the moon?,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"The water they found? Yeah. Yeah, because in the next sentence it says, the water they found is microscopic. So they did find some water.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Right. But does it mention that in the paragraphs?,,,,
Chris,230.2,Oh. No.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,So you didn't find your answer from paragraph 1.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,What did they use the lame lit lunar orbiter for keep her in that sentence.,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,I'm okay. I'm okay to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Where it is that water at when they say it's heavy. So read that sentence again for me.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,So here's an did you find specifically where that waters heavy at,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"What is this, what was the small machine called",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,I'm not sure.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Good. And so you said they sent this machine. So what did this machine, do.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,Um investigate,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, and you said, so this lunar orbiter looks for what deposits?",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Um you so talk to me about that. How much water did they find,,,,
Chris,230.2,"Um, oh, okay, I'm not really sure like exactly like the amount, like how many gallons or anything, but",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So does this whole machine, is it given a name? Do we see any place where it's given a name at?",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Yeah, so it's the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,But why did you choose that out of the out of the tags.,,,,
Chris,230.2,"I guess because when I looked at the text. What I was thinking was basically like I was seeing that they were saying that there was all this ice in the craters, and so I thought like, well, that's all the water so when they we were asking about finding water. I was like, well, there's the water",,,,
Teacher,230.2,What else do you think they would use be looking for on the moon?,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, but what does the reading tell us? You possibly could use oxygen tanks. But what does it tell us in the story?",,,,
Chris,230.2,"Um, I guess it doesn't really say anything about like I'm like really about like the um using like space suits and stuff. I guess that was like from like my understanding.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"How did. Where did you pull oxygen tanks from the text for them, discovering water.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Well you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen when responding to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Where did you find your answer from the text, which paragraph?",,,,
Luis,230.2,"Um, well, I didn't really get it from the text, a kind of just knew it. So I didn't really like get it from the reading.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Right. So when you're looking for what type of machines or stuff they use to look for the water when you're looking at the three paragraphs, where, where would you find that information, one of the paragraphs specifically",,,,
Teacher,230.2,do you see a word that you would use in of those paragraphs just by skimming,,,,
Luis,230.2,"Well, I can I, yeah, I can look it up and try to see, um,",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, so let's. Um, what, what did you what kind of evidence. Did you circle in the text.",,,,
Luis,230.2,"Oh, um, I didn't actually circle anything because I already know a bunch of stuff about",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"You said that they sent a small machine, what, um, what piece of evidence. Did you circle.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,Circle that at the beginning of paragraph to,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, well what paragraph. Do you think we can find that in",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"And you talked about astronauts can use the water to stay hydrated and I did like how you said you cannot survive without water, um, where did you come up with that answer. How did you find that answer.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Okay, so basically, okay. And let's see it's in the second reading, the water is a valuable resource.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,But what are we looking closely for?,,,,
Farrah,230.2,We're looking for water.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Alright, so let's go look. Let's say at your paragraph three, where does it talk about discovery in there.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Good. Okay. So you talked about NASA sending a small machine. If we look back at the text. What did it send the small machine to do?,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Teacher:But what equipment do you think they used to find it. What did you read in the article about the equipment that they used,,,,
Chris,230.2,What equipment they used to find it.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"And, but let's. Can you find that in the text? Is there any way you can go back in the text and see where you found that?",,,,
Teacher,230.2,And what does that lunar orbiter do?,,,,
Luis,230.2,"Um, so like the Lunar Orbiter, I guess, like, okay, so it flies around the moon and maybe it lands on the moon and and it might do things like",,,,
Teacher,230.2,To investigate and what did they discover when they used that small machine to investigate? What did they discover?,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Mm hmm. And why we use that for? To look at what? To look at things,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"To look closely, like to see something close",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay. And so that's very good, Farrah. and Oliver, is that where you found your evidence as well?",,,,
Oliver,230.2,"Um, yeah. So I pretty much have the same place and the same idea. Um, I think adding to Farrahs answer like I think that you have to use the microscope to see it. You can't like find it, I guess, unless you can see it.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, they sent a small machine. And where did you see that at?",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"It's in paragraph two, and actually I have a question about that. So I knew that we're all working together to try to improve our answers. And I'm wondering, like, what might be wrong about my answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,That's one type of equipment. What else did they do with the equipment. What did it do?,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Well, they used it to like go and look for ice deposits in the polar craters and that's where they found them.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Are masks and suits mentioned anywhere in the article.,,,,
Chris,230.2,"No, that's just what I kind of knew",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Let's look at the sentence where you found a small machine. Go ahead and read that whole sentence where small machine is included.,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Okay, this isn't a small machine coated Lunar Orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,I want you guys to take a second to locate,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"In the text where you found small machine and microscope, and I want you guys to tell me what paragraph in the text is a small machine in the microscope.",,,,
Luis,230.2,"Okay, I'm not a lot",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"oxygen tanks. Okay, so go ahead and locate that as well.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,So So Deb. Let's look at microscope. Did you find where we can find microscope and and there,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Yeah, and Farrah. Where did you find your answer for lunar orbiter were in the text did you find that?",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"So I saw it in paragraph two, and that was, yeah, that was right.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,. Is that the only paragraph that provides us with convincing evidence?,,,,
Teacher,230.2,No? where else has somebody found something that's convincing evidence,,,,
Teacher,230.2,What what they what those parts are going to be used for how are they going to use oxygen. How are they going to use the hydrogen?,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Where did you get your answer from, Chris",,,,
Chris,230.2,"My answer from the first part where it talks about the the craters because it says, scientists have evidence, the water can be found deep within the moon polar craters. So that's, that's where I got my part.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Where did you find your answer?,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"It was in paragraph three when it says, the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,So from the passage itself because you had mentioned oxygen tanks and and other things from the passage. What were some specific pieces of equipment that you see in the passage,,,,
Luis,230.2,"Oh, so like I gotta do like",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Farrah, they used the microscope to look closely at it, but what did they send to the moon?",,,,
Farrah,230.2,Um a space shuttle,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Luis You said that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen and tanks. What are they using that for,,,,
Luis,230.2,They use that to breathe because you can't breathe in space because there isn't any oxygen there,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Very good. I'm so how did you find that answer. Did you look back in the text using your keywords.,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Yeah, because you said look for this specific machine. And so when I went back and look for the specific machine that was the equipment itself Lunar Orbiter and",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Gotcha. So I want everyone to take a second go into the reading and circle where you found your answer.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Okay Oliver. Where did you find in the text to support your answer.,,,,
Oliver,230.2,"Okay, so I had basically I said that know that it's not ready yet. And I was looking in paragraph. It's paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"And Jazmin, would you like to go, let us know how you found your answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay. And so, Farrah. Why did you underline that in paragraph two.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay. Oliver why did you underline that I'm paragraph two,",,,,
Oliver,230.2,"Um, yeah, basically, that was on the same because it was all the equipment that I could see",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Luis Where did you come up with your answer.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"Ah, yeah. Okay, so I got my answer from like I know about like space and stuff. So I already kind of knew the answer to this question. I don't think I really need to be in this group, because I don't really need help with this stuff, you know,",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"and Jazmin, you said NASA sent a small machine. Could you tell me maybe what small machine or where you found that in the expert, except of the story.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Now, do me a favor. Look back in your text and help me understand what led you to that conclusion. What made you say you need it scientifically tool called the microscope. In fact, everybody look back in the text and see where you found your answer and help me understand what what it was that led you to that conclusion when we get to each person.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Farrah. Have you found it.,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Yeah, I have a good idea.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,To go ahead and read me where it is in the passage,,,,
Farrah,230.2,Good. Okay. So when I look at the reading the thing that connected was a paragraph and it says.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So Chris. Do me a favor, go back into the text. Help me understand what led you to your conclusion.",,,,
Chris,230.2,"Okay, so when I was reading. I thought that. Okay. So one of the key words in the question was what. So I said, Okay, so you have to find quiet and you both do the bidding.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Sure, if I were to so do me a favor, which paragraph. Did you find the information about the crater.",,,,
Chris,230.2,"Um, let's paragraph one.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So, would you mind going back in the text and finding that for me, while you're looking.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"I was just gonna say that I was still a little bit confused about some of the stuff like I think they understand like, so in this being the right answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Luis. Help me, help me with yours. I asked you to find where you found your information in the text. Where'd you see it.",,,,
Luis,230.2,So I think it was a trick question because I did not find it. And I think that was the thing right like,,,,
Teacher,230.2,And go ahead and refer to the text and see if you can find textual evidence that supports the fact that they need a small machine.,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Well I guess what I'm trying to find, it says that in paragraph two, that NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Well, do you think that you could maybe find what machine you're talking about inside your text.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Can you tell me where in our texts that it said that there was craters full of water on the moon?,,,,
Chris,230.2,"Um, yeah, I can do that. Um, okay. Let's see. So, um,",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, so we're going to, I was coming to you, Miss Jazmin, and you said that they sent a small machine. They did send a small machine, but can you find in that paragraph why they sent that small machine and what it was used for",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"So in paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Okay. Yeah. Okay. Would you mind reading a section of the passage where you found this answer?,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Um, yeah, I can do that. Let's see. Um,",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Could you share with the class The section that mentioned this tool.,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Okay so in paragraph two, and it says, NASA send this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Do you want to describe where in the text you found this?,,,,
Luis,230.2,"On yeah yeah I can do that. Okay, so let's see. Um,",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Okay um so what in the text makes you think that.,,,,
Oliver,230.2,Ok so,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Did you find any evidence of them using those masks or suits in the text?,,,,
Chris,230.2,"Oh, no. No, Um OK. So the only things that I saw was the microscope that Farrah and Oliver said and the lunar orbiter that Jazmin said.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Your response to the question, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely what led you to.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Using a microscope as a piece of equipment.,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Okay, it was in the last paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Where in the text did you find that NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,No it's not ready yet um can you remove show me the evidence of that if you could um.,,,,
Farrah,230.2,yeah I read it last story.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,So the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. And you talked about that NASA send something. Is there a place in the text where you found that Jazmin.,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So now i'm going to ask you, each question and that question is where can you reference the test the text from your answer and how does it answer the question, do you have a question Luis.",,,,
Luis,230.2,"um yeah so I don't think I need to be in this group, because I already know, like all about space.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,so easy why don't you start for me where did you find your answer in the text.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"The questions that i'm asking you, is in your answer, where, can you refer to the text so where did you get your answer from in the text,",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Thank you alright Jazmin so NASA sent a small machine where did you find that in the text.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"All right, awesome Thank you alright Chris, so your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon, where did you find that in the chat.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Oh OK, so I saw that i'm excited the first paragraph, it, they were talking about the yeah the craters and how there was all the water.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"All right, thank you so Farrah where did you find your answer in the text.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,So I was looking for.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,let's see where where did you find that in the text.,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Oh no No, sorry I was thinking about like what would be like oh so the Lunar orbiter is like.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"yeah I totally agree, do you want to point out exactly where in the text, she found the answers for us.",,,,
,230.2,um.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,and just a second the Oliver can you find where the microscope is in text.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Can you find it for me because I don't think that we had a robot part in there, but that's Okay",,,,
Teacher,230.2,awesome alright so Oliver where did you find the information about microscope and the text.,,,,
Oliver,230.2,"Okay, so when I was looking at it.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Really? I didn't know - is that, did you get that from the passage?",,,,
Chris,230.2,"No, no me and my dad have been reading about aviation and we went to NASA and I read that maybe they could put some, a base up there, so it'll make things easier.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Chris you said, water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore. So did you get the part about water being heavy from the passage?",,,,
Teacher,230.2,OK now I want you to give me specific detail from the text about why you think it's lunar orbiter.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"OK. So it says that NASA's sent a small machine called a lunar orbit. Well, I mean and you told us to look at this paragraph. So--",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Listen, can you show me where you found that can you tell me where you.",,,,
Luis,230.2,Paragraph five.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So be ready what made you choose that answer, can you tell me the evidence that you had from the book that made you think that.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"yeah um so like the last part of part six it says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money, so I don't think it's that valuable.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Did you read that in the article.,,,,
Oliver,230.2,"I read it online and well if there's water on the moon, it sounds really believable but there could be a base there in three years.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Where specifically in paragraph three, do you see that",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"At the at the end of the paragraph, um,",,,,
Chris,230.2,It's in the first in the first paragraph,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Could you share with us where you found where you read um or just I can read your answer: scientists found craters full of water on the moon. So could you like just show,,,,
Teacher,230.2,So def. You said you had the same answer as Farrah. Do you want to explain a little bit what you found when you're reading,,,,
Oliver,230.2,"Yeah, cause I read the question. I'm like, here are some words, you're saying",,,,
Teacher,230.2,um let's see can you point out to me where you found that?,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Okay yeah it's in the the third sentence in paragraph four: for example, future astronauts could drink this water.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Um, but I'm just wondering, more specifically what small machine did they use. How do you know they used to small machin, like did it tell you in the text? Where in the text is that?",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,Yeah yeah it's it in yet basically was like,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So can we go back right now, and we can all look at our responses, think about what we said. And can we all think about why we chose to say those things? And see if you can find the part of the text that tells you to say that. You can go now.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Farrah, what did you add to your thoughts? How are you going to support your thoughts?",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"OK. So when I looked back, I actually circled a quote already from the text because my answer was the last sentence in the story.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,And did you find the part of the story that you could quote that said anything about oxygen tanks?,,,,
Luis,230.2,"No, I couldn't find anything in there.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Now, when Farrah found that, did you look at the text and reread it to notice that they said a scientific tool?",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Oh, well, I noticed that the first time because I was looking for the word equipment and then I didn't see equipment. So when I was looking for it, I was looking for anything else that might be equipment and also that it talks about water. And so that's how I found it there, but I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Good all right i'm going to call on Jazmin first let's talk about Jazmin answer so you told me that NASA send a small machine now where did you get that information.,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,I could click to when I will do a new paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So, can you tell me where in the passage you found that answer, where did you get it from.",,,,
Chris,230.2,yeah okay so basically when I looked at the end.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Can you show me where you found that.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"that's a that's a really good question um, I guess, let me look at see i'm.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Good. OK, and let's go to Chris. Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon. I like that, that is very true. Can you just tell me a little bit more about that and where in the text it said that?",,,,
Chris,230.2,"Yeah. I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, and masks, and suits, but the crater part was in the beginning of the story. (WHISPERING) No atmosphere. Oh, here it is. OK, scientists found evidence that water could be found deep within the moon's polar craters.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Yes. So can you show me where in the text she found those answers?,,,,
Chris,230.2,I feel like you said section two and section three.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Can you read me the sentence of one of them.,,,,
Chris,230.2,"Okay, yeah, it's the first sentence in section two.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,The Lunar Orbiter. Great. Can you read me that sentence? Where you can find that?,,,,
Oliver,230.2,"Um, yeah, let me see.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Perfect. And do you remember where we found that?,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Yeah. Um, cuz uh Oliver and Chris read it too. It was the first sentence of the second paragraph, I was listening.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Yeah. So you mentioned that the scientists looked use your tool called microscopes. I was wondering if you could use some text evidence that proves to where you saw that in the text. Is there a Quote, that you remember",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Totally. There's a paragraph. That's what I was saying, the water is microscopic he wouldn't be able to see it.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So, Jazmin. Do you have text evidence from your response. You said NASA send a small machine. Do you read about that.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"In the, in the second paragraph, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So Farrah, you said that you'd need a scientific tool called the microscope and you also said that you circle, the same thing. Now where in the text. Can you point that out, just so that everyone's on the same page.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Okay, so let's basically, I think. Let's see. So you to paragraph three, and we were saying, okay, the water they found is microscopic",,,,
Teacher,230.2,i'd like to focus first on those that said that they do that there is sufficient evidence so that would be Chris Jazmin Luis. Now what part of the text makes you think that the water would be a valuable resource?,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"But, based on the text, what makes you believe that water could be a valuable resource.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, and Jazmin you were saying that you found your evidence somewhere else in the text. Where did you find your evidence.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Okay, well, I mean.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"um so the text where you find your evidence isn't necessarily important, so long as you can back it up.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Farrah, where did you find this? How did you know? Did you find it in the text?",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Yeah. In paragraph 3, it was the last sentence of the text that I found it.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Yeah they do use that that is a really good point. And do you know when we answer these I want you guys to try and think of where you found them and let me know where you found them because we want to bring in that information from the text. So where do you think you found that one.,,,,
Farrah,230.2,In the reading?,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"You can say The number of the point it was on. So like the microscope part, where was that?",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Oh, it was paragraph three.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Is there anything more specific that you want to pull from her answer in the text.,,,,
Oliver,230.2,I'm not sure what what to pull.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,So they did find them in the craters and but what part of the text did you get that one from?,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Did you find that anywhere, specifically in the text.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So good so in the text where did you find that in the text, what made you choose as your response.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Alright, so we're in the text did you find that answer what made you choose that as the answer to the question.",,,,
Chris,230.2,"Okay, I remember it was in the beginning um yeah and paragraph one, and why I chose, it was because I was looking for some of the key words in the question.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"All right, that is very true I want you to walk me through where you found that answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"In paragraph five, did you find it.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,But we just want to work to kind of find an example in the text. So that you know where you saw that in the text?,,,,
Farrah,230.2,Yeah. It was in paragraph three.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,You think equipment like oxygen like an oxygen oxygen tank.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"So actually I didn't even really read it, because I already know a lot about space and I already know that scientists use oxygen tank so that's how I got that piece.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So can we look back into the reading and you see anything about a microscope in any of the sections, you can tell me which section if you see it in like how they're numbered, let me know. Why don't you look back now.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"And if you don't see it, that's okay too.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"It's in it's in part three. It's in part three, paragraph three, they say you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Awesome. And I see you got that from the second sentence and paragraph five, is that correct",,,,
Luis,230.2,I am I sure did.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"I do have a question for you. Is there anything about using the water for growing things on the moon in the article. Do you remember, or are you kind of just thinking of things that we do with water on Earth.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,When we look back at it.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Right, what's, what's the textual evidence to support Chris's claim with the main idea of the first Paragraph is that scientists found lots of water on the moon.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"It says that, like in the first sentence, they found evidence that there's water deep in the polar craters but Chris. I don't know if it's like full of water, but, um, it's in the craters.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,And can you point out some evidence for the texts that tells you that astronauts will be able to not go into space with water on spaceships anymore.,,,,
Chris,230.2,"Yeah, I think I found it. Oh, oh yeah okay it's here on portal where it says, water is heavy. It takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Very good. Could you saying is there anything more that the text says about water and how heavy it is,,,,
Chris,230.2,Having water vailable on the moon would leave more room on the spacecraft for people and things,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Do you find this to be compelling evidence that the water would be valuable,,,,
Chris,230.2,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think that's important that they. It's really heavy. And so they could make the spacecraft's lighter or maybe bring other other equipment that's, um, that's important to",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Does I'm pretty cool. If you go back to the text and you reread the part of the tax the toxin that talks about that gives you that information about hydrogen oxygen being used for fuel. Is there anything around it that lets you know why that would be useful to astronauts.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"Oh yeah, okay. Oh, this is why, this is why I picked this. Okay. Um, it says oxygen and hydrogen could be used for rocket fuel.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Did, can you tell me where it is in story, I believe you. I just, I just need the actual text, please.",,,,
Oliver,230.2,"Oh, okay. So, um, and the last part, it says I'm making a plan will take a lot of time and money like you can just go to the moon today and drink this water or anything, because it's not ready yet.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Yes, good i'm glad you were able to connect to prior experience to that so How does that relate to what we're talking about in the text did you see anything in the text about things that they use.",,,,
Chris,230.2,"Oh Oh well, no I guess it's just when I read it It reminded me of going to NASA and I know that we have to say it Whitman, and so it made me think of that appointment.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,But I just need you to write down where you found your answer.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,But then I want you to tell me where you find the evidence. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Why, why did you answer it like that and see if your answer is in the text. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,What details in the text or what specific equipment are mentioned in the text that scientists used to discover water Chris.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"I'm wondering how is your answer, different from Jazmin and what evidence did you use To explain how your you got a different answer from Jazmin and what evidence you used",,,,
Oliver,230.2,"Um, yeah, definitely. Okay. So I said, no, there is not convincing evidence because I'm though the water isn't ready yet. I mean, it's not like you could just go to the moon today and I'm drink the water and plant a garden.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Teacher : So a scientific tool called a microscope. To look really closely. Okay. Did you find evidence of that in the text.,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"In part three, it talks about the microscope and how the water is really small.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Teacher : Luis You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. Where did you see oxygen tanks.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"Oh, well I just know a lot about space because I watch videos on YouTube and I watch stuff about rocket launches and I really know a lot about astronauts. So, um, I just know that the astronauts would have needed oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Right, I mean you know how I also a good way to test to see if that makes sense. That's what came first, in the text right?",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Farrah's nswer. I can find that right in paragraph two, whereas, I'm sorry, not Farrah Jazmin's answer I can find in paragraph two, but Farrah. Where did you find your answer.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,On part three.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Hmm. And where did you find that,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,It's in,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"That's fantastic. Exactly. The more specific. We are in the texts. Can you help me find out where that is, which which pairs.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,I found it in paragraph two in the in the first sentence.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Wow, that's awesome Background information. Is there any evidence in the text that you found that kind of That supports that they use oxygen and hydrogen tanks and etc.",,,,
Chris,230.2,"Um, oh, oh, well, no, not in this story, but I just know that if there were astronauts, they would need all of those things.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Let me pull up my text, which paragraph was that in.",,,,
Oliver,230.2,"Oh, this is Oliver. I'm really sorry, but actually we have to go and I wanted to say thank you so much for really",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Cool. And did you get that information from the reading that we did.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"No, I just I just knew that because I watch all sorts of stuff about astronauts on like YouTube and you know on the internet and stuff.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"And when you're reading through what makes you, where do you think that came from in the reading?",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Oh well, I wasn't quite sure, because when I was looking at it, it sounded to me like it was just a little bit of water, but maybe he was thinking about the craters, like in part one, it says craters.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,So as you're reading. Where do you think Luis got the answer of the oxygen tanks.,,,,
Chris,230.2,"Yeah, well. So here's the thing. So we were talking about it because we both know about space, but then when I looked at the at the story again, it didn't actually say anything about oxygen tanks or even like astronauts really",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Oh, where did you find that in the text.",,,,
Oliver,230.2,"To paragraph two,",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"You found your first answer in paragraph three, correct?",,,,
Oliver,230.2,Yeah paragraph 3 is about the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Oh, I see. You found that in paragaph two as well right?",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Since we've looked at Jazmin's answer and Luis's answer. Let's look a little closer at Chris's answer. So what did you all find when you were reading again and reading closely to see where Chris got his answer and what you might Luis yeah,,,,
Luis,230.2,"Okay, so, um, I don't know where Chris got his answer because if you read the story, it's pretty clear that there weren't any craters full of water or anything.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,In the text. Do you see anywhere that it says that the oxygen tanks helped to discover the water,,,,
Teacher,230.2,What did you read,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,I read paragraph two where it says,,,,
Teacher,230.2,And where did you get that idea from within the text. If you notice the word so you can explain,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Yes exactly where you found it.,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Yes, I found it in, in paragraph three on it. Some where they talk about how the waters microscopic",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Was that a big clue for you.,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Yeah, exactly. I know that a microscope is a tool.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Well what paragraph, did you get that from?",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"I like the way you're thinking, can you explain why or anywhere in the article where you've seen that a microscope was used.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Yeah, so it's on paragraph, paragraph three, it says scientists need a scientific tool called a microscope, because the water, the water is so small.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"And Farrah, would you mind talking about how did you get that answer, what in the text caused you to answer that.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"So there's this part on Part three, and it says the water is microscopic. So how can you discover something microscopic if you can't see it. That's why I thought you'd need the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"But going back to the question with the part of the question that says evidence that water on the moon can be valuable. What are some things that are listed in the text. Yes, a garden can regrow but does it say that in the text.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,No,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Yes. Did you see that in the text.,,,,
Chris,230.2,In part two.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Did you finding the passage.,,,,
Chris,230.2,Oh.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,yeah which line it's.,,,,
Chris,230.2,the Lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So, can you tell me like where you found this answer, Luis?",,,,
Luis,230.2,"Okay, I might not have read the whole thing, let me see.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Oh, a lot, where do you find this information.",,,,
Chris,230.2,"On the Internet or cuz, I would like to read about what's going on at NASA and so there was an article on the Internet, talking about some of the work that are that the scientists are doing to try to find.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Oh, where like where did you find your previous answer in this paragraph.",,,,
Chris,230.2,"Oh no, it was in the first paragraph.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Yeah, that's right. Well what in the text makes you think that within the next, what do you see that maybe that can be an equipment, for this idea?",,,,
Chris,230.2,From the story?,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Yeah, from this story like for this case for this specific case, we're talking about discovering water in the moono. So what in the text makes you think about they need oxygen tanks to discover water",,,,
Chris,230.2,"I, well, I guess, those aren't from the story, but I just thought because we were talking about equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"You're right. So what in the text makes you think that that's a, that's a main word. What do you think that",,,,
Oliver,230.2,What do I think is the right answer.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Can someone told me where is your answer according to the text.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So, did you find any anything in this text to backup that there was oxygen tanks.",,,,
Chris,230.2,"Oh, you mean the story.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,I was wondering if you could tell me where you what made you say your response have you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"I'm. Excuse me, excuse me, I have my hand up.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,So I'm also going to follow the same question for you. What made you focus on that specific part in relation to the question that it was asking.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So I'm glad you said that. So I'm going to follow up with you with the same question I had, which event and Chris, what exactly what language or what part of that. Did you see and think, oh, that's the answer to the prompt that has given me.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,Well they talked about it in part two. That's where I found my answer. And I guess I know I was looking for some kind of equipment from the question and a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,um so what in the article um made you think of oxygen tanks?,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, so even were in the passage do you hear them talking about oxygen tanks.",,,,
Luis,230.2,yeah that's something I didn't.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"and where in the passage Chris, can we find one of those.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Part Three okay cool and what about our orbiter where do we see evidence that that was an important tool for our scientists.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"Oh okay I got it, I read that passage and it talks about that orbiter thing Oh, it sounds amazing and it's in part two.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"yeah that's, what can you tell us which paragraph you saw that in? See they're numbered 1, 2, 3.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,I found it in paragraph number two.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,hi everyone i'm i'm so glad that everybody had shared their answer and I want to call on Farrah could you explain more about what in the text me do you find your answer.,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"yeah okay well i'm so on the third paragraph at the bottom, it says that the water is microscopic so you need a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Yes, and can you tell us exactly where you found that in the text, which paragraph and sentence in that paragraph?",,,,
Luis,230.2,"yep yep yep okay um paragraph two, and the second sentence.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,and where they found the evidence in the tax alright,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Okay, my answer is NASA Center small machine and the evidence is the first sentence and paragraph two, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Could you tell me where you found that in the text.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"um okay well I just know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for this water, I definitely have oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Luis could you point out in the text where you saw that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"Oh well, actually, well, I was just gonna say I I shouldn't even be in this group, because I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So if i'm looking right now, the text, if you want to show me where in the text it says that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks that would be helpful for me to understand.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"No, no one said, your answers necessarily wrong, but could you point out in the text where you saw that the scientific tool that was used for the water was the microscope.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,yeah so it's in part three.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Now, does this specific piece of writing does a specific article mention any of the other equipment that we that was used.",,,,
Chris,230.2,"know the story, the story just says the small machine and the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Well that's wonderful.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Jazmin What in the text drove you to your answer.,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"OK, so my answer is NASA sent a small machine and I found that at the beginning of like paragraph 2.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Right so Farrah where in the text did you find the microscope?,,,,
Farrah,230.2,On part three.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Luis have you found were in the story you want us to focus on.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"Okay, so um I found these two there's two pieces of equipment that they name in the story and one is lunar orbiter and the other as Mike ruskell um so I guess i'd probably say those two things.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Yes, actually i'm in i'm glad that you said that Luis because, looking at your response when you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right um I think that that is a great observation I was wondering where you saw that in the text.",,,,
Luis,230.2,um.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"That was, and thank you again because I did want to talk about that Luis. Farrah yours, was also really interesting because you talked about the microscope, can you tell me a little bit more about what you found that in the text.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Oh yeah Okay, well, I found it in part three, where it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Seeing nods. Thank you, thank you. So why don't we start with Oliver and Farrah. I saw you guys had some consensus. Where in the text did you find that scientists need a microscope to look closely at water? Can either Oliver or Farrah read that sentence for us?",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Yes, I can do that.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Can you tell us where in the text Jazmin you found this information?,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,Let me see the first sentence in Part two,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Keep in mind the evidence for this question should come from the text. Our items, did anyone see oxygen tank mentioned anywhere in the text? If you see it feel free to raise your hand if you want to share where that was found. I'm seeing a shake head from Oliver.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Mm-hmm. And what made you think that from the passage?,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Okay, well, so in part.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"it's not wrong, maybe let's look at that part together, can you tell us where you saw that in the passage?",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Yes, definitely. I found it in Part two",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Okay perfect so let's look closely at that sentence. Farrah where do you see in the story that says it was a microscope? where exactly in the story?,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Okay, so that's in part three, the last part it says the water they found is microscopic and it says, you need a microscope to see it.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Can you tell us where exactly, that is, you can read the sentence for us.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Okay, the first sentence in Part Two says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,awesome now my question to be where'd you get the answer from did you get the evidence to support that did you get a text evidence.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"i'm so um I mean I already. know some stuff and. if there are scientists on the Moon, they need oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,hard to find an answer from.,,,,
Oliver,230.2,"um Okay, so it actually talks about a microscope and part three, and because it says on water is really small, so you would need a microscope to look at it really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Shall we just go back and see together since I didn't go with three other answers, so we could definitely do that so Jazmin, can you tell us what the paragraph, you find the answer from.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,I found the answer in the second paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"How do you know that, how do you know that the answer actually is, in the second paragraph.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"um cuz I was looking for equipment right, and so, when I was reading I only saw two places in paragraph two, or they see a small machine and then paragraph three, where they see the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,but what did the text makes you think that was the answer.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Right right very important did you get that did you get the answer from which paragraph again?,,,,
Farrah,230.2,from paragraph three.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay you're right good can you read us the sentence, where you where you got that.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"yeah okay so um it was in part two, and it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,so did you get your answer from the article or did you get your answer somewhere else?,,,,
Teacher,230.2,did you find any any convincing evidence in the text to support that it can be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,yeah that's that's a good like I really think that was a very fruitful discussion that you had with Jazmin so Jazmin how did you find out about that what What did you read that make you think that the water is not like giant deposits of water and instead it's something different.,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"And so I was focusing on paragraph two, because that's where I found my answer, so it says NASA send a small machine and that was my answer and then at the end of the paragraph, it says that the ice deposits are very small.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, good if you look at the article, can you point to the spot of the article where it talks about NASA spending, excuse me, sending not spending sending a small machine.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"yeah if the first sentence of the second paragraph, where it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"mm hmm that's true and where's Oliver Do you remember, where the microscope part was.",,,,
Oliver,230.2,yeah that's in paragraph three um it's they use the microscope to look at the water.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"so Oliver, would you be able to tell me what evidence from the text led you to believe that they used a microscope to find the underwater.",,,,
Oliver,230.2,"yeah okay well i'm really That was the part that Chris just read aloud where it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely it's like the next sentence, right after what Chris read.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Where in the text, they figured out how to answer this question about equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, and do you have a specific sentence.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Yes, so I circled the part where it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, and were you looking at a specific sentence.",,,,
Chris,230.2,mm hmm yeah so where it says on scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar readers.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Great can you show me the sentence that you found in the text that we were looking for that made you feel so confident.,,,,
Luis,230.2,"As well okay I gotta say it's not from the text but you'll have to discover and oxygen tanks, because if there's astronauts on the loan, they are using oxygen tanks when they discover the water.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,What paragraph from the text did you get your answer from?,,,,
Farrah,230.2,um I found it in part three.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Which paragraph from the text did you get your answer from?,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,I found it in Part two,,,,
Teacher,230.2,yeah that's awesome so is that information in our text anywhere Chris.,,,,
Chris,230.2,"um.. No, not really but I saw them all, when I went to NASA so I know they use them",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Oh awesome and then what paragraph did you find that piece of evidence and.,,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Okay, I found it in part three.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Can you read that sentence, do you have it circle in your APP.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"yeah OK, so the part I circled is okay, the water you they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Oh that'd be really cool to find where did you find that in the text.,,,,
Chris,230.2,"On Okay, so in part it's right at the beginning, so it says, scientists have found evidence that.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"yeah and then Jazmin quick quick update with you what part of the reading, did you find that in.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,So Jazmin was that answer directly from the text first.,,,,
Jazmin,230.2,yeah yeah it's it's in Part two,,,,
Teacher,230.2,yeah So could you please tell me more like about how you figure dthat out? So where did you find that information in this text?,,,,
Chris,230.2,"yeah, so I think that was what the first part, part one, it says in the very first sentence actually scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"so Farrah, could you please tell me that in the sentences were in the lines that you found a word microscope where did it specify the function of microscope.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Who, I really want to keep going but it's time for us to go.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,can you tell me where in the text you see the word small machine,,,,
Teacher,230.2,and did you circle that sentence in the text.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Oliver what you circle, you said you circle, the same thing as Farrah, can you tell me exactly which part of the text you circled.",,,,
Oliver,230.2,Oh yeah well I just supposed to work on my scope i'm i'm still a little confused about why the small machine is there um because I thought it was just a microscope and I don't think I want to pick small machine.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Absolutely so let's go over your new answer the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic So what did you do when you went back to the text to find this answer what was your strategy.,,,,
Chris,230.2,When I read the text again like a.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Would you mind, did you have any evidence in the texts that you had for that or is that they stand outside knowledge.",,,,
Luis,230.2,Oh um yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,So you found that from the text right.,,,,
Luis,230.2,yeah yeah I did.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,And where did you read that.,,,,
Oliver,230.2,i'm online i'm on the site on a science website for kids.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"um, I also would like to know what you guys circled in the text. I know that you guys have formulated some answers, but what what led you to your answers? Oliver.",,,,
Oliver,230.2,yeah okay i'm still i'm a little confused because I circled the microscope um but it sounds like lunar orbit is supposed to be the answer and I don't totally understand why.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"You got your answer from did you did you circle, a certain part of the text where their context clues.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,yeah so I circled the sentence that said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,That is exactly right and did you see anywhere in the text that told you what sort of equipment allowed them to find the craters.,,,,
Chris,230.2,"Oh well, I don't know about in the text, but I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"yeah so um So yes, it definitely is a small machine, but can you tell me where in the text you got the answer.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,The very beginning of Part two,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"um, can you tell me why did you decide to say the word microscope like where did you find that",,,,
Farrah,230.2,okay yeah well first that's equipment And then I found it in the third paragraph.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,Great and what makes you say that where did you find that information.,,,,
Chris,230.2,In the first paragraph um yeah it's I took it right out of the text says all water can be found deep within the bones bone craters.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Oliver Maybe you can tell us, can you tell us where in the text you found that word microscope.",,,,
Oliver,230.2,yeah that was in paragraph three.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"and that was in the tax Luis, can you tell me where in the text you found those words hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Luis,230.2,yeah it's in paragraph five,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"and so I wonder, can you tell us where he where did you find that part in the text he Chris yeah.",,,,
Chris,230.2,"own oh yeah Okay, in paragraph four, it says, for example, was this it could be useful lots of ways, for example, future astronauts could drink this water water is heavy it takes up a lot of Romana spacecraft having water available in the moment me more room on the spacecraft thing.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,um so thinking about equipment that scientists use discover water on the moon um does anyone have an idea of maybe which paragraph we might look to.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Okay, can you explain that a little bit and why you looked at paragraph three.",,,,
Oliver,230.2,"um yeah so paragraph three, they were talking about a scientific tool, it says that mo story and that's on microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"so Chris, do you see oxygen tanks in this text.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Why did you give us this answer? where do you find it in the text?,,,,
Farrah,230.2,yeah I think I think I think Luis has something to say though um and and I'll answer maybe after him.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So i'm wondering why you say why you locate your answer at the second paragraph, what evidence, do you use to your answer?",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,"Okay yeah, so I think my evidence is the first sentence in paragraph two where it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and I would say that that's my evidence.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"So actually, and where did you find this answer?",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,In part two.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"yeah yeah just in the following sentence, right.",,,,
Jazmin,230.2,yeah exactly.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Now, I just want to discuss what made you circle, the answer that you did? okay.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Oh that's all true right, so you used your personal experience right to know and you saw with your own eyes what they're using right um, can I ask did they, did you see the ma- any of what you saw mentioned in the text?",,,,
Chris,230.2,No they aren't in the story.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"oxygen tank, how do you get that from text.",,,,
Luis,230.2,On say well sorry.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Someone mentioned, is that scientist need an oxygen tanks, can you find the oxygen tank in zoos test can anyone tell me about please.",,,,
Chris,230.2,"yeah well Okay, so I know Luis talked about the oxygen tanks before and I was thinking something similar of actually because I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and also masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,Does this mention.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,They did was that in the reading or was that just something you knew.,,,,
Luis,230.2,I I I don't.,,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Right, so what would we be looking at in the text, what did it say that we would have to be looking at.",,,,
Farrah,230.2,"Okay, well, we would be looking at the tiny Oh, what did they call them ice deposits.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Chris, can you show me where you found that in the article.",,,,
Teacher,230.2,"Interesting, can you tell me where you found that in the article",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Even better answer So yes, great so you have this microscope and we're saying that we need it because to discover the water, because the water is so small that you wouldn't be able to see it otherwise awesome yes Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,230.3,So.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,yeah so definitely a lot of different equipment and even in this reading right we've already identified two different.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So Okay, we might have found our answer in the second paragraph we're thinking that perhaps the equipment that they used is this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,,
Teacher,230.3,yeah so you're you're you're thinking they might have needed to use a microscope to see it,,,,
Farrah,230.3,"It says, you need a scientific tool.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So Farrah and Oliver, you said you will have the same answer, so why don't we work together and Chris i'll be with you in just a second.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Oh okay Jazmin You said something like that didn't you.,,,,
Jazmin,230.3,yeah I said NASA send a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,and I noticed that your answer um you definitely say a lot of equipment that scientists do use so i'm assuming you've probably done some sort of independent research or reading on this.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,so a couple of you put that they would need a microscope right,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"But there was like a little parts that concern me and I wanted to help you guys sort of find that you can fix those answers, by looking for things like evidence and complete answers. Oliver yeah.",,,,
Oliver,230.3,um i'm sorry but it's time for us to go now.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Right, okay. That can be one way that can be so they don't have to use a travel with it there. They can use what's on the man.",,,,
Luis,230.3,"Um, well, water can be the said water can be broken down into two parts like hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Right, and that's going to be very valuable for the astronauts right they're going to use the water",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah, oxygen, and then they can use the hydrogen from the water for rocket fuel. Right. And also, Chris was saying that they wouldn't have to travel with it.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"From Earth to the Moon, and then I'll back right the indices what's there.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, back to Farrah. Your answer was, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"You're welcome and and Oliver, you said that you had circled the same thing as Farrah. So I'm assuming that you address that you were thinking that it was the microscope as well.",,,,
Oliver,230.3,"Yeah, I had a microscope and I kind of thought. Same thing as Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"It, Luis, and we see here and we were talking about using all the other equipment. Right.",,,,
Luis,230.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yes, they do have to use a lot of equipment. You are right, and I'm sure there's a lot more than just oxygen tanks and a lot more than what we know about  Here, since we are not an astronaut or we don't go out into space.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So you were thinking they use a lot more equipment on their body to go into the craters like he was talking about oxygen tanks.,,,,
Chris,230.3,"Yeah, like maybe, you know, like, I guess I'm not yeah like I was thinking like, did they use that to go into craters and see like I i understand like, it's not as much water like but like, you know, if we went in the crater. Like there's they find the water by like walking in with their space suits.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,That we haven't seen it yet. I appreciate that. I do agree with you. We haven't seen it yet because it is something that may take a lot of time and money for us to see but,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And so, carrying all that water may not be very may not be a very good idea if we can find water and a way to use it on the moon,",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Am I correct Chris is that you're thinking,,,,
Chris,230.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Space and on the spacecraft, it would be valuable to not have to carry all that weight if we had access to water on the moon. And that would make it valuable to us. We could carry more equipment or more astronauts instead",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Hey everybody. Farrah. I loved your answer, but I want to challenge you a little bit. You said that you use the microscope to look closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so, Jazmin just gave us an excellent answer. She said that she thinks she can find the answer in paragraph two, and then I heard from Oliver. He said he thought it was in paragraph three.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"That's okay. Thank you for raising your hand so Farrah thought it was in paragraph three, and Jazmin thought it was in paragraph two,",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"You did correct your answer, but your answer. Um, you said using a small machine, Luis.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Very good. And the other machine that you found was the Lunar Orbiter. Correct?,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Perfect so answering that Jazmin answered it perfectly. She said that, um, let me see if I found it NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Correct?,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"You think that you know everything about space, you don't have to learn everything more",,,,
Luis,230.3,"Well, I mean, not like everything, but I know a lot a lot a lot about space.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yes, that would be an option to maybe Luis Can share with us something that he knows of of the space that is not in the in reading that you have to read.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"All right. All right. Let's then switch track. Let's take care of that. Let's see here. So, Jazmin, you said NASA sent a small machine. And that's true.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,You got it all figured out. Luis I'm excited to hear. So let's take a look right now. We had your response as scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Addition there. So you started off really powerfully and then up when you end your response there. You talk about a to look really close.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,It's not ready yet. Your answer isn't ready yet.,,,,
Oliver,230.3,No.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,So I just wanted to clarify that. So you said the water is not ready to eat. To us yet. Is that what you're trying to say.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Nothing. I can't remember who said it but you have saving way. I think it was Chris right,,,,
Chris,230.3,"Yeah, yeah. I said that",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So are all these things we just talked about that have value.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Right, are all of these things, able to be done with water.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Right, it might be expensive and take a long time, but yes. So these are all the things that you should listen",,,,
Chris,230.3,"Okay, um, you know, I read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So let's look at your evidence so Farrah and Oliver looked right towards the microscope Chris looked,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"At the craters on the moon and Jazmin was looking at, paragraph two at a small machine. All of these are good pieces of information from our passage",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Awesome. So, Farrah says that maybe if our keyword and our keyword is discover maybe if our keyword is discover I'm trying to find something that helps me locate where the water is found Chris, what did you want to add",,,,
Chris,230.3,"Well, I just, I, I kind of like, okay, I was thinking about out my dad took me to NASA.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"She was saying that maybe if the key word is discover what equipment right equipment can name several different things. Okay, what equipment. Did they use to discover",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So Farrah is realizing that maybe they didn't use the microscope tool to to first discover the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Very good. So Oliver also is able to go back and tell me the paragraph and where he found that in the passage.,,,,
Chris,230.3,"Well, I guess like it makes sense that like you would have to use those things. But I guess I'm confused. Like, it sounds like the answer of Jazmin's is like kind of right but it sounds like Oliver and Farrah. Like, I don't understand, like, did the astronauts who saw the water, did they use a microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yes. Which would also go in with what Chris was saying about water is so heavy. If they had water on the moon, they could use that to drink, and they wouldn't have to carry the water all over the place and save up some room for their stops. What do you think about that, Chris?",,,,
Jazmin,230.3,"Yes. Yes. I think that's why I said that, because I got that from the story.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So you're thinking it was an unmanned aircraft, meaning that there was nobody on the moon, but they sent just a machine. Correct?",,,,
Chris,230.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Alright so Chris thought the same thing as Oliver,,,,
Jazmin,230.3,"I said, equipment and I thought I circled discovered in the question for me.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Now, I noticed that Farrah and Oliver noticed that there is they said that there's not any evidence right and then Chris Jazmin and Luis did say that there is some evidence. Luis What did you have to say.",,,,
Luis,230.3,"I think I got this figured out, so I'm all good.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yes, right. So if we look back, you were us used an example from the text from paragraph five, all right, or excuse me, paragraph four, and it was saying that Since water so heavy. It would take up a lot of space. And then if we didn't have to bring it. It would save some space",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So Chris just listed one, there's a couple more in there and what in your said that astronauts can drink water and stay hydrated. You can't survive with water alone right",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah. And so if you look back, you found your answer in paragraph four, and it says for example future future astronauts could drink this water.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so since you said, and with no so that means there's is there small amounts of water on the moon as what we believe.",,,,
Farrah,230.3,"okay. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz we read that in the first part, it says they're small amounts. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Let's see here. Luis You mentioned a scientist like to use a lot of equipment. Yes?,,,,
Luis,230.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Farrah, you mentioned a thing called a microscope and it does something to look really closely.",,,,
Farrah,230.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And that special tool is what Farrah mentioned Farrah, you mentioned that you they use a scientific tool called a microscope. Yes.",,,,
Farrah,230.3,"Yeah, that was people used to find it.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Speaking of drinking water, Jazmin, you mentioned astronauts can drink water and stay hydrated and you can't survive without it. That is true.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,What it but you yeah but you say they wouldn't have to carry it on ships anymore.,,,,
Chris,230.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,You think it's a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay. Um, but you said that the water they found right",,,,
Teacher,230.3,To restate the question to the form your answer. Yes.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, what I understand that your answer was scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"That is very true. Yes, water is heavy. So it would be good, that if they didn't have to carry it on the ship. They could have room for other things. So that is very good thinking,",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Machine was sent to investigate.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so whenever the astronauts have to go into space, there's no oxygen in space. So they have to have an oxygen tank and a mask and things like that to be able to survive when they go into space. Does that make sense?",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, just a good piece of evidence that we can use water and specifically that the astronauts could use water.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"I'm jab and Farrah you both wrote no to this answer. And you said, not for a long time, or it's not ready yet.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Jazmin has given us some good information of why it could be good and why it could be valuable and and,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And then Chris's answer follows up to that is, if they had water there so they wouldn't have to carry it around so that would be valuable because we all need water to drink.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so that's a good story they talk about the water being heavy and that could be a positive thing that they're not having to carry on the ships,",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay. Yeah, they did. They didn't need a lot of equipment to get up there because there's not a lot of oxygen. They need a lot of tools.",,,,
Luis,230.3,Hmm.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yes, and you are exactly right. They do need a lot of those equipment tools to use to get up to space because without on they wouldn't have been able to get on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So I see that Oliver and Farrah. You guys said know that you didn't think that there was any evidence to find water valuable.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yes, and I completely agree. It will take a long time. And that's what the passage said that it's going to take a long time but",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yes, that's a good idea and I seen in your answer. You said how it was definitely important to have the water because they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water. That is very true. You definitely can't. So it is very valuable to have the water",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Also see where Chris, he added, kind of onto your answer. And he said that it was heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"I heard up until where you said the, you know, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, because they can't breathe in space. So we need oxygen.",,,,
Luis,230.3,"Yeah, exactly. You can't go to the Mon without an oxygen tank.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,NASA sent a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,They said that they wanted a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Right, so they can use the oxygen to breathe and then they can use the hydrogen as or do you want to add to that Oliver?",,,,
Oliver,230.3,"Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I really just wanted to thank you and I wanted to thank you, particularly for helping us to clarify our thinking.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, well that's perfect Farrah. So let's go ahead and get into those answers. So you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to close to look really closely.",,,,
Farrah,230.3,I'm really closely at the water,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Exactly right. So something that is useful or important already so something that is useful or important,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Let's see, Farrah and Oliver, you both said, It's not ready yet, or it would take a long time for the scientists to get it and even those both of those things are true.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah, you can drink it can make rocket fuel everything else Jazmin?",,,,
Jazmin,230.3,"Reach Every Reader:You can drink it, you can make rocket fuel. Oh, you can breathe it, they said that you can breathe it if you make oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"See, um, let's talk about sorry I have to keep looking back at my picture. Um, let's see. Luis You said water can be. You can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. So those are very important things.,",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Awesome. Okay, so I just want to make sure that heard you out there. So you're talking about the microscope that you can see the water with correct",,,,
Farrah,230.3,Yeah yeah,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Good. Awesome. Good. So it was a small machine, but it was the more specific name for it was a lunar orbiter rat.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"read what you wrote your class. Um, so, Farrah, you said not for a long time. Right, so that. So you mean that it could be valuable, but it's not valuable right now. Right. Is that right, is that what you meant by that. Okay. Okay, so",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Why it's going to take a long time. So, so you feel it will be valuable, but it's not available right now. Correct. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"You said yes is astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated. You can't survive without water. That is exactly right. The astronauts. We do need water to survive. Right. And stay hydrated and you can't survive that water, that's exactly right now in our text you know how it said",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah, I was trying to get to that. Yes. You said water is is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it and ships anymore. That's good. So, but they still have to carry it and ships because they have to get there. Correct.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so let's let's think about your answer. So you said they use Microsoft's correct",,,,
Jazmin,230.3,All,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Oliver, you said you found the same exact answer, as I'm Farrah. Is that right,",,,,
Oliver,230.3,Uh huh.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"But, and I want to specifically look at what you wrote on your answer. You said that you could",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Stay hot, they need to stay hydrated and you can't survive without water.",,,,
Jazmin,230.3,"Well, they were talking about it. I'm paragraph one, but um",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"What did you say before you told me that what was the first part, you just read there.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And I, I want to ask another question. When you said that. So you said water is heavy you found that in the first paragraph. Right.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah, so we're saving saving some energy for that space shuttle.",,,,
Oliver,230.3,Was harrowing,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Well, I wanted to call you back here, because even though you know a lot about space in your answer that you gave to my first question, tells me that you know that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Alright so Miss Farrah. I want to talk about your answer real quick how you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Farrah,230.3,"okay. So when I looked at was, I was thinking, okay, so what equipment did they use to discover the water right, so what I saw was like microscope. I thought that would be what you'd have to use because they say that the water is microscopic",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so in this article right here or in these paragraphs. There's a few reasons as to why waters valuable.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So you are right in the fact that it is heavy. It takes up a lot of room. And so that is one reason that water on the moon would be a valuable resource.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, well, we'll go over yours too. So you mentioned a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Science is a your answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay. Yeah. And I agree with you, Jazmin. I think a equipment and discover and you may have circled other words as well. But I think that we are looking for the equipment used to discover the water.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So the two verbs here where,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Discover and equipment. Okay, so let's take about",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Farrah and Oliver, both of y'all kind of said no it's not ready.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,There's no real evidence on why it's valuable this time.,,,,
Farrah,230.3,"Yeah, I mean,",,,,
Teacher,230.3,And I'll see yourChris and you put water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to curate in the ships anymore. So I guess with your answer.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"You're kind of saying that it's important. They found water. That way they don't have to bring it back and forth, which it talks about in the text, so",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And so, Farrah, you've mentioned that it will be a long time.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah, and that's certainly very true. It will take a long time to do it and will take a large investment, a lot of money will be spent to get the water. In other words, it's not available right away.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so it'll just take them a while but it'll be important.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"That's right and Luis mentioned that that water is is very -- sorry Chris. And actually, you mentioned that water was very heavy and that right now. Astronauts have to carry it in space. But if they could get water on the moon, that would certainly be viable.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Very good. So that's a very good observation on your part Chris. And then if they didn't have to carry all the water with and they had room to carry other things whether that's fuel or other equipment or more people. So that's very useful.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,That's a great idea. That's certainly another great use for water is that you could use it to potentially grow your food. And so now that's less things that you have to carry with you.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay. So certainly, if it's very expensive and hard to do that may or may not be able to get to the water and so unless you can get through it. It has no value, right.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,You didn't find where the water is located and you said it found craters with the water.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,and so Luis You mentioned that you can see water puddles.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,That's a use all those things because the environment in space requires him to have been extra equipment right? There's a lot of things that they need to do.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Oh, good job. So it's something that",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Needs to be stated it in a way that you can believe it right. What about you, Demi",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So there has to be more knowledge they have to provide more knowledge than what you have,,,,
Oliver,230.3,Yeah yeah,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so they're making statements to make you believe something",,,,
Jazmin,230.3,"Well, I guess, like when I am trying to advocate for our environment and I go out and I I pass out leaflets to try to tell people what they can do. I try to convince them.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,You're very good drink it. And that's something that's valuable to them because we all have to have water to stay hydrated. Right.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Oh, so you're looking at it from the fact that the moon is not ready as a whole to be lived on right",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So back to Farrah. And I think, Oliver, you said you had the same answers her",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Farrah, you believe that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely when you are trying to look at water on the moon.",,,,
Farrah,230.3,Right.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"you know, this technology will, you know, sort of be needed to be expanded upon going forward.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, well, good job, for sure. Um, it would be very expensive. Every time that you know you need to go into spaces is pretty expensive.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yes, yes, it's so you are correct. Currently, like, like you said, as for right now is, you know, not very valuable. Just because we don't really have anybody there but",,,,
Farrah,230.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yes, yes it. Good job. Chris you Luis are on the same page.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"You both have come up with the same evidence that perhaps you know like, like you said, if we were able to ever have someone living on the moon. Hopefully soon but maybe you know further along in the future.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Did you tell me that our plants need water to survive, is that correct?",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so it's really, really, really, really, really, really small. We can't see it with our",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah. Okay. So let's think about putting all of these things that we know together, we know that we're going to use the microscope to look at the microscopic us",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Right, that we found on the moon. So we're going to put all of this together. We know that the",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"OK, so the lunar orbiter is going to investigate the US deposits",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so we know that NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Perfect, perfect. So we've talked about a couple things we talked about a microscope and we've talked about a small machine",,,,
Teacher,230.3,You can do some cool stuff with it and Chris actually wrote about some cool stuff or another cool benefit of it,,,,
Chris,230.3,"Yeah, so I said that water is heavy. So it's really good.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,You're right. The astronauts and so water is very heavy on,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Or it's very cumbersome for astronauts,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"From your evidence. It sounds like you think, yes. Is that true",,,,
Luis,230.3,"Yeah, I",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Yes you do say yes answers. So you go yes and you're very use think strongly about it. There's an exclamation point.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Farrah. So you put no, not for a long time. So that's fine that that you think that um, because this is, it's what you believe. So, um,",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Is there and convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. So you're saying no.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Waters, so it's good. They don't have to Carry it in the ships anymore.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And you read that in the text, that's fine. Water is heavy.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so you are talking about bringing water so that might imply that water on the moon can be very valuable. Okay, so",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Some of our other answers. So we had a couple people think that we were looking for microscope. Now the Jazmin has found the sentence that told us the lunar orbiter was the machine that helped the scientists discover water,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So let's look so Jazmin, you said that the small machine.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Was the equipment that you think help the scientists and Oliver. You said the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,So we're looking so we've narrowed it down. We have our small machine. And we have a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Very true. So, so we know that ice is the water. We know that the water that we find is very small. Okay, so that's very good. We're going to keep that in the back of our brains.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, very good. So where we're thinking about how small the water is.",,,,
Chris,230.3,"Um, yeah. So I kind of went in. I was looking at, like, um, I guess, Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so we have lunar orbiter again",,,,
Luis,230.3,"Well, okay, so I didn't really read it that closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Right. So, very good, very good. So we know Chris oh sorry Oliver and Farrah, let us know that we need a microscope to see the water on the moon. Right?",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Hold your thought we're going to get to your, your comment because you talked about suit scientists using a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and oxygen masks in space.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,And I think you're absolutely right that we need to look at our title. So we have water we have equipment.,,,,
Oliver,230.3,"Okay, I can do that.  it's me Oliver. Okay, so, um, so like there's water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Why the microscope is not the answer.,,,,
Farrah,230.3,Cuz that looks like it's still the answer to me.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Very good. So it comes first in the story. And then we use the microscope to identify the water,,,,
Oliver,230.3,"Okay, okay, well, it's time for us to go. Um, so I want to take. Thanks for coming to work with us and we'll see you next time.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Hey kiddos. So looking at Question two. I'm seeing everybody's responses and it looks like we are split between water being valuable. And if there's evidence for and water not being valuable.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Absolutely. Jazmin, we can use the water for drinking. We can also use the oxygen for breathing.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,And I like your reasoning there because it's going to take time and money that that it would be difficult to get right now,,,,
Farrah,230.3,"Okay. Um, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Right, so we can use it to breathe as well. And I think breathing and staying alive in space is very important.",,,,
Farrah,230.3,"Yeah, I think so too.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah, so if we if we can find water and use it. We've already said it's valuable and we can put a moon base on the moon, then that means the water that we found can be used directly on the moon, which means what.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So I think, I think you guys have it. I think we are understanding that water is valuable because it allows us to do all these different things, especially if we can put a moon base on the moon.",,,,
Oliver,230.3,Yeah yeah,,,,
Teacher,230.3,and I know that some people had mentioned microscope are being microscopic,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah, I agree, equipment and discover are two very important keywords for our question number one.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"You are welcome and, Chris, you looked at, found craters full of water on the moon. Right?",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah, so, Farrah, you talked about the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,One question for you guys. So you had both mentioned the fact that water is found in Luis You had mentioned equipment they had been used,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah. And so, so we know the water, the water is there. Right. I mean, Chris you even said yourself that they found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Chris,230.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,So the water can be used for two different things for the astronauts to drink. And as the fuel if they break it into two parts. So that was two of the ways that they could use it.,,,,
Chris,230.3,"Oh, I was just going to share my answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Alright, so we have identified the word microscopic. Now I'm going to reread the question once more, just so we get it back into our heads. The question is this.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah, and that's exactly why I pause for just a moment because you both do have the same answer. So I'd like to dress you both at the same time. So you have the same answer As Farrah. That's great. You do use a microscope to actually see the water",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So your answer was that they use oxygen tanks, essentially, is what your answer was",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And Jazmin, you mentioned that they did use the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. So we know that they sent up that small machine and Farrah, we know that we have to use a microscope to actually see the water.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So I think you guys are on the right track with that and then Chris and Luis, you guys agreed that there was other equipment used",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, that's a good job. Jazmin. So it looks like so far, Farrah, and Jazmin. You guys have both talked about equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Sure. Jazmin. So I think that you're on the right track because they did send a small machine. And now that you've added the name you've definitely added more detail.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"They do need a small machine and, more specifically, as you just said in paragraph two, we can see they send a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter in this case.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,You're right. Scientists are going to be using a lot of equipment when they go to the moon.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So you have mentioned something that is valuable, they can",,,,
Teacher,230.3,They don't have to put that water on the rocket.,,,,
Chris,230.3,As well. So I read somewhere that they were maybe going to try to put in a moon base by 2020 or like some kind of base. And I guess if that was true.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Like what you've done, you got to that last paragraph, where it says that scientists need to come up with a plan for extracting the water. So you're right that water isn't ready yet. They're going to have to Oliverelop a plan to extract water so it can be used.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,You are so close. And I love how you guys are trying to think about this. So let me help you with this. Okay. You're telling me that I can split. Both of these things up.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"To us and help benefit the astronauts when they go to the moon. We do drink water because we have to have it for our bodies, but we breathe oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Mr. Luis You said that those two elements are can be broken apart. So hydrogen and oxygen. Think about them being separate now so your water molecules are now broken apart.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,You're left with hydrogen and oxygen.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yes, correct. And, and then I loved and Chris, you said that there was craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And Farrah told us that microscopic means you have to look through a microscope to see it, meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Jazmin,230.3,So I guess what I saw was like that the moon is really like a desert like it's really dry and there's just a little bit of water there,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, now, so. So you're thinking, we may not have the technology yet.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,It is very heavy. Going back to your first statement so transporting it would be something that we would have to do.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"now, Farrah, and Oliver you guys mentioned that during our discussion that the technology might not be ready for that yet but however there are some possibilities that we can use water.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"let's think about oxygen. Luis, you said about the last question that they use oxygen tanks right on the moon.",,,,
Luis,230.3,yeah right.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,yeah so you guys kind of had the same idea that they have to bring water anyways so they could just pick some up while they're there.,,,,
Jazmin,230.3,"So it me and Chris had some good ideas, then, how come we're in this group.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,mm hmm so you and Farrah had the same idea.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Jazmin and Luis and Chris brought up the idea of oxygen and you need water, but then you and Farrah thought about what it would take to get that so you, your opinion on it is whether or not it would be worth it to do it.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay Jazmin so, you said that NASA sent a small machine right.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Your answer was that they found craters of water on the moon right.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And we'll start with a Oliver this time, so you answered that um no the water on the moon is not ready yet correct.",,,,
Oliver,230.3,Correct.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"that's a really good strategy um so in your response, you said that water can be split into hydrogen and oxygen right yeah.",,,,
Luis,230.3,straight from the text.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so Oliver and Farrah you guys did have similar answers you guys said not ready yet or not, for a long time um.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So you did a great job finding that it was a small machine Jazmin, but Farrah was just a little more clear and how she said it was a microscope.",,,,
Jazmin,230.3,"Um, I mean I think so, but I okay i'm going to listen more and then I'll see if I have a question.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So we're using your background knowledge on the word.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,equipment.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,And like tool you like,,,,
Oliver,230.3,yeah that's what I knew about equipment.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,So here's what you're using our already background knowledge on what scientists had already used for previous things correct.,,,,
Oliver,230.3,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Quality of it that it can zoom in on something and pick up very small details of the water and like what it's what micro like what's in it and stuff,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Awesome. Thank you. And Oliver your response was just comparing to Farrah is which was a great point. She was absolutely correct.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Thanks guys alright so Farrah we were talking about the microscope and how that's the only object that you found after looking through the first three paragraphs.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"so we know that Jazmin said that we found small machine in the second paragraph, so i'm gonna talk with Jazmin",,,,
,230.3,"yeah Okay, I see it.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So Farrah and Jazmin, the two of you, in your responses mentioned -actually Luis you as well, so Farrah Jazmin and Luis the three of you mentioned some type of equipment that was used.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So, I have a specific little notes for each of you, so let me start off with Farrah. Farrah you said no, not for a long time for the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable so Luis yes.",,,,
Luis,230.3,"Okay, I think I got it now and i'm all good.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"let's let's take a look at yours and then we'll go to Luis's um, you said that yes, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water, so you, yes, you did.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"so, as I was just saying to Jazmin she said that for in the future astronauts can.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Exactly so that's one of our possible answers that could be one reason why it could be valuable is that it's heavy so if it's already there they already have access to it and they don't need to worry about bringing it to the moon Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,That is Farrah and we know that water is heavy so if there's less space for water than we can bring more people that's awesome a Oliver.,,,,
Oliver,230.3,um well I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah, you need a lot of different equipment to be able to go into outer space. Don't you?",,,,
Chris,230.3,Yeah yeah,,,,
Teacher,230.3,You think it's the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"yeah so Jazmin and I remember your answer was that NASA sent a small machine, so I can I I wanna I wanna I noticed that you.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,yeah a Jazmin is responsive originally was NASA send a small machine so she was able to gather that NASA did send a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"i'm seeing a pattern here, we all like the microscope in the orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,All right now i'm going to take a look at your answer and I want you to miss one you said I circled the same thing as Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So your answer was, NASA sent a small machine?",,,,
Jazmin,230.3,Uh huh.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"But what we did with Farrah. If you remember, if I had Farrah Farrah gave me the answer that said my cursor tropes will really",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Be used to find a water and she said to me that microscopes looked really closely and then they found the water because some more.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"and so you're in your response you said water's heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry on the ships anymore, which is true because",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"If they do have that room on the ship, it would be very valuable because they could store more things, which is what it says in",,,,
Teacher,230.3,The text so that's a great response.,,,,
Chris,230.3,So how come I'm here? because I used the evidence from the text and including the part that you told Jazmin she should put in her answer.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,so you said okay well Farrah said that they use a microscope she looked back she thought about the.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"i'm i'm noticing in your response, it says scientists found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Right so actually in the text, it does say that they found creators of water on the moon so you're you're telling me that you know they did in fact discover water on the moon",,,,
Chris,230.3,yeah I just heard it when I was reading my answer when you said what equipment was,,,,
Teacher,230.3,awesome okay so Farrah looking at your response and then looking back at the text you're saying you need a specific scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,awesome so i'm noticing you started with a really strong response and then you added the the actual specific tool that they initially discovered water on the moon with right?,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So, Jazmin you answered with NASA send a small machine. So am I right to say that you, you said the equipment they used was a small machine.",,,,
Jazmin,230.3,"Yes, yes, the equipment was the small machine",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"OK, because your answer shows and tells me that you understood what the article was about. And that you know that there was water on the moon and the scientists were using tools to examine it. And that tells me that you understood it.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Awesome. Good job. That's, that's really good. So you saw equipment in the discussion question.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And you highlighted the microscope, just like Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,that's awesome so what Farrah told me is that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And then, what your answer showed me is the evidence behind that what a microscope does and why we needed to look really closely because it zooms in on the really small molecules in the water right.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And Farrah. I noticed that in your response. You actually talked about microscopes, which help the scientists to see things closer, is that, sure, you said that right in your response.",,,,
Farrah,230.3,"Yeah, that was my response. Yeah.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,And I saw that in your answer. You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yes, so not only is water valuable because we can drink it and it can save space and spacecraft but also because we can use it for what you said oxygen, Luis that's very true that is good observation.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"How is what Jazmin said, change your thinking so even though it's hard to get merged, she said, the oil better product strategy part to get.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So what i'm hearing from you is you're saying that you used your background knowledge to answer it first right and I love that I love.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"place, I really like that, and I agree, so what i'm hearing is that you look back at the question and kind of reread it and saw your mistakes um or what you could improv a little bit right.",,,,
Farrah,230.3,"yeah and it was what people were saying to cuz I was listening in class for saying like Jazmin was saying, it was a small machine and you know stuff like that so um.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,To look really closely. Good. So is there. Remember how we talked,,,,
Teacher,230.3,To Farrah earlier and gave her some suggestions.,,,,
Oliver,230.3,On you saturate have to add more details to her thing so I'm,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so let's look at your answers Jazmin so you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water right.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So you have written that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,You said yes astronauts can drink the water to stay hydrated.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So does anyone want to-- actually, OK. Oh, Jesus. Sorry. One second, guys. OK. So Farrah, for example, you said that they used a microscope to look really closely, right?",,,,
Farrah,230.3,Uh-huh. Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Nice so are you also having the same ideas Farrah where equipment and scientific tools can be used interchangeably as a synonym.,,,,
Oliver,230.3,"yeah because I, I know that a tool is something that you used to do with thing, and I know equipment is something that you used to do a thing to.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Oliver you agree Jazmin you agree Chris you agree, I also agree as well, that you do need a microscope to us to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Right, they would need water to drink. So, Oliver, you think that it would be worth it to spend the money and do the research?",,,,
Oliver,230.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, good. So, Farrah, you made the point That maybe they needed it to see it in the first place to discover it.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So you guys said microscope.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,So we know you told us it's good that they can have it with them and they don't have to bring as much. So the astronauts can what with it.,,,,
Chris,230.3,They can drink it.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Farrah and Oliver. I see.That you had originally thought maybe the water isn't going to be that useful.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah, I think I agree with you, if there were astronauts, they would, they would have to be astronaut suits and oxygen tanks.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Farrah and Oliver, I see that you have identified a tool used by the scientists to see things that are very small.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,From using a microscope to seem small microscopic bits of water.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Hmm. And are you are you thinking that because it's going to take a lot of money.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"That the amount of money that we put into invest in this, we won't get returns",,,,
Oliver,230.3,"On. Yeah, well, cuz that's another meaning of the word value like money. Um, so I don't think I don't think they should spend all their money on that. Because remember, there's not even that much water, there's like four cups. You can't drink at that there's not there's not a lot.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And I think someone else circled, the same answer as you.",,,,
Oliver,230.3,That was yeah that was me yeah I saw the same thing as Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,So Oliver and Farrah think that it was the microscope in Jazmin and Luis Both think it was the lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,So Chris is saying that you guys are both right that they use the microscope and the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,It sounds like you're talking about the machine that they used to travel to the moon,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So Chris, I'm hearing that You think that water is heavy and that they don't have to carry it on the ships.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Seemed to be very strong you you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated and that you need,,,,
Teacher,230.3,So I'm hearing that you use the similar strategy to Jazmin.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And I think someone else have listen guessing with you. Luis, is it you?",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yes. And so, Chris do you notice what Jazmin just said. She said the machine that discovered was a small machine, right.",,,,
Chris,230.3,"Yeah, oh yeah, that was in part two the small machine.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Teacher : And Oliver, I saw that you said you circle, the same as Farrah.",,,,
Oliver,230.3,"Yeah, I also thought it was a microscope, because that's a tool and on the question asked for equipment that's equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Teacher : Awesome and Chris. I saw you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon.,,,,
Chris,230.3,Yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so you talked about water and how there was craters on the moon.",,,,
Oliver,230.3,"Okay, sure. Yeah, I had a different keyword from Chris and mine was on equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so you circled equipment and you knew that a microscope was in a tool that was used for equipment. All right.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Right, so there is a lot of equipment that we need to utilize especially with space",,,,
Jazmin,230.3,"Oh, I thought that the most important word in the question was, discover",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Right. So you found the Lunar Orbiter and the microscope. Nice. Luis,,,,
Luis,230.3,"Yeah, I just wanted to remind you, my dad as actually an astronaut.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Right. So, you told me the they found the lunar orbiter found the water on the moon, but it was ice right",,,,
Luis,230.3,"Yeah, it was frozen.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so the lunar orbiter found the water on the moon, and then Farrah, you were saying at the microscope helps us to look at the water right",,,,
Farrah,230.3,"Right. Yeah, because it's so small, like Luis was saying.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Right, so the name of that small machine, you just said is a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Chris,230.3,"Well, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"To go around, right. So, Chris shared that the lunar orbiter went around the moon looking for something",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Right, exactly. So what you just said was that the lunar orbiter went around the moon and spotted the water",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Than you you were able to use the context of your microscope, which is another tool to be able to say that the microscope is going to help study the water which is small pieces. Correct?",,,,
Farrah,230.3,Yeah yeah that makes sense now.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So Farrah mentioned that we needed the microscope to look at the water very closely because it's so tiny. So that's a very, very important piece of information that needs to be included in the answer.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Mm hmm. Great. I love that answer. So it sounds like you both found pieces of equipment that were used.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,So I noticed that Jazmin told me She was able to point out that the small machine could mean anything. It's not specific to the text right,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Right, so they're using the oxygen tanks to breathe, breathe, but then they're using a different piece of equipment to actually discover the water on the moon.",,,,
Luis,230.3,Yeah yeah,,,,
Teacher,230.3,So I see that some of us have said that scientists use lots of equipment. Yes. Luis,,,,
Luis,230.3,"I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Farrah, you said that people that scientists use like microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Jazmin. So you said NASA sent like a small machine.,,,,
Jazmin,230.3,"Yes, a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah, and member Jazmin had said that they sent a small machine to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And Luis I see that you wrote scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.",,,,
Luis,230.3,Yeah yeah equipment like the stuff he used to do something.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Now, let's see, Jazmin. You also said that NASA sent a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Now, let's see. Let's see. I'm Farrah. I really liked how you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Farrah,230.3,"Yeah, I knew I was looking for equipment and so that's why I found the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So I work from all the different students that each student found a different tool to use.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Now some of you wrote that, um, the microscope was used to discover the water",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Thank you. Yes, that is another meaningful valuable important or something worth worth. Well, yes. So we need to find information from the text that is convincing to support Our answer of water on the moon being valuable,",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Great while Luis is revising let's go we'll go we'll start on the other side, so Farrah and Oliver I noticed that, once again, you guys must have worked together, because you have some similar answers.",,,,
Oliver,230.3,yeah we always work together.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,so you both wrote that this isn't that using this water isn't something that's going to happen anytime soon is that right.,,,,
Farrah,230.3,yeah we were thinking that like maybe it's valuable.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,so you wrote about water being heavy.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,yeah definitely and I think your answer is really telling us where they found the tech where they found the water but def I see you have something to say.,,,,
Oliver,230.3,yeah so um I just actually looked at the clock and.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so you say that a microscope is the equipment that they used to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,I know that you get it. I know you know that they sent a small robot to find water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah, no, Jazmin, got it. Also, it's also good. Good answer. So there was a small machine. And it was a robot in the name is lunar orbiter right",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So you think that the microscope is the only equipment that they use to discover this water.,,,,
Farrah,230.3,So I guess it sounds like maybe they have to use both.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yeah, they use a lot of different equipment in order to go on these missions to find out more about the solar system.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Yeah you and Luis both brought up points about the fact that water was heavy and that water can be broken down into two parts.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Ah, OK. So you really focus on the word microscope, that's something that you really focused on",,,,
Farrah,230.3,"Yeah, because",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And so Luis why don't we actually start with you, I noticed that you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, is that right.",,,,
Luis,230.3,yeah yeah that's my answer.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Chris i'm wondering about your answer to you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, is that right.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And while they're talking Oliver and Farrah I noticed you guys circle, the same thing is that right.",,,,
Oliver,230.3,yeah yeah we saw the same thing on the microscope.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,yeah okay so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Definitely, so they said that the water was microscopic so they needed to find- they needed to use a microscope to be able to see it.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Oh Jazmin okay i'm just looking at your answer right now so Jazmin, you said that NASA sent a small machine. Is that correct?",,,,
Jazmin,230.3,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Chris um, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon right?",,,,
Chris,230.3,yeah that's yeah that's what I said.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,so you and Luis were saying that they found or that they used equipment like oxygen tanks,,,,
Chris,230.3,"Well, the fact that they were on the moon, and the fact that, basically, like there's no oxygen on the moon for them to breathe.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,How great so you guys have the same answer in the end that they use the Lunar orbiter,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Okay Luis so you said i'm scientist use a small machine right um so.,,,,
Luis,230.3,"Yeah, they found ice using a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,so what I would say um is that it seems like with our first the first answers that we had um what we were definitely coming up with.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"We want to talk about how we know that there's water on the moon and you'd mentioned, and your response Jazmin that scientists into small machine to discover water on the moon right?",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So you know, I think that also brings back the point of you know if we you know only read a text or we read it quickly, we may not catch all of these really fine details, I also wanted to you know switch over to oh go ahead.",,,,
Oliver,230.3,Oh yeah um before we keep going um I want to let you know actually it's time for us to go.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,and I would say that you're certainly right that a microscope is essential to see those microscopic water crystals.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Farrahs point about the microscope where you're going to need a microscope to look at the soil,,,,
Teacher,230.3,So Chris so your answer was scientists found the crators full of water in the moon.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And as Jazmin was saying, small small machine to see the particle and then find the water in the moon, yes.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"so um Farrah I saw I know that you thought you were thinking about the microscope and I love that you notice that, from what are one of the other paragraphs, the third paragraph right, it was Farrah and Oliver you guys found that in the third paragraph yeah?",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Um Farrah I liked how you were thinking about the future and how we were talking about the future in our readings right that right now we can't do some of these things, but in the future, we might be able to.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Just like you said Luis right?,,,,
Teacher,230.3,and you know I think deb also had a similar response right death.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,So you think you should shift totally from the microscope to the Lunar orbiter to clarify.,,,,
Oliver,230.3,"Okay, let me see um well because I thought it was a microscope but then Jazmin just said that they use a lunar orbiter to look for the ice deposit.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Farrah, you started with you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, correct?",,,,
Luis,230.3,"Oh, excuse me, excuse me.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Farrah so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. That was your answer correct?,,,,
Farrah,230.3,"Yes, that's what I said.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Excellent so we're using the stuff that we're learning in science class and bringing it to this discussion right?,,,,
Teacher,230.3,right they do and that's exactly what Luis told me right so Luis you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right?,,,,
Luis,230.3,They sure do.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"um so Oliver and Farrah, i'm going to come back to you guys. Farrah, you said that you have used a microscope before right?",,,,
Teacher,230.3,I want to combine Chris to answer with Luis's answer and kind of marry them together and the Lunar orbiter was a Chris was 100% correct when he said it's there to investigate right.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,You said that NASA census small machine.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Going back to you i'm wondering, do you see Jazmin so Jazmin talked about this lunar orbiter that is looking for frozen water on the moon does that sound like something that maybe.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Yes, perfect so ice is water. now in the microscope part this is kind of what Farrah and Oliver were pointing out",,,,
Oliver,230.3,"um well I just I realized it's time for us to go now, but thank you for taking the time to work with us.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Yeah that's true very good point. So um you've established that they need these oxygen tanks to breathe so that they can look for water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Ok so you both said the small machine.,,,,
Farrah,230.3,"Which one is right, then the microscope or Jazmin's?",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"and Chris, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon go ahead yeah go ahead i'm listening.",,,,
Chris,230.3,"yeah well so since we're talking about equipment on I wanted to say, I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks, but also um masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Soo it sounds like the two pieces of equipments we heard were microscopes and the lunar orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"awesome comment from Farrah. So the question i'm hearing is we kind of agree, yes, that this thing was used to investigate it, but we still need the microscope to look closely at it.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,That they need the Lunar orbiter right and at some point they're going to be the microscope to me I love that you mentioned that and then you guys brought up also that they're going to need some oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Farrah is telling us that in paragraph three, there's a microscopic material that you would need a microscope to see.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"He shared that they use these tools and the Lunar orbiter is one of the tools that they use. Jazmin pointed us to the exact sentence in the story that told us what the machine was called. Okay, so I want to circle back to Farrah Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And also that actually ties into Luis's experience Luis knows all about it he's very interested in that's how he made the connection with oxygen tank is that right, even.",,,,
Chris,230.3,Oh yeah exactly um I like to watch a YouTube videos.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Paragraph three so you got the word microscopic which looks really important right.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And then, it looks like a little machine sounds like a little machine and it has a scientific tools, who may just think that it was a scientific tool, the little machine and you also found found verve and water say major think that's the answer but.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So you thought about Jazmin's answer and then,,,,
Luis,230.3,"yeah i'm thinking, maybe the Lunar orbiter you know is like the MARS Rover where anybody in the Rover you know it was just the machine itself and maybe that's the Lunar orbiter is too.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Jazmin told us that it was a small machine and Luis added on to that by saying that it has to do with going around the moon,",,,,
Teacher,230.3,deb I think you also mentioned the microscope and your response right.,,,,
Farrah,230.3,"yeah yeah I I was looking for equipment, because I thought that was the key word and.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,so Jazmin thought that it could be valuable,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Water yeah that's that makes water so um Chris said that scientists found creators, full of water on moon right is that what you read hi Chris.",,,,
Chris,230.3,"yeah so they thought there wasn't water but it turns out the craters, they're full of water.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,so Farrah I noticed that you have mentioned microscope as your equipment.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so you have identify a bit I identified a benefit that the spaceship would be lighter which is by, it is worth it for us to continue with this exploration.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,And Jazmin has also identified a benefit so let's hear what Jazmin had to say.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, think it's a benefit because there is water on an astronaut's name need water for their hydration.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"I really value how some of you have talked about the benefits of this exploration, whereas the other people like Dave and someone I have talked about the costs of this exploration.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Awesome, yes equipment right. So now we know that the answer that we're looking for is going to be a piece of equipment, right?",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So you just told me when the scientists found the ice already, and then they couldn't see it.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Great and Luis talked about the oxygen tanks right?,,,,
Luis,230.3,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,so let's take a look at some of your answers Luis and we actually started with you um you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"answer too, he said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, so they used all the that equipment and the eating that terrible food.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Jazmin, you said that NASA sent a small machine to go get that water.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Well, I don't know if i'd call it a machine, but you, you talked about a scientific tool right",,,,
Farrah,230.3,yeah I'll go yeah I thought it was the microscope um cuz that's That was the well yeah I don't know if it's a machine either,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"yeah they could drink it and then like Oliver said there's hydrogen and oxygen right so maybe they can use the oxygen in the water  To get some air, so that they can breathe right",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So yeah, we could say that's one of the tools that's necessary for them to even go to the moon, are there any other tools",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"hmm so investigate right find right are great words, Oliver the same thing that you said, right all of those had that same kind of kind of meaning right",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Oliver, about the investigators, right and Farrah about about the scientific tools about the looking and the searching piece and Luis about all the equipment that we know that astronauts have to use,",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"mm hmm Okay, so this is actually perfect for both you Farrah and Oliver since you had very similar answers.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"I love that exactly right if we just a machine that it's kinda like the question it's just saying equipment right, but if we bring that name in it tells us specifically great job Jazmin really good work.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Alright, everyone, I think that we had just discovered a really valuable piece of information about savannas answer we had determined that microscopes help us look at things which is not quite the same as discovering or looking for something Luis Can you help me oh.",,,,
Luis,230.3,"yeah well, I think I got this all figured out so i'm.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Great yes, so we have found a sentence that answers both parts of our question  right it gives us a piece of equipment, the scientists are using and it's telling us that this equipment is used to discover things it's used to investigate to look for something Farrah.",,,,
Farrah,230.3,okay.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,right they're asking for two different things we're seeing a lot of really similar words.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"This is a great start, we need to read the text right because we're looking for a sentence Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,230.3,"And Okay, so a strategy for this new question I would say, is to really look at the words in the question and find the words.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Farrah you mentioned a microscope right?,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"so um Jazmin was saying that she thought she had the right answer and you were saying yes, she did not the right answer, but she needs to be more specific, so I just looked at her sentence.",,,,
Jazmin,230.3,So the name of it's the Lunar orbiter then.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,yeah awesome so one of the tools that the scientist used to look at the microscopic water was a microscope. that's awesome Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Farrah you say that you still think that the microscope is the most important part right.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"tool that's a good one yeah so tool, a tool can mean the same thing as equipment for sure nice job Farrah and Chris, I saw your hand went up what's a word that you thought might be the same thing as equipment.",,,,
Farrah,230.3,Okay well it's not one word but equipment is like a thing that you use to complete a job.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"yeah something you use to complete a job and that's really almost like savannas tool right it's a tool, something that we use to complete a job so two different ways of saying equipment there",,,,
Teacher,230.3,So a machine is another word for equipment that's a great.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So just to remind everyone for equipment, we have a tool, a thing we use to complete a job and also a machine so lots of different ways to think about equipment.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Find that's a really good one right if you're discovering something you're finding it nice thanks and then Luis I saw your hand go up what did you come up with Luis.,,,,
Luis,230.3,"um yeah well I also thought find, but I think what's really important is you're finding it for the first time no one else found it before.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"yeah that's a very good point it's for the first time, so you're finding it for the first time, good thanks Luis in depth, those are really good words to point up",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"yeah that could be interesting it's hidden maybe you can't find it you're not able to see it, or you don't know if it's there, and you uncover it that's very good yes.",,,,
Chris,230.3,yeah can I share one more thing.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Like full of like water that we're drinking so like the water in my water bottle.,,,,
Chris,230.3,yeah well that's sort of how I pictured it yeah cuz creators they're so big and it's like I was picturing sort of like lakes and pools of water.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,so you're saying we know we need to discover something so maybe it's a good.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Okay um so Luis your answer was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so very good, so this is about you found the part in the text right about them locating the craters and that's the location right that's where was this water right but.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,yeah just like what Oliver just the said.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"I noticed that Farrah and Luis, then they also named the equipment but a different one",,,,
Chris,230.3,yeah um I I have an idea.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"actually even said something about that in his answer didn't he that scientists use a lot of equipment, including oxygen tanks, which is totally right.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And it's the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon, so I think that's a great full answer Farrah and Oliver that's awesome",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"What else did we do Do you remember when we were talking before about Farrah's strategy, what else did Farrah do to make sure that she was answering the question completely.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,We went back to the text and we looked for evidence right  what else did we look back at to make sure that we were answering.,,,,
Chris,230.3,The question.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Was yes absolutely Okay, so we picked up some important keywords in that question right.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,whoo okay so we're applying what we know about equipment that it's a tool that does something and it's investigating in the polar craters.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so you know that microscope is a piece of equipment and you see that in paragraph three Nice.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"I really like um how you.brought up that that the scientific tool they use was called a microscope to look really closely at the water, because on that microscopes do really help us see things up close.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"i'm actually Chris, you also had a really great answer to you said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon, and I thought that came really, really close to answering the question as well.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And then Jazmin you also had a great response, where you had that NASA sent a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,Exactly Luis and um I think what your answer focused on more of is what they could do with the water once they discover it right like there was an interesting video I saw.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,and Oliver and Farrah you guys brought up that there were those ice deposits in the craters and they used the microscope to look at that even closer to discover.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"hmm you know that's really interesting point because it's true that when humans go to the moon, they definitely need oxygen tanks to breathe.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,let's see so your answer you revised answer Luis was that scientists found is using a small machine Is that correct.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,cool so we've had a couple of comments from you about equipment we've had scientists use a lot of equipment and then we have scientists found the ice using a small machine.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"You would revise your revisions, so you revise revise that the water found the water scientists found water on the moon, using a lunar orbiter and that the water was microscopic Is that correct.",,,,
All,230.3,yeah yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Look at all the words in the question okay.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"That you had just forgot to to include that in your answer, perhaps.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,and your answer is scientists use the Lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of water.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, great so i'm hearing that you have heard, everyone talk about being more specific and adding more details and so you're like i'm on it that's what i'm going to do, and you tried that and it worked out yeah.",,,,
Farrah,230.3,yeah yeah and and I added the words from the question to.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so that at the end you'll have some some answers that match, and it makes sense for you and for others to understand that sounds pretty solid so let's do let's just do the fill in the blank like we've done before so let's do a little thinking routine about.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Hello i'm happy to be back with you all, and I believe that we left off trying to add some more to Jazmin's response trying to strengthen it, and I know that we talked about we added the name of the machine the Lunar orbiter and I think that we, yes Luis?",,,,
Luis,230.3,"yeah yeah I I did that, so I think I got this all figured out i'm all good.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So the moon, we said.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So space exploration and finding water on space, there are a lot of steps and processes that come with that right and and Jazmin you you touch on a really important part of that, as do Farrah and Oliver.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"yep so oxygen tanks small machines microscopes, these are all really important pieces of equipment that allow NASA scientists to look at water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"yeah that's great so i'm glad that we have some agreement so so so far, the words that we've talked about our equipment and discover and water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Okay, so now going back to what Luis was saying he mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in general, which is great",,,,
Teacher,230.3,And just very quickly so vana brought up the idea that she said that it was a microscope was used to find the water and then we're talking with Jazmin about the small machine that she identified in the text so we're going to start there but,,,,
Teacher,230.3,so I know that we're talking with Jazmin when we left off and Jazmin also said that she agreed with what Farrah said That the microscope is used to look at the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"and we already talked about how the microscope was used to look at the water, and we also talked about how the Lunar orbiter was used to find water.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"but let's just go back to the first thing you said so, you said that Oh yes, the Lunar orbiter is looking for the ice deposits on the moon, so do you agree or disagree with what Oliver said.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So Jazmin Farrah pointed out one, and then you also pointed out another one similar to Farrah, which was a microscope correct.",,,,
Oliver,230.3,yeah yeah we pick that same one.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"yeah they are really been a you're correct, so you had mentioned that you visit a NASA before correct and so out of all.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"so let's think back to your answer, because your answer says that they found craters full of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,which is a microscope correct.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Oliver and Farrah I see that you guys had a similar answer right Farrah, you said that you i'm in your answer you talked about a microscope as a scientific tool to look really closely and they've used to that you circled the same thing, for your.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And so let's just keep those words in our heads, as we talk through this so we've got what type of equipment and Jazmin you mentioned a machine.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,And then Farrah you use that word tool,,,,
Teacher,230.3,Chris tells us what the scientists were doing on the moon Luis knows all these different types of equipment that scientists use that maybe aren't mentioned in the text.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,And then Jazmin you just identified for us a specific piece of equipment that the article mentions is us on the moon when scientists are looking for water.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So that's called our lunar orbiter so we can include that in our answer, and then I also liked what Oliver and Farrah mentioned about the microscope as another piece of equipment another tool that the scientists use so go ahead Chris.",,,,
Chris,230.3,To NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And so I think that we've got two folks who said, no one person who said yes and then two people answered by talking through some of the evidence.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"yeah, and so I think that if we consider that this this water might not be ready yet like Oliver and Farrah said what might happen in the future is what Luis just said",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"I think you bring up this good point that, even though it might not be ready now the value might be there in the future",,,,
Teacher,230.3,About how heavy water is and the need to carry water on the ships to to the moon and other locations in our universe,,,,
Teacher,230.3,yeah and so kind of tying what Chris read back to what Farrah was asking like why isn't that answer correct that it's not ready to be used yet.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Oh OK, so the part about equipment, I agree, I think that is a key part of the question that we might need to dig into to figure out the answers we need to go back to the article.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,That is true right so it's similar to kind of Farrah's thinking as well right?,,,,
Teacher,230.3,So you think the side is the need also need oxygen tank mask and suit right.,,,,
Jazmin,230.3,i'm.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"something you used to do something so let's use our understanding what Jazmin and Farrah gave us a tour, something we used to do something.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"and I noticed in Farrah knows i'm explanation, she said, a scientific.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"So Jazmin gave us a really, really awesome response and said that NASA use the small machine",,,,
Farrah,230.3,well.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,yeah so Jazmin was her answer was a little different.,,,,
Jazmin,230.3,yeah.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"yeah so like how he said i'm phase microscopes they use the Lunar orbiter and then Luis said that he knew using his background knowledge that you also need an oxygen tank out there, so that's why yeah.",,,,
Chris,230.3,"yeah okay Okay, so you just want to say one thing from the story, and then you could say some stuff you know too.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"And so, as Chris pointed out, they with the equipment that they use they made the craters to find the water and then Jazmin also gave us some context, saying that they use the small machine",,,,
Teacher,230.3,You started to explain how machine was being sent.,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"I see how you've answered the question is water valuable because right now there isn't any water there, so you said no, not yet",,,,
Teacher,230.3,"so Chris, you had said waters is heavy so it's hard to bring it up in ships right it's A lot of weight for the spaceship to bring .",,,,
Teacher,230.3,and Jazmin you had said that water is something they can drink to stay hydrated right,,,,
Teacher,230.3,"Which ties into what you said before about it being really heavy so it sounds like you're saying it could be valuable to have it on the moon, just so that you can save on the rocket fuel to bring it there.",,,,
Teacher,230.3,for drinking and like Luis had mentioned it can be used to make rocket fuel that's those are great reasons to include in your answer,,,,
Teacher,230.3,and Farrah is that right that that's what you had as well.,,,,
Farrah,230.3,yeah I had the same answer,,,,
Jazmin,310.1,"And yet, I just wanted to say. And we have to match the lunch. I just want to thank you for working with this and like in particular.","And yet, I just wanted to say. And we have to match the lunch. I just want to thank you for working with this and like in particular.",0,,
Teacher,310.1,"You did mention a specific piece of equipment and although that may not be the best answer.

Farrah,310.1,Thank you.,Thank you.,0,,
Jazmin,310.1,"I was wondering why, my answer the question. My answer was wrong. You know why I was in the group, it sounds like this small machine was was maybe a right answer.","I was wondering why, my answer the question. My answer was wrong. You know why I was in the group, it sounds like this small machine was was maybe a right answer.",,2,
Oliver,310.1,"Oh, I think to answer my question.",,,,
Farrah,310.1,"Great. Yeah, exactly.",,,,
Farrah,310.1,"Oh, oh, okay, well then why",,,,
Luis,310.1,"Um,",,,,
Chris,310.1,"And is my answer-- did I get it right when I said that the water is heavy, so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore?",,,,
Farrah,310.1,"Awesome, but I have one question. Um like, why is my it's because we're all here to like work on it together. Like what, why is my answer, not quite right.",,,,
Farrah,310.1,"Yeah, yeah, that's where I got mine from",,,,
Jazmin,310.1,"So my answer was sort of right and sort of wrong. Like when I said like NASA used a small machine like the initial one was was not quite right, because I didn't say orbiters right?",,,,
Jazmin,310.1,"Gotcha, well we have to go to Lunch. I just wanted to thank you for working with us. And particularly, I wanted to thank you for correcting me to look more closely at the work and really valuing the thinking that I was because I was thinking about it, but I guess I didn't really realize how much was the complete answer that you really like helped me to see like how to look to see the text and how to really get a more complete answer. That was really cool.",,,,
Chris,310.1,"Well, I was gonna say lunar orbiter as well and I changed my because you asked us to look at the text and not like necessarily background. Now even though I know that, like they use lots of other stuff.",,,,
Farrah,310.1,"Oh,",,,,
Chris,310.1,"Um, yeah. So I just basically was just thinking also that",,,,
Farrah,310.1,Okay. I think my answer. I chose I'm valuable. It's important one.,,,,
Jazmin,310.1,So my answer is right?,,,,
Oliver,310.1,"Okay, okay.",,,,
Chris,310.1,"Um, yeah, I was really interested in seeing like how they found the water they were trying to, like, you know what I mean, like how they manage to look for it.",,,,
Farrah,310.1,"Um, so me. Well, I actually have a question. I was not sure. Like I was thinking a lot about it and I still don't understand why my answer is wrong.","Um, so me. Well, I actually have a question. I was not sure. Like I was thinking a lot about it and I still don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,2,
Farrah,310.1,"I think I just, I'm still a little confused.",,,,
Jazmin,310.1,Miss Jennifer,,,,
Jazmin,310.1,I don't,,,,
Farrah,310.1,Let me look at it.,,,,
Jazmin,310.1,"Oh, oh, okay. This lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.",,,,
Oliver,310.1,"Um, yeah. So I have the same answer. I Farrah, so I thought it was the microscope, and I guess for me I guess it was kind of the same thing. I figured, when I read through the microscope was the only piece of equipment that I saw like when I was reading. So I guess that could be the only answer.",,,,
Oliver,310.1,"Um, yeah. So I would say, I guess it was sort of similar, but basically what I would say like in my own words. Is that like",,,,
Oliver,310.1,"Oh yeah, you're totally need it and like I i could see that, like, maybe it would be maybe valuable, but",,,,
Jazmin,310.1,"And it's just another piece about, like, I guess, like the when Chris was saying this stuff about the water play. You know what I mean like this, this, this, do we need like evidence from the text when we're seeing our like our, our speech like RP",,,,
Chris,310.1,"OK, OK, OK, I can do that.",,,,
Farrah,310.1,"Okay, I'll read it, but I guess that's why I was confused because I felt like you know I did better this time. And I did, I did read it, I got mine from I'm from from I think from paragraph number six.",,,,
Jazmin,310.1,I guess it would be like how Luis said where you do split it.,,,,
Jazmin,310.1,It makes sense. So he needs to say like,,,,
Chris,310.1,Thank you.,,,,
Oliver,310.1,"Yeah, I'm trying to think like how to explain it in my own words, you know,",,,,
Jazmin,310.1,"Actually, I have a question. So if it sounds like then that we needed to use the microscope, but so is my answer wrong. Like, did they not use the small machine?",,,,
Oliver,310.1,"Yeah, so I don't know why why I'm here. Honestly, cause I gave an answer from the text.",,,,
Jazmin,310.1,Actually,,,,
Chris,310.1,Okay okay.,,,,
Chris,310.1,"Okay yeah I can look more closely and see what what else is going on, because yeah I was just connecting to what I already do, but I think I see what you're saying like I need to I need to look at the paper look at the reading and my kind of pull it from from there as well, right now.","Okay yeah I can look more closely and see what what else is going on, because yeah I was just connecting to what I already do, but I think I see what you're saying like I need to I need to look at the paper look at the reading and my kind of pull it from from there as well, right now.",,2,
Luis,310.1,Yeah yeah,,,,
Chris,310.1,And I went to NASA. So I know that time does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits.,,,,
Jazmin,310.1,Good.,,,,
Farrah,310.1,"Farrah, do you want to tell me why you guys pick the microscope?",,,,
Oliver,310.1,"yeah Okay, so if it was used for the stuff that was discovered how did they discover.",,,,
Jazmin,310.1,Well I don't understand why my answer's wrong.,,,,
Jazmin,310.1,"So, so if I say i'm NASA send a small machine quarterly in order to investigate.","So, so if I say i'm NASA send a small machine quarterly in order to investigate.",,2,
Luis,310.1,"Well, how my knowledge relates-- how my knowledge relates to the question and the story. Well, I mean, so I know that the astronauts need equipment in order to go to the moon. So that part, I feel like that's how my knowledge relates because I know that they need oxygen tanks in order to breathe on the moon.",,,,
Luis,310.1,yeah I think so that you gotta do what.,,,,
Chris,310.1,"um so, unfortunately.",,,,
Farrah,310.1,"Yeah, exactly. It's because our microscope is equipment. It's like a tool that you use to look at things that are really small.",,,,
Farrah,310.1,"Yeah, in a science lab.",,,,
Oliver,310.1,Oh yeah i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock and and we have to go to lunch and i'm really bummed because I feel like we're just getting to the park but.,,,,
Oliver,310.1,"Yeah, well I just said what I said before, because like something I don't want first, like if I had gone. First, I would have said microscope, but she had already saw that. So I just said what I saw.",,,,
Oliver,310.1,"Um, excuse me.",,,,
Chris,310.1,"Yeah, yeah, that's that makes sense. Yeah.",,,,
Chris,310.1,"Okay, looking for equipment. Gotcha.",,,,
Oliver,310.1,"Yeah. Okay, I think I'm I think if I if I just read it more carefully. Next time I maybe I could find the right answer.",,,,
Chris,310.1,I'll share. Can I share,,,,
Oliver,310.1,"On so it's our it's time for us to goal right now, but I wanted to say thank you for paying attention to each one of our answers and giving each one of us something specific to think about and talk about",,,,
Oliver,310.1,"Oh, it's time for us to go to lunch. I'm so sorry. This was really fun class.",,,,
Oliver,310.1,"Yeah, I'm on the same page as Farrah here. I kind of agree because like",,,,

Teacher,410.2,"Okay, you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. That is correct. That is a tool that they use.

Chris,410.2,"Um, yeah. I have a question, like so. My dad took me to NASA. And we saw that like astronauts have to use like space suits and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff like, um, do they, do they like, do they have to use that stuff, didn't they have to use that to discover the water?",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"They don't really say that, is where Mr. Luis talks about that they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in our texts.

Luis,410.2,a machine so lunar orbiter.,,,,

You have to put the object you want to look at under the microscope.
Teacher,410.2,"And it could be right, yes, but it doesn't reflect on our texts and the main point here is that we're trying to ask from the text what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"You didn't mention what like you just wrote a small machine it's not very specific,",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"And, as I talked, as I said, to Farrah she said microscope which is -was mentioned in the passage, but for you, my concern is that you didn't have really your own answer you just said that Farrah, so yours was the same as Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"One part you were missing, though, is",,,,
Teacher,410.2,What they were looking at. So what were they looking at closely.,,,,
Farrah,410.2,Water,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"So I didn't. I really want to hear. I really wanted to hear your personal thinking and what you thought to answer the question, not the same as Farrah.","So I didn't I really want to hear. I really wanted to hear your personal thinking and what you thought to answer the question, not the same as Farrah.",,,
Oliver,410.2,"Yeah, cuz you asked her for her answer first and she circled the same thing that I did have I circled the last sentence which says arm YOU NEED A SCIENTIFIC POLL ON A microscope to look really closely.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"So, my concern is is that you're not you're not understanding completely by yourself, you know that Farrah circle, the same one as you.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"But just some common mistakes, I think, are that some people just didn't use specific words from the text I know.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"But I want to hear more specific answers in that. What kind of small machine that they send like what, what did they use once they sent it when they brought it back like",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"I just need to like we need to be able to understand what small machine it was because it tells you what small machine, it is in the reading. Right?",,,,
Jazmin,410.2,"See. Oh, yeah.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Oliver, I want you to be able to come up with your own answer in your own words,",,,,
Teacher,410.2,I didn't really see that you understood the reading well because your answer was I circled the same as Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,I just want to know why I just want to know what type of equipment they used to find the water in those creators so did you go and highlight two types of equipment.,I just want to know why I just want to know what type of equipment they used to find the water in those creators. so did you go and highlight two types of equipment?,,,
Chris,410.2,yeah I did the same ones that Jazmin did I highlighted the Lunar orbiter a small machine called a lunar orbiter and the scientific tool called a microscope.,yeah I did the same ones that Jazmin did I highlighted the Lunar orbiter a small machine called a lunar orbiter and the scientific tool called a microscope.,,2,
Teacher,410.2,"And Farrah had a lovely answer that was great, but I want an answer from depth, I want to know what Oliver found in the reading I want to know what to tools Oliver found it's great.","And Farrah had a lovely answer that was great, but I want an answer from depth. I want to know what Oliver found in the reading. I want to know what to tools Oliver found it's great.",,,
Teacher,410.2,"So your answer is right, but you will have -didn't take that extra step to look for the small machine's name.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"I love, how you work together with her, and I think it's great to work with your classmates in class but, for your answer, I want to hear what you have to say.",,,,
Oliver,410.2,"Okay um well, I think it is the Lunar orbiter cuz what you were saying was that we needed to look for.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Jazmin, you said that NASA send a small machine which is completely correct. But I think what I was looking for is a little bit more information on",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"So, your answer was close but it you just missed a tiny part of the question, so you got water and you got equipment, but you needed to look at how it was discovered not how it was looked at afterwards.",,,,
Chris,410.2,"As we're talking about equipment, I was thinking so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,When we are answering the question we're looking to answer with evidence from the text.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"And I don't think that that answer was based on evidence from the text, but I think it was based on your background knowledge which is great to use when answering questions, but for this specific question.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"That the water is heavy and that it takes up room on the spaceship but you didn't relate it back to the question as if how that would be valuable, so what me and Jazmin were talking about was that, yes, the spaceship",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Okay yeah let's go back into your answer you had said that NASA send a small machine, this is not incorrect, they did send a small machine, however, in the text it provided the.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,Actual name of what that machine was so i'd like to see a bit more specific detail to know exactly what that small machine was.,,,,
Jazmin,410.2,yeah okay I knew what it was I knew that it was.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Now, you are completely correct that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon. That's what our article is about, but what I'm looking for what equipment they used.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,But we need to highlight the equipment.,,,,
Oliver,410.2,I'm excuse me teacher. I was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"and make sure and see how small it is and really scope it out, we need to be able to know the equipment that we use to find the water first before we analyze it .",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Right, so it seems to me that you really understand what you're trying to say it just, i'm a little concerned that the reader of.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"whoever's reading your answer isn't going to be able to make the connection, you know, so if you could.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"That is a really good answer. So remember, our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. And so you said you need a Microsoft microscope to look really closely, but one. One thing that your answer is missing is kind of a connection to that question. So",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"You're right, it is the right answer, but we want to just add a little bit more to all of our answers to make them a little bit stronger.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,but you didn't necessarily write in your answer for me or any of your classmates to see.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"But you just one concern that I have is that if I was just reading your response and I had no other context, I would say, well, what can't we do for a long time?.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,That we can make it just a little bit better um so one concern I have about your response is that I was just reading your response kinda like I was just reading savannas and I wouldn't necessarily know what the question was asking right because.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"And i'm similar to the feedback, I was just giving Luis um I just don't get your answer just doesn't necessarily remind me of the question right like how Is that why water is valuable why it's valuable to get it from the moon, or why.","And i'm similar to the feedback, I was just giving Luis um I just don't get your answer just doesn't necessarily remind me of the question. right like how Is that why water is valuable. why it's valuable to get it from the moon, or why.",,,
Teacher,410.2,"Your answer wasn't necessarily answering what the question was so the question was asking, so the first question.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"I just wanted to see where you found it. I wanted to have like specific textual evidence, I know you found it in the text, but I wanted you to point it out to the rest of the class knows where to look.",,,,
Farrah,410.2,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"AND then Chris. so your response says that they found craters full of water. But you didn't really answer the question of what equipment they use, or do they use to find the craters.",,,,
Chris,410.2,"Oh, like, Oh, I see. So, okay, that's actually that's really helpful. So like I didn't say like what equipment. I just was talking about craters.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Now, Jazmin. When I heard your response. You were a little vague. You just sent you said that NASA sent a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Okay, so Luis your answer didn't really say whether or not you agreed that there is enough evidence. You just stated evidence.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,Because your answer could have gone either way.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,You could have said no.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Water splits into this and it wouldn't be a good resource or yes, because it does split this and that, and if you do read on it's leaning more towards the positive, so I assumed that you were agreeing, but I don't want to have to assume.",,,,
Luis,410.2,"Okay, I guess i'm not sure if I agree or not okay.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"just like Luis he didn't really state if it would be a good thing, so I had to assume that the answer was a positive that you did agree.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Perfect. Perfect. That's great. And then so Oliver, you said you circled the same as Farrah, but I think we want to go deeper into that, and I want you to have your own answer.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"In your answer it's very vague, so it just says a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,But I was hoping that maybe we could work on adding a little bit more detail to your writing because someone who didn't read this text might not know what a small machine is right.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"I'm a little bit concerned Farrah. I'm concerned about your tense because you kind of address, you said you need a scientific tool. So when I was reading that I thought you were talking to me. But what has already been discovered on the moon. Right.",,,,
Farrah,410.2,Yeah I said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. I don't understand why that answers wrong.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,I'm concerned about the way that you worded your answer. Farrah. So the way that you worded your answer. It didn't really restate the question.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"I am concerned because you didn't really rephrase anything. You just said I circled the same as savannas I it doesn't help me know if you understand the question, or the answer really um",,,,
Teacher,410.2,So I'm a little bit concerned that you didn't use a lot of detail.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"But what made you say that, my concern is you didn't include any equipment in your answer right.",,,,
Chris,410.2,"Yeah, I guess no.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Yes. And so um let equipment is an important words in a question, but you didn't include any equipment in your answer right.",,,,
Chris,410.2,"Yeah, I didn't include equipment. I just said, like where they found the water",,,,
Teacher,410.2,But you need a little more specific. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Teacher : Right, so you need a microscope to look at the microscopic particles, because it's so small, but that wasn't necessarily the tool that they use to send to the moon.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,Teacher : You just forgot to use the second part of that term.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Teacher : But in the article, I didn't see anything about oxygen tanks. So although I agree with you that they might need oxygen tanks. Our question was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Right, so you have the answer. Small machine. My concern is, is that there's a better answer and a name for that small machine.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,It was more that we just need to build more on it.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Remember, how I was saying that the point of these questions is to make sure we know that you know everything possible about this topic. So you gave us that step number one, but let's read the next step.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"However, when we're answering questions related to a text we only need to provide the information from the text.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"If you provided that information that you just told me, Chris, which is great background knowledge, the person who's reading this won't know where you got that information from it doesn't apply to this question. Does that make sense to you?",,,,
Chris,410.2,"So,",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"And I love that answer, because that's answering the question, we did need a piece that's the piece of equipment that needs to be used. However, we missed a little part of the text in your answer.",,,,
Jazmin,410.2,"So I said that NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.","So I said that NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,2,
Teacher,410.2,When we provide information from our own background knowledge. The issue with that is that we don't really have concrete evidence of where you got that information.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,So even though I might know that you visited NASA if somebody else was reading your response. And they didn't know that they might wonder where you got that information from right,,,,
Teacher,410.2,but we need both of those things to be looking at the water molecules.,but we need both of those things to be looking at the water molecules.,,2,
Teacher,410.2,The person who's reading your response. Don't know where you got that information right,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"For example, I know that you went to NASA, because you've talked about it. However, maybe Oliver doesn't know that. So if he was reading your response. You may question where you got that evidence. And if it's truly valid right",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Absolutely. That is correct. If there were astronauts there, they would need oxygen. But the oxygen tanks wouldn't be a tool to discover the water.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Well, your answer is not entirely wrong your answer was on track, but we're missing some of those details.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,But it doesn't say that they sent any astronauts to the moon to find the water so Chris. I really appreciate that point and you are correct. That astronauts would need those masks and suits to do this.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"But there weren't any astronauts present. So we don't want to focus on what they would need, we're just focusing on what the machine needed",,,,
Chris,410.2,"Oh, okay. So it was like, Oh, it was an unmanned craft. Oh, I learned that word at NASA to",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"But the focus. Question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and we need to answer that question using the article.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,Jazmin your answer isn't wrong NASA did send a small machine but you um if you read on in that sentence. There's a name for that small machine that you didn't use in your answer.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,So you identify why water is valuable. But one thing that i'm concerned about is that your answer doesn't isn't specific to just the moon and we're really thinking about why is it such a big deal that waters on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"So my My concern is that you, your answer is providing a good reason, but my suggestion, but still not complete, so my suggestion would be",,,,
Teacher,410.2,I'm concerned that that we need to find something a little bit more specific.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Yes, a new answer. Luis So Luis You talked about scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. So that's a great detail that you found, but I think you need to look for a little bit more detail. And so even though that's an equipment, you're going to be looking for.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,Another the main equipment. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,I liked where the path that you were taking but I'm a little concerned that you need just a little bit more detail in your answer.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"What equipment, did they use to discover water on the moon you guys found the equipment that they would use to look at what they discovered right but it feels like we skip this step somewhere in there, so can you guys look back and tell me what you think.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,but it seemed like we weren't looking close enough in the text to really take,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"yeah that's absolutely right, I am not sure if, when we were when the scientists were using the Lunar orbiter to investigate if they had any.","yeah that's absolutely right. I am not sure if, when we were when the scientists were using the Lunar orbiter to investigate if they had any.",,2,
Teacher,410.2,i'm I was concerned at your response that that wasn't the whole story.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,yeah i'm worried if the response doesn't actually answer the question,,,,
Chris,410.2,"Um what equipment that scientists used to discover oh what equipment, I forgot the equipment part.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,but i'm concerned that that might not be the whole story.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,i'm concerned that i'm hearing ideas from your.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"So maybe it's not in the text, but it was a brilliant comment, they do use oxygen tanks. But right now we're focusing on what we found in the text.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,And we also want to just make sure we're really using the text that we have in front of us to support our evidence,,,,
Luis,410.2,yeah okay.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Okay, so remember we want to back up a little bit, we want to ground our answer in the text that we're reading.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,I do not see the any paragraph the relative that related to the oxygen tanks so even though that's really reasonable for addiction I don't see that answer here.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"You did you're so close, you told me what the machine is and basically you actually circle, the evidence correctly and you gave me the answer, however, you didn't tell me the name of the machine.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"You actually actually you did excellent job and catching that NASA send a small machine you're correct, however, you just didn't identify what the smallest shane was OK.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"But that you didn't go back to the reading and that's just my assumption I didn't i'm not saying that you didn't do it, but my assumption is that you didn't revisit the text and telling me what the actual machine was so.","But that you didn't go back to the reading and that's just my assumption. I didn't i'm not saying that you didn't do it, but my assumption is that you didn't revisit the text and telling me what the actual machine was so.",,,
Teacher,410.2,But we wanted to use the text,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"They do, but this is asking us specifically from our reading, not from what we know from other places, in this text.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"At one point, I think you mentioned photos and I just want to be clear that a photo would not be enough, but like you said evidence would be enough, so any sort of a sample.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,i'm concerned that your response doesn't include all of the benefits that water could provide to the astronauts,,,,
Teacher,410.2,But my concern is that we still don't know its name and how it assisted in the discovery,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"In this explorations, but we cannot perhaps you know, come up with a final answer unless we also look at the benefits of water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,because we're gonna make sure answer touches not only discover water and lewd but also equipment and my concern is your answer might not including the equipment component.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"If somehow you looked at Farrah the answers and I don't I don't think that's the case, but I want to make sure you're doing your own thinking in the space",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"You know, did this small machine discover water on the moon, I need to know more about this small machine right.",,,,
Jazmin,410.2,Ok so I have to say NASA sent a small machine to discover water on the moon.,Ok so I have to say NASA sent a small machine to discover water on the moon.,,2,
Teacher,410.2,"We look at the text that you have we want to see what equipment they talked about from the article so that may be true, on space exploration, that we do need.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"yeah so that's a really great background information have but remember for this question, we need to circle evidence from our text so it's not in the text we can't use it this time it's still really good to know, though.",,,,
Chris,410.2,We have to pick the equipment from the story.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"That the scientists use to discover water on the moon, and in this case they're not using the oxygen tanks to discover the water they're using them to help them breathe so they're super important but they're not exactly answering the question right.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"But i'm wondering if we can go even more specific right because this isn't just a tool that an artist uses this isn't just a marker, but this is what kind of marker? what color is this?",,,,
Jazmin,410.2,Red.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"However, there was another machine you guys that they also used",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Yes, great, and that is really what I was looking for in this response you guys so many of you came so close um but I felt like every all your responses just needed that one extra detail okay um to really help.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"mm hmm you know I think you're right that scientists do use oxygen tanks, but I don't know that I see that in the text itself",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Maybe because it's too expensive so they're sending these machines called lunar orbiter, so I think and not situation they're actually not using oxygen tanks, but that's a great point event yeah Jazmin.",,,,
Jazmin,410.2,"Yes, okay well, so my answer was that NASA sent a small machine, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"So you're partially right, because it is a small machine but there's lots of different small machines right like a small machine could even be a toaster so they definitely didn't send a toaster",,,,
Teacher,410.2,But one thing that i'm concerned about with your with your response is going back to the question.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"So you're totally right about that, but I want to just go back to the question because i'm concerned that your your answer doesn't totally answer the question.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,Because the question is about the equipment that science scientists use to discover water and then you're talking about the tool that scientists were using.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,But one thing that i'm concerned about is that your response doesn't directly.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,i'm concerned about their whereas a lack of specificity and both of your responses today.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,well remember earlier when I said I wanted to look at small details in the text when you said that originally it's not that always wrong it's just that I didn't know what they're looking closely with so.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"And one thing that i'm concerned about is that maybe your response doesn't exactly answered the question, what do you think about that, what are your thoughts.",,,,
Chris,410.2,"Well, I mean I went to NASA so I know that um scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.","Well, I mean I went to NASA so I know that um scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,2,
Teacher,410.2,"and i'm concerned that the responses that you guys chose, which is a microscope isn't necessarily us to discover water on the moon",,,,
Teacher,410.2,"All right, so equipment and discover now you talked in your response about scientists finding craters on the moon, which is absolutely correct, but I am concerned that your answer doesn't completely align with what the question is asking.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,I think you're confusing this strategy with um just adding the name I guess.,,,,
Jazmin,410.2,So I guess cuz I was thinking when you say.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,But the question here is based on the text that we just read.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"So we were looking for evidence in the text sure they might use that other equipment, but in the text it didn't have anything about that so it's just about being specific this time.",,,,
Chris,410.2,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"Right, you need to feel a little more specific, so that they understand because I was looking at it and you said small machine, I might think the microscope because the microscope isn't big it's small.",,,,
Jazmin,410.2,So you just want to really be specific about what you're what you're saying.,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"But I think for this on packages, specifically, you know we're just looking at that one tool that they're using at this moment in time, so there definitely is a lot of more lot more equipment that NASA uses to find a lot of things, but.",,,,
Teacher,410.2,But we didn't specify exactly what that machine was,,,,
Teacher,410.2,"So you Chris took your answer from the first paragraph, but there's more information about how much water there is on the moon later in the article.","So you Chris took your answer from the first paragraph, but there's more information about how much water there is on the moon later in the article.",,1,

Teacher,410.3,"You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. There's where Farrah found her answer, but the microscope was just to be able to see the water they found it.

Chris,420.1,"Oh yeah, it was mostly the same word evidence. And I was thinking that, like, basically. Well, I think the evidence is good because water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen plus water so heavy. They don't have to carry it in ships anymore.",,,,
Chris,420.1,"So yeah, so like the equipment, not the not about, so what should be the answer right?","So yeah, so like the equipment, not the not about, so what should be the answer right?",,1,
Chris,420.1,"Um, okay. It wasn't water. It was equipment and discover right",,,,
Chris,420.1,"Okay, so different a different key word from the question.",,,,
Chris,420.1,Yeah I did that.,,,,
Chris,420.1,"Yeah. Oh, hi. I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.",,,,
Chris,420.1,"Okay, better better like about the question or just any keyword to the answer.",,,,
Chris,420.1,Okay equipment.,,,,
Chris,420.1,Oh did.,,,,
Chris,420.1,For.,,,,
Farrah,420.1,"Should we, should we circle the words, this time.",,,,
Farrah,420.1,"Oh, and so like discover is not the same thing as as like to look at it.","Oh, and so like discover is not the same thing as as like to look at it.",,2,
Farrah,420.1,"Oh, okay. Gotcha.","Oh, okay. Gotcha.",,2,
Farrah,420.1,Okay.,,,,
Farrah,420.1,"Okay, so.",,,,
Farrah,420.1,"Well, I think the most important words in the question they kind of tell you what to look for when you read the story.",,,,
Farrah,420.1,"Yeah, so I thought the main word was equipment. And so, my answer was you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why that answer is wrong.",,,,
Farrah,420.1,Okay yeah I feel like i'm i'm still confused because did I do that in my answer?,Okay yeah I feel like i'm i'm still confused because did I do that in my answer?,,2,
Farrah,420.1,"Okay, well, I thought the most important word would be equipment.",,,,
Farrah,420.1,Oh yeah i'm still kind of confused.,,,,
Jazmin,420.1,"Yeah, I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,,,
Jazmin,420.1,"I said, and discover",,,,
Jazmin,420.1,"So actually we have to go to lunch here in just a moment, but I wanted to thank you for working with us, and especially I wanted to thank you so much for really having us work with each other and having a sort of think through our answers ourselves.",,,,
Jazmin,420.1,"Okay yeah it's the same thing, even said, you know it wants us to tell what the equipment is that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon.",,,,
Jazmin,420.1,Okay.,,,,
Jazmin,420.1,I was just wondering why my answer was wrong.,,,,
Luis,420.1,"Yeah, so I kind of know like all about space, like, I don't think I really need to be in this group because I already know. Like all this stuff.",,,,

Luis,420.1,"Oh, I got it okay um equipment.","Oh, I got it okay um equipment.",,2,
Luis,420.1,"Okay, I think that it was evidence",,,,
Luis,420.1,Okay.,,,,
Luis,420.1,"Um, well, okay, so",,,,
Luis,420.1,Okay action word and question. Here we go.,,,,
Luis,420.1,"Um, yeah, I understand, but I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.",,,,
Luis,420.1,"Okay, yeah, I'll read it.","Okay, yeah, I'll read it.",,2,
Luis,420.1,"Um, I just wanted to remind you, my dad and actually an astronaut.",,,,

Luis,420.1,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.",,,,
Oliver,420.1,I'm okay.,,,,
Oliver,420.1,"Oh yeah okay okay um and start convincing evidence that water in a moment can be valuable. So I said no. Now, commenting evidence because it's not ready.",,,,
Oliver,420.1,"That makes the high. Yeah, it makes sense. I think about. We all felt like we did at this time, but you're like, Hey, go back again.",,,,
Oliver,420.1,So Farrah. I think that basically you know that we like equipment is like the tool or something that you use.,So Farrah. I think that basically you know that we like equipment is like the tool or something that you use.,,2,
Oliver,420.1,"Oh, whoops you said two, I circled like four",,,,
Oliver,420.1,"Yeah. Um, okay. So what are the things that I circled in the question was basically you know I circled equipment and I'm water.",,,,
Oliver,420.1,Okay.,,,,
Oliver,420.1,"Okay, yeah.",,,,
Oliver,420.1,"I was thinking, another really important one is convincing because your reasons like your evidence after be really glad, or else the people listening to your answer. They won't be convinced.",,,,
Oliver,420.1,"I'm not, but I have something else to say.",,,,
Oliver,420.1,"And i'm so sorry, and I just looked up a clock and we, we have to go to lunch, right now, but I want to test say thank you for teaching us this new strategy.",,,,
Oliver,420.1,Okay.,,,,
Teacher,420.1,Now the question. Let's look at the question again. The question says what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. Now what are some key words that kind of help us to find the answer in in the text.,,1,,

Teacher,420.2,"Well, so I think that first you use, you can start with one right and then focus on really building that answer out Ray so identifying the the scientific the scientific equipment.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"And then being able to explain how that equipment was used to discover water on the moon, and then, once you've gotten that you can add on to your answer yes Oliver",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Well let's think about it, how can we make that even more specific Jazmin because you're absolutely right, they did send a small machine, how can we were in the text, can we find something that's going to give you even more specific information about that small machine.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Excellent, so I would say, if you added that to your answer that would make it Nice and specific.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"you mentioned the small machine, but a better answer would tell me what the machine does",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"But if i'm asking you a question, where i'm asking like what equipment did scientists use and then i'm telling you this circle your answer on that your answer needs to come from what you just read.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So take a second and write a new answer yes, Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yes, Oliver, um but yes, instead of your answer being as circled the same as Farrah, you could have said that, instead of just saying I circled the same as her",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So you're, you're pretty much right you could of went a little more into detail. But they, It was a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Can you be more specific look back and paragraph 2 to see if you can find the rest of the or the more detailed part of the answer,,,,
Teacher,420.2,We just need to go and find a little bit more evidence,,,,
Teacher,420.2,To discover the water. So would you like to go ahead and start looking back through the passage to see if you can use the word discover and equipment defined your answer.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Deb, I know you said that you had the same answer as Farrah, but if you could find that in the text and circle it. So I know where your answer came from. That would be awesome.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,I just want you to get a little bit more specific with what you tell me,,,,
Teacher,420.2,Jazmin. Did you did you hear how they gave it a little bit more of a specific name? So instead of just saying a small machine. They called it a microscope. Did you find that in the text?,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Looking into and finding it for the first time. That's how I would change your answer, just a little bit to make it a little bit more clear now.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Can you look for that for me.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Can you change or think about your answer and change the way that you say it, so it answers that question.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,You just needed to go just a little bit more in depth. Right.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Then I'm kind of in the dark. Right. So if we were able to come to that same sort of answer, but give more details, you might be able to better inform your reader, who's me the teacher. Right. You want to make sure I'm in for sure.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"But it may be a smaller amount. So if we're able to kind of rephrase our answer. I think you've got a, you know, an interesting perspective there.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"I think we can be a little more specific in your response. So you said like oxygen tanks and yeah, absolutely. Um, they're, they're gonna use oxygen tanks there. Could you tell me maybe another piece of equipment that NASA used in this article to help discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Help to discover a water on the moon, right, because that's how it ends.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,And we're very specific when we're writing,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"A lot of words can seem tough, but making sure that your reader knows exactly what you are saying can go a long way. That way you don't get any confusion, so they know you're just as smart as I know you are",,,,
Teacher,420.2,And I think we can kind of change how that sets up,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Right, we kind of want to let our readers know that we're talking about the scientist specifically. So you could say, NASA. Or you could say scientist used if you want to do either one of those. I think would convey your meeting.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah. So remember, that's what we're trying to get the information Pro is what ring. Correct.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So maybe next time when you're doing that you could you could be more specific, you said NASA send a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So, but you could clarify your statement, a little bit more. Right. Well, that'd be a good strategy.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"However, we also have to use specific text evidence and just like Jazmin learned I can't just stop at NASA said a small machine, right.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Keep reading what small machine get very specific with your answer. And be sure to answer every single part of the question using evidence from the text Farrah.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,That would help. And go into a little bit more detail about it.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,So you got to pull those things together.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,We just need to add on to it that because you can drink water.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,And waters on the moon. That's convincing evidence that it is valuable. So we just have to rework your answer.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"It's a long answer, but what we can do for your answer.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Is just that we can add that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen because it allows people to breathe and you can make rocket fuel with it.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,So we just need to add in just that hydrogen Can be used for rocket fuel and oxygen can help people breathe. We just need to add that little bit to your answer.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"But you just need to add a little bit more to it, just so that way, we have an idea.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"I lost my train of thought,  just so that we can explain a little bit more on why you think it's not going to be able to be useful, just because they're smaller amounts of it. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"But we have to look at the tools that are inside of the text because every time we have a story that we're reading and questions about it, our answers are always going to be in that passage. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Is there a place in the text that that mentions what hydrogen oxygen can be used for?,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Exactly, exactly, the more detail you have, the better off your answer is",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Lunar orbiter right so if you to add it in the NASA sent a small machine called the lunar Lunar Orbiter and you think that could have clarified your answer?,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"OK, I will. Let's take our little answer and make it a great big answer to make it make more sense to make it concrete.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,So how about let's restating the question to form our answer. The scientists used a tool called the moon.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"See how that answer grows. Yeah, this is really short one word answer we created a whole sentence where anybody reading our answer can identify what we are talking about what we're learning about",,,,
Teacher,420.2,To make your answer very clear. And to clarify.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,Any misconceptions,,,,
Teacher,420.2,So just with write down the question and then use them. The words on your paper or on your iPad. You can just rearrange them to restate the question.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,But when we're answering questions we probably should refer back to our the reading that we were given to find out answers that we need.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"How would you use that answer to convince me that water is valuable, or could be valuable on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So I think you would have your sentence was great. Perhaps you could have worded it by saying, water is valuable, or could be a valuable.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yes, so we had to be very specific with our answer because they use the specific name in our text.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"I'm Jazmin, you wrote that NASA send a small machine. That's very good. So maybe we need to investigate look a little further, to see what is that machine called",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So one strategy we could use let's let's work together with Jazmin. Let's help her her figure out what we could add to this. Okay, so what is a strategy that we can use to look back at the text and to know where to look in the text.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Good, so you're right, it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen. Now let's go a little bit further with that answer. And can you also see if you can find what you can use the broken down oxygen and hydrogen for and that can go along with your evidence. Does that make sense. Chris.","Good, so you're right, it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen. Now let's go a little bit further with that answer. And can you also see if you can find what you can use the broken down oxygen and hydrogen for and that can go along with your evidence. Does that make sense? Chris.",,,
Teacher,420.2,"Right, so maybe include that with your answer in the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"But looking more specifically, you want to see if you can find the exact name of that machine and kind of be able to explain what that machine does. So your answer was right on it to you just wanted to add some more detail to it.","But looking more specifically, you want to see if you can find the exact name of that machine and kind of be able to explain what that machine does. So your answer was right on it to. you just wanted to add some more detail to it.",,,
Teacher,420.2,So when I'm looking for my answer you want to look for details that will tell you how the water is going to be valuable.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,But we want to say give like an a yes or no question. If you think that it is valuable and all of your details put together does say yes it is valuable because they can use it for surviving,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"They can use it for rocket fuel, it can be split apart.",They can use it for rocket fuel. it can be split apart.,,2,
Teacher,420.2,"Maybe, but you can also use the passage. Remember to so you can use your reading passage to help you figure out how it would be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah, and that's what Luis said. He said it could be useful because it can be broken down. Now he could have extended his answer a little bit more",,,,
Teacher,420.2,And said what is valuable about breaking it down.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,That's the only thing I would have done.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So I suggest that you write, even though it's this almost the same as your",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Friends, I would like to know that you are understanding what you're reading and write it down with your own words. Thank you, them.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Okay, so do you see why it's important to make sure to read all of the information before we try to answer the question.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Let's look, so NASA sent a small machine. What was that small machine called? I want you to turn to somebody next to you.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So it's really important when we are answering questions, even though you found part of the question stem and your answer. You've got to look around it to make sure that's the total. Chris.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Jazmin your answer. So NASA send a small machine. You're right. It was a small machine called a lunar orbiter. So your answer is almost there. You just need to add a little bit more information to it. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah, sometimes that works. But sometimes we have to look around too. So yes, it is a small machine and the small machine may answer a question, because we have to also ask a small machine that did what? okay.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Exactly. Because whenever we have an explanation or whatever we have evidence from article. So say we have one sentence of evidence we have to have two sentences of our explanation. So we have to describe that. Oliver.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,Right. But did you name the machine? Did you give specific details?,,,,
Teacher,420.2,No. So we have to name it.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,Right. So we always have to look back to our text and refer to that when we're trying to find our answers.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Okay, so let's look at this keyword equipment and find me in the text where it talks about a type of equipment. It could be a machine. It can be, words like machine or a tool. Can anybody find that for me? Where it says a machine or tool? Can anyone find that in the text for me? Luis?",,,,
Teacher,420.2,It lets your teacher and it lets people know like you fewer,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"We need to restate that question in our answers. Well, and he's the text, so I can use the text, but can you can fit it into this question, maybe just a little more more clear into the question.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Oh, you're right, they do do a lot of equipment. So that's one reason that we need to be very specific in our answer isn't it.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So what if we said something when you restate it question, you kind of take some some some words from the question and put it in your answer. So we could say",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"The equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon was a lunar orbiter. It gives our reader more information and they can, if they know nothing about the topic that helps them learn more about the main, doesn't it.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"You did, and quite a few details. Yeah. And yeah guys, I do want some of you did add more details and others, and definitely make sure to add details and",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Wonderful. Okay. So I want to talk about these two responses for just a moment. So whenever we're looking at passages, we really want to focus on textual evidence. Now textual evidence is when you have a question and you refer back to your passage to find the exact answer, or as close as possible.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"You're right, NASA does use a lot of equipment but we just got to be very specific and identifying which equipment we do. Does that make sense.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,You always want to prove your answer so that you always know that it's right.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,Possibly. Do you guys understand how important text evidence is and how it can help you answer your questions and to more importantly justify your answers.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,So we want to be as detailed as possible when we answer our questions so that we have all the information that we need in our response.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Well, our answers are kind of what we just went over on how we use some of the texts supporting details to prove why Our answer is what it is.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,So when I talked about how you could break it down into hydrogen and oxygen that talked about a way that makes your water valuable.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"And another way is when we talked about it being too heavy to carry it also makes it very valuable to have on the moon, so that we don't have to carry it.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,So we want to make sure that we're answering the question as fully and descriptively as possible. Does that help better explain it to you Oliver.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Correct, you got to make sure that you answer the question. And when you answer your question. You got to make sure you add all of your details, does that help?",,,,
Teacher,420.2,So you could be looking for something more specific. What was the small machine called it wouldn't be maybe a more solid answer than just the small machine. So when you're reading,,,,
Teacher,420.2,And looking for a specific question. So it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon. You could you should name that machine.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,In the correct response like just just if you were having a conversation with someone and like as if you are super excited about the moon and they asked you what kind of machine do they use discover water on them and then your answer should be more specific to,,,,
Teacher,420.2,To answer them. If you're having a conversation like you would name the machine and tell them how they used it. So that's kind of the answer you should be looking for in answering these attacks.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"And the text. The informative text does list some of the machines, it says the names of the machines. And right before they talk about the discovery of, okay, so that would be a more solid answer.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,And it answers the question better. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"You know you've, you found the piece of equipment that they used, but we have to be a little bit more specific here.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So next time when we are asked a question instead of saying, I answered it. Like Farrah, or a neighbor. Make sure you write an answer out instead of saying I found the same thing as my friend. I want to hear what you found. Jazmin, I see you have a question.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Well, it's always good to add detail to our answers. And so the more detail. We can answer. I mean, the more detail. We can provide with our answer, the better or the stronger answer can be. Does that make sense.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"but um let's pretend that we took away the reading passage and maybe we had read it the day before, and maybe [teacher name] was out that day. And so maybe the substitute didn't have that. Do you think that we could have wrote our question differ answer differently to include the question.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Not that your answer is incorrect because I see in the third paragraph that it states exactly what you said, but maybe adding exactly what they're looking for can also help your other friends. Maybe if you working in partners of two. Does that make sense.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So that's the only thing I would add to yours. What you put was was correct, but your teacher may want you to be a little more specific. So you could just name the actual machine, and it was called the Lunar Orbiter. So you're not very far off just a little bit more specific.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah, we want that specific evidence from the reading that we want to pull that straight out that shows we found the answer to that question. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Oliver. That is one thing I think that will help you if you really try to pull that answer out of what you're reading,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Instead of just agreeing with Farrah, maybe think about why do I agree with Farrah. What is it that she picked that I agree with. So you could still say I agree with Farrah, but then tell me that reason why you agree with her. Does that make sense.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah, okay. So if we rewrote our answers. If we might do that in a minute. Go ahead and think about why you might agree with Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"And if you need help getting started, you could say the equipment and the scientists used to discover water was the what? And then write out your response.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,but we have to be a little bit more spits specific in naming what that machine was,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Alright, so, Luis, we want to make sure that we're going back to the text to find our answer.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So what I'm sort of wondering sort of asked, could you be a little bit more specific, perhaps, and identifying what that small machine could possibly be.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So to be a little bit more specific you would then, you know, want to choose. Perhaps the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,So if you were able to look at that the idea or the answer of a lunar orbiter would be a little bit more specific.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"I think so. I think for us to build on your answer. So you have a good start. I think if we go back into the text and we look for any mention of equipment, that scientists have used and we underline that that we could then build on your answer. We'd have a complete full answer to that question.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yes, yes. And so, and usually it's best when we, when we answer a question if we just. If we stick to that question and we can save the extra information for discussions like when we're having right now.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,but do you think we could be a little bit more specific in our response as because there are lots of small machines in the world right,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"I but I think NASA. If we go back into the text. We can see the, the type of small machine that they sent and so we can give that a name, so that when we respond to the question we're being specific with our answer.","I but I think NASA. If we go back into the text. We can see the, the type of small machine that they sent and so we can give that a name. so that when we respond to the question we're being specific with our answer.",,,
Teacher,420.2,"And so your answer. You said NASA send a small machine. So I would like for you to tell a little bit more about the small machine. So looking in the text. Where could we are, what could we add",,,,
Teacher,420.2,To expand,,,,
Teacher,420.2,And give more details what top of small machine was it.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"I just, I would like to build more upon your answer.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,So why don't we try starting our CNS with we know we all agree that is the Lunar Orbiter.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,Whenever you get your opinion or your opinion is your opinion. It's just what you think. But it's always best to face what you think off of facts that you read,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So you don't want to have an opinion. Most of the time that is just something that you you make up because it's not necessarily true. Yes, Chris.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"And Oliver, I circled the same I Farrah. So really, I'm going to encourage you to end your answer. Just be independent. Alright, so talk about what you found. Not what Farrah found so just go in and read maybe read it and just, again, we're looking for what equipment, the scientists use to find water.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"And talk about yourself, not another student",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"That way, if I had no clue if I've never read the text, I'll read your question. I know exactly what you're talking about when we answer.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,What would be helpful.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah, tell me something about it. And what else, what identifies that machine.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah, your name. So probably the machines name as well.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,t's just we need to make it specific so you'll go ahead and do that. And just make sure your bringing it from the text.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"I love when students make the question. Alright, so equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon is and then go into your answer.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yes. So what you'll do is. So for example, you are going to restate the question. So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Would say there is convinced. So you're answering the question, and you're reciting that question there is convincing evidence that",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Let me see you again, sorry. There is convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable. So there you restated the question you answered the question.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Then you would say in the text, what it says. Water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. And then you would explain why that's important.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,The only thing I would like is just the restate the question.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Right, if you could say there is enough evidence that water on the moon. Can you guys and then you're off. You're saying yes, you're just also bringing the question into it.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,And then you need evidence to support your answer and then you,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Found the evidence from number six. That's perfect, just provide that evidence, and then explain.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah, so that that's a good train of thought. So now if we'll just restate the question, Answer the question.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"I would say that you do need more evidence, your evidence does say that bringing water on the moon is hard, but I would also talk about how the water on the moon would be good.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,See if you can find it.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,So the best place to start is the key words in the question and then going back to those headings to try and see if we can look underneath that heading for an answer.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah, so you and Jazmin. Y'all see if you can figure out how they are going to use oxygen and how they are going to use hydrogen. Okay so y'all talk about it for a minute and let us know in just a second. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Okay. Um, I have not heard that. But let's think about this text, though. Okay, so you and Farrah and Chris Chris. Did you have a question, your hand was up just a second ago.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"That is correct. But if you want it to be more specific in an answer a good answer, you could have said NASA sent a small machine and it is called a lunar orbiter. So Jazmin, you were on the right track.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"And then, to be more specific in our answer we could have put the name what and what is that machine called?",,,,
Teacher,420.2,talk about your answers and how you could have improved those answers to be more specific to,,,,
Teacher,420.2,That question by using the two words that you guys underlined as keywords.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,So Luis You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. How could you be more specific to the passage,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Okay. So we need to be more specific, when answering our questions.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So I want you guys to look at the answer that you put for this question. I want you to read over your answer and I want you to think to yourself, how could you be more specific, when answering this question to take a couple seconds to look at your spot.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Your right NASA did send a small machine, but to give a more specific and best answer. You could have put NASA send a small machine and gave the name.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"But yes, it's looking for something specific. So that's when you would want to refer back to the text. So when it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"That is when you would want to look back into the text to find your answer because you already know they use various tools, like you said, a mask.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Microscope and stuff like that. But then there's one specific tool that it states in the text that that is why you would want to look back in the text to find your answer.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,We just want to dig a little bit deeper into the text and maybe help your fellow students figure out some more details about what NASA did to find water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,I want you to help each other. Understand the text. And so now that we know the key words that everybody thinks I want you guys to reconstruct your answer to give us a little bit more detail about the equipment that specifically helped us discover water.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"One thing that may help you in the future is to answer the question, as if you were teaching about the question. So if somebody was new to reading this passage, just like you guys were, how would you best explain it to them so that they would get a full picture of what you guys are reading",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Sure, so you can also remind them if you were teaching or even from your perspective as a student, if you can answer the question, and then give us a little bit more detail as to why that your answer that will help you with a with a more concrete answer. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Because we must always refer to the text.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"but that detail you just added is critical. That's why it's valuable. The fact that when I break it down the oxygen, hydrogen astronauts can breathe the oxygen And they can use the oxygen and hydrogen as fuel.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,So that second Part that you just gave me. That's why it's valuable. So that's a great answer.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So your first answer was correct, but that added detail kind of gets to why it is even more valuable than what you mentioned.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Um, well, the question asked, according to the text. So we had to use what we had in the text to answer our questions. So we had to find evidence. So you might be right. From what you know from your dad going to NASA, we have to use the text in order to answer the question.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah, you want to look back in the story and make sure you're answering the whole question that stories like your friend. You want to keep looking back, and it has all your answers.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"And then Oliver, I really liked your answer to that you also were thinking about the microscope, I would have loved. If you give us another example, or maybe added on to Mars, Venus thought I definitely did like your answer and how you",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Understand, maybe next time. If you have the same idea someone, you could just add a little more that you felt like they didn't say that you wanted to bring up",,,,
Teacher,420.2,You could say that to like you can bring an example of,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Why they're using microscopes, like when you're reading the text. Why do you think they're using microscopes. Do you think it helped them to find the craters. Do you think it made it easier to look for water on the moon, just your thought process. Yes, Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,I would have loved if you,,,,
Teacher,420.2,Just said what the machine was or just talked more about what the machine does.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So what you could do is saying, NASA sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter. Just like how you said previously, and then kind of","So what you could do is saying, NASA sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter. Just like how you said previously, and then kind of",,2,
Teacher,420.2,They use it so that they can see what's going on on the moon that,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"might slip through the cracks or just very keep it simple, like NASA said the Lunar Orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah, like we should fill in the blanks, just to make our sentence a little Meteor",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yes, Okay, so you can always rephrase your sentence to say that NASA sent a little bit over there that way, I know that you're using the information that's in the text. Does that sound good?",,,,
Teacher,420.2,You can always write that even scientists use a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,But sometimes there are still things that are so small that they cannot see. Is that better?,,,,
Teacher,420.2,I just think that it sounds like you understand. So I just want you to go a little further in your explanation and you some evidence from what you read about,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Um, yes. So I just want your answer to be a little more specific and sometimes that does mean writing more stuff.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"But when you're answering the discussion questions for the text that we read, just try and incorporate",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Something specifically from the text. So the text mentions the Lunar Orbiter. So that would have been a good thing to include in your response in addition to what you said about finding Craters of water and they're like suits masks and oxygen tanks. Does that make sense.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"yeah so that is a really good answer and you're definitely correct um, but I want you to elaborate a little bit more so, yes NASA sent a small machine, but what was that small machine called.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Right, so when we use the term lunar orbiter we're using evidence to support our response and so that's something you want to make sure you're doing, because it shows that.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,But you also want to make sure that when you're answering the question you're specifically using evidence and examples that the text gives you.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So it's awesome to make connections with your background knowledge, but in order to answer a question you want to make sure that it comes from the text.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"However, again when you look at that question, it asks what equipment found those craters of water, so that would be similar to Jazmin where you just want to make sure that you're using a specific piece of evidence to support what you said when you said that there's craters of water.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"And what you could do with that so in your response um you could have added something like in another article I read, it said that there could be a base on the moon, and then connect to the article we're reading now, so do you have any idea of how you could do that.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"pretty good I would maybe just add a little bit about how like you said they're not carrying the water on the ships anymore, because they're keeping it at the base that they're going to build on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"I would probably just expand your response, so you could.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Okay Okay, so when you're answering so next time when we have questions, make sure you're answering all parts of the question and as much detail as you can.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Look at the microscope in context of how it was used to find water on the moon that's what I wanted you to bring to me.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"you explain to me that it was a piece of equipment and what it does, but I wanted you to tell me how it was used to find water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"I think you maybe could have gone in more depth to it, but like as a start like is a very good start. Good job. Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"I think that you could have, you could have maybe expanded on a little more on instead of saying like I scientists found craters for water on the moon, you could maybe as is answer, while also kind of expanding upon it by like adding like blah blah blah. I know it wasn't too long of a thing to read, so he couldn't really expand upon it as much.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"But in the future when, if you have a little more text to it. Try to try to deepen your thinking and like kind of think of it in different way. I guess maybe thinking about it like outside of the box. You know, I have you guys heard about thinking outside the box.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,So like when say like someone asked you to build a house right um and your ideas that you had before. Your idea is not really working. So you're kind of running out of ideas and sometimes thinking outside the box like instead of doing it like this normal approach like the typical way of doing it.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"The only thing I would say to add is maybe you could, because you said a lot of equipment and then you only said oxygen tanks. So the maybe expand on your point, which was a good point. You could say, like, they also use like special helmets and like a special like space suit or something like helmet.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,a suggestion I have for you.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"To maybe not like bulk it up, but to add a little more background knowledge to it um was you could say why the water on the moon is important and how it can help.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"on future astronauts or scientist when they get to the moon um which could maybe like oh i'll add some valuable evidence to your sentence, which is on.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Pretty key to all this um.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,so um yeah just maybe next time just try think of like.,so um yeah just maybe next time just try think of like.,,2,
Teacher,420.2,"A reason why, like the thing that they found to be important in La um I know that's a lot,",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"A suggestion I had written down when I looked at all the responses um I saw it, you could instead of saying NASA sent a small machine, you could say.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"NASA send an equipment, called the Lunar orbiter which is put that help the astronauts discover more on them.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,So maybe like adding like a couple words to a sentence and rephrasing can really make a huge difference to the sentence,,,,
Teacher,420.2,But i'm just i'm hoping that you know that the challenge of having maybe a longer sentence or breaking it maybe breaking it into two.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"can help you complete the sophomore because it's not it's not a terrible thing to add an extra sentence to it, because it will help you in the long run um so um.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"um okay um can you do, you tell me in your own words, why it's not ready, using using what's in the passage, but in your own words okay.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"I mean, I, as I said last time, adding an extra sentence to it can only help it sometimes and never make it worse um so so Jazmin your answer was awesome like.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"um alright so Luis water, you said water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen great job on that um So could you kind of tell me why.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Why, it would be important for the water to be able to be split into hydrogen and oxygen.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"um because, again, as I said, adding extra sentences can go from making a sentence slightly like vague and not as detailed to something very detailed and.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,It was right. But I wish you had a little bit more information like what was the small machine that they used,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"You guys had some really good responses for a couple of them. I wish they had a little bit more details like for Oliver and Jazmin. There was us a little bit more details,",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"but I also think maybe next time and your responses you could give us a little bit more of a personalized approach to your response. So maybe what you found from the text, along with what you thought about it. Does that sound good.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah, like your personal views, along with what you found from the text.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"But like I said to her, maybe personalize it a little bit, add your own views sound good.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So that's a really good start, but at your next point, you should add in what comes next, and the texts, a reading.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Thank you. So, Jazmin, like we were saying, I think you had a really good response just maybe go the next step, read a little bit further and then add to your answer before you respond. Okay.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Your answer is not necessarily wrong I just think we could expand on it further, so if you could look back in the text and see exactly where you have your answer so in paragraph two, is there any more knowledge that you can add to your answer now.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,That would be more information yeah that would make your answer a little bit more.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"what's the word i'm looking for specific and a little bit more, you know, on task What you said is good but it's a little.","what's the word i'm looking for specific and a little bit more, you know, on task. What you said is good but it's a little.",,,
Teacher,420.2,You just needed to go a little further to name the machine. They use the equipment they use.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"You just needed to go a little further to name the women they use. But so far, so good.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Oliver. You realize that Farrah had a good answer. And you agreed with her, but next time I would like you to either add on to something She says, based on the text or you can make up your own, go say your own answer.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,So you're adding on to discussion or adding your own opinion to it.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah, that's okay. Um, but for next time I would just like you to add on. So you see how she said microscope. They use a microscope to find the closer look in the water.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,You could have added on to say if you saw another equipment in the text.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,Or if  you disagree or anything. Just adding on to the discussion. So we're not all saying the same things.,Or if  you disagree or anything. Just adding on to the discussion. So we're not all saying the same things.,,1,
Teacher,420.2,"My suggestion would be to look at the passage the paragraph before it, where it stated the the equipment they use to find the water in the first place before they could even look into it with the microscope they use something else to find the water so my suggestion would be to add that and then revise your response.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So I see where you agreed with Farrah. My suggestion would be to Either if you're gonna if you're gonna agree, I need you to add something",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"It actually wasn't wrong, and I see where you answered your question, I just wanted you to be a little more specific of what the equipment was called so you had a good start, and you was almost there you just needed to name the equipment, so you you were on the right track.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yes, that is correct, so you just needed, you were in the right track, you just needed to name the object so for next time when you're given a response is make sure you as specific as possible, but you had a great start.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,I just want you to look into it and find the evidence to support your answer.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Exactly great observation and another thing is, if anything, you can always use direct evidence from the text to answer your question as long as you use the quotation mark for the evidence, but good job yeah exactly.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Okay, so one thing is we need to make sure that we are answering the question fully. So the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon. So what you want to say in your",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Response is you want to say scientists discovered water on the moon by using blank equipment.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah, you have to write more stuff.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,We want to be using that,,,,
Teacher,420.2,Good language and good vocabulary that we're learning from the text just add in it and say um they use the microscope in order to see the water. Does that make sense.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,You have to add more words.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,You want to make sure that - it's all about being specific. You want to use good examples from the text.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"so I want you to go back and reread and be more specific, because we want specific answers.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So I would love if you go back, reread the question and then go to the passage and come up with your own answer because I want to know your own ideas and thoughts for the answer.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So going back to what Luis said again, Luis, if you want to try to finish your statement because you're on the right track that the lunar orbiter is a small machine. But what does it do? To answer the question in context.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Right, so just that one little extra step.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Could really just push through your answer. That makes sense.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Just make sure when you're writing answers like this, you need to be very clear about the what and the why. So you had part of the what you just needed. The second piece.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,It's just we need more specifics,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Right. So when we're answering questions like this, you need to have the specifics. You don't necessarily have to take the whole paragraph you read",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So, Jazmin when you're looking at these answers. You need to be able to",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Look at the what they're asking for. So you got that you got you got the equipment.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Next time, just make sure if it has a name include the name",,,,
Teacher,420.2,You need to have a little more details.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,But we need to be a little more detailed,,,,
Teacher,420.2,yeah so my suggestion to you in the future is just to remember those key words because those key words like the Lunar orbiter that's an important thing to know for our vocabulary in the future in this lesson.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,So do you guys see anything that could support your answers from the text.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yes, that's really good. Um, so yeah, so we found our answer. However, we need to think about our phrasing of the question.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"We want to really reference, the text, just so that we show that we found our evidence in the text, you know.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"I think it's important that, when you say something you know you have evidence to back it up so in case somebody asked Oh, how do you know that, how do you know this is true, you can say Oh, I found it in this source or you can say, you can quote the text.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,um so would anybody maybe like to revise their answer? and maybe just include a piece of evidence in there or a specific word?,,,,
Teacher,420.2,So now that we now that we know that that that the expectation is maybe using more specific language Jazmin would you maybe like to revise your answer using one of the words that we just discussed or one of the phrases that we just discussed yeah,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"But what we want to do is we want to make sure that that you're using terms that are in the reading like just, just like the ones that we just talked about, like microscope.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Like Orbiter, things like that. So we want to make sure you're using the most strong vocabulary you can from the reading. Does that make sense?",,,,
Teacher,420.2,but I want you each to come up with your own individualized answers.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Your thinking so i'm going to show you my example sentence right here, this is how, if it were me I would start this sentence, but keep in mind there's a million ways to start the sentence, I would say to discover water on the moon, the scientist used blank.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"And you look, you can find at least two more tools that you can pull out and use in your response you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope you'd also need blank and you'd also need blank.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Now i'm sure you serve you did circle, the same as Farrah Farrah his answer was the microscope, but I want you to come up with your own words and your own answers, yes, you and samantha might have had the same answers.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"What types of equipment use on the reading not not necessarily you and Farrah I want to know exactly what depth saw in the reading so again, the example sentence might help you.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Perfect now can you add that to your whole sentence and make a whole new sentence for me.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"You said that NASA sent a small machine that's perfect NASA did send a small machine, but I want you to add more I want you to build on that now, you went back and you highlighted the Lunar orbiter as one did you highlight a second one.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Perfect can you rebuild your sentence for me in a way that explains both of them okay.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"awesome you should put that in your answer to, then you know a lot about space okay wow.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So we need to build your sentence, because we only have a little bit so, how would you start your sentence.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So to fix your answer just a little bit. You are correct, NASA sent a small machine. And just a simple fix. We can put on it is at the words, called a microscope, at the end of it.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"That's all you need to do, because you did say it was a small machine and you just needed to put the name of it. So NASA sent a small machine called a microscope and then your answer would be perfect.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"my only suggestion for you like, your answer was almost perfect is just to put the name of the small machine that's it that's my only issue. Otherwise your answer is perfect.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Well i'm so glad that you worked with your classmates and I think it's really important to work with your classmates, but when answering your question on your own paper, I really would love, if you could explain your answer, rather than, say you didn't listen to someone else.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"And the only only recommendation I have, for your answer, because it's almost there is to just name the small machine that they used. That's it to make your answer perfect.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"At the water. Okay, great. So when next time when you're doing this, maybe explain what the microscope was used for. So in your next response, you could say a scientific tool use",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Was the microphone scope to look really closely at the water because that was what the question was asked, so three jobs.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"What this small machine was so you said exactly what the texts needed, which was NASA send a small machine.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Mm hmm. And maybe what the machine was called,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Look really closely at things, which is true. But I asked him into then go on and say, how did the microscope.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Microscopic so that's why Farrah said that, and which is why spins and ended up being really great because she explained how the instrument was used to find the water. So does that make sense. Chris.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yes, so she took the instrument, she explained with instrument did and then explained how the instrument helps find the water","Yes, so she took the instrument. she explained with instrument did and then explained how the instrument helps find the water",,2,
Teacher,420.2,"The question fully, you would need to describe the exact small machine that was found",,,,
Teacher,420.2,I think you should be looking at the text and pulling evidence for a specific sentence that relates to explaining why water is valuable.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"would carry the water, it would be too heavy but then your response should have something about why it not the water not being carried would be a good thing, so just elaborating a little bit off of that of how",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Right, so that is what you would put into your answer, just to explain and relate back to the question that's being asked.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"but maybe we could elaborate and and why, why do they use this tool. What does this tool, help them with.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,So Referring to the water on the moon text. Can you kind of elaborate on that response. Can you tell me why you need a microscope.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Chris and Luis, I'd like to hear more concrete examples of what kind of equipment they use",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Sure. So, that that is a correct answer a small machine I were just looking, I guess I'm just looking for more specific, so later in the sentence, they get a little bit more specific.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Hi, friends. Thank you for sharing your responses on that reading. I just have a question for you to think about. When you are giving a response after reading a text, it's always a good idea to include evidence. Does anyone know what ways they can include evidence? Luis?",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"OK. So sometimes if we just include the quote, we also want to include our own thoughts to make the quote expand our thoughts with the quote. So it's kind of two pieces you need is your own thoughts and the author's thoughts, the writer's thoughts.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"OK. I don't want you to think about it as right and wrong, but we can always make our answers better, right? So the more details we add can make them better.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So that's another thing we want to consider when we're thinking of our answers, is does this answer the question that's being asked? Because sometimes our answers are very true and relate to the story but are not related to the original question.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"No? So maybe you already knew that piece of information, but you can find another piece of information from the text. So right now we're focusing on stuff you can find from the text, and we always want to do that first. And if you have more information to add, that's great. You can add that later. But we really want to focus on what we're reading.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Exactly. We want to say both, right? We always want to use our own words and also include some of the author's words or thoughts. That way we can back up our answer with evidence from the story.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So what you did was you answered the question, but we need more tools to, maybe, think further on our answers.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"But maybe we can use another tool like rereading through all of the text, right? And then, if we reread through the text, we can find a little bit more details and maybe even more of the tools that came up within the article.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So that would have helped out your answer and made it a little bit more specific. So you're not wrong, it is a small machine, but just to add a little bit more detail and clarification, so it's nice and clear.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So even though, you do have your background knowledge. We activated that. And that you know that they use a lot of different tools. Maybe we could just look through the article to find what they specifically used. Like the Lunar Orbiter that Jazmin was talking about or even the microscope that Farrah was talking about.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Nope, your answer is correct, but to answer the actual question that we brought into it, which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. We just need to go in a little bit more detail and make sure that we're rereading the text to answer the question.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah, so that's how you would want to broaden your, your, your response. You could say, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,So that could be useful in your response.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,but we just need to beef it up a little bit and use a little bit more academic vocabulary.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"You might want to add that into your answer as well, to be very concrete and make sure you're using all your resources from the passage",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"I kind of wanted to talk to you about your answer. And you agree with Farrah, which is awesome but you kind of want to put it into your own words.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Great. So incorporating that information in your answer really shows me that you understand the reading. So I think that would be a great detail to add in your answers.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,You don't have to write down all of them. Exactly. But if you can put that sentence into your own words that shows me that you understand. You know what I'm saying.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"We can build on this sentence by saying, NASA sense and the machine called a lunar orbiter to look for ice deposits in the craters.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,We want to have enough words to describe what we're thinking,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"It's really small. So, saying that in your answer shows me that you understand what a microscope is and that you know that the water on the moon is really small and that you got all that information from reading the passage",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Exact put it in your own words or that you understand. That's perfect. Okay.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,But I'd like for you to explain why you chose that answer. And I think you did a great job of showing me that,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"That's really good. So, so basically the words that your classmates have been using and what you already know from going to NASA.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Those are some of the words I want to hear in your answer. So our question was highlighting the equipment that science scientists use to find the water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"so next time when we're giving our answers to these questions, we want to make sure that we're including details like the name of the small machine that NASA sent but you're absolutely right now send.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So, like, I told for Jazmin when you're giving answers you want to make sure you have your evidence to back up your statement as well okay.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Oh, your answer was not wrong. I think that we can add more details to your answer to your answer. So let's do a sentence spring. So instead of saying, NASA sent a small machine, you could use our vocabulary word Lunar Orbiter. Can you repeat that with me, NASA sent a lunar orbiter.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Well, your answer wasn't wrong you actually had a really good answer, but we want to do is add more supporting details to give yourself a stronger answer,",,,,
Teacher,420.2,yeah like you could add those two equipments maybe you could start a new sentence with them just add in that those word to equipment that they used to discover water on the moon.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"A way that I could see you making a response, even better, is kind of adding the question into the response. So you could say one way that the that water is valuable is you can split it into hydrogen and oxygen says, what do you think, do you think that sounds better.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Keep the first part of your answer, but only make that your first part and then.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Go back and try and find a little bit of evidence in the text as to why you think the answer is correct. okay?,,,,
Teacher,420.2,I think it would be really hard to get it ready too. I think that's a really good point but let's think back to what I just said to Farrah do you have any thoughts of how you could make your answer a little bit stronger.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Right, I really liked that you bought up evidence from the reading I think that's a great idea, so I would look back to your answer and add some more evidence from the reading. Good job","Right, I really liked that you bought up evidence from the reading. I think that's a great idea, so I would look back to your answer and add some more evidence from the reading. Good job",,,
Teacher,420.2,"yeah I think that's a really good answer, I think you could go a little bit further by just maybe quoting the text, just so that you really getting your information from the text Okay, yes Farrah.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,Is there a way that you can add some words to that that would strengthen your response and make it connect to the question a little more,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"You're right. Exactly. So you had all of the right information. It's the one thing. Like, if I were to answer your question I'd use your exact words I say something like, to discover water on the moon.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,You need a specific scientific tool called Microsoft to look really closely. Right. So if you just add that little sentence that helps give your answer some context. So if I look at it without the question I still know what you're talking about. Right.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Right, so NASA did send a small machine, but can you add some details like what was that machine called. Do you remember",,,,
Teacher,420.2,It was called the Lunar Orbiter. That was something that was in our text water on the moon. And so adding small details like that can really strengthen our response.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,You added more words and you added specific details.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,So when we're gonna fix some of our answers we want to add some specific details from the text and we will so that we can show that we have a really deep understanding of what was that,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So, is there information from that sentence that you can add to your response to just make it a little stronger.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Right, so one suggestion that I have for you is maybe i'm being a little bit more specific with your words and even including the evidence that you had ready to tell me in your response.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So I think yeah yeah, so I think one suggestion I have for you, like the suggestion I had for Farrah would just to be to add a few more specific details, so that I and your peers can.","So I think yeah yeah. so I think one suggestion I have for you, like the suggestion I had for Farrah would just to be to add a few more specific details, so that I and your peers can.",,,
Teacher,420.2,"is needed for astronauts to breathe, and so, if you added that to your response, it would help me and any of your friends, reading the response understand why the water on the moon is valuable to us, yes Chris.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,To restate the question exactly So if you restate the question you say something like,,,,
Teacher,420.2,or is there a statement that you might think of or an answer to the question that you might have based with evidence from the reading?,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Okay. That's true, yeah, maybe it is, but I think there's something to think about is that when we're doing these assignments, we want to make sure that we're using the reading to backup our thoughts and to use evidence from the reading.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"I think a next time. If there's something we could Oliverelop that a little bit more like talking, you can say, you know what kind of small machine did they use",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Or different things like that. Just Oliverelop your thought process a little bit more than you already, then you already have. But there's nothing wrong with your answer.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So you could say, NASA, so like it said in the reading, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. Instead of just saying, NASA used a small machine, you could say, NASA used the lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"and we want to make sure we're going to, we want to make sure that we're using the text to support our answers.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,I will say the there one part of improvement or one area of improvement that I think that you could work on would be looking at all of the tools that they referenced because,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yes they did use telescopes but sometimes they also use that there are other tools that they utilize as well, so I just want to make sure you that you're going back and referencing the reading that we have in the assignment to make sure that you're getting all of the points possible.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"But I feel as though, like with a few of your other parents your answer can use a little bit more umpf, they could have he could have a little bit more to it.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,yeah that's that's totally okay um so we just want to make sure that when we are answering our questions that were being as clear as possible.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"It still has the same, it is the same, it does almost the same thing that your answer had that you wrote down but it just gives that a little bit more power to prove and to show that you are able to go back and reference, the text, while also understanding what you read.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"yeah so what I, so what I meant by that, basically, is just you want to make sure that you're stating the information that's written in the text, so instead of saying like you wrote.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Not yeah more words but you want to make sure that you don't necessarily have it's not always more words you just want to make sure that you're using the text and you're able to reference, the text in your reading.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"They talk about in the text, but I think that you can add even a little bit more they do talk about different types of equipment or different things that they could use or that they might need.","They talk about in the text, but I think that you can add even a little bit more. they do talk about different types of equipment or different things that they could use or that they might need.",,,
Teacher,420.2,"While they're up there, so I think in the future when you're doing your assignment and when you're reading or in your reading and you're filling up the questions and answering.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"That you can add a little bit more that's kind of the whole point of all of you, being in this group today.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"your answers aren't necessarily wrong, but I feel as though that when we go back and that when we do the assignment again you'll have you will know, know for next time that you can sit there, and you can add more.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"information from the texts or like direct quotes or like add the names of the machines, instead of generalizing it yeah Chris.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,They found the craters by using the Lunar orbiter helped them find the craters on the moon you just needed to add that little extra bit at the end of it to make sure that you really got the answer.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"yeah using evidence from the text, you have to state whether or not it is a valuable resource.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So the only part that I would, the only suggestion I have for you and this suggestion is for everybody, not just Jazmin.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Is that in your answers, I would like you to state where you found your evidence next time okay so.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"A suggestion I would say, is, I know this because, in paragraph four, it states.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Your answer is not wrong at all. It's actually really great. I loved your answer, Jazmin. But can you tell me what the machine is? Can you be a little bit more specific about that?",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yeah. That's perfect. So when we're saying our answers, we want to be as specific as possible to the text because that's really important to give evidence to what we have instead of just the general. So if you have a specific thing from the text, definitely include that always in your response because that gives me an idea of how much you can understand what's going on.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So when we're looking at our answers, I want you to be able to maybe explain just why they needed this equipment as well.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So when we answer. We want to be very specific. So like in the text, what small machine. Are they talking about did they say what kind of small machine.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Yep. So that's what you want to specify that the equipment that use was lunar orbiter which is a small machine. So, you are correct. But we just want to make sure we're super specific about it.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So when you're saying, just make sure you specify just be like, Well, I do know from previous information that they have to use oxygen tanks, because there's a very limited amount of oxygen in space. So that's all you have to say.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"In the text we can go deeper into the text and find more answers, like the machines and tools and equipments to find that in your answer and get more evidence and details into that response, and that would be great.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"Just make sure that we're going deeper into the text, one more reading it, so we can find even more information, because that answer was pretty good, very good.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,But if we want to look deeper and find more evidence that would be amazing.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So I would look definitely more closely, like, I told savannas and you guys circle, the same thing and find some more other tools or more evidence from the text that we can use and support your answer in the question.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,so if you want to incorporate that into your answer and make sure that you get those details in.,,,,
Teacher,420.2,That makes sense? to add yeah I think you think I just have to add the Lunar orbiter to my answer yep and make sure you use evidence from the text to support that,,,,
Teacher,420.2,"scientist sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is what it states, so you want to word that and make sure that the understanding of where it came from and what it is, is incorporated into your answer.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"So one thing you can do to add to your answer is in the text where did you find that answer, so you can say in paragraph two.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"And they didn't use a lunar orbiter which was similar to Jazmin's so all of you, in your responses can add where you found your answers in the text into your response, so we can all say like in this paragraph, I found in your answer.",,,,
Teacher,420.2,"But what I want you to work on is just being a little bit more specific with your response, you know what I mean? Just try to pick out details from the text. You know, earlier we did our lesson on comparing and contrasting using context and background information, so make sure with that we look for specific details in the text.",,,,
Teacher,420.3,"Can you and Oliver work together to go back to the text and figure figure out what that machine was called, is that cool?",Can you and Oliver work together to go back to the text and figure out what that machine was called?,1,,
Teacher,420.3,and we're going to keep our eyes open.,We're going to keep our eyes open.,0,,
Teacher,420.3,"I am wondering if you can pull out some information from the text that we used so, can you find a specific piece of equipment mentioned in this text Luis.","I am wondering if you can pull out some information from the text that we used so, can you find a specific piece of equipment mentioned in this text Luis.",1,,
Teacher,420.3,"so, can you look at the text Jazmin and see what the machine does.","So, can you look at the text Jazmin and see what the machine does?",1,,
Teacher,420.3,"awesome so Chris, I want you to go back to the text, and I want you to find me a piece of equipment that the scientists use okay okay okay awesome okay Luis i'm ready for you.","Awesome. So Chris, I want you to go back to the text, and I want you to find me a piece of equipment that the scientists use okay.",1,,
Teacher,420.3,"awesome well Luis I have a job for you, I want you to look at this text and find me a piece of equipment that the text mentions okay Luis.","Awesome, well Luis I have a job for you. I want you to look at this text and find me a piece of equipment that the text mentions, okay Luis?",1,,
Teacher,420.3,At least here in this case so Farrah and deb I want you to look back at the text and see if you can find a piece of equipment that the scientists used when they were discovering the water. ,Farrah and Deb I want you to look back at the text and see if you can find a piece of equipment that the scientists used when they were discovering the water so look back at the text and see if you can find a better piece of equipment.,0,,
,,So look back at the text and see if you can find a better piece of equipment.,So look back at the text and see if you can find a better piece of equipment.,0,,
Teacher,420.3,"So when we talk about what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon, I want you to kind of circle, a word or two anybody circle two words or did you guys all circle one word.","So when we talk about what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon, I want you to kind of circle, a word or two anybody circle two words or did you guys all circle one word.",2,2,I want you all to circle a word or two from the text about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon.
Teacher,420.3,"So for saying what equipment did scientist use discover water on the moon, maybe you can look for keywords like like the name of the equipment, because well the Lunar orbiter is a small machine it's also it's a lunar orbiter is a more specific example Farrah yeah.","So for saying what equipment did scientist use discover water on the moon, maybe you can look for keywords like like the name of the equipment, because well the Lunar orbiter is a small machine it's also it's a lunar orbiter is a more specific example Farrah yeah.",2,,"So for saying what equipment did scientist use discover water on the moon, maybe you can look for keywords like like the name of the equipment."
Teacher,420.3,"who remembers when Oliver asked what equipment was and Oliver said that it's like a tool right, so you can look for kind of key words like that Chris do you have a  question.",Who remembers when Oliver asked what equipment was and Oliver said that it's like a tool right? So you can look for key words like that?,1,,
Teacher,420.3,"Okay guys, so we just identified that we are looking for the equipment that was used to specifically discover water. So I want everybody to look in your text at paragraph two, yes. Luis","Okay guys, so we just identified that we are looking for the equipment that was used to specifically discover water. So I want everybody to look in your text at paragraph two,",2,,"So I want everybody to look in your text at paragraph two, and look for any keywords that may help to identify the equipment that was used to specifically discover water."

But let's look back","It's discovering so let's keep reading to see if it tells us what they're trying to discover because so far, we have a piece of equipment that's trying to discover something.
