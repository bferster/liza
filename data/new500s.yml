how has student thinking changed i want you to write in student reflection journal how has student thinking changed from when we started this activity
can somebody tell me and i want to see student hands raised what does it mean to find evidence
when we're talking about evidence we're thinking about what words do i see in this text or reading that help me answer this question
we might look for cue words or leading words like called like you notice how called is before that so that's a great example of a word that we might that we might use
alright student can you explain to me what evidence is
but when we're looking for evidence we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help us
you want to look in the story for where you can find these answers
alright so can somebody tell me how maybe they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation
yes so the next time student reading a tough question it can help you to look for that action words in the question because that's going to help you know specifically what student looking for yes student
exactly student so how's student thinking changed since the very beginning
so how can we approach that question a little differently now that student looked at it
when you read something it's a three step process when student trying to answer a question
and then you go look at student question and you look at what it's really asking you and then student read it again right so it's three steps skim it read it fast go look at the question and then you read to find the answer to that question does that make sense 
when we read the text and we read the question we need to correlate or we need to put them together to see what they're actually asking
you the strategy i talked about
if you want to be good at something you keep doing it over and over and over
thank you okay so student do you feel like student changed student student process for working through text and questions
about our keyword discover and you were thinking about how that was changing student thinking can you go back to that
what i want to challenge you with is the next time that you are posed with a question i want you to first think about student question and then dig into the passage and really circle and find the evidence
remember when we looked at our question we found a keyword
keyword to help us and to answer the question
always find and identify a keyword so you really understand what student looking for and go back in the text
she used the passage that we provided to find her answer she didn't just use her background knowledge she made sure to go back and find something in the text
and how did you find that instead of small machine it was the lunar orbiter what did you do to make that change 
i think what we all need to take away is that when we're answering reading comprehension questions we really need to focus on going back and reading the article in detail and maybe highlighting the text or annotating the text so that we can really understand in detail what we're learning and why we're learning it
make sure when student reading the passage you take a holiday you highlight important facts when you go to student question 
so you see how if you did remember that it was a small machine and i like how you went back and reread student text to figure out what that machine was actually called 
sometimes we can read things but not quite absorb everything so it's always a good idea to go back and reread student text underline important information and details that can help you answer questions about it afterwards and keep that knowledge with you 
now one of the strategies that we were going to use today is to look at some keywords that we have in our question
okay so from reading the text today and using our tools by going back and rereading the text and circling important information how can this broaden student understanding in the future of any topic that we discuss whether it's space or farming 
for restating a question you listen carefully for the words being used such as in our question
to answer the question using the race method you restate the question
how can you use student knowledge of restating the question in our next lesson
okay so who can tell me what they did to correct their answer so how did you go about correcting student answer
we look really closely at those keywords in our question
so remember when we are reading our question we have to look really closely at those keywords those words that we need to look for in our text 
so remember when we are looking at our question we always have to look for those important words 
and then we have to look in our text for the same words so that we can try to find our answer
often when we read it will tell us a sequence it will tell us what happened first and then what happens next so it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story
well what i do agree what can you we don't want to just say we agree and it's good to agree with people but it's also good to know why we we think something
when we're given questions we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are the more sense that they make later on so yeah you were partially right you want to look for that name student
i think we've all kind of learned a lesson when we're reading the information we have to pay attention to it and not just assume
does that make sense we know we all know different things about space but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being givendis 
so when we're answering questions like this again what's something that we need to make sure we do when we're answering the question
we looked very closely at our text we looked for those keywordstext
but what we need to do is definitely go through student passage and then highlight important details you always want to highlight student headings or student sub headings
because those are a lot of key details in there that could give you some really good text evidence so that's what you need to do you want to find details that go along with student question and could possibly support student answer
maybe like a chronological timeline of events in a text so if you broke down the text and circled like what happened first and then what happened and then what happened you might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question 
you built off student answer i appreciate how you build student answer we got more specific we narrowed down to that core of knowledge we're looking for and then we said okay this is this is what that machine was and this is what it was doing
okay again so and much like with student earlier we're just we're trying to look at that question and we're specifically boiling it down to just its core components 
that that is a um sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together and it's called summarizing so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer
so i really like to do is the race format so we're going to restate the question we're going to answer the question we're going to cite evidence and then we're going to explain that evidence
so for example when i read what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon i try to think to myself i try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking 
so for example i might say the equipment that the scientist used to discover on the moon would be and then leave that answer blank and then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment 
but i think next time we need to use the strategy of looking at keywords and be really specific
so next time you have a question you can underline student keywords to help you be more specific
so that is why it's very important to highlight those keywords so you can give the best answer
see sometimes it's okay to go back and reread to find the answer
so now that student figured out the full answer what will you do next time to when student looking back in the text
so now that we have talked about this how has this changed student think
alright so next time go back and look in the story to find student answer
yes that is exactly what i would like and that goes for all not just student so when student answering these questions try to use what you already know as well as specific information from what we're reading 
how did student thinking change there what did you do differently
great job that's a good strategy finding those key clues and keywords to help you find student answer
so next time you are answering a question like this how do you think you can make student answer better
ok so now that i have given you all some feedback i want you to think about how you started out thinking then how that changed
and how you will apply what you learned in student next task so i'm gonna give you all a couple minutes to think about it and then we will go around in the circle answering
so we can start with student and just to repeat i want you to state how you started out thinking how the strategy you used changed based on the feedback i gave and what you will do next time to make sure you are fully answering the question
what do you think you can include after using a background knowledge to answer student question so after you use student background knowledge what do you think what strategy do you think you can use to help promote learning and answering the question 
we're just going to go around student what do you think first student going to say what strategy you used and how you will build on to it for student next assignment or task
and last but not least student what about you what do you think what strategy did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future
you told me before that what you did was you read you noticed that the word water was in the question so you scanned through and you looked for things that related with water
great so i really liked that response because you explained studentself really well you said that you read the question you saw what the question was asking for and then you found it and explained why so that was a really great response
so can you tell me how student answer changed from the beginning
so what would you with our discussion today what would you say student answer would be and how would it change
so next time you answer a question like that what i want to hear is the actual equipment they were using
definitely use student imagination i really like how you visualize the situation before giving student answer that's a really good strategy to answering questions
student has that change student thinking a little bit
right so next time you get a question on a text are you going to use student background knowledge and not read the text at all or are you going to read the text and then use student background knowledge
right so what are a few things we can do next time when student not quite sure if student answers are all the way there yet
right so you went back and read so what do you want to do next time a teacher asks you for a little bit more information
yes that was a perfect response you used direct language from the text used specific vocab and you provided reasoning it was very specific that was a perfect response good job
so to find evidence we need to use those quotes from the text and i like that student quoted and she said paragraph three so we could all look at our texts and find where she was reading
do you see any ways that student mind is kind of changing are you thinking differently now that student hearing from student other friends and student
i like that student connecting student background knowledge to help you it's great that student using student notes to help you further understand this text that's an excellent strategy that good readers use
then you provided reasoning which is you can't survive without water it's very important to backup student answers with reasoning
i'm wondering what you'll do next time you get a question like this to arrive at an answer like this what's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this
i'm hearing that you read the text for details and evidence to help support student thinking
and i'm hearing that you have an idea of how you can repeat this answer in the future i think it might be great if you write down this process in a notebook
student connecting the details to another part of the text to explain how it could be valuable 
student you are using student background knowledge of a definition of orbiter to be able to apply student answerspace
so when we're answering comprehension questions like this we really need to dig into the text and make sure we're using all the information
that's right that's excellent so now when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions you can use dev's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use all of the evidence from the text 
i am going to give you some sentence starters and this is going to help us really solidify our learning and reading strategies
alright so for example i can start out saying i started out thinking and you would say student prior response and now i think this way because and then you can tell me so next time you see a question asking about a text i will do what 
so you think about the thinking and thinking strategy that you use when you are reading a text and answering a question
yo yo you started out thinking a certain way and now you think
so why did you change student answer to what student also wrote what were you thinking
okay so next time that you see a question like this that's asking about a text what are you going to do
she's going back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used to discover water on the moon 
so we're gonna take a minute to turn around to student partner next to you and student going to talk about what are student takeaway from the revision process
and so the next time i see a question like this where i have to look at the text again i'm going to talk about a strategy
can you do you remember can you restate what their strategy is
does class else want to share maybe they're thinking on what they thought that was the right answer but now what they know is the right answer
great does class else want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed
does class else want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading
so this is a really good thing that you were just able to do so when you were rereading student able to see where you found student answer and you were able to find another part that you could add to it
that's an excellent strategy to be looking at the text and pulling out those keywords 
and i think that that's an excellent strategy for all to think about when we're reading a text is to think
next time you see this kind of question please be as specific as you can to answer the question okay 
specific name and of the things that you described okay
when student trying to answer this question just to try to locate these keywords in the paragraph
when we read we want to make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text
so every single time that we're using information from a text in order to answer a discussion question we want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text even though we might know a lot about the subject reading already
so that's great that's a great segue so what i wanted to ask you all next because you just gave specific evidence of what the question said and you analyze that and picked an answer based off that specifically so that's a great process
or even thinking beyond today some tools that we can use for future texts like these 
okay um so when student thinking about student original answer and student new answer what do you think the difference is between those answers
yes so when we're thinking about answering questions like these later in the future i think that what you said about details is very important
yes so that use the lunar orbiter so student what on what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer that you have 
so when we're not drawing on our prior knowledge these things can be complex in reviewing them a couple times is important student you have something to add
and what about that and when you all are thinking about that what parts can we use in the future when we're reading a question like this do you think that there's any of the words that we understand better now or anything about this about space that we under or about the moon that we understand better now or water
it's important for you to look back at the passage to try and determine what the best answer to the question is it's always helpful to circle keywords in the question
awesome so how would that how would you need to revise student answer to include those two ideas
so what do you think you would do next time you get a question like this
okay so what was different about that answer versus student first responsedis
what do you think will stick with you for the next time student answering a similar question
student what about you how did student answer change when you were able to revise it
i mean student 100 right and using that background knowledge but when we answer questions especially questions about a text we always want to make sure that our answers on have evidence that are found directly from the text 
mm hmm so let's just think about as a all like what did we do together what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called student
so as we proceed with this discussion i would want you to observe how student thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay
and moon so i want to make sure that my answers to those questions incorporate all of those components
ok so student do you want to share student new thinking what has changed in student thinking
what i'm going to suggest to all of you is when you start the first thing you do before you start reading is to actually look closely at the question
so i guess the other strategy that student going to want to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking and then student trying to make some connections between the concepts that student reading
how what did you learn right what did you take away from this process of making inferences and making connections what did you learn about that you might be able to apply the next time you encounter a question like this 
that can help you make some inferences you want to read a little bit more closely for the meaning of the the material before it
yeah so this is a really important skill for scientists we need to be able to look at a text and use quotes or information from the text to support our answers 
great so student now that student participating already would you mind telling me what student thinking was when you went back to try to revise student response
okay so looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a great strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely 
is there anything else did class do anything different when they were revising their answerdis 
so we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies the next time we come across a question like this so
first student going to answer i started out thinking blank then student going to answer and now i think blank because blank go ahead and take 30 seconds to answer those questions
so next time you see a question asking about a text what will you do
what made you change student thinking on that
i love that you are looking for keywords that's a really strong reading technique 
and then after student finished i'm curious if you could share about how student thinking has changed from student original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote
so i suggest that the next time you have a question like this you read through the text and look for those key specific words that might help you have a more rounded out answer
now that we figured out the full answer what could you do next time so that you don't have to revise and revise and revise
i think that a little bit of specificity and putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times
what was different about student first answer and student second you saiddis 
i sort of noticed that through talking with student i mean that you also added some specificity to student answer do you think that helped you get a more full response
okay what could you do next time you get a question like this
what do you think you could do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking
i think that's totally a great strategy for you i think if you see the question provide student answer just look over student answer one more time and then make sure it answers matches the question and you'll be good to go 
so how can i ask you a question how did you get from student first answer to student second answer how did student thinking change
how can you know to look or how can you how can you see what the question is asking so that you understand what answer to give other than just putting more words down
fantastic so i really appreciate something student just did he took little parts of the world to lunar orbit to draw a conclusion from that so we're really looking for small details here
the question when we're looking for an answer it's important to think about those keywords and it can also be helpful to create our sentence but i wouldn't say that it necessarily has to be in student response
before our conversation i thought that the answer was this or i didn't know the answer or i was still confused or just before our conversation this is what i thought and then after the conversation that we just had now i think
i think it's nice though when we read a text if we can scan the text for specific pieces of equipment then that way when we write our answers out if i ever asked you can you tell me what paragraph you found that in student be able to point to that exact part of the text
so i think student you did just that when you just re read that beginning of paragraph two
has our thinking kind of changed at all since we started talking through this student sorry i saw student hand was up
yeah exactly you could specify the small machine and that's a strategy you can use in response questions
hi welcome back from lunch so we'll just pick up from where we left it student as we talked about earlier in the day maybe in the future you can use specifying techniques in student responses
well in this case adding a name would be sufficient but i i'm talking more about a strategy of specifying student responses instead of just like adding into adding a name into it so
but student strategy is absolutely right you you locate the keywords in the question and you find them in the text
so the next time when student answering these kinds of questions be sure to look for student information or student answer in the text 
tell me how your thinking has changed?
what does it means to find evidencequestion
what i mean about evidence is we're thinking about what words do i see what help me answer this question 
lookimg for cue words or leading words is a great example of a word that we might that we might use
can you explain to me what evidence is question
when looking for evidence we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help
look in the story to find these answers
how has they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation
next time student reading a tough question it can help you to look for that action words to know specifically, 
so how's student thinking changed since the very beginning
let's approach that question adifferently now student looked question
it's a three step process when student trying to answer a question
look at student question what is it really asking studentquestion
it is three steps skim, read fast and look at the questionthen you read to find the answer to that question
we read the question we need to correlate we need to put them together to see what they're actually asking
this is the strategy i mean
to be good at something keep doing it over and over and over
do you feel like student changed student student process for working through text and questions
about keyword discovery were you were thinking about how that was changing student thinking
next timeyou are posed with a question first think about student question and then dig into the passage and really circle and find the evidence
we looked at the question and found a keyword
keywords help us to answer questions
find and identify a keyword to understand what student looking for
use the passage provided to find answer
dont use her background knowledge make sure to go back and find something in text
how did you find that instead of small machine it was the lunar orbiterquestion
what did you do to make that change 
when answering reading comprehension questions we focus on going back and reading the article in detail and highlight or annotate the text or annotating the text
so we canunderstand in detail what we're learning and why we're learning it
when student reading the passage highlight important facts
i like how you went back and reread student text to figure out what that machine was actually called 
we can read things but not quite absorb everything 
go back and reread student text underline important information and details that can help you answer questions about it afterwards and keep that knowledge with you 
one of the strategies we use is to look at some keywords that we have in our question
okay so from reading the text today and using our tools by going back and rereading the text and circling important informationevidence.
how can this broaden student understanding in the future of any topic that we discuss whether 
listen carefully for the words being used to restate question you
answer the question using the same method you restated the question
use student knowledge of restating the question in next lesson
how did studentgo about correcting student answer
examine the keywords in question
when reading question look really closely at keywords 
we always have to look for those important words 
we can find our answer by lookin in our text for the same words
it will tell us what happened first and then what happens next so it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story
we don't want to just say we agree and it's good to agree with people but it's also good to know why we we think something
we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are the more sense that they make later on so yeah you were partially right you want to look for that name student
we've learned a lesson when we're reading the information
we have to pay attention to it and not just assume
weknow different things about space but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being givendis 
we need to make sure when we're answering the question we're answering questions like this
looked for those keywords when we looked very closely at texttext
go through passage and highlight important details you always want to highlight student headings or student sub headings
because those are key details that could give you some good evidence
that's what you need to do you want to find details that go along with student question and could possibly support student answer
a chronological timeline of events in a text
break down the text and circled hat happened first and what happened next you might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question 
you built off student answer
got more specific we narrowed down to that core of knowledge we're looking for
ook at that question and specifically boil it down to its core components 
that that is a um sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together and it's called summarizing so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer
swe're going to restate the question to answer the question we cite evidence and then explain that evidence
try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking
leave that answer blank and then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment
use the strategy of looking at keywords and be specific
you can underline student keywords to help you be more specific
it's very important to highlight those keywords to get the best answer
it's okay to go back and reread to find the answer
now that student figured out the full answer what will you do next time when looking at the text
now has this changed student thinking now that we have talked about this
next time go back and look in the story to find answer
when student answering these questions use what you already know as well as specific information from what we're reading 
what did student do differently and how did student thinking change there
that's a good strategy finding those clues and keywords
how do you think you can make student answer better next time you are answering a question like this
i want you to think about how student started out thinking then how that changed
how you will apply what you learned in student next task
i want you to state how you started out thinking how the strategy you used changed based on the feedback i gave and what you will do next time to make sure you are fully answering the question
what do you think you can include after using a background knowledge to answer student question so after you use student background knowledge what do you think what strategy do you think you can use to help promote learning and answering the question 
what do you think first student going to say what strategy you used and how you will build on to it for student next assignment or task
and last but not least student what about you what do you think what strategy did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future
what you did was you read you noticed that the word water was in the question so you scanned through and you looked for things that related with water
you explained studentself really well you said that you read the question you saw what the question was asking for
tell me how has student answer changed from the beginning
what would you say student answer would be and how would it change
next time i want to hear is the actual equipment they were using
imagination is a really good strategy to answering questions
visualization is a really good strategy to answering questions
changed student thinking a little bit
next time you get a question on a text don't use student background knowledge
next time when if student not quite sure if student answers are all the way there yet
you used direct language from the text used specific vocab and you provided reasoning it was very specific that was a perfect response
we need to use those quotes from the textt o find evidence
do you see that student mind is kind of changing are you thinking differently 
that's an excellent strategy that good readers use 
student provided reasoning it's very important to backup student answers with reasoning
next time you get a question like this to arrive at an answer like this what's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this
you read the text for details and evidence to help support student thinking
you have an idea of how you can repeat this answer it would be great if you write down this process in a notebook
it could be valuable to connect the details to another part of the text to explain how 
student you are using student background knowledge of a definition of orbiter to be able to apply student answerspace
when answering comprehension questions we need to dig into the text and make sure we're using the information
when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions you can use student's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use all of the evidence from the text 
here are some sentence starters to help us solidify our learning and reading strategies
you would say student prior response and now i think this way because and then you can tell me so next time you see a question asking about a text i will do what 
when you are reading a text and answering a question think about the thinking and thinking strategy that you use
student started out thinking a certain way and now you think
why did you change student answer to what student also wrote
next time that you see a question like this, what are you going to do
go back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used 
what are student takeaway from the revision process
next time student see a question like this where have to look at the text again talk about a strategy
can you restate what their strategy is
does class want to share their on what they thought that was the right answer but now what they know is the right answer
does class want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed
does class want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading
you were rereading student able to see where you found student answer and you were able to find another part that you could add to it
pulling out those keywords is an excellent strategy 
that's an excellent strategy for class to think about
be as specific as you can to answer the questionnext time you see this kind of question 
locate these keywords in the paragraph
make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text
we're need to use information from a text in order to answer a discussion question we want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text even though we might know a lot about the subject reading already
you just gave specific evidence of what the question said and you analyze that and picked an answer based off that specifically so that's a great process
thinking beyond today some tools that we can use for future texts 
student thinking about student original answer and student new answer what do you think the difference is between those answers
in the future i think that what you said about details is very important
what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer 
reviewing them a couple times is important student you have something to add
think about that what parts to use in the future
are there any words that we understand better now or anything about this about that we understand better now
look back at the passage and determine what the best answer to the question is it's always helpful to circle keywords in the question
awesome so how would that how would you need to revise student answer to include those two ideas
when student get a question like this, what student would do next time
what was different about that answer versus student first response
next time student answering samewhatwill stick with you
student what about you how did student answer change when you were able to revise it
we always want to make sure that our answers on have evidence that are found directly from the text 
what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called student
so as we proceed with this discussion i would want you to observe how student thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay
make sure that student answers to those questions incorporate all of those components
do you want to share student new thinking what has changed in student thinking
when you start the first thing you do before you start reading is to actually look closely at the question
anither strategy to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking and then student trying to make some connections between the concepts that student reading

would you mind telling me what student thinking was when you went back to try to revise student response
looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a good strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely 
would student do anything different to were revise answer
we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies the next time we come across a question like this so
what will student do when you see a question asking about a text next time
what made you change student thinking on that
looking for keywords is a strong reading technique 
could you could share about how student thinking has changed from student original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote
so i suggest that the next time you have a question like this you read through the text and look for those key specific words that might help you have a more rounded out answer
what could you do next time so that you don't have to revise and revise and revise
putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times
tell me what was different about student first answer and studentdis 
you also added some specificity to student answer do you think that helped you get a key full response
if you get a question like this, what could you do next time 
what mightstudent do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking
