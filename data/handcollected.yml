    - student what text about astronaut water should under bottle water valuable source valid valuable resource what :: question, science, tagmeta
    - student right hydrogen oxygen :: science, agree, tagconcern
    - student back think second paragraph you'll nasa sent small machine called lunar orbiter investigate lunar orbiter look deposit large polar crater :: space, text, tool, search, science, tagconcern
    - student that's where found think right :: search, agree, tagconcern
    - student landed moon south pole that's where found looked deposit since wasn't necessarily water frozen water look large polar crater guess really cold :: space, search, science, tagconcern
    - underlined equipment discover great tell just reading passage student tell what word equipment might refer passage what kind equipment scientist discover water moon :: space, text, tool, search, question, science, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - student deposits what tell what says deposit very small :: question, science, tagconcern
    - very small they're looking something very small they're take lunar orbiter there also read paragraph three student :: space, text, search, action, tag500, tagconcern
    - student word could that's second sentence circle word could student pencil will second sentence paragraph four says could useful lots ways :: text, action, tagconcern
    - student would think word useful also same maybe valuable look back paragraph telling could useful :: text, search, agree, tagconcern
    - student stop second what first paragraph tells know :: text, question, tagconcern
    - student okay someone paraphrase paragraph :: text, agree, tagconcern
    - student yeah what would deposit what think would look like :: search, question, science, agree, tagconcern
    - student tool because deposit small can't student eyes tool microscope able :: tool, science, tagconcern
    - student okay moisture that's still bigger moisture found moon frost naked what found moon would even able tell there without lunar orbiter microscope being able :: space, tool, search, question, agree, tagconcern
    - student okay think water moon look same glass water would drink :: space, search, science, agree, tagconcern
    - student paragraph three what about :: text, question, tagmeta
    - student when when says able :: question, tagconcern
    - student what right after :: question, agree, tagconcern
- intent: r300
  examples: |
    - awesome so student and student get awesome points for circling the parts in the text prompt because that was the the direction so a direction for following points :: text, tagconcern
    - amazing yeah i love that and and i love that you are you agree with student and student adding more to the answer and together you class have collaborated on even better answer :: expand, agree, tagconcern
    - and i love that you class are really using the reading and pointing to specific parts and sentences in the reading to help equipment that allow us to discover water on the moon you come up with student answer and i think we already so now we have identified two different equipments and you class were able to build on each other's answers to :: space, text, tool, search, science, disagree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - yeah and you pulled out something very specific and you found another piece of equipment that was method mentioned in the text which is very good as well :: tool, search, expand, question, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - i love that you brought in that background knowledge student that fact about some about the scientists and astronauts needing those oxygen tanks that's really awesome background knowledge :: space, science, tagmeta
    - okay so you read it in the story i love that you found it in the story :: text, search, action, agree, tagconcern
    - yeah so i love that you picked up on the microscope because it's really important when we're thinking about the word microscopic :: text, tool, question, science, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - yeah so student i love what you know about nasa and student using evidence from the reading :: space, evidence, question, agree, tagmeta
    - yeah i love how you summarize that are student alright so i love how you summarize the article student :: text, question, agree, tagconcern
    - yeah student that's awesome background knowledge thank you for bringing that background knowledge so :: agree, tagconcern
    - yeah so i love that you both know that microscopes are used to look at small things and that you were able to pull that out of the text :: search, agree
    - so student what you did was you definitely got the answer correct :: question, agree, tagmeta
    - right you you know you know what sort of equipment scientists use to discover equipment on the moon uh to discover water on the moon :: space, tool, search, action, question, science, agree, tagconcern
    - absolutely yeah no these are class great observations about how our thinking can change by sort of learning a new piece :: action, question, agree, disagree, learn, tag500, tagmeta
    - i really like how you use student background knowledge to answer that question :: ask, question, tagconcern
    - so i am sure that you are going to do a great job when we look back for this specific tool because you probably heard of it before :: search, question, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - yeah i am so glad that you know so much about space :: agree, tagmeta
    - great i can really tell you use student background knowledge with that :: agree, tagconcern
    - so student absolutely right and ice deposit is a piece of frozen water that's on a planet :: science, agree, tagconcern
    - that's a good way of thinking about it student :: agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - you did mention a specific piece of equipment and although that may not be the best answer :: tool, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - and you still address the equipment part of the question and i appreciate that :: tool, search, ask
    - that's very specific and i appreciate you being really specific in student answer :: evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - i like student revised answer and that you class work so well together :: tagconcern
    - but yeah she did a great job and you were very specific also :: agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - i see student line of thought and i really appreciate that student telling us that they sent a small machine which is the equipment and they used it to discover which is to find out or to see :: tool, search, question, tagconcern
    - and i appreciate that answer
    - you did a great job using student background knowledge and using class the information that was in our text :: evidence, agree, tagconcern
    - that was one of our right answers :: agree
    - it was a right answer :: agree
    - well i appreciate that
    - i can see what student thinking and where you were going with that :: question, tag500, tagconcern
    - and i really like the fact that you use those contexts clues and explain to me what extracting meant :: question, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - so i appreciate that student opinion is that no you don't think that it'sit's going to be convincing or or it's going to be valuable :: disagree, tagconcern
    - reading you told us that extracting was getting the water out and i see where you use that evidence saying that it might take a lot of time and money :: evidence, science, tell, tag500
    - because it's possible that we could get it from the moon and i see chris's thinking was he said that water is very heavy :: space, science, tell, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - i can see how it would be very useful to leave behind class that weight because we may be able to find that water and use water on the moon and not have to carry that would be valuable :: space, search, question, science
    - so i can see student i appreciate the fact that you see value in that because it would be a valuable source :: tagconcern
    - you did a good job :: agree
    - yeah you did a very good job going back and finding the evidence :: search, evidence, agree
    - yes that is our this the two words that we really want to focus on :: text, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - that's a very good point :: agree
    - so you could circle convincing evidence together :: evidence, action, tagconcern
    - yeah that's a great idea :: agree
    - and we always want to make sure that we're looking forward :: search
    - even if it's not valuable right now :: agree
    - like you just said in student answer that it would be valuable in the future :: tell, tagconcern
    - now but in the future
    - so like you said you have a good you have a good point that it may not be valuable :: tell, agree
    - i love that student use the text when she found her answer and i wonder if :: search, question, tagconcern
    - i love that you cited where you found it in the text :: search
    - so student you said you need a specific tool called a microscope to look really closely which is absolutely true :: tool, search, question, tell, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - instead of saying equipment like the question did you just said tool :: tool, ask, tell
    - and that's perfectly because they're synonyms which means that they're the same or they mean the same thing :: question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - you told me and you gave it to me from the text that a microscope is what is needed to look really really closely :: tool, search, question, tell, tagconcern
    - i'm glad that you had some place that you could reference back to because that's really helpful in showing me that you know where the information came from :: evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - scientists have found craters full of water on the moon and that is absolutely true :: space, search, science, agree
    - student you have found some specific evidence in the text you pulled it right out :: search, evidence, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - and i'm really proud of you for finding that :: search, tagconcern
    - oh what a nice way to explain that :: question, tag400
    - oh i see where student talking about it says the water they found is microscopic so i mean right it's very small :: search, science, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - which is great and you class refer back to the text :: question, agree
    - you got to the three of you have listed science equipment right which you that is that first part of the question :: tool, ask, question, agree
    - well you know those are pieces of equipment that they use :: tool
    - thank you for that
    - that's a some awesome prior knowledge student :: tagconcern
    - so i can add a bit of background info here :: expand
    - so student can you give me another example of equipment maybe something from that article that we just read that you know that nasa is using in space :: space, text, tool, expand, action, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - and you offer a lot of insight
    - that's that's my my fault there so instead i should have said the way you answer that i see where student coming from :: tell, tagconcern
    - well maybe i phrased that poorly
    - i think that definitely gives a lot to whoever's reading that answer to include them in :: expand, tagmeta
    - i think that's very good :: agree
    - i like student use of detail there :: evidence, tagconcern
    - and that's that's very good :: agree
    - i'm glad student able to get that sort of perspective on it :: action, tagconcern
    - you give really good strong details on that very specific part :: agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - so i can kind of see student enjoyment there now a way we can sort of improve or something we might want to see is :: action, evidence, tagconcern
    - okay that's that's great :: agree
    - i think student got the main idea :: tagconcern
    - and so at the heart of student answer there :: tagconcern
    - and that's really exciting :: tagconcern
    - we found some water on the moon :: space, search, science
    - thank you very much for listening
    - those are very good listening skills and making sure student always being an active learner and to i think you really took to heart :: agree, tagconcern
    - so i appreciate that
    - that was very good :: agree
    - what i said there :: question, tell, tagconcern
    - why it doesn't say anything about water and that's a great point there but :: question, science, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - that's right they you know they they are very valuable and i like how you pointed that out :: question, agree
    - but when we look back at the question :: search, ask, question
    - okay awesome and i love how deb's original response was that he found the same as student that shows that student is able to make a connection with his classmate and relate his thinking to student thinking :: search, question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - and that's a good skill :: agree, tag500
    - i love how student student student and student were able to look specifically in the text :: search, question, evidence, tagconcern
    - to use our background knowledge like student used in to make inferences using our background knowledge and what the text tells us right :: question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - we want to make inferences and use our use our prior knowledge that's very important :: tag500
    - that's a good question :: ask, agree
    - that is a good answer because that is part of the answer :: agree
    - so way to use that evidence there for for a reason for water being valuable to us class right now :: evidence, science, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - so yes that's another great example of convincing evidence :: evidence, expand, agree, tag500
    - but you had a you had another good piece of evidence :: evidence, expand, agree
    - and so you you do have a good convincing answer right there :: agree, tagconcern
    - i see where student going with that :: tagconcern
    - and it is a small machine :: tool
    - and i'm glad that you referenced the text because that was awesome and correct :: agree, tagconcern
    - it is the lunar orbiter :: space
    - great job looking back at the text :: search, agree
    - yes they could use the microscope after they found it to study it :: tool, search, agree, learn, tagconcern
    - that's very good deduction there :: agree, tagconcern
    - i like what you did there student :: question, tagconcern
    - student that was that was a great find in the text :: search, agree, tagconcern
    - the water before it's broken apart can be drunk by astronauts good observation there from the text and the usefulness for oxygen and hydrogen can be used for rocket fuel here :: space, science, agree, tagconcern
    - that's great use of student background knowledge about that space station that they're planning to build it will take a lot of what in order to get that process going :: question, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely :: tool, search, science, tagconcern
    - and it also does say in here in the third paragraph :: text, tell
    - i'm and i see where student could have got her answer :: tagconcern
    - and she couldn't when you couldn't quite remember what the name of it was :: question, tag500
    - i like how you went back to student text and re read the information :: evidence, action, question, tagconcern
    - i like how class is reading their text and finding the details in the reading :: search, question, evidence
    - so great job class :: agree
    - so you weren't wrong but by going back and rereading you are able to identify what the exact name of that machine was :: tool, question, disagree, evidence
    - it was the right answer but i like how you went back and read student text and offered more accurate details :: expand, action, question, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - and nice job looking back at the text :: search
    - that is a very good answer :: agree
    - you remember from student text and student elaborated by restating the question :: ask, tag500, tagconcern
    - student did you want to add something :: expand, tagconcern
    - now i can see since you already have a lot of prior knowledge about space how why you would come up with that answer :: question, tagmeta
    - and that is a great answer our passage :: text, agree
    - i can see exactly why you would say that because it does say the water is microscopic and you would need to see a microscope you would use a microscope to see it :: tool, question, science, tell, evidence, tagconcern
    - well i can if you went to nasa and you actually saw class of those things i could i can understand why you would think that because there's a lot of things that you probably learned :: space, question, learn, tagconcern
    - and i see why you would say that :: question, tell
    - i see where you get that answer
    - i like student thinking that is awesome :: tag500, tagconcern
    - you use details from our text to support student thinking :: search, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - okay i see what student thinking too so awesome job using evidence from the text as well :: evidence, question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - it is like a tool that scientists use when they are discovering things :: search, question, science, tagconcern
    - so that was a really good explanation and definition of what equipment is :: tool, question, agree, tagconcern
    - yes those are some things from student personal experience and we do get information from our personal experience :: evidence, agree, learn, tagconcern
    - what you did a great job finding the first part of the sentence :: text, search, question, agree
    - good thinking because we are talking about water :: science, tell, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - we are talking about the moon but there are a few more :: space, expand, tell, tagmeta
    - well i appreciate it that you added that detail for us :: evidence
    - water is a valuable resource right :: science, agree
    - one place we can look is exactly where you look so you found the right spot to look under the section :: text, search, agree, evidence
    - because that has the words we were just talking about :: text, tell, tagmeta
    - so that was just the right place to look for that :: search, agree
    - and you did find some evidence didn't you :: search, evidence
    - class right let's see when you class are doing a great job with talking through this and working through it together and you know where to find the right place to look :: search, question, tell, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - so you class are class given really good details :: agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - so you class are given really good details for that :: agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - i've seen that you remembered a detail from the passage :: text, evidence
    - because i agree with you that no maybe it's not a good investment :: agree, disagree
    - so i think that you justified student answer and :: tagconcern
    - so i think that you and student and student class said that yes it's valuable and then you gave a reason why you thought it was valuable :: question, tell, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - and i spoke to student :: tagconcern
    - so he justified his answer
    - so i wouldn't say that you are wrong because it says one are valuable :: tell, disagree
    - you said yeah and then you pulled student evidence from the text so i would asy that student answer is right :: evidence, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - i think we class had our reasons and justified our reason :: tag500
    - i think that was a pretty good and complete answer because she gave the value :: agree, tagconcern
    - but i think that jazmin's answer and she said yeah because they can drink the water and they can stay hydrated :: science, tell, agree
    - of the water and how the water could be used :: question, science, tagconcern
    - you summarize very well okay and about the craters :: space, agree, tagmeta
    - you talked about the craters and craters full of water on the moon :: space, science, tagmeta
    - okay now you elaborate a little bit more in student answer :: expand, agree, tagconcern
    - i like that answer
    - now okay i can see that you understand what you were reading :: question, agree, learn
    - and you look back in the text to find student answer and to get class the information :: evidence, search, tagconcern
    - i like how student thinking about that how student thinking about what you could use on the moon even thought it's not in there that's a very good pull from what you read student :: space, search, action, question, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - they are and student using her deep reading skills to really engage with the text and that's awesome :: tagconcern
    - and i love student use of the vocabulary term microscopic that's really good :: text, science, agree, tagconcern
    - but i love that student using that prior knowledge that's really good :: agree, tagconcern
    - i loved student answer you really use the details in the article you went back and re read so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen :: text, action, science, evidence, tagconcern
    - so like you said student answer :: tell, tagconcern
    - and it looks like student done that in student answer :: tagconcern
    - student the water is valuable but we really need to discuss why :: question, science, tagconcern
    - okay so i can see how you may have a misunderstanding there because it's the say that you would need a tool called a microscope right student :: tool, question, tell, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - i see where you found about the microscope you can see the water :: tool, search, science, tagmeta
    - but i like how you found a machine because it did ask for a tool and a machine in that question and i really like how you found that but let's let's see if we can find another tool :: tool, search, expand, ask, question, tagconcern
    - i really like how you restated the text but we need to put a little really like that :: question, tagconcern
    - yeah so you you definitely you restated the text :: agree, tagmeta
    - and i love how you used i'm like the text to to backup student answer :: question, tagconcern
    - i really like how i mean you went straight to the text and you tell me :: question, tagconcern
    - yeah yeah student right :: agree, tagconcern
    - so try to think about :: tagmeta
    - okay so next time i really love how you came up with that answer :: question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - i'm glad that's what we're talking about in the question :: ask, question, tell, tagmeta
    - good i'm glad you were looking specifically that they found those the water in the craters :: space, search, science, agree, evidence
    - you found exactly where you should be looking at by that word machine there :: text, tool, search, evidence, tagconcern
    - and you also found that they both talked about water :: search, science, tagmeta
    - now what did the question ask us to find about water :: search, ask, question, science, tagmeta
    - you found exactly both of the equipment they talked about really really good :: tool, search, agree, evidence, tagmeta
    - they did say that it will be a long time because they still haven't been able to access the water :: science, tell
    - i'm glad that student looking into the text instead of just going off of what you know :: search, question, tagconcern
    - so right after that the paragraph :: text, agree
    - we want to be in student exactly right :: agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - because it's asking us directly about the text so yes :: ask, agree, tagmeta
    - okay so you did find some important information where :: evidence, search, agree
    - so you made a really important :: tagconcern
    - good i agree that they're not ready :: agree, tagconcern
    - no student answers great it you caught on to the fact that nasa did send a small machine but you didn't tell me what this small machine did and i wanted to know :: space, tool, question, agree, disagree, tagconcern
    - they do say that and that's great text evidence to use :: evidence, tell, agree
    - they say that this especially specifically in the text but let's look back at our question :: search, ask, tell, evidence, tagconcern
    - and i say that you you basically rephrase the first sentence :: text, tell
    - yes that was very good :: agree
    - i love how you are reading very closely and paying attention to those very big words very good :: text, question, agree
    - and that's probably helped you a little bit with reading this passage and being able to connect some of the experiences that you had back to this packet passage :: text
    - and now the reason that you could be confused is because it says it but we haven't proved it :: tag500, tagconcern
    - okay so we'll keep going :: agree, tagconcern
    - which is which is good because they did use a small machine and it does say small machine :: tool, question, tell, agree
    - so you you just used a one sentence from the paragraph that had a piece of equipment in it :: text, tool
    - student answer was nasa sent a small machine :: space, tool, tagconcern
    - so student in the ballpark :: tagconcern
    - so you found the equipment :: tool, search
    - and i like that you use that wording scientific tool :: science
    - i like that you use that word scientific tool :: text, science
    - great great job there :: agree, tagconcern
    - and i really appreciate you explaining student answer :: tagconcern
    - i do understand what you mean :: question, learn
    - well i do like that you shared student opinion in student answer :: tagconcern
    - and sometimes it's hard for us as students and even sometimes as teachers because we're not scientist to understand how long it takes for them to figure out how to get things right :: question, science, agree, learn, tag400, tagconcern
    - i agree with you
    - like right now it's not ready and i do like that you shared student opinion good job there :: agree, tagconcern
    - i think that you are correct that sometimes it's not going to be ready :: agree, tagconcern
    - so you class have class shared student responses with us and that's been really really good :: agree, tagconcern
    - i really liked that you class tried to pull student evidence from the text :: search, evidence, tagconcern
    - okay so one of the things i would say is that you class did a really good job trying to pull things you found out of the text :: search, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - yeah that certainly makes sense from having gone to see that type of stuff :: agree
    - that's great that you had a chance to see some other things that have happened in space :: agree
    - so that's a great job be able to identify what that means :: question, agree
    - so you class did a really good job at using student past knowledge on a microscope :: tool, agree, tagconcern
    - and so you looked back at the tech stuff on if there was convincing evidence that water can be valuable :: evidence, science, tagconcern
    - good job so you may be redirected and rethought student answer :: agree, tagconcern
    - yes it was in the within the text it does state that this stuff :: agree
    - okay well you know good job :: agree
    - yes was within the actual document in this state that you can split up in between oxygen hydrogen and oxygen :: science, agree, tagconcern
    - student you were able to sort of you know find those key evident that key evidence very quickly :: search, evidence, action, tagconcern
    - that is very good job :: agree
    - very good for looking deep into student question and in circle in it :: search, action, ask, agree, tagconcern
    - alright so let's first look at the question again :: search, ask, tagconcern
    - and i was very impressed about how class took time to look over and look into the text and had some really deep connections they really you really thought about the things that we were asking :: search, ask, question, tagmeta
    - a that is a great response and i love how you made a connection because that helps some of us out a detective :: question, agree
    - made a connection and we're studying about space and on the moon :: space, tagmeta
    - you made a connection a detective
    - she used like a student use that his dad was an astronaut :: science, tagconcern
    - so again there you goin back in when you said you didn't understand about that word i think you know more than what you think evidence you just showed me evidence about how to survive :: text, evidence, expand, question, tell, learn, tagmeta
    - so i appreciate that you when looking at the text you notice that the scientists use the microscope :: tool, search, question, science, tagconcern
    - so i appreciate that you care to get the correct answer :: agree, tagconcern
    - so that's very that's that's very good to ask so you you are student seeking to know why student answer was wrong :: question, agree, disagree, tagconcern
    - and so i love that class are class thinking about the story and are using :: text, tag500, tagmeta
    - using the text to help support student answers :: search, tag500, tagconcern
    - i do and i think student doing a good job putting that together :: agree, tagconcern
    - that is such a great comment and it's really great that student able to tie that in with a real world experience and i would think that they definitely use those things on the moon :: space, agree, learn, tagmeta
    - you can bring in student prior knowledge to the article sort of like student :: text, action, tagconcern
    - and i especially like what you said about an opinion because it is asking for an opinion :: ask, question, tell, tagmeta
    - student and that was perfect :: tagconcern
    - i really i really think that you did a really good job i identifying and separating the fact that the now versus later :: agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - so student you may know a lot about space that's i agree with you :: tagmeta
    - you know that answer makes perfect sense :: agree
    - you do a great job of talking about the question :: ask, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - as far as that goes
    - so you obviously understand the question :: ask, learn
    - so again we're just going to that
    - so student picking up on key parts of the text which water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that's important :: question, science, tagconcern
    - so you already do parts of that you answer the question you provide evidence you explain student evidence :: evidence, ask, tag400, tagconcern
    - you do a great student answers :: agree, tagconcern
    - yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated :: science, agree
    - you can't survive without water :: science
    - and it's hard because i like you to have student own opinion :: tagconcern
    - what i would really like you to do though :: question, tagconcern
    - yeah i mean that's a great way to say it :: tell, agree
    - okay so we have the first noun what equipment and that's an excellent strategy to look at if our if our question is focused on on noun specific things :: tool, search, ask, question, agree, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - you did in fact student response is very good as finding pieces of text evidence :: search, evidence, agree, tagconcern
    - that is that is a great piece of text evidence :: evidence, agree
    - that was a great thought process putting those two together :: agree, tag500
    - okay so convincing evidence and valuable :: evidence, agree
    - and that is correct :: agree, tagconcern
    - and i like that you found that because you did find a in paragraph four right under that heading so that helped lead you in the right direction :: text, search, agree
    - and i like the way that student gone back and put the key words from the question with student answer :: text, ask, tagconcern
    - so i appreciate you looking at student :: search, tagconcern
    - answer and asking why :: ask, question
    - i like how student making that connection :: question, tagconcern
    - well i like how student bringing in that prior knowledge that you already know to help you answer this question :: ask, question, tagconcern
    - i know exactly where it's at the text as well i believe part three of the first pair first section :: text, evidence
    - so good job there oliveron are deaf :: agree, tagconcern
    - okay i can see how you got there i can see i can see that :: question, agree, tagconcern
    - good job they're reading into that :: agree, tagconcern
    - yes that is true :: agree
    - i like that you went back in the text and had some support to support student answer and i do agree with you :: search, tag500, tagconcern
    - i am very glad that you went back in the texts were able to find support for student answer :: search, tag500, tagconcern
    - he did a really good job :: agree, tagconcern
    - i really liked student answer and how you can how you included both parts those the water is heavy and that the water can be broken into two parts and us :: question, science, tagconcern
    - that's actually very well done
    - and that's a very logical series of steps you took to get to that answer
    - i love where you went with that and it was a very logical series of steps that you took
    - yeah that makes complete and total sense :: agree
    - that was a good job connecting the dots there :: agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - it's good that student pulled in the lunar orbiter :: space, agree, tagconcern
    - so you can definitely still say that student answer is is a big part of what you want to reconstruct to but i think to be a little more specific :: expand, question, tell, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - and now that student chosen to answer that gives us more detail instead of just circling the same as student :: expand, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - student thought process is a lot deeper as well :: tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - first of class because i know that that's a really important detail but now that we know how it was found in those craters we've answered the question with much more detail :: space, search, expand, ask, question, evidence, tagconcern
    - great that's that's really good student :: agree, tagconcern
    - so i appreciate that you noticed where the water was found :: search, science
    - okay now like how you have started thinking about question :: ask, question, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - it did say what equipment do they use discover water on the moon and student starting to think about what equipmentwould they need to find water on the moon :: space, tool, search, question, science, tell, tagmeta
    - you have mentioned two pieces of equipment that are specifically referenced in the text lunar orbiter and microscope :: space, tool, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - i like how you read the text you saw mentioned microscope and student thinking well i have to have a microscope to see the water deposit :: tool, action, question, science, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - therefore the microscope is what was used to find as water deposits :: tool, search, question, science, tagconcern
    - right and i do like how you have focused on part of the question you focused on the part where it says they they discovered water on the moon and you specifically said where they found water on the moon they found it in the craters :: space, search, ask, question, science, tell, agree, evidence
    - okay and i do like how you have referenced something in the text that is specifically mentioned it does in fact say that water can be broken down into oxygen and hydrogen :: question, science, tell, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - and that is great because you obviously went to the text and the text does in fact say that astronauts could drink the water :: science, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - absolutely and that's in the text says great student point information out of the text that water h2o can be splitting the oxygen and hydrogen :: evidence, science, agree, tagconcern
    - right well and i love that you class were able to close student eyes and see that and help you oliverelop that :: agree, tagconcern
    - so you found that directly in the text :: search
    - anything you did use a lot of background knowledge and student answer :: tagconcern
    - okay i understand that :: agree, learn
    - but i do love that you brought student outside knowledge into the conversation :: talk, tagconcern
    - and i just like that
    - that was student example :: evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - okay so just like student i love that student using student background knowledge to contribute to our discussion and they're also may be :: talk, agree, tagconcern
    - for our first question you said that scientists use a microscope to look closely and i wanted to say that that was really good i like that you used the specific name of the tool that scientists use but i also want to encourage you to :: tool, search, ask, science, tell, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - so student you did a really good job saying that the microscope was a tool that they used because student definitely correct it is :: tool, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - awesome i want to say that that is a good response because you said that they use a lot of equipment and then you were specific by saying oxygen tanks :: space, tool, science, tell, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - and i think it's really good when student reading a text to think about what you already know and experiences you have so like student is saying :: question, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - he already knows a lot about space and he learned the astronauts use these specific things so that's great to keep in mind when student reading the text :: question, science, agree, learn, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - right i definitely appreciate that and i like that you were able to find exactly where in the text you found student answer i do have a concern though so the question :: search, ask, agree, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - that is a very good response and i like that you provided a use for the water so that would be student evidence that you pulled from the text um :: evidence, science, agree, tagconcern
    - and you were able to find that in the text good job :: search, agree
    - great job pulling that out of the text :: agree
    - so i strength so far from that was you pointed out the material they use and then you said what it's used for which is very good :: question, tell, agree
    - i like that that's that's a good plan that's what i was thinking when i was reading yesterday first time i was like no not for yeah so i like student response and i like how you look for the evidence :: search, evidence, question, agree, disagree, tag500, tagconcern
    - for student answer which is really good so i'm keep keep up the good job of looking at the evidence on before they even asked that question :: search, evidence, ask, question, agree, tagconcern
    - do you think it's a good investment i thought i thought student answer was great because like :: agree, tagconcern
    - you know someone could have given like a shorter and simple answer i guess but student answer was still very good so good job on us man thank you very much no problem no problem so i'm dead you said :: tell, agree, disagree, tagconcern
    - you i like how you added evidence that you have to stay hydrated because you can't you can't survive without water and :: evidence, question, science
    - so i like how you paid attention to that and student you paid a lot to attention you paid a lot of :: question, tagconcern
    - attention to details which is very key in reading passages like this because if you mess up on details then student answer like could be not what you wanted to say but like you messed up on reading so then student answer when my county class messed up if you know what i mean well :: question, tell, evidence, tagconcern
    - student student response is actually really good :: agree, tagconcern
    - i like how you use the word microscope and you knew what it was used for :: text, tool, question, tagconcern
    - that is right and i like student answer how you use evidence from what you knew that i told you in the name of the machine that i set up for :: tool, evidence, question, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - like that it's a lot more general towards what the check said and then an opinion that you add or student guess of what you saw was there :: expand, question, tell, tagconcern
    - i think you did a really great job pulling from the text :: agree, tagconcern
    - so it was a great response :: agree
    - you had some of student personal views along with some thoughts that came from the text :: tagconcern
    - so what you said related to the text really well :: question, tell, tag500, tagconcern
    - and student i think you had some great vocab sorry did you have a question student :: ask, agree, tagconcern
    - yeah it's definitely a good answer to give and you use multiple paragraphs looking through to find that answer but where the question is kind of :: search, ask, agree, evidence, tagmeta
    - i'm glad we could expand on that and we can see how there's much more to getting to space and finding the water than we thought there was :: search, expand, question, science, tagconcern
    - but you use great academic knowledge :: agree, tag500
    - nd great academic vocab in student response :: agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - so you notice that it was a small machine was very good which they also stated it shows that you use student context from the text which is very good :: tool, question, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - but you used great academic vocab in student response :: agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - they did use a microscope to look at the water closest answer was small i see how you connected those two :: tool, search, question, science, tagconcern
    - and the background knowledge is helpful to understand what's going on in the passage i want you to use that background knowledge to help you understand the passage better and be able to read to find the answers :: text, search, action, question, learn, tagconcern
    - i well one thing i noticed was that you started out with student context student background knowledge which is great and always useful :: question, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - yes that is right so it's always great to have background knowledge to help us understand our text better or understand the question better :: ask, agree, learn
    - awesome you got that right from the passage :: text, agree
    - mention a piece of evidence that is in the passage that because it says clearly in the passagefor example future astronauts can drink water :: text, evidence, science, tag500, tag400
    - so you had said that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen you are right that is from passage so you did get that from the password which is good :: text, question, science, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - student just as you said you said you understood it but i still want to give you the feedback :: tell, tagconcern
    - awesome so i see what you did :: question
    - and that was great to use the reading to help us with our answer :: agree
    - awesome so that's what it says in the text which is great that we used our resources :: question, agree
    - awesome so yes that included the important details :: agree, evidence
    - you don't think it's valuable so i see where student coming from because it does say right here that making a plan will take a lot of time and money :: tell, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - let's look at the last sentence because i like what student brought up making this plan will take a lot of time and money :: text, search, question, tag500, tagconcern
    - and student i also noticed that you have to be did student background knowledge by referencing that they use oxygen tanks on the moon :: space, science, tag500, tagconcern
    - i knew you were using student background knowledge because in the reading we read we didn't read anything about oxygen tanks but you knew that when student on the loon :: space, action, question, science, tagmeta
    - you need to have oxygen to be able to breathe right :: science, agree, tagconcern
    - so i can see why you think that microscope is important and i agree to the microscope is very important with discovering water on the moon :: space, tool, search, question, science, tagconcern
    - okay so i see how you did connect but you were you were kind of scanning the page for the words that connected to water because the question was about finding water on the moon :: space, text, search, ask, question, science, agree, evidence, tagmeta
    - that's a really good strategy :: agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - student they did use the microscope to really look closely and that's a really good way to use the text as evidence in student answer :: tool, search, evidence, agree, tagconcern
    - thank you for pointing that out student :: tagconcern
    - and thank you student for explaining student answer and using the text really well :: tagconcern
    - answer because it really like i said it really uses the text like farrah's :: tell, tagconcern
    - you quoted the reading really well and i really like that and you also found in the text where :: search, tagconcern
    - so student i really liked in student answer that you really you mentioned the evidence from the from the reading :: evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - it talks about specific things that the question asks :: ask, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - and i really like that you you that you took us to a very specific part in the text um :: evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - a lot of people use a lot of good language in their responses student and student you class really use a lot of nice language specific language from the texts that i really appreciate :: agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - so jazmin's response is really good because it does lead us to answering the question the question was what equipment did they use :: tool, ask, question, agree, tagconcern
    - and she answers nasa sent a small machine :: space, tool
    - okay so jazmin's response was nasa sent a small machine :: space, tool, agree
    - yes thank you that is :: agree
    - is really really nice way to phrase that :: tagconcern
    - that's awesome and i love how long is like how you worded student answer :: question, tagconcern
    - i love how you comprehend the reading so well :: question, tag500
    - and i love how you said that you look back at the reading to like determine which machine you thought would be the best one :: tool, search, question, tell, learn
    - and student answer is right about the microscope data scientists did use the microscope to look at the water they already found in the reading it says they already found the water :: tool, search, science, agree, evidence, tagmeta
    - i really like how you looks back at the reading and really understood the question because you totally did :: ask, question, tagconcern
    - student totally right about how nasa you so much equipment like oxygen tanks and other things like that and they definitely do use that when they go to the moon but :: space, tool, question, science, agree, tagmeta
    - well that's great and i can definitely tell that you class read the reading and understood it :: action, agree, tagmeta
    - i totally understand where student coming from and i think that's a great way that you class interpreted interpreted the reading :: agree, learn, tagconcern
    - i definitely can see how you would find it confusing :: search, question, tagmeta
    - and i'm glad that you class didn't notice that when you class read :: action, question, tagconcern
    - i do agree that it does say other equipment that thank you :: tool, tell
    - student answer is almost perfect and it does show that you read the reading and understood it and understood the question which is great :: action, ask, question, agree, tagconcern
    - they definitely could have and i do see where student coming from :: tagmeta
    - oh even you bring up a really great point :: agree, tagconcern
    - i saw that you use student background information when you :: evidence, question, tagconcern
    - right so i think that you and student and student class did this you used class of student background knowledge when answering this question which is great :: ask, question, agree, tagconcern
    - good so student and student you both found specific information for the text so that is great :: evidence, search, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - so you got the answer and you use evidence from the text because it says it was a small machine :: tool, evidence
    - right so you again student using some evidence from the text which is great but :: evidence, question, agree, tagconcern
    - oh right okay so when we read that sentence that you immediately think okay good we need water to drink which is a great answer but what it goes on to say is that :: text, action, question, science, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - and i thought that was great response i noticed that you used student vocabulary :: text, agree, tagconcern
    - and you made it an amazing excellent well thought out response :: tagconcern
    - now you student built on student response :: tagconcern
    - so that is a great response :: agree
    - i'm noticing that you use the text to support student answer you used the two words scientific tool :: text, search, science, tag500, tagconcern
    - awesome so i'm noticing you said you were referred exactly to where in the text you found student answer you said in paragraph three :: text, search, tell, evidence, tagconcern
    - i noticed the it said that they used a microscope to find water and this is exactly what the question asks i really like how you referred back to the question to help support student answer :: tool, search, ask, question, science, tell, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - awesome so see you just improved student response by just looking back you read you read that sentence and you strengthen student response :: text, search, action, tagconcern
    - the tools the equipment she thought about the question and then by looking back in the text you did the same thing you looked in you found another thing that they use the how they discovered this water on the moon so by adding those key terms student answering the question what equipment :: space, tool, search, expand, ask, question, science, agree, tagmeta
    - awesome so you started with they found these creators of water and then you you referred back to the question you thought about student peers responses and you ended up adding the equipment that they used :: tool, search, ask, science, tagmeta
    - alright so i'm noticing that you really strengthen student response from the start to the end you really use that student thinking and you use the text to support you :: search, tag500, tagconcern
    - thank you so much for sharing student responses to me :: tagconcern
    - i want to particularly point out student and jazmin's responses you class did a really good job of highlighting the exact equipment that we use :: tool, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - naming the exact specific examples of equipment :: tool, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - i pointed out student and student both of you had done a really good job from the beginning :: agree, tagconcern
    - exactly but you did an awesome job backing up student answer i really liked that :: evidence, tagconcern
    - and student background knowledge is very beneficial and i love how you have that :: question, tagconcern
    - student i know that you were talking about class student knowledge :: tell, tagmeta
    - ok now i saw a lot of vocabulary that you class used in student responses and that's amazing :: text, agree, tagconcern
    - and you did a really good job with that :: agree, tagconcern
    - so using the tool that you used was really good to take equipment and look through the text and examine it right :: tool, search, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - so that's what you did :: question
    - you looked through and you tried to find the word that fitted :: text, search
    - it shows me that you understand what student reading and you understand the questions i'm asking you but you had a great start to student question to answer i mean :: ask, question, agree, learn, tagconcern
    - by nasa i don't think we had any oxygen tank so i love how you use student background knowledge to answer the questions :: space, ask, question, science, tagconcern
    - see the orbits the craters closer and you connected that to microscopes which is really good :: space, question, agree, tagconcern
    - we do use that in science student but :: tagconcern
    - that was actually really good :: agree, tagconcern
    - one thing i noticed was that you took the evidence from the text that scientists wanting to see things :: evidence, science
    - you connect to the fact that the waters were found on the moon is used for oxygen right :: space, search, science, agree, tagconcern
    - i love how student challenging student capacities to think about what truly makes water valuable and it really is valuable to get from the moon :: space, question, science, tagmeta
    - that's true i do love how you were challenging the question itself and i think that we there is reasons to support our evidence that water is valuable and i don't think that :: evidence, search, ask, question, science, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - just not a great connection :: agree
    - mm hmm so that is really good that you realize that that was from the article :: text, agree, tagconcern
    - you and people use their background knowledge because that tells me that student really thinking about what you already know but i do you really like that you :: question, tag500, tagmeta
    - right i really like that just like student i think you have a really good grasp on what student trying to say and i think you really understand the text :: question, tell, agree, learn, tagconcern
    - i really like that answer :: tagconcern
    - i like that you gave reason to why you think that um :: question, tag500
    - that is like a lot of really good evidence that you shared with me in student answer :: evidence, agree, tagconcern
    - which is one concern i have for you although that is a very good point that it's going to cost a lot of money and it might take a very long time for us to get there :: question, agree, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - that is what i like about student responses you took that specifically from the text you :: question, evidence, tagmeta
    - so you said water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore so like student i really liked this answer because they this is right from the text you took this information right from the text and that is a really important part of answering text specific questions :: space, evidence, ask, science, tell, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - great job so that's great job using student skills in the text using the context of the text to find student answer :: search, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - i think it was a really great response and you had you used student academic vocabulary and you used something that was stated directly from the text :: text, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - you did use an idea that was stated directly from the text
    - and student that answer was really great :: agree, tagconcern
    - yeah i so one thing that i noticed from student response i thought that student response was really well and you wrote it very well and you made the points very clear :: agree, tagconcern
    - that i think student answer is great and you did do a great job again i'm clarifying you know saying that :: tell, agree, tagconcern
    - that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks it's a clear point :: space, tool, science, tagconcern
    - and i'm glad that you went back into the text because we know for our answers we want to focus on two things using evidence :: evidence, tag400
    - i really like that you could find that specifically in the types that that tells me that you were reading very carefully and the fact that you remembered where it came from :: search, evidence, tagconcern
    - is very good that means you were paying attention yes good job :: agree
    - did have evidence and that you said why it would be a good thing :: evidence, question, tell, agree
    - i like that you did state students like student agreement or disagreement in this case you would did agree and then you did say why it would be a valuable resource because there's water on the moon and they could drink it so student answer you had a very good answer :: space, question, science, tell, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - i like that was very clarifying
    - i know that they found it and that's really awesome that you picked that up because i think that's a really great piece of information :: evidence, search, agree, tagconcern
    - and i like that you really pulled that from the text :: tagconcern
    - great so i love how that you took trying to pick tool and equipment we use those as cinnamon synonyms and found that answer that is a great job :: tool, search, question, agree, tag500
    - yep so the discover water on the moon is definitely important and it definitely was found in that first paragraph and i understand where you would get that answer :: space, text, search, science, agree, learn, tagmeta
    - i love that you had a really specific reference to the text talking about nasa and that they sent a small machine :: space, tool, tell, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagmeta
    - student student response was really awesome :: tagconcern
    - student student answer was really awesome :: tagconcern
    - i love how you talked about microscopes and that was really specific :: question, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - and you even described what a microscope does which it allows you to see something super up close which is what they talk about in the article :: text, tool, question, tell, tagmeta
    - great jobs and see you use you knew the important words in the question and then you looked at me and you saw my sweater is right so we want to use just the same ideas for that and work with the questions that we answered before :: text, ask, agree
    - yeah i understand i understand student confusion :: agree, learn, tagconcern
    - how i phrase it could have been confusing so next time i'll make sure that i more concisely explain that to you class :: expand, question, tag400, tag500, tagconcern
    - student that's a really great job because you look through the text and you found the equipment that's mentioned which is a lunar orbiter but you also notice that a microscope is mentioned but you realize that the microscope does not help them find water on the moon :: space, tool, search, question, science, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - class it's a really great job i really love you class are starting to use the text that you read previously :: action, agree, tagconcern
    - and that's great that you were able to gather that information out of the article :: text, evidence, agree
    - so that's great that you were able to point that out :: agree
    - it's a piece of equipment that was mentioned in the article :: text, tool, tag400
    - so a microscope is a type of equipment :: tool, tagconcern
    - that's a very good thing to point out :: agree
    - there's more than just those pieces of equipment that scientists have to use and the astronauts have to use to get to the moon :: space, tool, expand, science, tagconcern
    - student right that is a scientific tool that we use during science to see things closely :: science, agree, tagconcern
    - so that would make sense :: agree
    - and some of student science classes maybe :: tagconcern
    - so if you use one before
    - right so student kind of using student prior knowledge and experience to come up with that answer which is great :: question, agree, learn, evidence, tagconcern
    - so they did use a microscope and night you found that right from the evidence :: tool, search, evidence, agree, tagconcern
    - good to look really closely :: search, agree, tagconcern
    - so i like how in student answer :: question, tagconcern
    - student you were specific and you said that they found the water in the craters of the moon :: space, search, science, tell, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - right and that's a great answer because i see you got student information right from the article inch paragraph for that water is heavy :: text, evidence, science, agree, tagconcern
    - and it takes up a lot of space
    - you have put the steps together very well in student brain :: tagconcern
    - they need things to even be in space
    - that is very very very good :: agree
    - student and i what i like about that is if i didn't know anything about this topic of finding water on the moon and i had never read this passage i could learn how the astronauts discovered water on the moon from student answer :: space, text, search, action, question, science, learn, tagmeta
    - i like that you expanded student thinking :: tag500, tagconcern
    - student what i really like what you just did there was that you started with an idea and then you came up with some of student own thoughts student own thought of maybe if they didn't have to carry heavy water they could carry other things as well :: question, science, tagconcern
    - and i see how we've made the link between using the water to make hydrogen fuel and oxygen into something that the astronauts use very good :: space, question, science, agree, tagconcern
- intent: r400
  examples: |
    - but we didn't exactly answer the question about equipment what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon :: space, tool, search, ask, question, science, evidence, tagmeta
    - but i'm a little concerned that you did not connect the question to the text so looking back at the question what's the question that we're looking for can you tell me that are you able to tell me what the question is :: search, ask, question
    - yes so the water they found you would use a microscope to study it but it doesn't explain how they found the water :: tool, search, question, science, agree, learn, tag400, tagconcern
    - however i think that this point doesn't answer directly the main question this is the next step after they discovered water for the moon hey this is part of the equipment that they discovered what are the one :: space, tool, search, ask, question, science, tag500
    - you are correct with you need a microscope to look at it really closely but they're asking what equipment do the scientists use to discover it :: tool, search, ask, question, science, agree, tagconcern
    - you are correct with you need a microscope to look at it really closely but they're asking what equipment do the scientists use to discover it the microscope is equipment that they looked really closely at the water with but did they discover the water with the microscope :: tool, search, ask, question, science, agree, tagconcern
    - alright student so when we look back at the question it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon while it may be true that scientists do use oxygen tanks and probably very often it's not the equipment that they use to find water on the moon :: space, tool, search, ask, question, science, agree, tagmeta
    - it's not the specific tool used to get to the water to get those samples that's what the question was asking :: ask, question, science, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - because we were asking about equipment not what they found :: tool, search, ask, question, tagmeta
    - they do but that's not what the that's not what the question is what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon it said that those things are not what they used to discover water on the moon it was the lunar orbiter :: space, tool, search, ask, question, science, tell
    - the question is actually wanting to know what equipment they used to discover water on the moon :: space, tool, search, ask, question, science
    - yeah absolutely it's kind of part of the moon so it is something that caught the water but it doesn't quite answer a question about it being a piece of equipment that the scientists are using :: space, tool, ask, science, agree, evidence, tagmeta
    - but for this specific question it wants to know what specifically they used to find that water and that wouldn't necessarily be like oxygen tanks and things like that :: space, search, ask, question, science, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - however having that knowledge does help you with this overall topic but it's not specific to that question if that makes sense :: ask, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - to help you understand this question this question specifically is asking what what equipment they use to discover the water yes they do use that equipment to help them discover the water but that is not the actual equipment that is discovering the water :: tool, search, ask, question, science, agree, learn, evidence, tagconcern
    - so that's what they found but we were looking for what equipment that they used to discover that on the moon :: space, tool, search, question
    - so while oxygen tank and a mask and suits are part of the equipment they use for this question we're only focusing on what they use to discover water on the moon :: space, tool, search, ask, question, science, tagconcern
    - the question asked for you to talk about the equipment :: tool, ask, tell, tagmeta
    - what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon oxygen tanks are pieces of equipment but they don't really go with the water on the moon :: space, tool, search, question, science, tagconcern
    - but in the question we want to focus on the equipment they use to discover that water :: tool, search, ask, science, tag400
    - and i'm concerned though that the question is asking specifically for how the water was found :: search, ask, question, science, evidence
    - so i want you to reread the question because i don't think you fully understood what the question was asking because student answer didn't have anything to do with equipment it just said that water was found on the moon :: space, tool, search, action, ask, question, science, tell, tagconcern
    - that is true that is where they discovered the water but the question was the equipment that they used :: tool, search, ask, science, agree
    - because we are looking for the specific word of the equipment that they use :: text, tool, search, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - microscope is used to discover water but the article is thinking more in general of what equipment would be used along with the microscope :: text, tool, search, expand, question, science, tag500, tagconcern
    - we're talking about the equipment so you did name where we found it but the question is more focused on the equipment :: tool, search, expand, ask, tell, tagmeta
    - the question though it did ask us it said what equipment did scientists use and student talking to me about astronauts :: tool, ask, question, science, tell, tagmeta
    - i'm concerned that the question is asking for what was used to discover water right and we've only mentioned the tool that's used to see it once you have discovered it :: search, ask, question, science, agree, tag400
    - the question is not based on the videos that you watched or the youtube videos you watch it's about what you read :: action, ask, question, tagmeta
    - there are class different types of tools like equipment gear class those other things but for right now the question is asking for the ones that will help us find the water :: tool, search, ask, science, agree, disagree, tagconcern
    - but yes student you are correct that those are class different types of equipment that astronauts use but for this particular question it was the equipment that they used to discover water :: tool, search, ask, science, agree, disagree, tagconcern
    - but i'm just concerned that you are understanding the full question itself because the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon :: space, tool, search, ask, question, science, learn
    - the question is actually asking what did they use to discover water on the moon and while they use so much equipment up on the moon we need to focus on what was used to discover water specifically :: space, tool, search, ask, question, science, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - they weren't really thinking about what they use to actually get to space so yes student right they did use the oxygen tanks and things like that because there is no oxygen in space but they were focusing more on the water piece versus what they use to get to space :: space, expand, question, science, agree, disagree, tag500, tagmeta
    - student i'm not sure that maybe you understood the question correctly you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely well you do need a microscope to look really closely but this question is we're looking for the name of the piece of equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon :: space, tool, search, ask, science, tagconcern
    - but right now we're looking for the actual piece of equipment that was used to discover water on the moon :: space, tool, search, science, agree
    - right and again like he said you know that's one way to look at it but the question is actually specifically pointing toward what's the potential value :: search, ask, question, tell, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - you read it as is water on the moon valuable right now but the question actually says could it be valuable at some point in the future :: space, action, ask, science, agree, tagconcern
    - a concern that i have with you class is that we want to make sure that we're really focusing on the equipment that is used by scientists to find water on the moon :: space, tool, search, science, tag400, tagconcern
    - yeah that is correct but that's what they wear we're looking at what they used to find the water :: search, question, science, agree, tagconcern
    - i am concerned though that the question is asking why you would want water on the moon :: space, ask, question, science
    - really what we're looking for is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable :: space, search, evidence, question, science, tagconcern
    - i'm concerned though that the question is asking specifically about water :: ask, science, evidence, tagmeta
    - so student definitely right about how nasa uses so much equipment to do so many different things but the question is only asking for one specific machine or equipment that they used to find the water :: space, tool, search, ask, question, science, agree, disagree, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - that is true and it's basically just what i told student that the scientists do use a lot of equipment so much equipment for so many different things but the question is only asking for one specific piece of equipment that was used to find the water :: tool, search, ask, question, science, tell, agree, disagree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - but when we look back at the question it's only asking specifically what machine they used to find the water not class the other machines :: tool, search, ask, question, science, evidence
    - so student with student question you tell me about a tool which was great you told me about a tool that's used to look at the water but we're not looking at the water really closely we are trying to find the water :: search, ask, question, science, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - okay you need to be more specific in student answer what small machine what was it called :: tool, expand, question, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - okay and in student answer you said that student need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and yeah you would need a microscope to look really closely closely but does student answer tell what discovered the water :: tool, search, question, science, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - you should be able to pull student answer right from the text so a small machine is great but there's more specific information in there that could give a more specific answer :: evidence, tool, search, expand, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - so class those facts are right that you class had but they're wanting a little more specific answer okay :: expand, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - so i think the one that stands out to me the most is going to be you student i noticed that student response didn't tell me anything about what went on in the text :: question, tagmeta
    - but for this one answer wasn't quite there is because we needed to focus more on that equipment than what the equipment was finding :: tool, search, expand, question, tag400, tagconcern
    - but it's still wrong and it doesn't really tell us what the question is trying to get at we want to know about this equipment so we have to make sure we talk about the equipment specifically :: tool, ask, question, tell, disagree, evidence, tagmeta
    - yes yes they do they absolutely do but i think that answer might leave out some important parts of the story :: text, agree
    - something that's right on the cusp of being just what i'm looking for in this case student was a little too vague :: search, question, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - but i think it was wanting to be a little bit more specific and getting a little bit more detail from the reading about the microscope and lunar orbiter so student on the correct track student we just need to push it a little bit more into detail :: space, tool, expand, agree, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - student you said that nasa sent a small machine right they did send a small machine but what i'm looking for is what is also the name of that small machine :: space, tool, search, question, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - mr student did you consider that those machines were not mentioned in our text :: tag400, tagconcern
    - however when we're given a text we do have to look at what it talks about in the text i know that you answered saying that they used equipment like oxygen tanks but that was not mentioned in the text :: space, tool, search, question, science, tell, tag400, tagmeta
    - student answer is about how the kind of water that they found was microscopic but it doesn't really say how they got the water :: search, question, science, tell, evidence, tagmeta
    - what student and student described is how they got to the moon and not what they used to discover water on the moon :: space, search, question, science, tagconcern
    - well i'm glad you know class about space but we're looking for specific information from the text that we have :: evidence, search, tag400, tagmeta
    - class right well then if you think student good let's look at student response first let's see our water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that is very true but i'm concerned that student not giving me a reason to as why it could be valuable on the moon :: space, search, question, science, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - they did send a small machine to discover water on the moon but what was the name we're looking for more detail what was the name of the small machine :: space, tool, search, expand, question, science, evidence
    - right nasa sent a small machine but you need more detail yes they did send a small machine but what was the name of this small machine :: space, tool, expand, question, agree, evidence
    - the thing that troubles me with student answer is that you said the same as student which shows me that student either looking at farrah's paper or you didn't have student own idea :: search, question, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - wow that's very possible and student you did find some good information because water can be very heavy that is true but we're looking for convincing evidence that it could be valuable :: evidence, search, science, agree, tagconcern
    - so they do use a lot of things but you didn't look for the specific equipment that the scientists used to discover the water :: tool, search, science, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - yeah so i mean you do have a point there that they used other things too but i was just looking for a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon :: space, tool, search, science, agree, tagconcern
    - but i'm a little confused on how the oxygen tank helped them discover the water on the moon because to me they needed the oxygen tanks to get to space and to be able to survive in space i don't see how oxygen tanks discovered the water :: space, search, question, science, tagconcern
    - the point of the oxygen tank is to supply oxygen to the astronauts i don't think the intention is for it to discover water :: space, search, science, tagconcern
    - so i would say that student answer was just a little bit incomplete it was lacking just a small detail on what specific machine they sent :: tool, question, tell, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - student over there said oxygen tanks now that is equipment and it did help them you know get to the moon to discover the water but he needed to be a little bit more specific on the actual equipment that discovered the water :: space, tool, search, expand, science, tell, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - and student answer said they sent a small machine which is true it's a little bit more detailed than luis's we just need that extra bit of i guess what specific machine :: tool, expand, question, tell, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - so back to you studentand student the microscope helps them look closer at the water but the microscope itself didn't actually discover the water :: tool, search, science, tagconcern
    - well so even though you know a lot about space and you know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and microscopes and things like that it's really cool but you have kind of missed the answer about what equipment we need to discover the water on the moon :: space, tool, search, question, science, agree, evidence, tagmeta
    - student answer doesn't really encompass how water on the moon might be valuable :: space, question, science, tagconcern
    - my concern is that you want it to be right now and student not thinking about the future :: agree, tag500, tag400, tagmeta
    - because if you just put lunar orbiter we're not going to know what question you are answering :: space, ask, question
    - because if we just put down lunar orbiter they're not going to know what we're talking about :: space, question, tell, tagmeta
    - well that wasn't an answer because in our text it didn't talk about that :: tell, tagmeta
    - but student answer is you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely it doesn't answer the question exactly about what equipment the scientists used to discover water on the moon :: space, tool, search, ask, question, science, evidence, tagmeta
    - so although it's really great that you have a lot of background knowledge we have to look at the the paragraph to answer our question :: text, search, ask, agree, tagconcern
    - student answer is pretty solid as far as a comprehension of space but as far as discovering water oxygen tanks don't really have anything to do with that :: space, search, science, tag500, tagconcern
    - i'm concerned because oxygen tanks did not help the scientists find water :: space, search, science, tagconcern
    - okay you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that is a tool that they use but the question asked about discovering water on the moon :: space, tool, search, ask, science, agree, tagmeta
    - but since they sent a small machine i don't know that we would have needed the equipment for actual people like oxygen things to check that out :: tool, science, tagconcern
    - i definitely think that those pieces of equipment could be important but i think that we're looking for a little bit more specific piece of equipment that helped us discover water :: tool, search, expand, science, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - mr student talks about how they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in our texts but it doesn't say anything about oxygen tanks do they do use them yes but not in this text :: space, tool, question, science, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - but the microscope cannot exactly go up to an object and find something you have to put the object you want to look at under the microscope :: tool, search, evidence, tagconcern
    - but student answer doesn't reflect on our text and the main point here is that we're trying to find in the text what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon :: space, tool, search, question, science, tag500, tagconcern
    - you didn't mention what type of machine you just wrote a small machine and that's not very specific :: tool, question, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - and as i talked to student she said microscope which was mentioned in the passage but for you my concern is that you didn't have really student own answer you just said that students was the same as student :: text, tool, question, tell, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - one part you were missing though is what they were looking at :: search, question
    - but just some common mistakes i think are that some people just didn't use specific words from the text :: text, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - but i want to hear more specific answers like what kind of small machine that they sent we need to be able to understand what small machine it was because it tells you what small machine it is in the reading :: tool, expand, question, learn, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - student i want you to be able to come up with student own answer in student own words :: text, tagconcern
    - i didn't really see that you understood the reading well because student answer was i circled the same as student :: agree, tagconcern
    - but you didn't take that extra step to look for the small machine's name :: tool, search, tag500, tagconcern
    - i love how you worked together with her and i think it's great to work with student classmates in class but for student answer i want to hear what you have to say :: question, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - and i don't think that that answer was based on evidence from the text but i think it was based on student background knowledge which is great to use when answering questions but not for this specific question :: evidence, ask, question, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - the water is heavy and it does take up room on the spaceship but you didn't relate it back to the question of how that would be valuable :: space, ask, question, science, tag500
    - okay yeah let's go back into student answer you had said that nasa send a small machine this is not incorrect they did send a small machine however in the text it provided the actual name of what that machine was so i'd like to see a bit more specific detail to know exactly what that small machine was :: space, tool, expand, question, tell, agree, disagree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - but we need to highlight the equipment that they used :: tool, action, tagconcern
    - we need to be able to know the equipment that we use to find the water first before we analyze it :: tool, search, science, tag500
    - that is a really good answer so remember our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and so you said you need a microscope to look really closely but one thing that student answer is missing is kind of a connection to that question :: space, tool, search, ask, question, science, tell, agree, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - but you just one concern that i have is that if i was just reading student response and i had no other context i would say well what can't we do for a long time :: question, tell, disagree, tag400, tagconcern
    - so one concern i have about student response is that i was just reading student response and i wouldn't necessarily know what the question was asking from student answer :: ask, question, tag400, tagmeta
    - and similar to the feedback i was just giving student i just don't get how student answer realtes to the question right like how does student answer show why it's valuable to get water from the moon :: space, ask, question, science, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - student answer wasn't necessarily answering what the question was asking :: ask, question, tagconcern
    - i just wanted to see where you found it i wanted to have like specific textual evidence in student answer i know you found it in the text but i wanted you to point it out in student answer so the rest of the class knows where to look :: search, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - and then student student response says that they found craters full of water but you didn't really answer the question of what equipment they use to find the craters :: space, tool, search, ask, question, science, tagconcern
    - okay so student student answer didn't really say whether or not you agreed that there is enough evidence you just stated evidence :: evidence, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - student answer could have gone either way you could have said no water splits into this and it wouldn't be a good resource or yes because it does split this and that if you do read on student answer is leaning more towards the positive so i assumed that you were agreeing but i don't want to have to assume :: expand, action, science, tell, agree, disagree, tagconcern
    - just like student he didn't really state if it would be a good thing so i had to assume that the answer was a positive that you did agree :: agree, tagconcern
    - perfect perfect that's great and then so student you said you circled the same as student but i think we want to go deeper into that and i want you to have student own answer :: tell, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - but someone who didn't read this text might not know what a small machine is :: tool, action, question, tagconcern
    - i'm concerned about the way that you worded student answer student so the way that you worded student answer didn't really restate the question :: ask, tag500, tagmeta
    - i am concerned because you didn't really rephrase anything you just said i circled the same as student's that doesn't help me know if you understand the question or the answer :: ask, tell, agree, learn, tagconcern
    - so i'm a little bit concerned that you didn't use a lot of detail :: evidence
    - my concern is you didn't include any equipment in student answer :: tool, expand, tag400, tagconcern
    - yes and so equipment is an important word in the question but you didn't include any equipment in student answer :: text, tool, expand, ask, agree, tagconcern
    - right so you need a microscope to look at the microscopic particles because it's so small but that wasn't necessarily the tool that they used to send to the moon :: space, tool, search, science, agree, tagconcern
    - right so you have the answer small machine my concern is is that there's a name for that small machine that you didn't mention :: tool, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - if you provided that information that you just told me student which is great background knowledge the person who's reading this won't know where you got that information from because it doesn't apply to this question :: evidence, ask, question, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - when we provide information from our own background knowledge the issue is that we don't really have concrete evidence of where you got that information :: evidence, question, tagconcern
    - so even though i might know that you visited nasa if somebody else was reading student response and they didn't know that they might wonder where you got that information from :: space, evidence, expand, tagconcern
    - the person who's reading student response won't know where you got that information :: evidence, question, tagconcern
    - for example i know that you went to nasa because student talked about it however maybe student doesn't know that so if he was reading student response he may question where you got that evidence and if it's truly valid :: space, evidence, ask, tag500, tagmeta
    - absolutely that is correct if there were astronauts there they would need oxygen but the oxygen tanks wouldn't be a tool to discover the water :: space, search, science, agree, tagconcern
    - but the text doesn't say that they sent any astronauts to the moon to find the water :: space, search, science, tell
    - student nasa did send a small machine but you if you read on in that sentence there's a name for that small machine that you didn't use in student answer :: space, text, tool, action, tagconcern
    - so you identify why water is valuable but one thing that i'm concerned about is that student answer isn't specific to just the moon and we're really thinking about why is it such a big deal that water's on the moon :: space, question, science, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagmeta
    - what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon you class found the equipment that they would use to look at what they discovered right but it feels like we skipped the discover step somewhere in there :: space, tool, search, question, science, agree, tagconcern
    - yeah i'm worried that the response doesn't actually answer the question :: ask, agree, tagconcern
    - but right now we're focusing on what we found in the text :: search, question, agree
    - i do not see any paragraph related to the oxygen tanks so even though that's really interesting we need to find our answer in the text :: space, text, search, science, tell, tag500, tagconcern
    - you did student so close you told me what the machine is and you actually circled the evidence correctly and you gave me the answer however you didn't tell me the name of the machine :: tool, evidence, question, tell, tagconcern
    - you actually did an excellent job catching that nasa sent a small machine however you just didn't identify what the small machine was called :: space, tool, question, tagconcern
    - but you didn't go back to the reading and tell me what the actual machine was called :: tool, question
    - but we wanted to use the text and not our background knowledge
    - they do but this is asking us specifically from our reading not from what we know from other places :: ask, question, evidence
    - i'm concerned that student response doesn't include class of the benefits that water could provide to the astronauts :: expand, science, tagconcern
    - but my concern is that we still don't know the machine's name and how it assisted in the discovery :: tool, question, tag400, tagconcern
    - because we're gonna make sure our answer touches not only discover water and moon but also equipment and my concern is student answer might not including the equipment component :: space, tool, search, expand, science, tag400, tagconcern
    - i'm concerned you looked at farrah's answer and i don't think that's the case but i want to make sure student doing student own thinking :: evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - so student totally right about that but i want to just go back to the question because i'm concerned that student answer doesn't totally answer the question :: ask, agree, tagmeta
    - and one thing that i'm concerned about is that maybe student response doesn't exactly answer the question :: ask, evidence, tagmeta
    - and i'm concerned that the responses that you class chose which is a microscope isn't necessarily used to discover water on the moon :: space, tool, search, question, science, tagconcern
    - now you talked in student response about scientists finding craters on the moon which is absolutely correct but i am concerned that student answer doesn't completely align with what the question is asking :: space, search, ask, question, science, agree, tagmeta
    - but our answer has to use evidence from the text sure they might use that other equipment but in the text it didn't have anything about that :: tool, evidence, tagmeta
    - right you need to be a little more specific so that they understand what student talking about because i was looking at it and you said small machine and i might think student talking about the microscope because the microscope isn't big it's small :: tool, search, expand, question, tell, agree, learn, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - but you didn't specify exactly what that machine was called :: tool, question, evidence, tag400
    - so i'm concerned student that you took student answer only from the first paragraph but there's more information about how much water there is on the moon later in the article :: space, text, evidence, expand, question, science, tagmeta
    - i think student raising a good point that they might have needed to use something like a microscope but we don't know for sure because it doesn't say that the scientists definitely used a microscope :: tool, science, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - and with that student let's look at student student you mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks but like we just talked about with student that oxygen tanks weren't exactly in our story so i'm concerned why student talking about things not in our story :: space, text, tool, search, question, science, tell, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - well like we just talked about with student there's not a lot of water on the moon so i'm a little concerned that student saying that astronauts don't need to take it on their ships anymore do you think they may still need to take some water with them :: space, science, tell, tag500, tagmeta
    - they would have to use a combination of class those things but this article is mainly about the lunar orbiter that they use and what we can do with the water once they found it :: space, text, search, question, science, tagmeta
    - but they didn't say full of water you didn't really read and do student underlining and highlighting :: action, science, tell, tagconcern
    - a piece of equipment but in the text it didn't really mention that the microscope helped discover water on the moon :: space, tool, search, science, tag400, tagconcern
    - but specifically this paragraph addresses just a small part of that process and that is actually investigating the craters on the moon so that is right student they do need a lot of equipment to get there you know a lot of equiwe're looking for what's actually mentioned in the text like the microscope or the lunar orbiter pment to land and they need equipment to examine the craters but this article that we have here is examining just one little part of that whole process :: space, text, tool, search, question, agree, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - but in student answer i also would have liked to see you mention the lunar orbiter because that was the big idea of the text that we read and that was the most important piece for specifically finding water on the moon :: space, search, action, science, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - you said that scientists use a lot of equipment which is good you you talked about how they use equipment but you said that they use oxygen tanks and oxygen tanks were not mentioned in the text :: space, tool, question, science, tell, agree, tag400, tagmeta
    - and student you said that the scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks so oxygen tanks weren't mentioned in the passage :: space, text, tool, science, tell, tag400, tagconcern
    - but the question is what small machine discovered the water so if we look back at the reading the microscope is what they use to view the water not what found it :: tool, search, ask, question, science, tagconcern
    - but the microscope was to look at the water that was already discovered :: tool, search, science, tagconcern
    - you use those but i don't think they use those to necessarily find the water :: search, science
    - they did use that because we can not breathe the air on the moon so we did use that student student totally right about that one however they needed to use a specific equipment to really really find water because it was very very hard to find :: space, tool, search, science, agree, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - the text said the water was microscopic but they never said they need to use a microscope :: tool, science, tell, tagconcern
    - okay so let's start with you student so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks on the moon so i in the article i don't recall them saying that they use oxygen tanks however i know that astronauts do use oxygen tanks :: space, text, tool, science, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - this phrase in general what you wrote was not used they didn't talk about that in the in the passage :: text, question, tell, tagmeta
    - lunar orbiter is a really great piece of equipment that you mentioned however i also want to make sure that we know that glass is not so much equipment as it is just something that's mentioned as an object :: space, tool, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - but if we look at the article right it doesn't mention oxygen tanks :: space, text, search, science, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - so even though we know that they use things like oxygen tanks that's not specifically in the reading :: space, science, evidence, tagconcern
    - i see that you understand a little about what a microscope is but i'm a little concerned that while the microscope is a tool it didn't really discover the water on the moon :: space, tool, search, question, science, learn, tagmeta
    - you know there's actually very little water really on the moon :: space, science, tagconcern
    - i'm wondering if there might be some equipment that we missed in that text :: tool, tagconcern
    - but my concern though is is that maybe the way the form that the water is in on the moon is a little different than the way that we see perhaps a lake full of water here on earth :: space, science, disagree, tag400, tagconcern
    - i don't think the text said they found a big amount of just water but they found various little small things that you cannot even see with the human eye :: search, science, tell, tagconcern
    - that means that it was really really small that you would need a microscope to see it it doesn't really tell us that specific line what the tool was called that discovered the water :: tool, search, question, science, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - that particular tool though is not what found that microscopic water :: search, question, science
    - so hearing what you wrote i think you you got the words microscopic and lunar orbiter mixed up from the text :: space, text, question, science, tagconcern
    - you know i i'm glad you caught the tool component but i'm a little bit concerned that you think they would have the microscope with them i think they're saying they wouldn't need it :: tool, tell, tagconcern
    - that there's water on the moon but he only found very miniscule amounts of water and they did student right they did find that in the craters on the dark side of the moon the part of the moon that doesn't see the sun right but it wasn't lots of water it wasn't like the kind of water you go swimming in it would it would be something that you view with a microscope :: space, tool, search, science, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - but one thing that i'm concerned about a bit is that i don't remember oxygen tanks being talked about in the passage :: space, text, science, tag500, tagmeta
    - okay i'm gonna have to look further after but i'm in the paragraph it doesn't say was filled it just said that it was found in the craters so just to make sure you understand it wasn't like filled to the top it was just at the bottom they found some water and some of them so that's how they found out there that there was water on the moon :: space, text, search, expand, question, science, tell, agree, learn, tagconcern
    - i'm concerned though that there is evidence in paragraph four :: text, evidence, tagconcern
    - one of the a concern that i have is when student reading nonfiction often they'll give you a little bit of information in the beginning and then they'll keep elaborating on it later in the article that will give you a fuller picture of what they're talking about :: text, evidence, question, tell, tag400, tagmeta
    - so by saying the name of the machine instead of saying a small machine you allow whoever reads that response to know exactly what student talking about so please add in the name of the machine to student response :: tool, expand, question, tell, evidence, tagmeta
    - as far as what type of equipment scientists used to discover the water on the moon it has a specific name so it's always very important to read everything in the question and text before answering the question :: space, tool, search, action, ask, question, science, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - a question relates to the passage so when it says equipment in the question what we want to do is to find the equipment that was mentioned in the passage :: text, tool, search, ask, question, tag400, tagconcern
    - so next time how about we try we'll start with either a strong either yes or no and then like you did just now will back it up with some evidence does that sound good :: evidence, question, agree, disagree, tag500, tagmeta
    - so the next time student answering student question what's something you can do when student answering besides just saying no :: ask, question, tell, disagree, tag500, tagconcern
    - okay okay so when student answering so next time when we have questions make sure student answering class parts of the question and as much detail as you can :: ask, question, agree, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - you explained to me that it was a piece of equipment and what it does but i wanted you to tell me how it was used to find water on the moon :: space, tool, search, question, science, tag400
    - try to add a little more background knowledge to student answer so you could say why the water on the moon is important and how it can help :: space, expand, question, science, tell, tagconcern
    - so yeah just maybe next time just try think of a reason why the thing that they found is important :: search, question, agree, tag500
    - i mean i as i said last time adding an extra sentence to it can only help it sometimes and never make it worse :: text, tell, tagconcern
    - it was right but i wish you had a little bit more information like what was the small machine that they used :: evidence, tool, expand, question, agree
    - i wish student answers had a little bit more detail :: expand, evidence, tagconcern
    - but i also think maybe next time and student responses you could give us a little bit more of a personalized approach to student response so maybe what you found from the text along with what you thought about it does that sound good :: search, expand, question, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - but like i said to her maybe personalize it a little bit add student own views sound good :: expand, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - thank you so student like we were saying i think you had a really good response just maybe go the next step read a little bit further and then add to student answer before you respond okay :: expand, action, tell, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - student answer is not necessarily wrong i just think we could expand on it further so if you could look back in the text and see exactly where you have student answer so in paragraph two is there any more knowledge that you can add to student answer now :: text, search, expand, disagree, evidence, tagconcern
    - adding more information would make student answer a little bit more what's the word i'm looking for specific and a little bit more on task :: text, evidence, search, expand, question, tag400, tagconcern
    - you just needed to go a little further to name the machine they use or the equipment they use :: tool, expand
    - you just needed to go a little further to name the machine they use but so far so good :: tool, expand, agree
    - student you realized that student had a good answer and you agreed with her but next time i would like you to either add on to something she says based on the text or you can make up student own answer so student adding on to the discussion or adding student own opinion to it :: expand, talk, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - for next time i would just like you to add on so you see how she said they use a microscope to look closer at the water you could have added on to say if you saw another equipment in the text or if you disagree or anything just add on to the discussion so we're not class saying the same things :: tool, search, expand, talk, question, science, tell, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - my suggestion would be to look at the passage the paragraph before it where it stated the the equipment they use to find the water in the first place before they could even look into it with the microscope they use something else to find the water so my suggestion would be to add that and then revise student response :: text, tool, search, expand, science, tag500, tagconcern
    - it actually wasn't wrong and i see where you answered student question i just wanted you to be a little more specific of what the equipment was called so you had a good start and you were almost there you just needed to name the equipment so you you were on the right track :: tool, expand, ask, question, agree, disagree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - yes that is correct so you just needed you were on the right track you just needed to name the object so for next time when student given a response make sure student as specific as possible but you had a great start :: question, agree, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - i just want you to look into it and find the evidence to support student answer :: search, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - exactly great observation and another thing is if anything you can always use direct evidence from the text to answer student question as long as you use the quotation mark for the evidence but good job yeah exactly :: evidence, expand, ask, agree, tagconcern
    - okay so one thing is we need to make sure that we are answering the question fully so the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon so what you want to say in student response is you want to say scientists discovered water on the moon by using blank equipment :: space, tool, search, ask, question, science, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - we want to be using that good language and good vocabulary that we're learning from the text :: text, agree, learn
    - you want to make sure that it's class about being specific you want to use good examples from the text so i want you to go back and reread and be more specific because we want specific answers :: expand, action, agree, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - so i would love if you go back reread the question and then go to the passage and come up with student own answer because i want to know student own ideas and thoughts for the answer :: text, action, ask, tagconcern
    - so going back to what student said again student if you want to try to finish student statement because student on the right track that the lunar orbiter is a small machine but what does it do to answer the question in context :: space, tool, ask, question, tell, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - just make sure when student writing answers like this you need to be very clear about the what and the why so you had part of the what you just needed the second piece :: question, tagmeta
    - it's just we need more specifics right so when we're answering questions like this you need to have the specifics you don't necessarily have to take the whole paragraph you read :: text, expand, action, ask, question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - but we need to be a little more detailed :: expand
    - so do you class see anything that could support student answers from the text :: search, tag500, tagconcern
    - we want to really reference the text just so that we show that we found our evidence in the text you know :: search, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - i think it's important that when you say something you know you have evidence to back it up so in case somebody asked oh how do you know that how do you know this is true you can say oh i found it in this source or you can say you can quote the text :: search, evidence, question, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - so would class maybe like to revise their answer and maybe just include a piece of evidence in there or a specific word :: text, evidence, expand, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - so now that we now that we know that that that the expectation is maybe using more specific language student would you maybe like to revise student answer using one of the words that we just discussed or one of the phrases that we just discussed :: text, expand, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - but what we want to do is we want to make sure that that student using terms that are in the reading like just just like the ones that we just talked about like microscope like orbiter things like that so we want to make sure student using the most strong vocabulary you can from the reading :: space, text, tool, question, tagmeta
    - so i'm going to show you my example sentence right here this is how if it were me i would start this sentence but keep in mind there's a million ways to start the sentence i would say to discover water on the moon the scientist used blank :: space, text, search, question, science, tell, agree, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - and you look you can find at least two more tools that you can pull out and use in student response student need a scientific tool called a microscope student also need blank and student also need blank :: tool, search, expand, science, tagconcern
    - now i'm sure you did circle the same as student but i want you to come up with student own words and student own answers :: text, action, agree, tagconcern
    - what types of equipment did you see in the reading so again the example sentence might help you :: text, tool, question, evidence, tag500
    - perfect now can you add that to student whole sentence and make a whole new sentence for me :: text, expand, tagconcern
    - you said that nasa sent a small machine that's perfect nasa did send a small machine but i want you to add more i want you to build on that now you went back and you highlighted the lunar orbiter as one did you highlight a second one :: space, tool, expand, action, tell, tagconcern
    - perfect can you rebuild student sentence for me in a way that explains both of them :: text, tagconcern
    - my only suggestion for you like student answer was almost perfect is just to put the name of the small machine that's it that's my only issue otherwise student answer is perfect :: tool, tagconcern
    - well i'm so glad that you worked with student classmates and i think it's really important to work with student classmates but when answering student question on student own paper i really would love if you could explain student answer rather than say you didn't listen to someone else :: expand, ask, question, tell, tag400, tagconcern
    - and the only only recommendation i have for student answer because it's almost there is to just name the small machine that they used that's it to make student answer perfect :: tool, tagconcern
    - okay great so next time when student doing this maybe explain what the microscope was used for :: tool, question, agree, tag400, tag500, tagconcern
    - and maybe add what the machine was called :: tool, expand, question
    - to answer the question fully you would need to describe the exact small machine that found the water :: tool, search, ask, science, evidence, tag400
    - i think you should be looking at the text and pulling evidence for a specific sentence that relates to explaining why water is valuable :: text, search, evidence, question, science, tag400, tagconcern
    - you said it would be too heavy to carry the water but then student response should have something about why the water not being carried would be a good thing so just elaborate a little bit off of that :: expand, question, science, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - so make sure to relate our answer back to the question that's being asked :: ask, tag500
    - but maybe we could elaborate on why they use this tool what does this tool help them with :: expand, question, tagconcern
    - so referring to the water on the moon text can you kind of elaborate on that response can you tell me why you need a microscope :: space, tool, expand, question, science, evidence, tagconcern
    - student and student i'd like to hear more concrete examples of what kind of equipment they use :: tool, expand, question, evidence, tagconcern
    - sure so that that is a correct answer a small machine i guess i'm just looking for you to be more specific :: tool, search, expand, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - ok so sometimes if we just include the quote we also want to include our own thoughts to make the quote expand our thoughts with the quote so it's kind of two pieces you need is student own thoughts and the author's thoughts or the writer's thoughts :: expand, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - so the more details we add can make our answer better :: expand, evidence
    - so maybe you already knew that piece of information but you can find another piece of information from the text so right now we're focusing on stuff you can find from the text and we always want to do that first and if you have more information to add that's great you can add that later but we really want to focus on what we're reading :: evidence, search, expand, question, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - so what you did was you answered the question but we need more tools too maybe think further on our answers :: expand, ask, question
    - but maybe we can use another tool like rereading through class of the text right and then if we reread through the text we can find a little bit more details and maybe even more of the tools that came up within the article :: text, search, expand, action, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - so that would have helped out student answer and made it a little bit more specific so student not wrong it is a small machine but just to add a little bit more detail and clarification so it's nice and clear :: tool, expand, disagree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - so even though you do have student background knowledge that we activated and even though you know that they use a lot of different tools maybe we could just look through the article to find what they specifically used :: text, search, question, disagree, evidence, tagconcern
    - to answer the actual question which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon we just need to go in a little bit more detail and make sure that we're rereading the text to answer the question :: space, tool, search, expand, ask, question, science, evidence
    - but we just need to beef up student answer a little bit and use a little bit more academic vocabulary :: text, expand, tag500, tagconcern
    - you might want to add that into student answer as well to be very concrete and make sure student using class student resources from the passage :: text, expand, tagconcern
    - great so incorporating that information in student answer really shows me that you understand the reading so i think that would be a great detail to add in student answers :: evidence, expand, agree, learn, tagconcern
    - but if you can put that sentence into student own words that shows me that you understand :: text, learn, tagconcern
    - it's really small so saying that in student answer shows me that you understand what a microscope is and that you know that the water on the moon is really small and that you got class that information from reading the passage :: space, text, evidence, tool, question, science, tell, learn, tagconcern
    - exactly put it in student own words to show that you understand that's perfect :: text, learn, evidence, tagconcern
    - so so basically the words that student classmates have been using and what you already know from going to nasa those are some of the words i want to hear in student answer :: space, text, question, tagconcern
    - so next time when we're giving our answers to these questions we want to make sure that we're including details like the name of the small machine that nasa sent but student absolutely right :: space, tool, expand, ask, question, agree, evidence, tag500, tagmeta
    - so like i told for student when student giving answers you want to make sure you have student evidence to back up student statement as well :: evidence, question, tell, tagconcern
    - i think that we can add more details to student answer so let's do a sentence spring :: text, expand, evidence, tagconcern
    - but what we want to do is add more supporting details to give studentself a stronger answer :: expand, question, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - yeah you could add those two equipments maybe you could start a new sentence with them just add in that those were two equipments that they used to discover water on the moon :: space, text, search, expand, science, agree, tagconcern
    - a way that i could see you making a response even better is kind of adding the question into the response so you could say one way that the water is valuable is you can split it into hydrogen and oxygen :: ask, science, tell, evidence, tagconcern
    - keep the first part of student answer and then go back and try and find a little bit of evidence in the text as to why you think the answer is correct :: search, evidence, question, agree, tagconcern
    - so i would look back to student answer and add some more evidence from the reading good job :: search, evidence, expand, agree, tagconcern
    - yeah i think that's a really good answer i think you could go a little bit further by just maybe quoting the text just so that student really getting student information from the text :: evidence, expand, agree, tagconcern
    - is there a way that you can add some words to that that would strengthen student response and make it connect to the question a little more :: text, expand, ask, tagconcern
    - student right exactly so you had class of the right information it's the one thing like if i were to answer student question i'd use student exact words and say something like to discover water on the moon you need a specific scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely right so if you just add that little sentence that helps give student answer some context so if i look at it without the question i still know what student talking about :: space, text, evidence, tool, search, expand, ask, question, science, tell, agree, tag400, tagmeta
    - right so nasa did send a small machine but can you add some details like what was that machine called do you remember :: space, tool, expand, question, agree, evidence, tag500
    - so when we're gonna fix some of our answers we want to add some specific details from the text and we will so that we can show that we have a really deep understanding of the text :: expand, question, learn, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - so is there information from that sentence that you can add to student response to just make it a little stronger :: text, evidence, expand, tagconcern
    - right so one suggestion that i have for you is maybe being a little bit more specific with student words and even including the evidence that you had ready to tell me in student response :: text, evidence, expand, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - so i think one suggestion i have for you like the suggestion i had for student would just to be to add a few more specific details so that i and student peers can understand better :: expand, learn, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - oxygen is needed for astronauts to breathe and so if you added that to student response it would help me and any of student friends reading the response understand why the water on the moon is valuable to us :: space, question, science, learn, tagconcern
    - yes please restate the question in student response :: ask, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - we could develop that a little bit more you can say you know what kind of small machine did they use or different things like that just develop student thought process a little bit more than you already have :: tool, expand, question, tell, disagree, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - and we want to make sure we're going to we want to make sure that we're using the text to support our answers :: search, tag500
    - i will say the one part of improvement or one area of improvement that i think that you could work on would be looking at class of the tools that they referenced because yes they did use telescopes but sometimes they also use there are other tools that they utilize as well :: search, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - so i just want to make sure you that student going back and referencing the reading that we have in the assignment to make sure that student getting class of the points possible :: agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - so we just want to make sure that when we are answering our questions that we're being as clear as possible :: ask, question, agree
    - yeah so what i so what i meant by that basically is just you want to make sure that student stating the information that's written in the text :: evidence, question, agree, tagconcern
    - it's not always about having more words you just want to make sure that student using the text and student able to reference the text in student reading :: text, expand, tag500, tagmeta
    - so the only part that i would the only suggestion i have for you and this suggestion is for class not just student is that in student answers i would like you to state where you found student evidence next time :: search, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - a suggestion i would say is adding i know this because in paragraph four it states :: text, tell, tagconcern
    - but can you tell me what the machine is can you be a little bit more specific about that :: tool, expand, question, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - yeah that's perfect so when we're saying our answers we want to be as specific as possible to the text because that's really important to give evidence to what we have instead of just the general so if you have a specific thing from the text definitely include that always in student response because that gives me an idea of how much you can understand what's going on :: evidence, expand, question, tell, agree, learn, tag400, tagmeta
    - so when we're looking at our answers i want you to be able to maybe explain just why they needed this equipment as well :: tool, search, question, tag400
    - so when we answer we want to be very specific so like in the text what small machine are they talking about did they say what kind of small machine :: tool, question, tell, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - yep so that's what you want to specify that the equipment that use was the lunar orbiter which is a small machine so you are correct but we just want to make sure we're super specific about it :: space, tool, question, agree, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - we can go deeper into the text and get more evidence and details for the response and that would be great :: evidence, expand, agree, tag400
    - just make sure that we're going deeper into the text and reading it one more time so we can find even more information :: evidence, search, expand, tag400
    - but if we want to look deeper and find more evidence that would be amazing :: search, evidence, expand, tag400
    - so i would look definitely more closely and find some more tools or more evidence from the text that we can use to support student answer to the question :: search, evidence, expand, ask, tag500, tagmeta
    - make sure you use evidence from the text to support that scientist sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is what it states so you want to word that and make sure that the understanding of where it came from and what it is is incorporated into student answer :: space, text, tool, evidence, search, question, science, learn, tag500, tagconcern
    - so one thing you can do to add to student answer is in the text where did you find that answer so you can say in paragraph two :: text, search, expand, tell, tagconcern
    - so class of you in student responses can add where you found student answers in the text into student response so we can class say like in this paragraph i found my answer :: text, search, expand, tell, tagconcern
    - but what i want you to work on is just being a little bit more specific with student response you know what i mean just try to pick out details from the text you know earlier we did our lesson on comparing and contrasting using context and background information so make sure with that we look for specific details in the text :: evidence, search, expand, question, tag400, tagconcern
    - you can focus on really building that answer out by identifying the scientific equipment :: tool, science, tag400, tagconcern
    - and then explain how that equipment was used to discover water on the moon and then once student gotten that you can add that to student answer :: space, tool, search, expand, question, science, tag400, tagconcern
    - how can we work in the text can we find something that's going to give you even more specific information about that small machine :: evidence, tool, search, expand, question, tag400, tagmeta
    - you mentioned the small machine but a better answer would tell me what the machine does :: tool, question, tag400
    - can you be more specific and look back in paragraph 2 to see if you can find the rest of the or the more detailed part of the answer :: text, search, expand, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - would you like to go ahead and start looking back through the passage to see if you can use the word discover :: text, search
    - did you hear how they gave it a little bit more of a specific name so instead of just saying a small machine they called it a microscope :: tool, expand, question, tell, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - looking into and finding it for the first time that's how i would change student answer just a little bit to make it a little bit more clear now :: search, expand, question, tag500, tagconcern
    - so if we were able to come to that same sort of answer but give more details you might be able to better inform student reader who's me the teacher :: expand, action, question, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - i think we can be a little more specific in student response so you said oxygen tanks and yeah absolutely they're gonna use oxygen tanks there could you tell me maybe another piece of equipment that nasa used in this article to help discover water on the moon :: space, text, tool, search, expand, science, tell, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - a lot of words can seem tough but making sure that student reader knows exactly what you are saying can go a long way that way you don't get any confusion so they know student just as smart as i know you are :: text, question, tell, evidence, tagconcern
    - right we kind of want to let our readers know that we're talking about the scientist specifically so you could say nasa or you could say scientist used if you want to do either one of those i think would convey student meeting :: space, science, tell, agree, evidence, tagmeta
    - so maybe next time when student doing that you could you could be more specific you said nasa sent a small machine :: space, tool, expand, question, tell, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - but you could clarify student statement a little bit more right well that'd be a good strategy :: expand, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - however we also have to use specific text evidence and just like student learned i can't just stop at nasa said a small machine right :: space, tool, evidence, tell, agree, learn, tag400, tagconcern
    - keep reading what small machine get very specific with student answer and be sure to answer every single part of the question using evidence from the text student :: tool, evidence, ask, question, tag400, tagconcern
    - is there a place in the text that that mentions what hydrogen and oxygen can be used for :: question, science, tagconcern
    - exactly exactly the more detail you have the better off student answer is :: expand, evidence, tagconcern
    - lunar orbiter right so if you add it in that nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter you think that could have clarified student answer :: space, tool, expand, agree, tagconcern
    - let's take our little answer and make it a great big answer to make it make more sense to make it concrete :: expand, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - so how about let's restate the question to form our answer :: ask, question, tag500, tagmeta
    - see how that answer grows yeah this is really short one word answer we created a whole sentence where class reading our answer can identify what we are talking about what we're learning about :: text, question, tell, agree, learn, tagmeta
    - so just write down the questions and then use them the words on student paper or on student ipad you can just rearrange them to restate the question :: text, action, ask, tag500, tagconcern
    - but when we're answering questions we probably should refer back to our the reading that we were given to find out answers that we need :: search, ask, question
    - how would you use that answer to convince me that water is valuable or could be valuable on the moon :: space, question, science, tagconcern
    - perhaps you could have worded it by saying water is valuable or could be valuable :: science, tell, tagconcern
    - student you wrote that nasa sent a small machine that's very good so maybe we need to investigate look a little further to see what is that machine called :: space, tool, search, expand, question, agree, tagconcern
    - so one strategy we could use let's let's work together with student let's help her her figure out what we could add to this okay so what is a strategy that we can use to look back at the text and to know where to look in the text :: search, expand, question, agree, tag400, tag500, tagconcern
    - good so student right it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen now let's go a little bit further with that answer and can you also see if you can find what you can use the broken down oxygen and hydrogen for and that can go along with student evidence :: search, evidence, expand, question, science, agree, tagconcern
    - but looking more specifically you want to see if you can find the exact name of that machine and kind of be able to explain what that machine does so student answer was right on it you just wanted to add some more detail to it :: tool, search, expand, question, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - so when i'm looking for my answer you want to look for details that will tell you how the water is going to be valuable :: search, question, science, evidence
    - but we want to say give like a yes or no question if you think that it is valuable and class of student details put together does say yes it is valuable because they can use it for surviving :: ask, tell, agree, disagree, evidence, tagconcern
    - maybe but you can also use the passage remember too you can use student reading passage to help you figure out how it would be valuable :: text, question, tag400, tag500, tagconcern
    - yeah and that's what student said he said it could be useful because it can be broken down now he could have extended his answer a little bit more and said what is valuable about breaking it down :: expand, question, science, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - why is it important to make sure to read class of the information before we try to answer the question :: evidence, action, ask, question, tagconcern
    - so it's really important when we are answering questions even though you found part of the question stem and student answer student got to look around it to make sure that's the total :: search, ask, question, tagconcern
    - yeah sometimes that works but sometimes we have to look around too so yes it is a small machine and the small machine may answer a question because we have to also ask a small machine that did what :: tool, search, ask, question, agree
    - so we always have to look back to our text and refer to that when we're trying to find our answers :: search, question
    - we need to restate that question in our answers :: ask, tag500
    - when you restate the question you kind of take some some some words from the question and put it in student answer :: text, ask, question, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon was a lunar orbiter it gives our reader more information and they can if they know nothing about the topic that helps them learn more about it doesn't it :: space, evidence, tool, search, expand, science, learn, tagmeta
    - so whenever we're looking at passages we really want to focus on textual evidence now textual evidence is when you have a question and you refer back to student passage to find the exact answer or as close as possible :: text, search, evidence, ask, question, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - you always want to prove student answer so that you always know that it's right :: agree, tagconcern
    - so we want to be as detailed as possible when we answer our questions so that we have class the information that we need in our response :: evidence, ask, question, agree
    - so when i talked about how you could break it down into hydrogen and oxygen that talked about a way that makes student water valuable :: question, science, tagmeta
    - correct you got to make sure that you answer the question and when you answer student question you got to make sure you add class of student details :: expand, ask, question, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - so you should be looking for something more specific what the small machine was called would be a more solid answer than just the small machine so when student reading and it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon you should name that machine :: space, tool, search, expand, question, science, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - in the correct response like just just if you were having a conversation with someone and like as if you are super excited about the moon and they asked you what kind of machine do they use discover water on them and then student answer should be more specific to answer them if student having a conversation like you would name the machine and tell them how they used it so that's kind of the answer you should be looking for in answering these :: space, tool, search, expand, talk, question, science, agree, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - you know student you found the piece of equipment that they used but we have to be a little bit more specific here :: tool, search, expand, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - so next time when we are asked a question instead of saying i answered it like student or a neighbor make sure you write an answer out instead of saying i found the same thing as my friend i want to hear what you found :: search, action, ask, question, tell, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - well it's always good to add detail to our answers and so the more detail we can provide with our answer the better or the stronger answer can be :: expand, agree, evidence
    - how do you think that we could have wrote our answer differently to include the question :: expand, ask, question, tagconcern
    - not that student answer is incorrect because i see in the third paragraph that it states exactly what you said but maybe adding exactly what they're looking for can also help student other friends maybe if student working in partners of two :: text, search, question, tell, disagree, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - so that's the only thing i would add to students what you put was correct but student teacher may want you to be a little more specific so you could just name the actual machine and it was called the lunar orbiter so student not very far off just a little bit more specific :: space, tool, expand, question, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - yeah we want that specific evidence from the reading that we want to pull that straight out that shows we found the answer to that question student that is one thing i think that will help you if you really try to pull that answer out of what student reading :: search, evidence, ask, question, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - instead of just agreeing with student maybe think about why do i agree with student what is it that she picked that i agree with so you could still say i agree with student but then tell me that reason why you agree with her :: question, tell, tag500, tagmeta
    - and if you need help getting started you could say the equipment and the scientists used to discover water was the what and then write out student response :: tool, search, action, question, science, tell, tagconcern
    - so what i'm sort of wondering could you be a little bit more specific perhaps in identifying what that small machine could possibly be so to be a little bit more specific you would then you know want to choose perhaps the lunar orbiter :: space, tool, search, expand, action, question, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - i think if we go back into the text and we look for any mention of equipment that scientists have used and we underline that that we could then build on student answer we'd have a complete full answer to that question :: tool, search, action, ask, science, tag400, tagconcern
    - usually it's best when we answer a question if we just stick to that question and we can save the extra information for discussions like when we're having right now :: evidence, ask, question, agree, tagconcern
    - how do you think we could be a little bit more specific in our response because there are lots of small machines in the world right :: expand, question, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - if we go back into the text we can see the type of small machine that they sent and so we can give that a name so that when we respond to the question we're being specific with our answer :: tool, ask, question, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - and so student answer you said nasa sent a small machine so i would like for you to tell a little bit more about the small machine so looking in the text what could we add to expand and give more details what top of small machine was it :: space, tool, search, expand, question, tell, evidence, tagmeta
    - alright so talk about what you found not what student found so just go in and maybe read it and just again we're looking for what equipment the scientists use to find water and talk about studentself not another student that way if i had no clue if i've never read the text i'll read student question i know exactly what student talking about when we answer :: tool, search, expand, action, ask, question, science, tell, disagree, evidence, tagmeta
    - yeah tell me something about it and what else what identifies that machine :: tool, expand, question, agree, tagmeta
    - yes so what you'll do is for example you are going to restate the question so is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable :: space, evidence, ask, question, science, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - i would say that you do need more evidence student evidence does say that bringing water on the moon is hard but i would also talk about how the water on the moon would be good :: space, evidence, expand, question, science, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - so the best place to start is the key words in the question and then going back to those headings to try and see if we can look underneath that heading for an answer :: text, search, ask, tagconcern
    - that is correct but if you want it to be more specific in a good answer you could have said nasa sent a small machine and it is called a lunar orbiter so student you were on the right track :: space, tool, expand, tell, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - and then to be more specific in our answer we could have put the name and what is that machine called :: tool, expand, question, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - so student you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks how could you be more specific to the passage :: space, text, tool, expand, question, science, tell, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - we just want to dig a little bit deeper into the text and maybe help student fellow students figure out some more details about what nasa did to find water on the moon :: space, search, expand, question, science, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - i want you to help each other understand the text and so now that we know the key words that class thinks i want you class to reconstruct student answer to give us a little bit more detail about the equipment that specifically helped us discover water :: text, tool, search, expand, science, learn, evidence, tagmeta
    - one thing that may help you in the future is to answer the question as if you were teaching about the question so if somebody was new to reading this passage just like you class were how would you best explain it to them so that they would get a full picture of what you class are reading :: text, ask, question, tag400, tagmeta
    - sure so you can also remind them if you were teaching or even from student perspective as a student if you can answer the question and then give us a little bit more detail as to why that student answer that will help you with a with a more concrete answer :: expand, ask, question, evidence, tagconcern
    - but that detail you just added is critical that's why it's valuable the fact that when i break it down the oxygen hydrogen astronauts can breathe the oxygen and they can use the oxygen and hydrogen as fuel so that second part that you just gave me that's why it's valuable so that's a great answer :: space, question, science, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - so i just want you to go a little further in student explanation and use some evidence from what you read about :: evidence, expand, action, question, tagmeta
    - so i just want student answer to be a little more specific and sometimes that does mean writing more stuff :: expand, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - but when student answering the discussion questions for the text that we read just try and incorporate something specifically from the text so the text mentions the lunar orbiter so that would have been a good thing to include in student response in addition to what you said about finding craters of water and they're like suits masks and oxygen tanks :: space, search, expand, action, talk, ask, question, science, tell, agree, evidence, tag500, tagmeta
    - yeah so that is a really good answer and student definitely correct but i want you to elaborate a little bit more so yes nasa sent a small machine but what was that small machine called :: space, tool, expand, question, agree, tagmeta
    - right so when we use the term lunar orbiter we're using evidence to support our response and so that's something you want to make sure student doing because it shows that :: space, evidence, search, question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - but you also want to make sure that when student answering the question student specifically using evidence and examples that the text gives you :: evidence, ask, question, tagconcern
    - so it's awesome to make connections with student background knowledge but in order to answer a question you want to make sure that it comes from the text :: ask, tagconcern
    - however again when you look at that question it asks what equipment found those craters of water so that would be similar to student where you just want to make sure that student using a specific piece of evidence to support what you said when you said that there's craters of water :: space, tool, search, evidence, ask, question, science, tell, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - and what you could do with that so in student response you could have added something like in another article i read it said that there could be a base on the moon and then connect to the article we're reading now so do you have any idea of how you could do that :: space, text, expand, action, question, tell, tagconcern
    - pretty good i would maybe just add a little bit about how like you said they're not carrying the water on the ships anymore because they're keeping it at the base that they're going to build on the moon :: space, expand, question, science, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - student student answer is not wrong we just want to work to be a little more specific and then we want to work to explain how we know what we know :: expand, question, disagree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - so instead of saying small machine we know that the small machine was called a lunar orbiter so we want to try to be a little bit more specific instead of saying small machine we want to say lunar orbiter :: space, tool, expand, tell, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - class right student student response was really great i love that you kind of collaborated off of farrah's idea but what i want to see from you is to articulate something that you found interesting that someone else didn't necessarily say i know you have so many great thoughts :: search, expand, talk, question, tell, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - i want you to try to when student answering questions about text i want you to try to look for specific things and even if you share the same ideas as student classmate try to articulate it in a new way and try to explain student thinking :: search, talk, ask, question, agree, evidence, tag400, tag500, tagmeta
    - not necessarily for example if student has the answer then you can say the same answer but just work to kind of say it in student own words and describe what you thought about it :: text, question, tell, agree, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagmeta
    - no evidence we can add some evidence into our answer :: evidence, expand, disagree
    - i want you to look back into the reading to circle the evidence where it talks about what you want to answer you need to have specific evidence from the reading :: search, evidence, action, question, tag400, tagmeta
    - that's perfect beautiful i love that does it make more sense that you have to make sure student answering the full question when they say equipment you have to remember their equipment and then you can add in those details you have those are awesome as well :: tool, expand, ask, question, tell, agree, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - good so what do you think you could add to student sentence to student answer to make it even more detailed and more specific to the question :: text, expand, ask, question, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - yeah just that was kind of from student prior knowledge yep so now we know to look you can use student prior knowledge and use what's in the article to answer those specific questions yes deb you have a hand up :: text, search, ask, question, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - we're going to use writing right from the text to make sure we support our answers so if we say no there's something in the text that will support a no answer and if we say yes there will be something in the texts for a yes answer does class want to talk about their response first :: search, tell, agree, disagree, tag500, tagmeta
    - so there you go student so we'll just add that little part to student response to make sure it's nice and clear on why it's important that the water can be broken down into those two parts thank you for sharing :: expand, question, science, tagconcern
    - and that it would take a lot of money and investment to even use what water there is on the moon so i when i tell you to go back and finish up student work please use that evidence to support student answer :: space, evidence, search, question, science, tag500, tagconcern
    - so this sentence starter says the scientists used and then there's a line blank so this is where you would put the equipment that they used to discover that water is on the moon :: space, text, tool, search, science, tagconcern
    - i found my answer in paragraph blank and this is where student going to put the number there's a number at the side of the paragraphs and i want to know exactly where you found student answer okay does that make sense :: text, search, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - yes okay so well i start with student i want my friends i want you to start thinking about changing the wording of student answer okay just try student best that's class that matters :: agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - you can do it on student own okay and i want you to start working on the sentence starter okay do you need me to read that to you :: text, action, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - great i'm glad i'm so glad so if you could fill out this sentence starter for me :: text, agree, tagconcern
    - so student answer is right but i think that we should add a little bit more detail and describe is there maybe an adjective or a name of that small machine that we could use :: tool, expand, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - love it so student if you could rewrite student answer and maybe use that name that would be super helpful :: tagconcern
    - i was wondering can you describe the machine at class are there any adjectives in the texts that describe the machine :: tool, tag400, tagconcern
    - oh my goodness student you just answered my next question my next question was going to be what does the machine do could you add a little bit more detail into student answer :: tool, expand, ask, question, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - i'm wondering if you can push student thinking further and ask why having more space on a spaceship is good :: space, expand, question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - yes so you class just need to be a little more specific what kind of machine was used to discover water :: tool, search, expand, question, science, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - yes so how will you revise student answer to include the equipment :: tool, expand, question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - right so i would like to see you use some context from the story to be able to answer that question does that make sense :: text, ask, agree, tag400
    - however when we're writing answers to comprehension questions about a text that was given to us we need to be sure that we're just providing information from the text :: evidence, ask, question, tag500, tagmeta
    - to use evidence from the text in front of us :: evidence
    - so it's just a matter of combining student two answers :: tagconcern
    - so those are class pieces of equipment absolutely however when we're answering a question to a text that we've read we need to be just using evidence from the text if we use background information :: evidence, tool, action, ask, question, tagconcern
    - but what i want you to do is i want you to look back at the reading that we did and try and find something from the reading that answers the question about what equipment the scientists use to discover water on the moon :: space, tool, search, ask, question, science, tagmeta
    - right so student answer isn't wrong they did send a small machine but i want to see more detail i know that you could pull more detail from this what was the small machine called do you remember :: tool, search, expand, question, agree, disagree, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - but what i want you to do is i want you to go back to the text and add more details to student answer what was this small machine called and what was it there to do :: tool, expand, question, evidence, tagconcern
    - so now that you see where we got our answer let's see what we can add to it to make it more complete :: expand, question, tagconcern
    - so go ahead and look into the reading and see what you might add to the answer to make it from a partial answer to a complete answer and then i'll come right back to you :: search, expand, question, agree
    - so i'm going to suggest that student class keeps looking through and looking at each other's answer and seeing what you could add to each one individually :: search, expand, question, tagconcern
    - you were on to the right path of getting to the answer that nasa sent a small machine they did but can you tell me more about the machine can you be more specific while using evidence from the text something to support student answer what type of machine was it :: space, tool, evidence, search, expand, question, agree, tag500, tag400, tagmeta
    - yes we have to read what's in the story when we answer the question of support and that we use what we read in this story to support our answer :: text, search, action, ask, question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - that's very true what you said but as i said earlier we really want to be sure that we're answering what's being asked we don't want to talk about things that are not in the text or what they're not really asking us because that can be a little confusing yes student :: ask, question, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - so my suggestion would be to find some reasons why even in that long future that you identified why could it be important to have in the future :: search, question, tag400, tagconcern
    - so my suggestion would be to keep what you have but now make a connection to why it's important that water is there on the moon :: space, question, science, tagconcern
    - to explain what benefit can the astronauts or can nasa have that they don't have to carry this water anymore so what other benefit does that provide see if you can expand student answer a little :: space, question, science, tag400, tagconcern
    - i was wondering if we could look a little bit deeper into the first excuse me the second paragraph and find out if there's a more specific tool that you can use as evidence for this answer :: text, search, evidence, expand, tag400, tagconcern
    - so for you i would say read that part and see if you can add another detail on to it :: expand, action, tell, evidence, tagconcern
    - maybe think about the equipment's looking for water maybe where's the water or maybe something to that effect we can really make a more detailed answer :: tool, search, expand, science, tagmeta
    - i wonder sometimes if we could even use those words to help us look even deeper so what if we turn those words into the beginning of a statement and figure out if the rest of the information is in the text :: text, evidence, search, question, tag400, tagconcern
    - so i suggest you go back to the text underline what answer you just gave me and then i want you to circle something else that links with that to help further student answer can you do that for me :: expand, action, question, tagconcern
    - so i want you to underline what you did answer which was nasa sent a small machine so underlined small machine okay and then i want you to just circle more detail with that that would further student answer a little bit more :: space, tool, expand, action, question, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - i'm wondering if you also can get a little bit more specific so what were they sending the small machines for :: expand, question, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - so i'm wondering if you can make student answer a little bit more specific so we're looking for the equipment that they use to discover water on the moon :: space, tool, search, expand, science, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - i'm wondering if you class wouldn't mind going back and rereading the text and seeing if we can find a more specific answer :: search, expand, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - student i'm going to have you look at the text for a second and try to come up with an answer that's a little bit more detailed :: search, expand, tagconcern
    - when we have a question that tells us to use the text :: ask, question
    - can we think of what the specific name of that small machine is i want us to get as specific as possible when we're thinking about this specific equipment :: tool, question, agree, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagmeta
    - but i'm wondering if we could make sure we circle back right to that passage what information in the passage might help you build a stronger answer to the equipment scientists needed for this specific mission :: text, evidence, tool, action, question, science, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - so let's go back through reread and really try to find an idea that's connected to the text :: search, action, tagconcern
    - very good alright student student answer was almost there and student got just half of it i want you to be a little more specific so you told me that nasa sent a small machine which is absolutely true can you tell me what that small machine was called :: space, tool, expand, question, tell, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - yeah my suggestion is that we just use evidence from this story :: text, evidence, agree, tagconcern
    - yeah so maybe just add that to response and then do you think you could also talk about what you were just telling me about being an environmentalist and :: expand, question, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - yeah so how do you think you could describe some of the equipment they use to get to the moon :: space, tool, question, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - i think you could also talk about student own experience going to nasa :: space, tell, learn, tagmeta
    - well if you can try and find a way to connect it to what you read in the text so you have this experience with nasa and learning about the equipment :: space, tool, search, action, question, learn, tagmeta
    - so now that we student described what the equipment looks like do you think you could tell me a little bit more about why they were a gathering class this equipment and going to the moon to look for water in the first place :: space, tool, search, expand, question, science, tagmeta
    - yeah so you can include that and then maybe also talk about why we would need to look for water on the moon :: space, search, expand, question, science, tell, agree, tagmeta
    - so i think we can be a little bit more specific about that small machine :: tool, expand, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - it would be helpful to elaborate and add more details to student response but it was a great start good job student :: expand, agree, evidence, tagconcern
    - and give me the actual word with the citing source then you will get the answer okay okay :: text, agree, tagconcern
    - on the machine o h that's okay next time can you please give us a specific name for the machine that's class :: tool, agree, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - so maybe you could add to student answer a bit about how it would be helpful to have it there on the moon ready to go since astronauts need to drink it :: space, expand, question, science, tagmeta
    - to use context clues you look at the text around a word or phrase to understand what that word or phrase means action step and strategy :: text, search, question, learn, evidence, tag400, tag500, tagconcern
    - okay studenti would like you to look back over the passage and i would like for you to underline where the word scientists appear and what they're using to find the water :: text, search, action, question, science, agree, tagconcern
    - so let's take a step back and see what sort of equipment we see mentioned specifically in paragraph two action step :: text, tool, action, question, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - look at paragraph two to see if there was a special machine that they brought to investigate the water on the moon :: space, text, tool, search, science, tagconcern
    - now let's let's go a little further back on our texts and see if we can maybe go a little deeper into how they originally discovered it okay would you like to maybe give it another go :: search, expand, question, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - can you and student work together to go back to the text and figure out what that machine was called :: tool, question, tag400, tagconcern
    - i am wondering if you can pull out some information from the text that we used so can you find a specific piece of equipment mentioned in this text student :: evidence, tool, search, tag400, tagconcern
    - so can you look at the text student and see what the machine does :: tool, search, question, tagconcern
    - awesome so student i want you to go back to the text and i want you to find me a piece of equipment that the scientists use okay :: tool, search, science, agree, tagconcern
    - awesome well student i have a job for you i want you to look at this text and find me a piece of equipment that the text mentions okay student :: tool, search, agree, tagconcern
    - i want you class to circle a word or two from the text about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon :: space, text, tool, search, action, question, science, tagmeta
    - so for saying what equipment did scientist use discover water on the moon maybe you can look for keywords like like the name of the equipment :: space, tool, search, question, science, tell, tag500, tagconcern
    - who remembers when student asked what equipment was and student said that it's like a tool right so you can look for key words like that :: text, tool, search, question, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - so i want class to look in student text at paragraph two and look for any keywords that may help to identify the equipment that was used to specifically discover water :: text, tool, search, science, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - look in paragraph two of the passage to see if you might find another machine reread paragraph two of the passage okay :: text, tool, search, expand, action, agree, tagconcern
    - and remember student two key words equipment and discover and look back to see if you can find a paragraph and the passage that uses the words discover and equipment :: text, tool, search, tag500, tagconcern
    - so now that we know the two key words that we need to look for in our reading passage is evidence and valuable can class look back at the reading passage and underline what you think a good answer would be :: text, search, evidence, action, question, agree, tagconcern
    - so student i want you to take a moment and look back at paragraph four where we see the word valuable because we're looking for evidence that water is valuable it's important :: text, search, evidence, science, tag500, tagconcern
    - so let's look look back at paragraph four and see how in the future water would be valuable can you do that :: text, search, question, science, tagconcern
    - maybe be a little more specific with that question right so looking for a specific piece of equipment which one which piece of equipment helps them search for water okay :: tool, search, expand, ask, question, science, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - okay student i would like you to go back when you get a chance and look back over the passage and i would like for you to underline where the scientists work and what they're using to help them find the water :: text, search, action, question, science, agree, tagconcern
    - student why don't you go back and look at the text and maybe reread it and highlight some keywords or helpful passages then see if you can come to that answer studentself :: search, action, question, tag500, tagconcern
    - and as student reading the passage you know might be good to take a highlighter and highlight key words so when you go back you can look at what you highlighted to help you find the answers :: text, search, action, question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - so what we want to do now is to go back to the passage take a closer look at the passage and see if you can identify where the words equipment and discover are as it relates to finding the water :: text, tool, search, question, science, tag500, tagconcern
    - okay so i want you to go back in the groups that you were take a closer look at the passage and see if you can find out where machine was mentioned where water was mentioned and where the word discover was mentioned :: text, tool, search, science, agree, tag500, tag400
    - so the sections are labeled 1 2 3 4 5 and six let's take a look at section three and see if you can find an example of the equipment they used to find water on the moon :: space, text, tool, search, science, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - so look back through student texts and see if you can look for that keyword equipment and then see if you can find the answer to the question :: tool, search, ask, tag500, tagmeta
    - but again you want to use context clues to find the exact name of that small machine :: tool, search, evidence, tag400
    - you read the question first maybe look at some key words so for example in this question you see equipment so class right now i know i'm looking for equipment when i go to read :: text, tool, search, action, ask, question, agree, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - and then i'm going to read the passage and maybe highlight or circle any equipment that i see as i am reading and then go back to the question and read it again :: text, tool, action, ask, tagconcern
    - what i want you to do is go back and underline at least one thing that they said was useful and if you want to amaze me i want you to underline two things and raise student hand once student done :: action, question, tell, tagconcern
    - student i want you to look through the text and find equipment that helps them find water okay :: tool, search, science, agree, tagconcern
    - did you find that in the text i want you to find where it tells me what the lunar orbiter does so circle a word that tells you what the lunar orbiter does :: space, text, search, action, question, tagconcern
    - now let's look at some supporting details that prove why it's a valuable resource :: search, question, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - okay so student when student reading the informative text you should be looking for words that jump out to you about the question being asked :: text, search, ask, question, agree, tagmeta
    - you should be looking for keywords like tool equipment or maybe machine to help you find what they used to discover the water :: tool, search, question, science, tag500
    - so look back on student article and look for that word valuable do you see it anywhere in there maybe look for the word in one of the headings or sub headings :: text, search, disagree, tagconcern
    - good so we could underline that sentence to support this discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon right because investigate is something you do to discover something right :: space, text, tool, search, action, talk, ask, question, science, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - okay so how about we go back in the text and look a little bit more closely so that we can learn more information about space okay :: evidence, search, expand, question, agree, learn, tagmeta
    - but if you were to look through the sort of the article a little bit more you know sort of try to pick out some key words :: text, search, expand, action, tagconcern
    - so i would like for you to read the third paragraph and see if we can expand upon luis's answer that he gave us :: text, action, tagconcern
- intent: r500
  examples: |
    - can somebody tell me and i want to see student hands raised what does it mean to find evidence :: search, evidence, question, tagconcern
    - when we're talking about evidence we're thinking about what words do i see in this text or reading that help me answer this question :: text, evidence, ask, question, tell, tag500, tagmeta
    - we might look for cue words or leading words like called like you notice how called is before that so that's a great example of a word that we might that we might use :: text, search, question, agree, evidence, tag500, tagmeta
    - alright student can you explain to me what evidence is :: evidence, question, tag400, tagconcern
    - when we're looking for evidence we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help us :: search, evidence, question, tag400, tagconcern
    - you want to look in the story for where you can find these answers :: text, search, tagmeta
    - the next time student reading a tough question it can help you to look for the action words in the question because that's going to help you know specifically what student looking for :: text, search, ask, question, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - when you read something it's a three step process when student trying to answer a question :: action, ask, question, tag500, tagconcern
    - then you go look at student question and you look at what it's really asking you and then you read it again :: search, action, ask, question, tagconcern
    - if you want to be good at something you keep doing it over and over and over :: agree, tagconcern
    - remember when we looked at our question we found a keyword :: search, ask, question, tag500, tagmeta
    - keyword to help us and to answer the question :: ask, tag500, tagmeta
    - she used the passage that we provided to find her answer she didn't just use her background knowledge she made sure to go back and find something in the text :: text, search, tagconcern
    - you highlight important words in student question so you can go back and you can try to find that in the passage :: text, search, action, ask, tagconcern
    - so you see how if you did remember that it was a small machine and i like how you went back and reread student text to figure out what that machine was actually called :: tool, action, question, tag400, tag500, tagconcern
    - sometimes we can read things but not quite absorb everything so it's always a good idea to go back and reread student text underline important information and details that can help you answer questions about it afterwards and keep that knowledge with you :: evidence, action, ask, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - now one of the strategies that we were going to use today is to look at some key words that we have in our question :: text, search, ask, tag500
    - for restating a question you listen carefully for the words being used such as in our question :: text, ask
    - to answer the question using the race method you restate the question :: ask, tag500
    - we look really closely at those key words in our question :: text, search, ask, tagconcern
    - remember when we are reading our question we have to look really closely at those key words those words that we need to look for in our text :: text, search, ask, question, tag500, tagconcern
    - remember when we are looking at our question we always have to look for those important words :: text, search, ask, question, tag500
    - then we have to look in our text for the same words so that we can try to find our answer :: text, search, agree
    - often when we read it will tell us a sequence it will tell us what happened first and then what happens next so it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story :: text, search, action, ask, question, tag500, tagmeta
    - we don't want to just say we agree it's good to agree with people but it's also good to know why we we think something :: question, tell, agree, tagconcern
    - when we're given questions we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are the more sense that they make later on :: search, expand, ask, question, agree, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - i think we've class kind of learned a lesson when we're reading the information we have to pay attention to it and not just assume :: evidence, question, learn
    - does that make sense we know we class know different things about space but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being given :: evidence, agree, disagree, tagmeta
    - we looked very closely at our text we looked for those key words :: text
    - but what we need to do is definitely go through student passage and then highlight important details you always want to highlight student headings or student sub headings :: text, action, question, evidence, tagmeta
    - because those are a lot of key details in there that could give you some really good text evidence so that's what you need to do you want to find details that go along with student question and could possibly support student answer :: search, evidence, ask, question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - maybe like a chronological timeline of events in a text so if you broke down the text and circled like what happened first and then what happened and then what happened you might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question :: search, expand, ask, question, tag500, tagmeta
    - you built off student answer i appreciate how you build student answer we got more specific we narrowed down to that core of knowledge we're looking for and then we said okay this is this is what that machine was and this is what it was doing :: tool, search, expand, question, tell, agree, evidence, tag400, tagmeta
    - okay again so and much like with student earlier we're just we're trying to look at that question and we're specifically boiling it down to just its core components :: search, ask, agree, evidence, tag500, tagmeta
    - sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together and it's called summarizing so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer :: text, tag500, tagmeta
    - so i really like to do is the race format so we're going to restate the question we're going to answer the question we're going to cite evidence and then we're going to explain that evidence :: evidence, ask, tag400, tag500, tagmeta
    - so for example when i read what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon i try to think to myself i try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking :: space, tool, search, action, ask, question, science, evidence, tag500, tagmeta
    - so for example i might say the equipment that the scientist used to discover on the moon would be and then leave that answer blank and then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment :: space, tool, search, question, science, tell, learn, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - but i think next time we need to use the strategy of looking at keywords and be really specific :: search, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - so that is why it's very important to highlight those keywords so you can give the best answer :: action, question, tag500, tagconcern
    - see sometimes it's okay to go back and reread to find the answer :: search, action, agree, tagconcern
    - yes that is exactly what i would like and that goes for class not just student so when student answering these questions try to use what you already know as well as specific information from what we're reading :: evidence, ask, question, agree, tag400, tagmeta
    - great job that's a good strategy finding those key clues and keywords to help you find student answer :: search, agree, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - you told me before that what you did was you read you noticed that the word water was in the question so you scanned through and you looked for things that related with water :: text, action, ask, question, science, tell, tag500, tagmeta
    - great so i really liked that response because you explained studentself really well you said that you read the question you saw what the question was asking for and then you found it and explained why so that was a really great response :: search, action, ask, question, tell, agree, tag400, tagconcern
    - definitely use student imagination i really like how you visualize the situation before giving student answer that's a really good strategy to answering questions :: ask, question, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - yes that was a perfect response you used direct language from the text used specific vocab and you provided reasoning it was very specific that was a perfect response good job :: agree, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagmeta
    - so to find evidence we need to use those quotes from the text and i like that student quoted and she said paragraph three so we could class look at our texts and find where she was reading :: text, search, evidence, tell, tagmeta
    - i like that student connecting student background knowledge to help you it's great that student using student notes to help you further understand this text that's an excellent strategy that good readers use :: expand, agree, learn, tag500, tagmeta
    - then you provided reasoning which is you can't survive without water it's very important to backup student answers with reasoning :: question, science, tag500, tagmeta
    - i'm hearing that you read the text for details and evidence to help support student thinking :: evidence, search, action, tag500, tagconcern
    - student connecting the details to another part of the text to explain how it could be valuable :: expand, question, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - student you are using student background knowledge of a definition of orbiter to be able to apply student answer :: space, tagconcern
    - so you think about the thinking and thinking strategy that you use when you are reading a text and answering a question :: ask, question, tag500, tagmeta
    - so why did you change student answer to what student also wrote what were you thinking :: question, tag500, tagconcern
    - she's going back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used to discover water on the moon :: space, search, evidence, science, tag400, tagmeta
    - so this is a really good thing that you were just able to do so when you were rereading student able to see where you found student answer and you were able to find another part that you could add to it :: search, expand, question, agree, tagconcern
    - that's an excellent strategy to be looking at the text and pulling out those keywords :: search, tag500, tagconcern
    - and i think that that's an excellent strategy for class to think about when we're reading a text is to think :: question, tag500, tagmeta
    - when student trying to answer this question just to try to locate these key words in the paragraph :: text, ask, question, tagmeta
    - when we read we want to make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text :: evidence, action, question, tell, tagconcern
    - so that's great that's a great segue so what i wanted to ask you class next because you just gave specific evidence of what the question said and you analyze that and picked an answer based off that specifically so that's a great process :: evidence, ask, question, tell, agree, tag500, tag400, tagmeta
    - so when we're not drawing on our prior knowledge these things can be complex and reviewing them a couple times is important :: question, tagmeta
    - it's important for you to look back at the passage to try and determine what the best answer to the question is it's always helpful to circle key words in the question :: text, search, action, ask, question, learn, tagconcern
    - i mean student 100 right and using that background knowledge but when we answer questions especially questions about a text we always want to make sure that our answers on have evidence that are found directly from the text :: search, evidence, ask, question, agree, tagmeta
    - what i'm going to suggest to class of you is when you start the first thing you do before you start reading is to actually look closely at the question :: search, ask, question
    - so i guess the other strategy that student going to want to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking and then student trying to make some connections between the concepts that student reading :: ask, tag500, tagmeta
    - that can help you make some inferences you want to read a little bit more closely for the meaning of the the material before it :: expand, action, tag500, tagconcern
    - yeah so this is a really important skill for scientists we need to be able to look at a text and use quotes or information from the text to support our answers :: evidence, search, science, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - okay so looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a great strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely :: search, evidence, ask, agree, tag500
    - so we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies the next time we come across a question like this :: ask, question, tag500, tagmeta
    - i love that you are looking for keywords that's a really strong reading technique :: search, tag500, tagconcern
    - i think that a little bit of specificity and putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times :: tag500, tagmeta
    - i sort of noticed that through talking with student i mean that you also added some specificity to student answer do you think that helped you get a more full response :: expand, action, tell, tagmeta
    - i think that's totally a great strategy for you i think if you see the question provide student answer just look over student answer one more time and then make sure it answers matches the question and you'll be good to go :: search, expand, ask, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - fantastic so i really appreciate something student just did he took little parts of the world to lunar orbit to draw a conclusion from that so we're really looking for small details here :: space, search, evidence, tag500, tagmeta
    - the question when we're looking for an answer it's important to think about those keywords and it can also be helpful to create our sentence but i wouldn't say that it necessarily has to be in student response :: text, search, ask, question, tell, tag500, tagmeta
    - i think it's nice though when we read a text if we can scan the text for specific pieces of equipment then that way when we write our answers out if i ever asked you can you tell me what paragraph you found that in student be able to point to that exact part of the text :: text, tool, search, action, question, evidence, tag400, tagconcern
    - so i think student you did just that when you just re read that beginning of paragraph two :: text, action, question, tagconcern
    - yeah exactly you could specify the small machine and that's a strategy you can use in response questions :: tool, ask, agree, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - well in this case adding a name would be sufficient but i i'm talking more about a strategy of specifying student responses instead of just like adding a name into it :: expand, tell, evidence, tag500, tagmeta
    - but student strategy is absolutely right you locate the keywords in the question and you find them in the text :: search, ask, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - well i'm looking at it and i think it says like okay nasa sent this whole machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar creator these ice deposits are very small :: space, tool, search, science, agree, tagmeta
    - yeah so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we went to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us like sometimes :: agree, tag500
    - well you asked us to look closely for the equipment right and like look at what was using to discover the thing :: tool, search, question, agree
    - do you feel like you could try this strategy next time you encounter a tricky question like this :: ask, tag500, tagmeta
    - next time you have a similar question what would you do first :: ask, question, tag500
    - if you are not sure what the question is asking or if you want to check student understanding of the question then what can you do :: ask, question, learn, tagconcern
    - to make sure that you understand a text what can you do :: question, learn
    - so next time you have to answer a question that requires information from the text please remember to make sure you understand the question first before you start trying to find an answer :: evidence, search, ask, learn, tag500, tagmeta
    - thank you okay so student do you feel like student changed student student process for working through text and questions :: ask, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - whatever you think it's okay if student response hasn't changed it's okay if it has changed i'm just curious what you class are thinking so take a moment before our conversation i thought this and after our conversation i thought this :: talk, question, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - i think what we class need to take away is that when we're answering reading comprehension questions we really need to focus on going back and reading the article in detail and maybe highlighting the text or annotating the text so that we can really understand in detail what we're learning and why we're learning it :: text, ask, question, learn, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagmeta
    - okay so from reading the text today and using our tools by going back and rereading the text and circling important information how can this broaden student understanding in the future of any topic that we discuss whether it's space or farming :: evidence, question, agree, learn, tag500, tagmeta
    - how can you use student knowledge of restating the question in our next lesson :: ask, question, tag500, tagconcern
    - so when we're answering questions like this again what's something that we need to make sure we do when we're answering the question :: ask, question, tagconcern
    - so next time you have a question you can underline student keywords to help you be more specific :: expand, action, ask, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - so now that student figured out the full answer what will you do next time when student looking back in the text :: search, question, tag500, tagconcern
    - so next time you are answering a question like this how do you think you can make student answer better :: ask, question, tag500, tagconcern
    - and how you will apply what you learned in student next task so i'm gonna give you class a couple minutes to think about it and then we will go around in the circle answering :: action, question, learn, tag500, tagmeta
    - so we can start with student and just to repeat i want you to state how you started out thinking how the strategy you used changed based on the feedback i gave and what you will do next time to make sure you are fully answering the question :: ask, question, tag500, tagconcern
    - we're just going to go around student what do you think first student going to say what strategy you used and how you will build on to it for student next assignment or task :: question, tell, tag500, tagconcern
    - and last but not least student what about you what do you think what strategy did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future :: question, tag500, tagmeta
    - right so next time you get a question on a text are you going to use student background knowledge and not read the text at class or are you going to read the text and then use student background knowledge :: action, ask, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - right so what are a few things we can do next time when student not quite sure if student answers are class the way there yet :: question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - right so you went back and read so what do you want to do next time a teacher asks you for a little bit more information :: evidence, expand, action, question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - i'm wondering what you'll do next time you get a question like this to arrive at an answer like this what's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this :: ask, question, learn, tag500, tagconcern
    - and i'm hearing that you have an idea of how you can repeat this answer in the future i think it might be great if you write down this process in a notebook :: action, question, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - that's right that's excellent so now when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions you can use student's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use class of the evidence from the text :: evidence, ask, question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - okay so next time that you see a question like this that's asking about a text what are you going to do :: ask, question, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - next time you see this kind of question please be as specific as you can to answer the question okay :: ask, agree, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagconcern
    - so every single time that we're using information from a text in order to answer a discussion question we want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text even though we might know a lot about the subject reading already :: evidence, talk, ask, tag500, tagmeta
    - or even thinking beyond today what are some tools that we can use for future texts like these :: question, tag500, tagmeta
    - yes so when we're thinking about answering questions like these later in the future i think that what you said about details is very important :: ask, question, tell, agree, evidence, tag500, tagmeta
    - so what do you think you would do next time you get a question like this :: ask, question, tag500
    - what do you think will stick with you for the next time student answering a similar question :: ask, question, tag500, tagconcern
    - how what did you learn right what did you take away from this process of making inferences and making connections what did you learn about that you might be able to apply the next time you encounter a question like this :: ask, question, agree, learn, tag500, tagmeta
    - so next time you see a question asking about a text what will you do :: ask, question, tag500, tagmeta
    - so i suggest that the next time you have a question like this you read through the text and look for those key specific words that might help you have a more rounded out answer :: text, search, expand, action, ask, evidence, tag500, tag400, tagmeta
    - now that we figured out the full answer what could you do next time so that you don't have to do so much revising :: question, tag500, tagconcern
    - okay what could you do next time you get a question like this :: ask, question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - what do you think you could do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking :: search, ask, question, tagconcern
    - hi welcome back from lunch so we'll just pick up from where we left it student as we talked about earlier in the day maybe in the future you can use specifying techniques in student responses :: search, tag500, tagmeta
    - so the next time when student answering these kinds of questions be sure to look for student information or student answer in the text :: evidence, search, ask, question, tag500, tagmeta
    - what do you know now that you did not know when we started talking together :: question, tell
    - ethan what's something new that student learned today about how to answer a text-based question like this one :: ask, question, learn, tagmeta
    - how could you sum-up three actions that you took to improve student response :: question, tag500, tagmeta
    - what are the qualities of a high quality response to a question that is specifically asking about information that is in a text :: evidence, ask, question, tag500, tagmeta
    - does class else want to share maybe they're thinking on what they thought that was the right answer but now what they know is the right answer :: expand, question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - great job class so how has student thinking changed :: question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - i want you to write in student reflection journal how has student thinking changed from when we started this activity :: action, question, tag500, tagmeta
    - alright so can somebody tell me how maybe they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation :: talk, question, tag500, tagconcern
    - exactly student so how's student thinking changed since the very beginning :: question, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - so how can we approach that question a little differently now that student looked at it :: ask, question, tagconcern
    - about our keyword discover and you were thinking about how that was changing student thinking can you go back to that :: search, question, tag500, tagmeta
    - how is that keyword discover changing what you were originally thinking :: search, question, tag500, tagmeta
    - and how did you find that instead of small machine it was the lunar orbiter what did you do to make that change :: space, tool, search, question, tag500
    - okay so who can tell me what they did to correct their answer so how did you go about correcting student answer :: question, agree, tagmeta
    - so now that we have talked about this how has this changed student thinking :: question, tag500, tagmeta
    - how did student thinking change there what did you do differently :: question, tag500, tagconcern
    - ok so now that i have given you class some feedback i want you to think about how you started out thinking then how that changed :: question, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - so why did you need to add more to student answer for to describe with lunar orbiter did :: space, expand, question, tag400, tagconcern
    - so can you tell me how student answer changed from the beginning :: question, tag500, tagconcern
    - so what would you with our discussion today what would you say student answer would be and how would it change :: talk, question, tell, tag500, tagconcern
    - do you see any ways that student mind is kind of changing are you thinking differently now that student hearing from student other friends and student class :: evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - alright so for example you can start by saying i started out thinking and then you would say student prior response then you can say and now i think this way because and you can explain how student thinking has changed :: question, tell, evidence, tag400, tag500, tagconcern
    - so we're gonna take a minute to turn around to student partner next to you and student going to talk about what are student takeaway from the revision process :: question, tell, tag500, tagmeta
    - so you can say something like i started out thinking that we needed a microscope microscope was my answer for the question right now i think it's the lunar orbiter because blank :: space, tool, ask, tell, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - great does class else want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed :: expand, question, agree, tag500
    - does class else want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading :: expand, question, tag500, tagmeta
    - okay so when student thinking about student original answer and student new answer what do you think the difference is between those answers :: question, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - yes so that use the lunar orbiter so student what on what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer that you have :: space, question, agree, evidence, tag500, tagconcern
    - i'm wondering how do you feel like that compares to student first answer what was different about those two :: question, disagree, tagmeta
    - okay so what was different about that answer versus student first response :: question, agree, disagree, tag500, tagmeta
    - student what about you how did student answer change when you were able to revise it :: question, tag500, tagmeta
    - mm hmm so let's just think about as a class like what did we do together what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called student :: question, tag400, tagmeta
    - so as we proceed with this discussion i would want you to observe how student thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay :: talk, question, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - ok so student do you want to share student new thinking what has changed in student thinking :: question, agree, tag500, tagconcern
    - great so student now that student participating already would you mind telling me what student thinking was when you went back to try to revise student response :: question, agree, tag500, tagmeta
    - is there anything else did class do anything different when they were revising their answer :: expand, question, disagree, tagconcern
    - first student going to answer i started out thinking blank then student going to answer and now i think blank because blank go ahead and take 30 seconds to answer those questions :: ask, tag500, tagconcern
    - what made you change student thinking on that :: question, tag500, tagconcern
    - and then after student finished i'm curious if you could share about how student thinking has changed from student original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote :: question, tag500, tagmeta
    - what was different about student first answer and student second you said :: question, tell, disagree, tagmeta
    - so how can i ask you a question how did you get from student first answer to student second answer how did student thinking change :: ask, question, tag500, tagconcern
    - what was what was different and how other than just writing more :: expand, question, disagree
    - what do you think student thought process was in shifting student answer :: question, tag500, tagmeta
    - before our conversation i thought that the answer was this or i didn't know the answer or i was still confused or just before our conversation this is what i thought and then after the conversation that we just had now i think :: talk, question
