    - student going call first what when answer question 
    - student tell what responded question 
    - student tell what answered what student answer 
    - today student could tell what equipment scientist discover moon could read student answer 
    - alright student tell what answered what said 
    - student tell what said 
    - guys tell little about what think equipment look like student 
    - student sounds great want start 
     - student that's that's totally correct think we'd agree microscope would look water really closely although think about what happens before point right 
    - student know exactly equipment used discover water moon right think each like piece then just just needed microscope 
    - student like couple people just circle microscope that's great example there multiple tool like just pointed come from things 
    - student need microscope look really closely things what scientist used find water moon 
    - student semi right could went into more detail small machine small machine called lunar orbiter 
    - student very close 
    - student exactly like student thinking what keeps water together passage 
    - student partially correct need microscope however that's didn't just send microscope moon 
    - student well partially correct equipment sent machine called lunar orbiter able across ground surface moon surface check deposit 
    - student then once figured there 
    - student deposits very small water then microscope make sure what thought there okay microscope actually gave evidence 
    - student there water moon 
    - student then tool used microscope 
    - student completely wrong will send small machine really doesn't 
    - student that's said student student right track 
    - student okay said student meet scientific tool called microscope look really closely right microscope piece equipment 
    - yeah sure okay student also right scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
    - valuable okay agree valuable word that's right going look more thing more other word question student could tell what word another word circled 
    - student scientist found crater full water moon absolutely true that's absolutely something reading 
    - student okay there's pieces equipment actually look ng here 
    - student kind version other slits think about 
    - student wouldn't needed pieces equipment actually figure there water moon 
    - student equipment microscope piece scientific equipment correct 
    - student yeah that's right 
    - student awesome okay yeah would used equipment would oxygen they're moon astronaut moon right 
    - student well enough that's right astronaut correct 
    - student well okay pieces equipment correct 
    - okay read student answers think very good points everyone think little more about what question about example question what question 
    - student says nasa sent small machine right enough question sent small machine look better word answer question 
    - student okay said nasa send small machine right think read little 
    - student think even better think that's great response think make amazing response question asking what equipment scientist discover water moon 
    - that's right  what kind learn from student here learn look ng middle ground between both both pretty much gave good answer gave 
    - student really really good almost exactly where want still make couple improvements there close thank student 
    - student that's right piece puzzle right that's what talking earlier mentioned microscope 
    - student know what that's correct statement wrote down need microsoft skype look something that's really small when back look question 
    - student look student answer scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
    - student that's very knowledgeable point 
    - that's very critical tool when learning together group that's awesome dead 
    - student okay track find right answer going deeper 
    - student right small machine that's what using discover where water 
    - okay  student think scientist used microscope look very very closely 
    - student student answer wrong totally right either 
    - would almost there student would because question very specific meaning what piece equipment said small machine 
    - student examples equipment just particular moment 
    - student okay nasa good point question 
    - student sort right send machine 
    - student said scientist equipment like oxygen tanks equipment like oxygen tanks 
    - student really close sure 
    - student obviously true statement right can't live without water 
    - student well microscope definitely equipment used space like because 
    - student okay getting there 
    - okay great okay reread over text because  student really close answer 
    - student well yeah that's what just there 
    - student that's true couldn't crystals investigate without small machine right 
    - student tools used some observation some research 
    - student maybe there's something back text could find some more 's information student information work together come full more complete answer 
    - student okay that's that's part answer could more space more room 
    - student okay good that's good start student answer 
    - student good start 
    - student well completely wrong 
    - student okay yeah understand really close 
    - student yeah look d really close microscope weren't exactly wrong there just more specific answer yeah good 
    - student that's very interesting take actually first read through answering question thought same thing 
    - student because would 
    - student wrong okay just need elaborate little more okay 
    - student right things question about what equipment scientist discover water moon they're moon know they're using oxygen tanks stuff like what need find about water moon 
    - student nasa sent small machine didn't sent astronaut space make sense 
    -  really like what said nasa send small machine right direction want everybody look text 
    - student polar crater student part answer right 
    - student student piece 
    - student yeah sound like agree oxygen tanks when they're space moon think what trying figure 
    - student well student right need microscope look water 
    - student student answer necessarily wrong just little deeper make student answer more detailed just little better what right what great start 
    - student said nasa sent small machine correct send student small machine order discover water 
    - student that's good need 
    - student oxygen tank maybe used breathe 
    - student okay find 
    - student craters water moon 
    - student student answer incredibly wrong headed right direction would definitely need microscope because water 
    - student student answer scientist found crater full water moon article found crater some water moon didn't full water 
    - student mhmm good student answer just needed little more whole small piece answer 
    - because student just responded thinks knows just about everything about  want tell really enjoyed reading student answer because talked about water split said split into parts hydrogen oxygen correct 
    - student okay yeah student right scientist would oxygen tank breathe space 
    - student yeah maybe just little more attention exact question correct student response just didn't specifically answer question 
    - astronauts didn't oxygen oxygen tanks like student said 
    - yeah okay look ng student responses will student probably closest getting correct answer student response 
    - student sounds filming crater full water moon okay find crater water 
    - student necessarily 
    - right student nasa send small machine student almost 100% right 
    - student right okay good maybe microscope isn't what used discover 
    - because look listen look student answers student said scientist found crater full water moon 
    - student that's entirely true find water some places 
    - microscopes discover things just like guys said tool help discover things 
    - student what tool scientist used microscope 
    - student think both right fact scientific tool just need clarify what tool 
    - right small machine great student 
    - student moon isn't ready live student absolutely right 
    - student tools scientist just make sure student reading question what specific equipment used discover water moon okay 
    - student okay would would correct there's definitely oxygen space 
    - student well part part answer 
    - student okay well student able find there used small machine know very good able discover sort what answer 
    - student know correct student able find where able find water 
    - student well would definitely equipment especially know breathe sort operate within space around moon moon good yeah yeah 
    - student totally sure could like maybe entire moon being covered garden 
    - student wrong answer could better ch ice going talk about more about when talking just like brought discover before when look question look discover 
    - student both right track here equipment they're using microscope water 
    - student might made observation about scientist find ng crater which very good student noticing crater that's where water 
    - student partially correct student right sense nasa send small machine 
    - student correct nasa types equipment boots special special article clothing some some things like oxygen tanks different things things might like when they're exploring space around space missions they're talking about machine find about find about deposit 
    - student yeah that's really good question lunar orbiter wouldn't need microscope 
    - student student partially right when kind 
    - student that's really interesting don't know that's truth mean don't know like that's like truthful like 
    - talk about student student answer scientist equipment like oxygen tanks true 
    - student that's true tell read part text that's true student talking about water which questions asking talk about water 
    - student right student definitely right 
    -   on said need scientific tool called microscope look really closely water moon guys both right track guys really thinking like where student headed 
    - student absolutely absolutely some great observations yeah absolutely would equipment nasa would refer back question what equipment scientist discover water moon 
    - student scientific tool think right track 
    - perfect student absolutely right track 
    - student absolutely student absolutely right equipment huge what 
    - think guys great right track 
    - student absolutely fact true focus what question actually asking 
    - student yeah said would look closely discover d found there water there 
    - student microscope 
    - student correct scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
    - student think answers getting right track 
    - student getting right answer 
    - student know what mean microscope look closely water 
    - student equipment while moon stuff like 
    - well that's very good microscope would part answer lunar orbiter would also part answer right student 
    - okay student look student answer said scientist equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks very true know when space need oxygen able breathe 
    - student scientists need other other equipment like oxygen tanks when into space help 
    - student small actually smaller small microscopic really word means very very small small enough where can't actually without special tool 
    - student that's great question student partially right entirely there student very right when actually microscope water absolutely 
    - student that's absolutely right only halfway right know foot door rest 
    - student halfway 
    -  student absolutely microscope actually water 
    - student sure absolutely some equipment moon can't imagine just know stroll moon absolutely equipment there student wrong regard 
    - student essence yeah should probably oxygen tanks when space need breathe right 
    - student student right whenever into space there's equipment into space moon land moon 
    - student absolutely student initial answer correct need water able drink able survive 
    - what miss  just read what's advantages told makes think there might full water what guys think 
    - student oxygen tanks find water know exactly purpose oxygen tanks designed 
    - student right even though wasn't even though didn't oxygen takes help mission find samples 
    - student okay look ng wouldn't need space exploration 
    - student tools like 
    - student well right thing then find other tool scientist used almost right just more tool 
    - student helped saying there matter microscope still trying figure what other tool even audio 
    - student microscope wrong we've answered part question want says what other what tool found tool want find other tool microscope correct want find other tool also story even said 
    - student items needed find water moon find other item needed moon 
    - student think helped each other come conclusion bunch answers might thought after read first time ice talk other people ideas right 
    - student okay student answer wasn't completely wrong mention nasa send small machine 
    - student would love actual student student answer completely wrong 
    - student yeah pretty good response because lunar orbiter definitely small machine what sent moon 
    - student really awesome response because definitely true scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
    - student yeah definitely like used oxygen tanks equipment 
    - student okay really good thing bring on appreciate student response isn't wrong just focus different section text kind focused microscope very right 
    - student that's great that's great answer small machine that's what microscope real word want find here last paragraph 
    - student would wouldn't thing found water 
    - student okay well after asked question student answer maybe didn't include what question look ng 
    -  student also found different paragraph there multiple answers 
    - yeah there's multiple pieces equipment that's guys answering 
    - student lunar orbiter another equipment then fellow classmate also mentioned sentences shall getting sort said microscope yeah 
    - student just maybe add ng couple more equipment sentence help just bulk give more understanding follow reader reading sentence 
    - correct student answer exactly look ng 
    - student true fully insured 
    - student moon equipment 
    - said everyone else student answer correct exactly answer look ng 
    - student know student background knowledge correct he's answer would where answer 
    - student because student intro wasn't exactly what look ng 
    - wide range could multiple answers like  said machine there well couldn't find water didn't there right machine microscope excuse student 
    - alright student saying there's multiple tool used find water because there order find water right that's really good answer 
    - student started student response really well 
    - student said nasa sent small machine student correct nasa mentioned part 
    - student student answer okay student wrong student just fully there okay 
    - student student student answer nasa sent small machine student right about like small machine piece equipment 
    - student there some more evidence used also said can't survive without water 
    - student which right know that's known fact 
    - student didn't answer question 
    - student doesn't really explain water being moon would valuable 
    - student well wrong sense going moment 
    - student that's good point focusing equipment used find water 
    - student what wear 
    - student student right path just need more makes sense 
    -  part student other part need together 
    - student right track mention microscope 
    - student yeah microscope part 
    - student yeah just getting closer closer answer 
    - student answers little just -they're right direction they're exactly meeting expectations 
    - student yeah what's student student response i'll read nasa send small machine which true nasa send small machine 
    - student student right need scientific tool called microscope that's right student right also need 
    - right student talked about need scientific tool called microscope look really closely that's great sentence great start 
    - student very true equipment many times many different things actually what used discover water moon 
    - student answer question because often chicks definitely 
    - student just think could little more room improvement 
    - well student background knowledge student science equipment think what question asking doesn't mean necessarily background knowledge more look evidence from text 
    - student question didn't necessarily background knowledge what said probably would used potentially find water moon 
    - student question look text evidence don't think text talks about oxygen tanks 
    - student student answer wasn't wrong think really great start response there said nasa uses small machine sent small machine that's true that's correct 
    - student there both right because text actually talks about both things used discover water moon 
    - need just like telling student well  right about 
    - student also sometimes might answer student answer wrong answering question asked want also look question because sometimes might find something that's text might very true nothing question asked 
    - student yeah other tool scientist 
    - next time good okay chose same answer shows guys highlighting right answers passage 
    - student student absolutely right found water moon that's what passage told 
    - student student absolutely right while student answer right scientist oxygen tank sometimes when talking about water being found moon 
    - student don't think answers specific question understand 
    - student exactly there's possibility lunar there's microscope lunar orbiter helps look ashes moon 
    - student part 
    - student student answer great start okay 
    - student yeah really really important 
    - student just because didn't talk about reading doesn't mean important 
    - student weren't wrong just think could build upon student answer more make even stronger 
    - don't think student answer like saying student answers necessarily wrong student sitting group think student answers work could some improvement 
    - give same note gave student although answer correct think could build deeper meaning build build upon student answer elop even more make even stronger already 
    - student student answer correct just when look ng answers know there more parts answer make stronger answer doesn't doesn't mean right wrong just stronger 
    - student part what think student answer although stated used microscope 
    - student student answer although come straight from article reading 
    - student well there couple answers 
    - then student going look student answer really great think really understood text sure quite understood question asking 
    - tell what equipment  student student completely wrong microscope piece equipment that's full answer 
    - right then student also know microscope well once discover d water remember reading 
    - student that's good thought through wasn't answer just wasn't correct question 
    - student student answer correct 
    - student right might used different equipment moon survive moon field walk around breathe student right 
    - student spaceship there talking specifically about discover water just like says from reading 
    - want take look even closer student there's another scientific equipment used specifically find water because microscope going help maybe look water closer look other things maybe just magnified didn't specifically find water 
    - equipment look ng equipment into creators wouldn't exactly microscope into crater find student just something student like 
    - student what just only thing student answer great because right from text saying water there important 
    - student some equipment moon focus other what discover water moon 
    - student find anything specifically related think student really good path quite there 
    - student part part answer 
    - student okay there another tool there 
    - student totally totally completely understand love answered question because student question 
    - student student question wrong student question right student question spectacular plus going student question right 
    - student that's like okay know want student question student answer spectacular 
    - student microscope tool think there's more more important piece equipment 
    - thank answer student used lunar orbiter discover water then used microscope order able closer since small 
    - student teacher almost there nice 
    - student student answer wasn't totally wasn't completely incorrect 
    - missing step number student great explaining step number great explaining step number need together 
    - student right sure that's absolutely right into space need tons equipment don't down here right 
    - need there's parts answer need combine what  answer what student said answer there's parts 
    - that's great start student 
    - student right probably would need microscope anything that's tiny can't student naked 
    - student student right wouldn't need microscope order look water order find water 
    - student don't think would oxygen tanks think would helpful don't think exactly what scientist used discover water 
    - student investigate little more into text might there something used before microscope 
    - student yeah student exactly right water water grow things sure would work moon 
    - student don't think could don't think could grow plants water other uses moon 
    - student yeah think student right think might take scientist long time water doesn't mean less valuable because think there lots different 
    - student true water moon microscopic first first step reviewing question 
    - student about water know asked what discover water true water small need microscope that's what's really being asked 
    - equipment gone moon process that's exact equipment used discover water student 
    - student that's quite really answering question like 
    - student getting closer answer sent small machine 
    - student microscope part equipment used discover water right student right there there part equipment 
    - student student right oxygen tanks equipment sometimes need moon that's when 
    - student when need astronaut need human beings because human beings human beings needs oxygen over there 
    - student student answer isn't wrong because answers question want there's maybe better answer sometimes there's answers them's little more specific 
    - student actually like moment that's exactly what object called 
    - student said nasa sense small machine okay know student actually correct 
    - student that's great place start thank 
    - student even though like student answer think even better answering question 
    - student think included microscope student student answer lunar orbiter would like best answer ever 
    - student important both things want microscope 
    - student right track find ng right answer 
    - student well student answer actually wrong just half piece student more smaller picture 
    - exactly right know what onto something student microscope response because really essential part analyzing dirt moon however microscope dirt analyze student what's 
    - student unfortunately don't think oxygen tank time 
    - student right student when said need find would need microscope because water microscopic probably microscope that's necessarily what using find discover water right 
    - yeah exactly okay what hearing from guys different tool really important 
    - what really want focus right what's important water right because true like said when student need oxygen tanks right need breathe 
    - would kind pair little more student saying student right track 
    - student find paragraph tech scientist like sentence where corresponds because answer oxygen tanks didn't from paragraph student find paragraph

    - student found oxygen tank 
    - student question 
    - student finished 
    - more seconds 987654321 right actually start student we'll move around circle  what word circle  
    - student what circle 
    - what student 
    - student what 
    - student what 
    - what  student tell about microscope there 
    - anybody want to-- 
    - student that's that's totally correct think we'd agree microscope would look water really closely although think about what happens before point right 
    - student know exactly equipment used discover water moon right think each like piece then just just needed microscope 
    - student like couple people just circle microscope that's great example there multiple tool like just pointed come from things 
    - student need microscope look really closely things what scientist used find water moon 
    - student semi right could went into more detail small machine small machine called lunar orbiter 
    - student very close 
    - student exactly like student thinking what keeps water together passage 
    - student partially correct need microscope however that's didn't just send microscope moon 
    - student well partially correct equipment sent machine called lunar orbiter able across ground surface moon surface check deposit 
    - student then once figured there 
    - student deposits very small water then microscope make sure what thought there okay microscope actually gave evidence 
    - student there water moon 
    - student then tool used microscope 
    - student completely wrong will send small machine really doesn't 
    - student that's said student student right track 
    - student okay said student meet scientific tool called microscope look really closely right microscope piece equipment 
    - yeah sure okay student also right scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
    - valuable okay agree valuable word that's right going look more thing more other word question student could tell what word another word circled 
    - student scientist found crater full water moon absolutely true that's absolutely something reading 
    - student okay there's pieces equipment actually look ng here 
    - student kind version other slits think about 
    - student wouldn't needed pieces equipment actually figure there water moon 
    - student equipment microscope piece scientific equipment correct 
    - student yeah that's right 
    - student awesome okay yeah would used equipment would oxygen they're moon astronaut moon right 
    - student well enough that's right astronaut correct 
    - student well okay pieces equipment correct 
    - okay read student answers think very good points everyone think little more about what question about example question what question 
    - student says nasa sent small machine right enough question sent small machine look better word answer question 
    - student okay said nasa send small machine right think read little 
    - student think even better think that's great response think make amazing response question asking what equipment scientist discover water moon 
    - that's right  what kind learn from student here learn look ng middle ground between both both pretty much gave good answer gave 
    - student really really good almost exactly where want still make couple improvements there close thank student 
    - student that's right piece puzzle right that's what talking earlier mentioned microscope 
    - student know what that's correct statement wrote down need microsoft skype look something that's really small when back look question 
    - student look student answer scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
    - student that's very knowledgeable point 
    - that's very critical tool when learning together group that's awesome dead 
    - student okay track find right answer going deeper 
    - student right small machine that's what using discover where water 
    - okay  student think scientist used microscope look very very closely 
    - student student answer wrong totally right either 
    - would almost there student would because question very specific meaning what piece equipment said small machine 
    - student examples equipment just particular moment 
    - student okay nasa good point question 
    - student sort right send machine 
    - student said scientist equipment like oxygen tanks equipment like oxygen tanks 
    - student really close sure 
    - student obviously true statement right can't live without water 
    - student well microscope definitely equipment used space like because 
    - student okay getting there 
    - okay great okay reread over text because  student really close answer 
    - student well yeah that's what just there 
    - student that's true couldn't crystals investigate without small machine right 
    - student tools used some observation some research 
    - student maybe there's something back text could find some more 's information student information work together come full more complete answer 
    - student okay that's that's part answer could more space more room 
    - student okay good that's good start student answer 
    - student good start 
    - student well completely wrong 
    - student okay yeah understand really close 
    - student yeah look d really close microscope weren't exactly wrong there just more specific answer yeah good 
    - student that's very interesting take actually first read through answering question thought same thing 
    - student because would 
    - student wrong okay just need elaborate little more okay 
    - student right things question about what equipment scientist discover water moon they're moon know they're using oxygen tanks stuff like what need find about water moon 
    - student nasa sent small machine didn't sent astronaut space make sense 
    -  really like what said nasa send small machine right direction want everybody look text 
    - student polar crater student part answer right 
    - student student piece 
    - student yeah sound like agree oxygen tanks when they're space moon think what trying figure 
    - student well student right need microscope look water 
    - student student answer necessarily wrong just little deeper make student answer more detailed just little better what right what great start 
    - student said nasa sent small machine correct send student small machine order discover water 
    - student that's good need 
    - student oxygen tank maybe used breathe 
    - student okay find 
    - student craters water moon 
    - student student answer incredibly wrong headed right direction would definitely need microscope because water 
    - student student answer scientist found crater full water moon article found crater some water moon didn't full water 
    - student mhmm good student answer just needed little more whole small piece answer 
    - because student just responded thinks knows just about everything about  want tell really enjoyed reading student answer because talked about water split said split into parts hydrogen oxygen correct 
    - student okay yeah student right scientist would oxygen tank breathe space 
    - student yeah maybe just little more attention exact question correct student response just didn't specifically answer question 
    - astronauts didn't oxygen oxygen tanks like student said 
    - yeah okay look ng student responses will student probably closest getting correct answer student response 
    - student sounds filming crater full water moon okay find crater water 
    - student necessarily 
    - right student nasa send small machine student almost 100% right 
    - student right okay good maybe microscope isn't what used discover 
    - because look listen look student answers student said scientist found crater full water moon 
    - student that's entirely true find water some places 
    - microscopes discover things just like guys said tool help discover things 
    - student what tool scientist used microscope 
    - student think both right fact scientific tool just need clarify what tool 
    - right small machine great student 
    - student moon isn't ready live student absolutely right 
    - student tools scientist just make sure student reading question what specific equipment used discover water moon okay 
    - student okay would would correct there's definitely oxygen space 
    - student well part part answer 
    - student okay well student able find there used small machine know very good able discover sort what answer 
    - student know correct student able find where able find water 
    - student well would definitely equipment especially know breathe sort operate within space around moon moon good yeah yeah 
    - student totally sure could like maybe entire moon being covered garden 
    - student wrong answer could better ch ice going talk about more about when talking just like brought discover before when look question look discover 
    - student both right track here equipment they're using microscope water 
    - student might made observation about scientist find ng crater which very good student noticing crater that's where water 
    - student partially correct student right sense nasa send small machine 
    - student correct nasa types equipment boots special special article clothing some some things like oxygen tanks different things things might like when they're exploring space around space missions they're talking about machine find about find about deposit 
    - student yeah that's really good question lunar orbiter wouldn't need microscope 
    - student student partially right when kind 
    - student that's really interesting don't know that's truth mean don't know like that's like truthful like 
    - talk about student student answer scientist equipment like oxygen tanks true 
    - student that's true tell read part text that's true student talking about water which questions asking talk about water 
    - student right student definitely right 
    -   on said need scientific tool called microscope look really closely water moon guys both right track guys really thinking like where student headed 
    - student absolutely absolutely some great observations yeah absolutely would equipment nasa would refer back question what equipment scientist discover water moon 
    - student scientific tool think right track 
    - perfect student absolutely right track 
    - student absolutely student absolutely right equipment huge what 
    - think guys great right track 
    - student absolutely fact true focus what question actually asking 
    - student yeah said would look closely discover d found there water there 
    - student microscope 
    - student correct scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
    - student think answers getting right track 
    - student getting right answer 
    - student know what mean microscope look closely water 
    - student equipment while moon stuff like 
    - well that's very good microscope would part answer lunar orbiter would also part answer right student 
    - okay student look student answer said scientist equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks very true know when space need oxygen able breathe 
    - student scientists need other other equipment like oxygen tanks when into space help 
    - student small actually smaller small microscopic really word means very very small small enough where can't actually without special tool 
    - student that's great question student partially right entirely there student very right when actually microscope water absolutely 
    - student that's absolutely right only halfway right know foot door rest 
    - student halfway 
    -  student absolutely microscope actually water 
    - student sure absolutely some equipment moon can't imagine just know stroll moon absolutely equipment there student wrong regard 
    - student essence yeah should probably oxygen tanks when space need breathe right 
    - student student right whenever into space there's equipment into space moon land moon 
    - student absolutely student initial answer correct need water able drink able survive 
    - what miss  just read what's advantages told makes think there might full water what guys think 
    - student oxygen tanks find water know exactly purpose oxygen tanks designed 
    - student right even though wasn't even though didn't oxygen takes help mission find samples 
    - student okay look ng wouldn't need space exploration 
    - student tools like 
    - student well right thing then find other tool scientist used almost right just more tool 
    - student helped saying there matter microscope still trying figure what other tool even audio 
    - student microscope wrong we've answered part question want says what other what tool found tool want find other tool microscope correct want find other tool also story even said 
    - student items needed find water moon find other item needed moon 
    - student think helped each other come conclusion bunch answers might thought after read first time ice talk other people ideas right 
    - student okay student answer wasn't completely wrong mention nasa send small machine 
    - student would love actual student student answer completely wrong 
    - student yeah pretty good response because lunar orbiter definitely small machine what sent moon 
    - student really awesome response because definitely true scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
    - student yeah definitely like used oxygen tanks equipment 
    - student okay really good thing bring on appreciate student response isn't wrong just focus different section text kind focused microscope very right 
    - student that's great that's great answer small machine that's what microscope real word want find here last paragraph 
    - student would wouldn't thing found water 
    - student okay well after asked question student answer maybe didn't include what question look ng 
    -  student also found different paragraph there multiple answers 
    - yeah there's multiple pieces equipment that's guys answering

    - student ever seen something through microscope 
    - student what thing 
    - student that's really good well sounds exciting enjoy student self nasa 
    - good information anybody else anything about input what think about space 
    - student would-- think would need oxygen tanks 
    - about  tell something know about space also what  student telling 
    - good point because atmosphere which breathe which oxygen tanks talking about going into space messed then won't here earth would look some other place possibly live about student anything input 
    - well that's people aren't into space some people more into environment like  talking about some people into oceans stuff which very interesting learn about about  input group 
    - student what would consider fiction nonfiction story 
    - student laughs 
    - student didn't phones back then cell phones like didn't anything like wind wall 
    - student gasps 
    - student there cartoons book about phones 
    - student people thought just going be-- science fiction realistic today 
    - student right right used science fiction would able into space which what we've studying about space going moon being able different explorations like seen latest results stuff from titan moon saturn 
    - student saturn moon floating around there's actually moon that's called titan think found life 
    - student gasps 
    - student well they're microscopic aliens live very very cold because really really cold moon moon like below zero really cold there think equipment like what moon was-- used find water moon think found some lifeforms existed titan 
    - student that's pretty good stuff what think about audio know there outer space stuff 
    - student we'll into more study about outer space different equipment they're using rockets satellites stuff they're using there 
    - anything else interest student about aliens moon saturn 
    - student student answer wasn't wrong talking about atmosphere which something exploring space find different atmospheres would hold life from earth which very good said 
    - student would make what would need order able really good garden moon 
    - student would bring artificial greenhouse something like possibly maybe 
    - everybody like reading 
    - student like martian 
    - student yeah good movie 
    - student where find water 
    - student polar crater what mean around earth bottom 
    - student well science videos family love watch science videos documentaries great places learn 
    - student great place learn more about what talking about 
    - student kind think about like refrigerator 
    - student somebody asked what keeps student food cold would like refrigerator wouldn't plug plugs into outlet supplies power 
    - student well fact when first grade wanted astronaut obviously didn't live know goal 
    - student texas florida john kennedy center or-- 
    - student think that's named after president kennedy 
    - while student look ng back student because pretty excited astronaut 
    - student mean know everything about what scientist using space oxygen tank work 
    - anyone ever microscope before 
    - student what some thoughts student text prior answering questions 
    - student next time invite 
    - student convince people student best minecraft what 
    - student well actually show beating game right student using actions instead word convince 
    - student know name facility student works 
    - student well that's that's unfortunate able speak regular basis perhaps some online activity hearing stories 
    - student right because look ng what equipment just like today sitting front okay student sitting there school 
    - scientist astronaut there's some things know right every student student school right what's equipment right thats helping student work student 
    - student glad brought about nasa because know what today when learning student tablets 
    - student pencil front things changing just like when research 
    - student enjoy reading passage 
    - student want each little piece paper don't want write down what know about space okay 
    - alright over want share partner first group going    three work together   work share what know about space okay each other quietly okay y'all turn each other show each other what know about space 
    - student okay what's something today student ever used want look something very close really small what's something could 
    - student yeah like magnifying glass many ever seen microscope 
    - right student where microscope 
    - already know about space good what want tell about space student 
    - student correct went nasa well when younger different times kinds really cool equipment 
    - student great time there well 
    - student question asked about equipment article talking about moon like desert anything about moon being like desert when student 
    - well that's great seems like learned something today anyone else know moon like desert 
    - student isn't tell what know about space 
    - student there's interesting stuff like gravity others 
    - student like don't know necessarily possible read that's super cool where read 
    - student possibly mean point time year anything could happen honestly wouldn't surprised next year something crazy everything happening 
    - student tool give some examples tool debbie student hand raised give example tool 
    - yeah absolutely that's absolutely right there anybody else wanted share tool 
    - student wouldn't stranded right think about like station drive very need fill station station what allow fill student halfway through trip 
    - student won't like student going beach halfway there's station turn back around right 
    - student we'll just more keep going 
    - student know least growing always most confident when came answering questions even knew know knew answer easy plus four maybe actually wouldn't 
    - student answer fear ridicule from friends even teacher 
    - student like 
    - student look something that's smaller because didn't eyes 
    - student like organisms 
    - student knows what periodic element oxygen 
    - student periodic element table there owed stands oxygen water on 
    - student okay where left talking about elements water element periodic table 
    - student know anywhere else might microscope 
    - what oxygen tanks usually designed anybody know 
    - student know what oxygen suits student classmates might 
    - that's really cool fact student where read 
    - student okay what about equipment that's talked about text 
    - student moon 
    - student awesome well since student gone there could think like things there 
    - student yeah think something eggs something military both might something like that's really cool that's really cool yeah 
    - everybody here knowledge space just couple 
    - there an more knowledge guys student 
    - student went nasa really 
    - yeah anyone else seen anything from nasa reach 
    - student well yeah yeah 
    - would anyone ever want space 
    - student experience 
    - student what about would want would 
    - student water hiding crater 
    - student maybe maybe we'll read about next time 
    - student like read 
    - that's love answer like garden student self student 
    - student know about space really where learn about space from book museum 
    - student person passionate about space want astronaut when student older 
    - good afternoon everyone everyone please raise student hand 
    - thank  would anybody else like tell about before move forward student 
    - that's pretty amazing student wonder student ever seen lunar escape lunar orbiter 
    - student okay well maybe don't know tell what what know about space 
    - student would love wonder hope they're selling tickets soon moon base 
    - student ahead like shirt same shirt actually that's really cool shirt 
    - student agree think moon something away hear certain things about pictures know round objects crater 
    - student never think about would actually exist there walk around moon agree think that's really cool thing 
    - surprised student scientist found water moon 
    - about student surprised 
    - student yeah either think that's what scientist thought 
    - about student surprised 
    - student yeah article made think about something that's that's really good reason reading current news 
    - about student 
    - student yeah thought great really liked space like seeing moon there night fact there's water really intriguing 
    - know there's there information article wasn't there student someone who's experienced about space wasn't there information about article 
    - student like reading over paragraph know find interesting thoughts 
    - yeah student like spark interest 
    - student that's more like know mean i've i've like crater like swimming well that's different 
    - awesome thanks student okay first briefly before know tackle student guys's responses wanted know just raise hands would love moon someday 
    - student want moon 
    - absolutely know some didn't raise student hand wouldn't want moon anyone wants share 
    - kind unpack lunar orbiter minute minute there anyone chance group speak spanish raise hands anyone

    - student really favorite topics especially when student 
    - student yeah that's great fact things think remember right like pounds something don't feel when student bouncing around moon right because gravity different 
    - anybody know what water made what types molecules water made anybody know 
    - student what some jobs what some some people usually investigate know 
    - student yeah that's really good question there's much technology world times places without actually physically being there right we've seen cameras we've seen like 
    - really student some what where else would explore that's outer space maybe actually yeah outer space what's another planet would explore really small machine could 
    - that's cool student what about where would what planning would 
    - student hydrogen part heard people talk about 
    - student okay found there's there's some there's hydrogen there maybe part water would exciting right because there's water know

    - also talk about crater story which  brought everybody little part story want talk about what found find water moon don't student 
    - student before even look into text want look question question specifically asking what equipment scientist discover water 
    - right there know want look some sort equipment based around water text evidence something wanted talk guys about 
    - student text evidence going support student answers pull straight from text always know student answers close semi correct 
    - student evidence really important word because means there's going proof passage want find proof question what equipment discover water 
    - student right equipment such question specifically wants know what equipment discover water 
    - student about word evidence word value 
    - student evidence means going prove answer passage tells answer question will there convincing evidence will there we'll find 
    -  student ready come back answer want investigate some other answers first 
    - student know sure paragraph tell scientist used 
    - awesome student could rewrite student answer include piece information 
    - okay question what equipment scientist sentence mentioned scientist actually microscope student 
    - scientists yeah thinking about equipment student  student answer mentioned equipment 
    - trying text text mention oxygen tanks student 
    - student question both scientist actually equipment when working moon 
    - absolutely student asked what equipment scientist discover water moon would answer using text al evidence 
    - student student right talk about water look discussion question 
    - student anything about equipment used 
    - student need narrow down student answer more specific 
    - okay student which what what where circle word 
    - student what important word words circle question 
    - just like student asked discover water 
    - student when read deeper into passage answer gave else could found what other olive ice could used find water moon crater 
    - student think could important express water valuable future 
    - student equipment find water moon 
    - student yeah which really isn't telling 
    - student what machine right 
    - student find anything talking about oxygen 
    - student scientists oxygen tanks discover water moon 
    - think student told about oxygen tanks oxygen tanks discover water moon something else 
    - student okay know know much still don't know what used discover water moon 
    - student find evidence when look ng answer different question 
    - think student asking about equipment that's used water would need different equipment only just parts would help discover water 
    - student think-- 
    - student right that's look ng 's answer said nasa send small machine what else could instead just small machine 
    - student well yeah what else could student answer instead just saying small machine could made more depth answered more depth 
    - student small machine could anything couldn't 
    - student what else could student answer 
    - student know what small machine called 
    - teacher know want student self position little when response like hard know what meant because maybe what grade student paper before grade student 
    - student okay there's definitely some room improvement there gave some good information 
    - student improvement tell what changes make 
    - student depending size could lunar order maybe also small machine 
    - just kind circle back little think  we've kind talked some other people student there feel about student answer giving another shot what might instead 
    - student perfect what microscope attached 
    - student didn't didn't actually name machine right 
    - student look into student statement answer question 
    - student that's going very valuable what else valuable there talks about there 
    - student going information just part 
    - student that's right what else what other purposes takes point answer 
    - student right used what else 
    - student right what know there's more think 
    - very much student there's more 
    - student right what would being able split hydrogen oxygen apart what benefit would give astronaut 
    - that's good answer student just need little more detail 
    - student would would work atmosphere right 
    - student like discussing last session about what thought science fiction long time like wrinkle time actually happen possibly lifetime where they're able 
    - student need into little more detail 
    - student right water being moon future continue space journeys explorations then possibly water will very very valuable moon 
    - student according think people actually moon time just send machine called lunar lunar orbiter 
    -  student other ke word 
    - student there could would great another reason look back people base don't need oxygen breathe 
    - student would oxygen breathing what about hydrogen part would hydrogen useful 
    -  student student answers changed after discussing 's 's 's 
    - student what what into little more detail 
    - student yeah since they're small amounts going able like amount water earth 
    - student good okay found piece equipment found tool used microscope used find water begin first machine find water 
    - student think student answer wrong 
    -  same answer student follow along what just went 
    - student okay oxygen tanks allows breathe better when they're moon 
    - student well take microscope moon 
    - student just want little clarification 
    - student well yeah think about like what uses talks about microscope right microscope small right could talking about know oxygen tank wanted know specifically knew what equipment used know what mean 
    - student needs clarified 
    - student what 
    - student okay could valuable astronaut 
    - student right what think student answer 
    - student okay think think take space hip could easier without weight water 
    - student hold just said haven't moon 
    - student yeah would valuable resource 
    - student okay what mean what water essential 
    - student right well yeah take literally essentially central take bath right essential drink water 
    - student okay well read article question 
    - student okay what question asking 
    -  question said circled same student actually read article 
    - student mean already find water 
    - there okay student where find ng water 
    - student microscope actually find water 
    - student okay reasons could valuable 
    - student okay read paragraph listen hear somewhere else 
    - there other word important student 
    - student okay need look closely means already found right 
    - student okay nasa send small machine called lunar orbiter investigate look question answers what equipment scientist discover water moon 
    - student says good good don't carry ships an more that's some good information convince water moon valuable 
    - student what think think that's partially convincing evidence water moon could valuable 
    - student okay well just because can't right moment mean future wouldn't valuable what think 
    - student maybe instead using word tool could different word what would another word 
    - student expanding thinking want learn more okay important read discuss learn little more about water moon 
    - student improve response what could improve response 
    - anybody else answer question though need microscope water there water crater there just little water crater 
    - student what discover before microscope 
    - student yeah before microscope what discover 
    - student microscopes moon would maybe collect samples then we'll back earth 
    - student type equipment used discover investigate water 
    - student there better answer 
    - student there type equipment might used investigate water 
    - anyone know 
    - student however best piece evidence grab from article 
    - student okay just told water split into parts hydrogen oxygen tell information about moon about astronaut 
    - student right after reading last paragraph just read 
    - just like student mentioned some well equipment while that's true what used 
    - sorry guys says would need scientific tool called microscope look really closely okay that's what nasa sent though student 
    - student that's what sent 
    - student used 
    - student could restate question 
    - student restate question answer know when student reciting 
    - student question 
    - student what will know number like somebody didn't know what what passage even about could read answer question know taught what talking about could restate question 
    - student little deeper tell really valuable right 
    - student think about feel valuable while little deeper tell going valuable while 
    - student like things time money wasn't problem could know think about 
    - know trying think about issues could important think about next time okay student 
    - student fact water split telling anything about good space tell 
    - student just says found evidence there water found water just evidence meaning seen water there mean there's 
    - student whole whole thing article about about water moon think space uit could help find water just tool astronaut protect 
    - student student answer talked about microscope being tool what microscope discover water used look water 
    - student that's right examine water they're using microscope examine water equipment used discover 
    - student okay water could other word could important 
    - already telling valuable  student know here weren't quite sure valuable resource heading first line already start identifying valuable resource 
    - student says what equipment scientist used discover water moon small machine could mean anything 
    - student understand what student saying same time student able find water moon 
    - student moving forward could very valuable 
    - right what oxygen tank student 
    - student astronauts could what water 
    - student there water moon help 
    - student mean example small machine could sort mean could anything know from maybe even remote even clock wall can't sort discover water moon 
    - student example need need water live earth 
    - student able know perhaps expand know space traveling capabilities able actually water moon might little more inexpensive inexpensive actually transport 
    - anybody might know another reason might actually sort beneficial water moon might actually help astronaut 
    - student think perhaps like said perhaps future there enough evidence know know least going forward some type know human habitation there surface moon water become more valuable live there 
    - student okay when answer something think sometimes maybe little more specific there's confusion 
    - student think took student answer send small machine which student correctly what else could make little more clear somebody idea what student talking about 
    - student okay could what machine what what machine here being used 
    - student need expand upon some answers 
    - student scientific tool called microscope microscope what show 
    - student when look student answer oxygen tanks equipment used discover water 
    - yeah then also when talking student 
    - student just need support 
    - absolutely look back some answers look d question what equipment scientist used discover water moon answers microscope small machine then some other equipment which answer makes most sense what would found moon student 
    - student student time look back what equipment passage 
    - student said nasa sent small machine what word find what word what pieces equipment find 
    - student microscope wasn't best choice 
    - student because microscope tool fact 
    - student makes sense able they're saying look really closely water would need tool discover another word find water only other piece equipment text small machine called 
    - student right microscope help water what's thing helps water first place 
    - student point nasa small machine microscope small machine right 
    - student question would know water valuable even split what parts would question 
    - student there other ways which water that's found moon 
    - student think other reasons water would valuable resource because based what we've talked about today 
    - student would change student answer want keep same what student already down 
    - student okay water important many since article about water says whole time throughout article 
    - student need oxygen tanks moon 
    - student that's true very true people moon though 
    - student people moon article what just read anything about people being moon article 
    - student true there title machine there name machine number 
    - student yeah after number where student answer read rest response rest article 
    - student yeah talk about using microscope equipment what used moon there microscope there moon look need something else before could microscope 
    - student used microscope what name machine needed space remember 
    - student what 
    - student underline 
    - student time share person beside would like person each group share answers group  want view give what word guys underlying question 
    - student question wondering student answer wasn't best answer correct 
    - student yeah okay know student answer could wasn't best answer 
    - student what word could underline question help answer best answer 
    - student okay like underline equipment good word underline correct there another word question help under help answer question 
    - depth tell what word guys underline 
    - student could more specific answering student student answer  
    - student could more specific student answer 
    - student teacherr could look back 
    - student find answer 
    - student no ice anything could more specific student answer 
    - student talking about equipment anything from microscope giant rocket anything 
    - yeah guess student also soften student answer water microscopic  just from lunar orbiter above above moon special kind equipment 
    - student after after reading paragraph three think able water eyes 
    - anyone want share what circled 
    - okay student find anything helps change student answer circling word question 
    -   student able find paragraph where talking about answers 
    - think student answer answers question student 
    - student think there's another part student answer other small microscope 
    - student student text doesn't there astronaut 
    - student there able observe said water 
    - student used order find water don't think quite 
    - student yeah maybe look back down student answer which there full water moon 
    - student completely accurate 
    - want guys after student talked student partners student group members circled underline terms text student questions guys think could reconstruct student answer just little more detailed 
    - student remember uses microscope humans look through microscope right scientist look through microscope 
    - student remember what called machine science sorts wacky names machine that's what look ng look ng find name what small machine 
    - student totally yeah look text look back think close same line about small machine sure know 
    - student yeah totally microscope look three sentences here three paragraph 
    - student paragraph three says water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able look ng straight would need scientific cool tool called microscope look really closely there's part microscope before then 
    - student where found called lunar orbiter paragraph right 
    - student yeah what machine call 
    - student tiny water well love lunar orbiter going into polar crater look ng small water where's small water located 
    - student what form like 
    - student looking giant lake look ng what yeah well what form water what same text part don't 
    - student what equipment okay look ng name what's name small machine came 
    - student yeah think there even very short text different pieces equipment mentioned right 
    - student third paragraph tell scientist used microscope find water 
    - awesome student which piece equipment think most important here 
    - student awesome little machine lands moon 
    - student yeah that's right doesn't really scientist using 
    - yeah that's awesome text both found text question what small machine student what machine 
    - student alright sound 
    - student could yeah look something discover 
    - talking about what equipment maybe equipment name right what small machine name anybody anybody circle what small machine called 
    - student microscope great example piece equipment also thing called lunar orbiter investigate things work together 
    - looking both sentences guys want look student sheet paper student look ng word lunar orbiter microscope there word kind signal what equipment 
    - student there second part sentence tells maybe what called like name equipment 
    - going paragraph going read while reading look ng student 
    - student going look paragraph okay just want listen while reading find particular equipment might stop talk about okay 
    - student means moon still drier driest desert earth water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able look ng straight 
    - need scientific toll called microscope look really closely what microscope helping guys 
    - student because passage look back find says nasa sent small machine called looper lunar orbiter investigate lunar orbiter look deposit large polar crater what name machine called 
    - student small machine look back what that's called read sentence okay number nasa sent small machine called lunar orbiter investigate 
    - student what microscope what microscope text 
    - find water before look right anyone know what discover means 
    - student right discover when find find first going lunar orbiter find before look 
    - student okay microscope discover water 
    - student need scientific tool called microscope look very closely 
    - student look back student passage what equipment find water 
    - student look number 
    - student lunar orbiter look deposit large polar crater deposit very small what what 
    - student back text specific answers from text what equipment 
    - student need back into text find specifically where states what equipment used discover water moon 
    - student back into text look 
    - student says text back look 
    - student text 
    - back look what's another word student 
    - student small machine right what name machine 
    - student look what what says astronaut 
    - student water main 
    - student what astronaut water 
    - student what text about astronaut water should under bottle water valuable source valid valuable resource what 
    - student right hydrogen oxygen 
    - student back think second paragraph you'll nasa sent small machine called lunar orbiter investigate lunar orbiter look deposit large polar crater 
    - student that's where found think right 
    - student landed moon south pole that's where found look d deposit since wasn't necessarily water frozen water look large polar crater guess really cold 
    - underlined equipment discover great tell just reading passage student tell what word equipment might refer passage what kind equipment scientist discover water moon 
    - student deposits what tell what says deposit very small 
    - very small they're look ng something very small they're take lunar orbiter there also read paragraph three student 
    - student word could that's second sentence circle word could student pencil will second sentence paragraph four says could useful lots ways 
    - student would think word useful also same maybe valuable look back paragraph telling could useful 
    - student stop second what first paragraph tells know 
    - student okay someone paraphrase paragraph 
    - student yeah what would deposit what think would look like 
    - student tool because deposit small can't student eyes tool microscope able 
    - student okay moisture that's still bigger moisture found moon frost naked what found moon would even able tell there without lunar orbiter microscope being able 
    - student okay think water moon look same glass water would drink 
    - student paragraph three what about 
    - student when when says able 
    - student what right after 
    - student good glass water lunch can't wait there's something glass 
    - student what tell water moon what compared water here 
    - student well might because found crater there might lots there small can't naked know turned before naked yeah 
    - student think lunar orbiter being able 
    - student because remember paragraph three says wouldn't able water 
    - student found there 
    - student right passage only talking about 
    - student what found moon there anything passage talks about oxygen 
    - student lunar orbiter helped find water want look paragraph three 
    - student what about water paragraph three 
    - student what need find can't 
    - student look paragraph 
    - student fourth sentence look down four sentence 
    - student right here ounces 
    - student would though word water take surface which 
    - student couldn't even describe would trucks trucks loads topsoil okay upload moon still would only fill glass 
    - student would like look back student paragraph find 
    - student answer 
    - okay student correct nasa sand small machine look back student paragraph find name machine 
    - okay anybody paragraph four word valuable actually beginning paragraph 
    - student lunar orbiter different called lunar orbiter what 
    - student discover water microscope 
    - student look back paragraph second 
    - sent orbiter look clues didn't talk anyone moon sent lunar look clues what find lunar orbiter 
    - student lunar orbiter discover ng orbiting look ng around used investigate 
    - student remind what investigating means 
    - student good look clues order figure there water moon 
    - also water firsthand what water student 
    -  able relate what student saying where lunar orbiter what actually discover water microscope what study water 
    - student right discover water lunar orbiter okay someone raise student hand tell some other equipment we've talked about reading 
    - student what we've talked about lunar lunar orbiter we've talked about microscope there other equipment they've talked about 
    - student what read what read paragraph there other equipment discussed paragraph read 
    - student exactly right send small machine know what small machine called 
    - student okay want look back passage figure what small machine called 
    - okay many guys look ng word water passage 
    - student whenever look ng passage able read understand moon same thing water 
    - lunar orbiter paragraph says look deposit large polar crater deposit very small answer help student 
    - student look back text where text find word look word machine machine there 
    - student exactly exactly back look text 
    - student what look ng 
    - student asking text field like back text there's piece equipment used look ng water right 
    - student right exactly think microscope help look water while they're physically moon 
    - student right look text lunar orbiter right 
    - microscopes both there when talking specifically about find ng water look back text find where says film equipment used find water moon yeah student 
    - student back text look first part where they're talking about piece equipment 
    - student they've talked about moon being desert right think there's water 
    - student then look ng what 
    - student well look ng water moon right 
    - student what about lunar orbiter 
    - student okay think little more about questions because says word essential student answer word equipment word water think about word before make answer 
    - read said student said scientist used equipment like oxygen tanks question asking about what using moon something savanah 
    - student what think microscope look really closely what think need look things really closely 
    - student that's amazing really know what something microscope something really really really small right 
    - student example think microscope 
    - student read text 
    - student even little more basic there what equipment talk about text what what what's getting used 
    - very good very good glad student seeing take look back student no ice paragraph could some insight take back what sort equipment mentioned specifically paragraph 
    - student also part getting moon about search ng there we've whole elaborate backstory right what makes very interesting read 
    - student while there some water there might whole might buckets buckets buckets oceans water 
    - student make sure speaking nasa they're ones sent lunar orbiter right 
    - student they're ones microscope look small small know article water when find moon know they're kind subject they're kind article talking about right 
    - student that's part actually goes down look very closely need figure found water crater correct 
    - student once take quick glance 
    - student what find 
    - student right what text tell about 
    - student correct what's small machine called 
    - student what nasa sent will look going help read okay nasa send small machine what just first little text tell 
    - student right what called 
    - student what about water split into 
    - student what could possibly water used 
    - nasa said small machine pull d from second paragraph everyone will look back second paragraph 
    - discovered student later they're going other equipment right they've discover d water later study deeper 
    - student into water right want look closely that's what passage says tell want look really closely paragraph three going need another tool called 
    - student microscope microscope scientist using equipment 
    - student scientists using equipment 
    - student using microscope what microscope helping scientist 
    - student right correct using microscope study look deeper into water first find water equipment small lunar orbiter that's what passage about 
    - student then later passage learned used other equipment study water deeper 
    - student where find passage 
    - student well microscope able look microscopic things moon find water digging equipment 
    - student right important thing separated oxygen astronaut could breathe also fuel hydrogen oxygen separate into atoms make fuel 
    - student remember atmosphere what breathe oxygen and-- 
    - student moon doesn't oxygen 
    - student well rockets hydrogen will break into-- breaks down able make rocket fuel which help space rafts move like story like cars know 
    - student helps student without student won't just like rocket fuel which made different strands hydrogen also some oxygen would fill tank move throughout space 
    - student water heavy there water moon then wouldn't carry which would drain fuel supply would also take space spacecraft being able stop somewhere pick water better carry around time water heavy 
    - student okay look look back reading says nasa send small machine called lunar orbiter investigate 
    - student there isn't said didn't clearly there people there would assume well would just machine called lunar orbiter 
    - student look back paragraph take moment look back paragraph 
    - student then paragraph threee says found water found microscopic meaning super small microscope look 
    - okay water paragraph okay what different form water there's different forms water there's frozen form what called student 
    - student just different form just water different form frozen solid 
    - student okay look back text real quick 
    - student when discover something student correct doesn't doesn't discover 
    - student right know people earth water live water moon 
    - student don't worry about bringing water could just drink water moon stay hydrated 
    - student second sentence correct right water broken down into parts hydrogen oxygen 
    - student important what's reason would want break down what reason wanted break down water into hydrogen oxygen what could hydrogen oxygen 
    - student look paragraph five 
    - student could split water hydrogen oxygen rocket fuel that's could moon leave from moon right that's another reason water could such valuable commodity 
    - student nope because we've more 
    - student perfect okay want start look ng over question paragraph okay look paragraph passage 
    - anybody tell heard something sentences just read sounds like might answer question what equipment used 
    - student okay what seeing paragraph three second sentence starts saying 
    - student water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able look ng straight student need scientific tool called microscope look really closely 
    - student that's very good question what going considered look back little further before microscope 
    - student perfect okay i'll read second sentence after tell what nasa send investigate tell what called 
    - student know scientist back paragraph found there water moon because crater find crater remember happened just read little part 
    - student about oxygen tanks find maybe another type equipment might used help find water moon 
    - student says means moon still drier driest desert earth water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able even student look ng straight 
    - student there oxygen tanks microscope there that's what says 
    - student well look first paragraph could read 
    - student correct crater where full water water below crater 
    - student student correct four glasses water water moon 
    - student very much think could fill crater 
    - student they're they're full there's such tiny amount water almost special tool 
    - student student right lunar lunar orbiter find water moon find water little water 
    - student think really great starting answers just want really work look ng text little more make answers more complete built text al evidence reading 
    - student think different strengths here just want really prac ice just like knowing content also being able skill backing responses text evidence from text 
    - student okay think part what right isn't just about knowledge what learning 
    - first thing want talk about when here group want think what question asking what what mean circle evidence yeah student 
    - student lunar orbiter will land moon south pole look deposit large polar crater deposit very small scientist said lastudent moon surface would hold total about ounces water what deposit 
    - student some really great responses going make sure answers proven from text 
    - student text tells astronaut using water from moon need back into text figure think water moon could valuable 
    - student well learn some more 
    - thank joining small group table guys appreciate answers gave ahead review some things we've talked about 
    - student well great know about space going specifically talk about moon water found moon 
    - going look questions okay want just want guys look together deeper understanding reading passage 
    - student want look deeper into question asked okay because struggled little giving specific answer question okay 
    - everybody want challenge think about answer right find evidence text support answer student what's going

    - student there's just things need work order create better responses better understanding text 
    - here because concerns about each student guys's responses water moon passage going work improving student 
    - student know about space doesn't really anything learning about space going about improving responses questions when read passage 
    - reason five today because some concerns about student responses would like address improve guys better understand 
    - -student have better understanding answer questions given after reading passage awesome 
    - everyone today heard read water moon correct anyone everyone read want revise answers because understanding didn't deep deep understanding going today want one-- student 
    - everyone today going revising answers from question what equipment scientist discover water moon 
    - everyone good understanding reading want work answers just little because think getting little confused between aspects first before share answers student want independently minute look question 
    - student well really want work because want hear what student answer want know what make even better 
    - think maybe guys good understanding text think little deeper relate text student answers pull evidence from text 
    - student from reading 
    - student however think important sometimes even know material think good work word things just really working answering questions skills really helpful 
    - student true however today using science 
    - student drive reading skills actually going using science reading about science about 
    - guys done going using reading 
    - student going reviewing responses questions 
    - student actually going using reading work reading skills going learning also- about science 
    - student also going learning work reading writing skills 
    - student work break down questions such 
    - student think more work answers make little more expectation using specific language 
    - text uses well just working writing skills like said student earlier just working science skills also working reading writing skills 
    - yeah also using today only reading help know little more about space like student knows about 
    - student also going using reading learn prac ice reading writing skills understanding break down 
    - student information might even know about stuff 
    - just want make sure everybody using right language everybody understands find find evidence answer such student student hand well

    - student yeah yeah 
    - student went nasa know time equipment like oxygen tanks masks suits 
    - student good 
    -  want tell guys pick microscope 
    - student yeah okay used stuff discover d discover 
    - student well don't understand answer's wrong 
    - student nasa send small machine quarterly order investigate 
    - student well knowledge relates-- knowledge relates question story well mean know astronaut need equipment order moon part feel like that's knowledge relates because know need oxygen tanks order breathe moon 
    - student yeah think gotta what 
    - student unfortunately 
    - student yeah exactly because microscope equipment like tool look things really small 
    - student yeah science 
    - student yeah sorry just look d clock lunch really bummed because feel like just getting park 
    - student yeah well just said what said before because like something don't want first like gone first would said microscope already just said what 
    - student excuse 
    - student yeah yeah that's makes sense yeah 
    - student okay look ng equipment gotcha 
    - student yeah okay think think just read more carefully next time maybe could find right answer 
    - student i'll share share 
    - student time goal right wanted thank paying attention each answers giving each something specific think about talk about 
    - time lunch sorry really student 
    - yeah same page student here kind agree because like 
    - student yeah we'll 
    - student yeah cool 
    - student well just think they're build base 2024 which would really cool 
    - student more evidence 
    - student sorry time 
    - student yeah exactly about water 
    - student makes sense thank 
    - student okay said nasa send small machine pick d from part because says machine investigate thought sounded kind close question 
    - student sure sounds great 
    - student thank 
    - student yeah thinking about equipment since circle text went nasa know scientist equipment like oxygen tanks masks suits 
    - student because look ng ke word equipment discover water moon 
    - student yeah sorry teacher wasn't machine guess science teacher might look ng equipment 
    - sorry teacher just look ng clock actually time want thank kept asking questions everybody took time explain 
    - student said scientist found crater full water moon 
    - student water scientist need come plan extracting getting polar crater making planet tickle don't even know water 
    - student found somewhere because thought underline 
    - student yeah guess 
    - student okay 
    - student still kind confused 
    - student yeah also really picture because went nasa found scientist equipment like like oxygen tanks masks suits 
    - student yeah read there could base moon 2024 
    - student yeah okay what scientist discover water moon 
    - student really guess caught circle word scientist because there scientist moon oxygen tanks 
    - well just wanted share went nasa know scientist equipment like like oxygen tanks like student said also masks suits 
    - shouldn't group already know about space 
    - student okay 
    - student teacher student frozen hear 
    - student sorry just look d clock 
    - student yeah 
    - student yeah yeah wanted know answer okay water scientist found moon microscopic 
    - student circled water moon also discover 
    - student sent small machine called lunar orbiter investigate 
    - student teacher look ng clock time lunch want appreciate kept asking questions know like think about 
    - student wasn't question teacher just look ng clock look like time lunch what wanted thank 
    - student ice thing just just part answer 
     - student just wanted match lunch just want thank working like particular 
    - student thank 
    - wondering answer question answer wrong know group sounds like small machine maybe right answer 
    - student think answer question 
    - student great yeah exactly 
    - student okay well then 
    - student answer-- right when said water heavy good don't carry ships anymore 
    - student awesome question like because here like work together like what answer quite right 
    - student yeah yeah that's where mine from 
    - student answer sort right sort wrong like when said like nasa used small machine like initial quite right because didn't orbiter right 
    - student gotcha well lunch just wanted thank working particularly wanted thank correcting look more closely work really valuing thinking because thinking about guess didn't really realize much complete answer really like helped like look text really more complete answer really cool 
    - student well lunar orbiter well changed because asked look text like necessarily background even though know like lots other stuff 
    - student yeah just basically just thinking also 
    - student okay think answer chose valuable important 
    - student answer right 
    - student okay okay 
    - student yeah really interested seeing like found water trying like know what mean like manage look 
    - student well actually question sure like thinking about still don't understand answer wrong 
    - student think just still little confused 
    - student miss jennifer 
    - student don't 
    - student look 
    - student okay lunar orbiter will land moon s south pole look deposit large polar crater 
    - yeah same answer student thought microscope guess guess kind same thing figured when read through microscope only piece equipment like when reading guess could only answer 
    - student yeah would guess sort similar basically what would like word like 
    - student yeah student totally need like could like maybe would maybe valuable 
    - just another piece about like guess like when student saying stuff about water play know what mean like need like evidence from text when seeing like speech like 
     - student okay i'll read guess that's confused because felt like know better time read mine from from from think from paragraph number 
    - guess would like student said where split 
    - student makes sense needs like 
    - student thank 
    - student yeah trying think like explain word know 
    - student actually question sounds like then needed microscope answer wrong like small machine 
    - student yeah don't know here honestly cause gave answer from text 
    - student actually 
    - student okay okay 
    - student okay yeah look more closely what what else going because yeah just connecting what already think what student saying like need need look paper look reading kind pull from from there well right 
    - student yeah yeah 
    - student went nasa know time equipment like oxygen tanks masks suits 
    - student good 
    -  want tell guys pick microscope 
    - student yeah okay used stuff discover d discover 
    - student well don't understand answer's wrong 
    - student nasa send small machine quarterly order investigate 
    - student well knowledge relates-- knowledge relates question story well mean know astronaut need equipment order moon part feel like that's knowledge relates because know need oxygen tanks order breathe moon 
    - student yeah think gotta what 
    - student unfortunately 
    - student yeah exactly because microscope equipment like tool look things really small 
    - student yeah science 
    - student yeah sorry just look d clock lunch really bummed because feel like just getting park 
    - student yeah well just said what said before because like something don't want first like gone first would said microscope already just said what 
    - student excuse 
    - student yeah yeah that's makes sense yeah 
    - student okay look ng equipment gotcha 
    - student yeah okay think think just read more carefully next time maybe could find right answer 
    - student i'll share share

    - time lunch sorry really student 
    - yeah same page student here kind agree because like 
    - student yeah we'll 
    - student yeah cool 
    - student well just think they're build base 2024 which would really cool 
    - student more evidence 
    - student sorry time 
    - student yeah exactly about water 
    - student makes sense thank 
    - student okay said nasa send small machine pick d from part because says machine investigate thought sounded kind close question 
    - student sure sounds great 
    - student thank 
    - student yeah thinking about equipment since circle text went nasa know scientist equipment like oxygen tanks masks suits 
    - student because look ng ke word equipment discover water moon 
    - student yeah sorry teacher wasn't machine guess science teacher might look ng equipment 
    - sorry teacher just look ng clock actually time want thank kept asking questions everybody took time explain 
    - student said scientist found crater full water moon 
    - student water scientist need come plan extracting getting polar crater making planet tickle don't even know water 
    - student found somewhere because thought underline 
    - student yeah guess 
    - student okay 
    - student still kind confused 
    - student yeah also really picture because went nasa found scientist equipment like like oxygen tanks masks suits 
    - student yeah read there could base moon 2024 
    - student yeah okay what scientist discover water moon 
    - student really guess caught circle word scientist because there scientist moon oxygen tanks 
    - well just wanted share went nasa know scientist equipment like like oxygen tanks like student said also masks suits 
    - shouldn't group already know about space 
    - student okay 
    - student teacher student frozen hear 
    - student sorry just look d clock 
    - student yeah 
    - student yeah yeah wanted know answer okay water scientist found moon microscopic 
    - student circled water moon also discover 
    - student sent small machine called lunar orbiter investigate 
    - student teacher look ng clock time lunch want appreciate kept asking questions know like think about 
    - student wasn't question teacher just look ng clock look like time lunch what wanted thank 
    - student ice thing just just part answer 
- intent: r400
  examples: |
    - student didn't exactly answer question about equipment what equipment scientist discover water moon 
    - student little concerned connect question text look ng back question what's question look ng tell able tell what question 
    - student water found would microscope study doesn't explain found water 
    - student wasn't exact answer question student answer would there scientific tool called microscope look really closely water 
    - student well student answer wasn't necessarily incorrect some really good vocabulary terms weren't completely answering question question sorry pull back 
    - student however think point doesn't answer directly main question next step after discover d water moon part equipment discover d what 
    - student correct need microscope look really closely they're asking what equipment scientist discover 
    - student correct need microscope look really closely they're asking what equipment scientist discover microscope equipment look d really closely water discover water microscope 
    - student alright student when look back question says what equipment scientist discover water moon while true scientist oxygen tanks probably very often equipment find water moon 
    - student specific tool used water samples that's what question asking 
    - student student student response scientist found crater full water moon although correct answer wasn't necessarily answering question understand 
    - student because asking about equipment what found 
    - student that's actually really good know about space thing going noticing some responses really pinpointing answering question asked 
    - student that's what that's what question what equipment scientist discover water moon said things what used discover water moon lunar orbiter 
    - student looking used discover find think another equipment mentioned passage apart from microscope 
    - student question actually wanting know what equipment used discover water moon 
    - student student true that's true doesn't answer question while equipment that's what look ng question 
    - student yeah absolutely kind part moon something caught water doesn't quite answer question about being piece equipment scientist using 
    - student specific question wants know what specifically used find water wouldn't necessarily like oxygen tanks things like 
    - student doesn't truly answer question 
    - guys getting there student almost there main concern three didn't fully answer question stated 
    - student however knowledge help overall topic specific question makes sense 
    - student question want make sure student answering what questions asking about equipment expand specifically 
    - student really focused trying find evidence text answer question 
    - student help understand question question specifically asking what what equipment discover water equipment help discover water actual equipment discover ng water 
    - student mentioned microscope which mentioned passage which good just need reread question take step farther because concerned didn't fully understand what question asking 
    - student that's what found look ng what equipment used discover moon 
    - student very good correct tool equipment word hand hand together then back question figure what asking specifically 
    - student didn't talk about equipment 
    - student while oxygen tank mask suits part equipment question only focusing what discover water moon 
    - student question asked talk about equipment 
    - student also student student question student answer equipment well talked about oxygen tanks trying figure which equipment used discover ng water oxygen moon 
    - student what equipment scientist discover water moon oxygen tanks pieces equipment don't really water moon 
    - harris good find ng know what machine equipment using then student recognizing know small machine still missing concept what action will seen right 
    - student another really important part question action 
    - student question want focus equipment discover water 
    - student want reread question because don't think fully understood what question asking 
    - student concerned though question asking specifically water found 
    - student want reread question because don't think fully understood what question asking because student answer didn't anything equipment just said water found moon 
    - student true where discover d water question equipment used 
    - student because look ng specific word equipment 
    - student microscope used discover water article thinking more general what equipment would used along microscope 
    - student talking about equipment name where found question more focused equipment 
    - student question though said what equipment scientist student talking about astronaut 
    - student concerned question asking what used discover water right we've only mentioned tool that's used once discover d 
    - student that's great observation would need focus specific question asking asking 
    - absolutely that's something like student into answer right like correct look ng what question asking 
    - student question based videos watched youtube videos watch about what read 
    - want guys take seconds seconds think what word what word jumps when read question word should will help find answer question okay going give guys seconds seconds think about then going someone volunteer okay 
    - student there different types tool like equipment gear other things right question asking ones will help find water 
    - student connected student background knowledge text reading right only concern didn't answer question originally asked 
    - student which what equipment scientist discover water moon think scientist oxygen tanks discover water moon 
    - student yeah that's actually great background knowledge assignment could also help question being asked 
    - student student correctthat different types equipment astronaut particular question equipment used discover water 
    - student specific equipment scientist find water 
    - student kind need both although really love student answer teach something want answer question 
    - student just concerned understanding full question because question what equipment scientist discover water moon 
    - student right talking about question only suggestion suggestion 
    - student question actually asking what discover water moon while much equipment moon need focus what used discover water specifically 
    - student what useful important saying split into hydrogen oxygen true doesn't totally answer question 
    - student read question carefully would no ice ke word equipment scientist discover lunar 
    - student weren't really thinking about what actually space student right oxygen tanks things like because there oxygen space focusing more water piece versus what space 
    - student think confused question 
    - student however what what question asking 
    - student sure maybe understood question correctly need scientific tool called microscope look really closely 
    - student student sure maybe understood question correctly need scientific tool called microscope look really closely well need microscope look really closely question look ng name piece equipment scientist discover water moon 
    - student right look ng actual piece equipment used discover water moon 
    - student don't think read question correctly either 
    - student question think need little more specific right 
    - student that's right that's very good split into parts hydrogen oxygen think student little confused what questions asking 
    - student lots equipment right that's what there think still little confused about what questions asking 
    - student right like said know that's look question actually specifically pointing toward what's potential value 
    - student read water moon valuable right question actually says could valuable some point future 
    - concern guys want make sure really focusing equipment used scientist find water moon 
    - student yeah correct that's what wear look ng what used find water 
    - student water overload along passage concern other students circle word like equipment agree 
    - student question asking right 
    - student concerned though question asking would want water moon 
    - student really what look ng evidence water moon could valuable 
    - student when look student don't necessarily answer question tell what student getting reading student evidence don't actually specifically answer question then provide evidence then just explain 
    - student concerned though question asking specifically about water 
    - student student definitely right about nasa uses much equipment many different things question only asking specific machine equipment used find water 
    - student true basically just what told student scientist equipment much equipment many different things question only asking specific piece equipment used find water 
    - student think that's answering question 
    - student when look back question only asking specifically what machine used find water other machine 
    - student what 
    - student part question think student missing 
    - student like said because going take time money question answered think would good investment question water valuable 
    - student really want reiterate important question really reading asking enough evidence would valuable they're ready 
    - student because answered whether good investment don't think answer actual question water being valuable think 
    - student great yeah think that's really solid concern would like make sure understanding what question asking 
    - student question what equipment scientist discover crater full water type equipment 
    - right guys want right look question want underline question what think most important word word question 
    - student mind reading question find ng word think really important 
    - student want look back question just read want find most important word word think most important question 
    - student question which most important word pick 
    - student want look question want find action word because we've underline equipment we've underline water haven't underline action word 
    - right everybody find action word underline 
    - student look back question find word question synonym investigate 
    - student when answering questions need make sure answering question that's being asked okay 
    - student look back question take student pencil maybe circle important word question 
    - student concern student answer doesn't really address question given 
    - student what's really important word question could help find answer take student pencil just underline really important word could help find answer 
    - student ahead look back question want circle underline word think important question 
    - student look back question look word will help understand what look ng reading passage 
    - student ahead look word past question 
    - look student answer look question student answer actually answered question word same student answer actually answering question while student look ng going over student 
    - what want just minute want guys look question number 
    - want guys figure underline pick word question think word important word might help answer question little more depth 
    - student want look question number find ke word words important might help answer question 
    - student read text read question what word kind synonyms each other 
    - student what specifically remember post look what questions asking what text 
    - student saying what specifically 
    - student that's right look question once reread question remember student posts look question what specific information look ng 
    - student student reading test information student question trying answer scam look question then read answer question 
    - student want start using scale after circle student evidence want back think deeper about question what equipment scientist discover water moon 
    - student what might word question help answer question what's word 
    - anybody word want look 
    - student what's another word could list 
    - student then told student need scientific tool called microscope look closely could find nasa found moon 
    - student because what just described moon 
    - student right back reread question take student highlighters slowly student look ng equipment scientist discover water moon 
    - student want look question more time there word don't understand circle 
    - student ahead circle word student sure know meaning 
    - student look word share student ideas what think word mean 
    - student okay what word find text helped answer question 
    - student there word circled underline text 
    - student yeah suggestion when reading prompt answering questions would read questions first then read passage 
    - student could little more specific question answering 
    - student think about word question think about student then will discuss what word 
    - student there's word very important question name word question might important 
    - student okay want look student paper want circle word question circle maybe word from question i'll give about seconds 
    - student will just look when student finished when student circled student word 
    - student that's right okay which which most most important word question word what think 
    - student i'll give seconds think some synonyms word similar each word what's another word equipment what's another word discover 
    - right look like finished what guys think what another word equipment

    - student verbs question i'll give about 
    - student seconds want take student pencil just circle action word question 
    - student right what think should after look ng answers kind look question kind determine some ke word question 
    - pull highlight look evidence back text y'all look d question first question answered where think what think word question 
    - student okay within question just like talked about first session what think some word there need pull before even worry about answering question 
    - student what want just couple minutes look back question want take student pencil circle highlight some important word feel important something stands 
    - student even questoin like sure miss teacher what about word confusing minute stop just minute take some time look back question circle okay 
    - student talk about question because wanting first look about what they're asking then we'll talk about text make connections about first want look about question what's about question something about 
    - think when circle helps bring back because went even deeper because just asked word student used went deeper explained little more connection text helps when circled 
    - student what going break into even smaller groups because liked look d some s savannas answers want work together right look more into what circled what connects text questions 
    - student okay what going right going same strategy we've taught before about important make connections find what question's asking help back text first what want student pencil highlighter look back over find important word words feel don't understand okay 
    - okay question want there anyone here question found there's word student sure about what means there anyone here because want make sure understand question 
    - need water survive right there anything here right right student also raise student hand about there concerned about question there some word weren't sure about same word evidence different 
    - student then sometimes when look ng questions really careful because sometimes they'll trick throwing little something could answer clever make sure watch make sure student look ng what could best answer give 
    - throwing little something could answer clever make sure watch make sure student look ng what could best answer give student what's student question 
    - student when answer question want really careful answering right question

    - student identify word focus when back into text word help answer question 
    - student tool helps focus make sure find ng information reading take minute take student pencil circle what think most important word question that's going help know what look what equipment scientist discover water moon 
    - student take student take student pencil circle what think most important word question that's going help know what look what equipment scientist discover water moon 
    - student what's important word take minute circle student question going what circled 
    - student really instead going straight text really know understand question before turn text someone tell exactly what question asking what asking find 
    - student don't really solid understanding what being asked said what question asking find article read 
    - student yeah really good think about when reading question says used discover water moon look 
    - student looking ke word like 
    - student going give about little less minute just read question circle what think most important word question 
    - student right want identify object look ng from question circling equipment 
    - student underline last part scientist discover water moon 
    - student think most important thing already most important equipment going underline equipment 
    - student underline discover water moon right 
    - look question what word that's really important everybody look question student piece paper find word think important answering question 
    - student what think most important word question what word kind giving clues answer want 
    - other word question gives clue going help figure what look ng what other word think going help figure exactly what question asking student 
    - student will describe particular question order make sure fully answered want make sure student answering specific question that's being asked 
    - student look little clues text question 
    - student strategy just question pick word question tell what should look ng 
    - student right question sort what know when when analyze things read look specifically what question asking 
    - student like treasure hunt right what could take second circle word question student look ng 
    - student want reread prompt want circle most important word prompt just take minute ahead 
    - student student right small need microscope concern student response need piece equipment made initial discover right 
    - student what exactly question asking maybe some what already know about space answer question 
    - right back question hand everyone want when unpacking question look specific details what look ng 
    - student want focus action word question 
    - student cells ahead look back first question what want like really like would super helpful could later 
    - student what want first find most important word question look back question then want read pick most important word will help answer question take seconds then we'll come back 
    - student look back question then want read pick most important word will help answer question take seconds then we'll come back 
    - student what want circle more three word phrases think most important question remember should something leads student response take minutes 
    - everyone circle word question think most important word focus when answering 
    - student look water discover d student totally right article think little more deeply about question 
    - student what's important word question 
    - student actually like take moment take look question just independently student self read over question maybe circle some word phrases think might help answering what question asking i'll give minute 
    - student look back question tell what think question asking tell maybe just three word what question asking 
    - student great completely correct want focus pieces question want focus first word which equipment second which discover 
    - student what's specific part question need look think about 
    - student follow thread correct response 
     - student what suggesting should order answer look some ke word ke word some co text clues will help find find question 
    - student what some word some co text clues will help answer what's main part question what look ng question 
    - student ce cool cool good good know what look ng equipment break down little more what some word some word relate equipment will help find 
    - student focus really building answer identifying scientific equipment 
    - student then explain equipment used discover water moon then once student gotten student answer 
    - student work text find something that's going give even more specific information about small machine 
    - student excellent would add d student answer would make ice specific 
    - student mentioned small machine better answer would tell what machine 
    - student asking question where asking like what equipment scientist then telling circle student answer student answer needs come from what just read 
    - take second write answer student 
    - instead student answer being circled same student could said instead just saying circled same 
    - student student student pretty much right could went little more into detail small machine 
    - student more specific look back paragraph find rest more detailed part answer 
    - student just need find little more evidence 
    - student would like ahead start look ng back through passage word discover 
    - know said same answer student could find text circle know where student answer came from would awesome 
    - student just want little more specific what tell 
    - student hear gave little more specific name instead just saying small machine called microscope 
    - student looking into find ng first time that's would change student answer just little make little more clear 
    - student look 
    - student change think about student answer change answers question 
    - student just needed just little more depth right 
    - student able come same sort answer give more details might able better inform student reader who's teacher 
    - student smaller amount able kind rephrase answer think student know interesting perspective there 
    - student think little more specific student response said oxygen tanks yeah absolutely they're oxygen tanks there could tell maybe another piece equipment nasa used article help discover water moon 
    - student help discover water moon right because that's ends 
    - student very specific when writing 
    - student words seem tough making sure student reader knows exactly what saying long don't confusion know student just smart know 
    - student think kind change sets 
    - student right kind want readers know talking about scientist specifically could nasa could scientist used want either think would convey student meeting 
    - student yeah remember that's what trying information what ring correct 
    - student maybe next time when student could could more specific said nasa sent small machine 
    - student could clarify student statement little more right well that'd good strategy 
    - student however also specific text evidence just like student learned can't just stop nasa said small machine right 
    - student keep reading what small machine very specific student answer sure answer every single part question using evidence from text student 
    - student would help into little more detail about 
    - student pull things together 
    - student just need because drink water 
    - student waters moon that's convincing evidence valuable just rework student answer 
    - student long answer what student answer 
    - student just water split into parts hydrogen oxygen because allows people breathe make rocket fuel 
    - student just need just hydrogen used rocket fuel oxygen help people breathe just need little student answer 
    - student just need little more just idea 
    - student lost train thought just explain little more think going able useful just because they're smaller amounts okay 
    - student look tool inside text because every time story reading questions about answers always going passage okay 
    - student there place text mentions what hydrogen oxygen used 
    - student exactly exactly more detail better student answer 
    - student lunar orbiter right nasa sent small machine called lunar orbiter think could clarified student answer 
    - student take little answer make great answer make make more sense make concrete 
    - student about restate question form answer 
    - answer grows yeah really short word answer created whole sentence where anybody reading answer identify what talking about what learning about 
    - student make student answer very clear clarify 
    - student misconceptions 
    - student just write down questions then word student paper student ipad just rearrange restate question 
    - student when answering questions probably should refer back reading given find answers need 
    - student would answer convince water valuable could valuable moon 
    - student perhaps could word d saying water valuable could valuable 
    - student very specific answer because specific name text 
    - student student wrote nasa sent small machine that's very good maybe need investigate look little further what machine called 
    - student strategy could work together student help figure what could okay what strategy look back text know where look text 
    - student good student right broken down into hydrogen oxygen little further answer also find what broken down oxygen hydrogen along student evidence 
    - student right maybe include student answer microscope 
    - student looking more specifically want find exact name machine kind able explain what machine student answer right just wanted some more detail 
    - student when look ng answer want look details will tell water going valuable 
    - student want give like question think valuable student details together valuable because surviving 
    - student rocket fuel split apart 
    - student maybe also passage remember student reading passage help figure would valuable 
    - student yeah that's what student said said could useful because broken down could extended answer little more said what valuable about breaking down 
    - student said what valuable about breaking down 
    - student that's only thing would done 
    - student suggest write even though almost same student 
    - student friends would like know understanding what student reading write down student word thank 
    - student important make sure read information before answer question 
    - student look nasa sent small machine what small machine called want turn somebody next 
    - student really important when answering questions even though found part question stem student answer student look around make sure that's total 
    - student student answer nasa send small machine student right small machine called lunar orbiter student answer almost there just need little more information okay 
    - student yeah sometimes works sometimes look around small machine small machine answer question because also small machine what 
    - exactly because whenever explanation whatever evidence from article sentence evidence sentences explanation describe student 
    - student right name machine give specific details 
    - student name 
    - student always look back text refer when trying find answers 
    - okay look ke word equipment find text where talks about type equipment could machine word like machine tool anybody find where says machine tool anyone find text student 
    - student student teacher people know like fewer 
    - student need restate question answers 
    - student student right equipment that's reason need very specific answer isn't 
    - student when restate question kind take some some some word from question student answer 
    - student equipment scientist discover water moon lunar orbiter gives reader more information know nothing about topic helps learn more about doesn't 
    - quite details yeah yeah guys want some more details others definitely make sure details 
    - student whenever look ng passage really want focus text al evidence text al evidence when question refer back student passage find exact answer close possible 
    - student student right nasa equipment just very specific identifying which equipment make sense 
    - student always want prove student answer always know right 
    - possibly guys understand important text evidence help answer student questions more importantly justify student answers 
    - student want detailed possible when answer questions information need response 
    - student well answers kind what just went over some text support ng details prove answer what 
    - student when talked about could break down into hydrogen oxygen talked about makes student water valuable 
    - student another when talked about being heavy carry also makes very valuable moon don't carry 
    - want make sure answering question fully descriptively possible help better explain student 
    - student correct make sure answer question when answer student question make sure student details 
    - student should look ng something more specific what small machine called would more solid answer just small machine when student reading says what equipment scientist discover water moon should name machine 
    - student looking specific question says what equipment scientist discover water moon could should name machine 
    - student correct response like just just conversation someone like super excited about moon asked what kind machine discover water then student answer should more specific answer student conversation like would name machine tell used that's kind answer should look ng answering 
    - student answer student conversation like would name machine tell used that's kind answer should look ng answering attacks 
    - student text informative text list some machine says names machine right before talk about discover okay would more solid answer 
    - student answers question better okay 
    - student know student found piece equipment used little more specific here 
    - student next time when asked question instead saying answered like student neighbor make sure write answer instead saying found same thing friend want hear what found 
    - student well always good detail answers more detail provide answer better stronger answer 
    - student think could wrote answer differently include question 
    - student student answer incorrect because third paragraph states exactly what said maybe add ng exactly what they're look ng also help student other friends maybe student working partners 
    - student that's only thing would student what correct student teacher want little more specific could just name actual machine called lunar orbiter student very just little more specific 
    - student yeah want specific evidence from reading want pull straight shows found answer question student thing think will help really pull answer what student reading 
    - student thing think will help really pull answer what student reading 
    - student instead just agreeing student maybe think about agree student what pick d agree could still agree student then tell reason agree 
    - yeah okay rewrote answers might minute ahead think about might agree student 
    - student need help getting started could equipment scientist used discover water what then write student response 
    - student little more spits specific naming what machine 
    - alright student want make sure going back text find answer 
    - student what sort wondering could little more specific perhaps identifying what small machine could possibly little more specific would then know want choose perhaps lunar orbiter 
    - student little more specific would then know want choose perhaps lunar orbiter 
    - student able look idea answer lunar orbiter would little more specific 
    - student think back into text look mention equipment scientist used underline could then build student answer we'd complete full answer question 
    - student usually best when answer question just stick question save extra information discussions like when right 
    - student think could little more specific response because there lots small machine world right 
    - student back into text type small machine sent give name when respond question being specific answer 
    - student student answer said nasa sent small machine would like tell little more about small machine look ng text what could expand give more details what small machine 
    - student expand 
    - student give more details what small machine 
    - student just would like build more upon student answer 
    - student don't starting know agree lunar orbiter 
    - student whenever student opinion student opinion student opinion just what think always best face what think facts read 
    - don't want opinion most time just something make because necessarily true student 
    - student alright talk about what found what student found just maybe read just look ng what equipment scientist find water talk about student self another student clue i've never read text i'll read student question know exactly what student talking about when answer 
    - student talk about student self another student 
    - student clue i've never read text i'll read student question know exactly what student talking about when answer 
    - student what would helpful 
    - student yeah tell something about what else what identifies machine 
    - student yeah student name probably machine name well 
    - student just need make specific you'll ahead just make sure student bringing from text 
    - student love when students make question alright equipment scientist discover water moon then into student answer 
    - student what you'll example going restate question there convincing evidence water moon could valuable 
    - student would there convinced student answering question student reciting question there convincing evidence 
    - student sorry there convincing evidence water moon valuable there restated question answered question 
    - student then would text what says water split into parts hydrogen oxygen then would explain that's important 
    - student only thing would like just restate question 
    - right could there enough evidence water moon guys then student student saying student just also bringing question into 
    - student then need evidence support student answer then found evidence from number that's perfect just provide evidence then explain 
    - student found evidence from number that's perfect just provide evidence then explain 
    - student yeah that's good train thought we'll just restate question answer question 
    - student would need more evidence student evidence bringing water moon hard would also talk about water moon would good 
    - student find 
    - student best place start word question then going back headings look underneath heading answer 
    - yeah  y'all figure going oxygen going hydrogen okay y'all talk about minute know just second okay 
    - okay heard think about text though okay  student  question student hand just second 
    - student correct want more specific good answer could said nasa sent small machine called lunar orbiter student right track 
    - student then more specific answer could name what machine called 
    - student talk about student answers could improved answers more specific 
    - question using word guys underline ke word 
    - student student said scientist equipment like oxygen tanks could more specific passage 
    - student okay need more specific when answering questions 
    - want guys look answer question want read over student answer want think student self could more specific when answering question 
    - student student right nasa send small machine give more specific best answer could nasa sent small machine gave name 
    - student looking something specific that's when would want refer back text when says what equipment scientist discover water moon when would want look back into text find student answer because already know various tool like said mask 
    - student when would want look back into text find student answer because already know various tool like said mask 
    - student microscope stuff like then there's specific tool states text would want look back text find student answer 
    - student just want little deeper into text maybe help student fellow students figure some more details about what nasa find water moon 
    - want help each other understand text know word everybody thinks want guys reconstruct student answer give little more detail about equipment specifically helped discover water 
    - thing help future answer question teaching about question somebody reading passage just like guys would best explain would full picture what guys reading 
    - student sure also remind teaching even from student perspective student answer question then give little more detail student answer will help more concrete answer 
    - student because must always refer text 
    - student detail just add d critical that's valuable fact when break down oxygen hydrogen astronaut breathe oxygen oxygen hydrogen fuel second part just gave that's valuable that's great answer 
    - student second part just gave that's valuable that's great answer 
    - student student first answer correct add d detail kind gets even more valuable what mentioned 
    - student well question asked according text what text answer questions find evidence might right from what know from student going nasa text order answer question 
    - student yeah want look back story make sure student answering whole question stories like student friend want keep look ng back student answers 
    - then student really liked student answer also thinking about microscope would loved give another example maybe add d mars venus thought definitely like student answer 
    - student understand maybe next time same idea someone could just little more felt like didn't wanted bring 
    - student could like bring example 
    - they're using microscope like when student reading text think they're using microscope think helped find crater think made easier look water moon just student thought process student 
    - student would loved just said what machine just talked more about what machine 
    - student just said what machine just talked more about what machine 
    - student what could saying nasa sent small machine called lunar orbiter just like said previously then kind 
    - student what's going moon 
    - student might slip through cracks just very keep simple like nasa said lunar orbiter investigate 
    - student yeah like should fill blanks just make sentence little meteor 
    - student okay always rephrase student sentence nasa sent little over there know student using information that's text sound good 
    - student always write even scientist microscope 
    - student sometimes there still things small cannot better 
    - student just want little further student explanation some evidence from what read about 
    - student just want student answer little more specific sometimes mean writing more stuff 
    - student when student answering discussion questions text read just incorporate something specifically from text text mentions lunar orbiter would good thing include student response add tion what said about find ng crater water they're like suits masks oxygen tanks 
    - student something specifically from text text mentions lunar orbiter would good thing include student response add tion what said about find ng crater water they're like suits masks oxygen tanks make sense 
    - student yeah really good answer student definitely correct want elaborate little more nasa sent small machine what small machine called 
    - student right when term lunar orbiter using evidence support response that's something want make sure student because shows 
    - student also want make sure when student answering question student specifically using evidence examples text gives 
    - student awesome make connections student background knowledge order answer question want make sure comes from text 
    - student however when look question asks what equipment found crater water would similar student where just want make sure student using specific piece evidence support what said when said there's crater water 
    - student what could student response could add d something like another article read said there could base moon then connect article reading idea could 
    - student pretty good would maybe just little about like said they're carrying water ships an more because they're keeping base they're going build moon 
- intent: r500
  examples: |
    - student somebody tell want student hands raised what mean find evidence 
    - student when talking about evidence thinking about what word text reading help answer question 
    - student might look word leading word like called like no ice called before that's great example word might might 
    - student alright student explain what evidence 
    - student when look ng evidence need find certain specific things text will help 
    - student want look story where find answers 
    - want think about what differently next time when student answering student next question make sure specific answer look ng because guys really close just needed look more closely text 
    - student next time student reading tough question help look action word question because that's going help know specifically what student look ng 
    - student means means student word what heard paragraph 
    - student when read something three step process when student trying answer question 
    - student first time scan right just read really fast know just know blah blah blah more flow through 
    - student then look student question look what really asking then read 
    - student when read text read question need correlate need together what they're actually asking 
    - student okay what find answer thank 
    - student strategy talked about 
    - student want good something keep over over over 
    - student remember when look d question found keyword 
    - student remember what asked find 
    - student ke word help answer question 
    - student always find identify ke word really understand what student look ng back text 
    - student used passage provided find answer didn't just background knowledge made sure back find something text 
    - student right know what that's perfectly fine sometimes come across scenarios where know think know much maybe take moment read back over i'll come back okay 
    - student important read right 
    - student make sure when student reading passage take holiday highlight important facts when student question 
    - student highlight important word student question back find passage 
    - student remember small machine like went back reread student text figure what machine actually called 
    - student sometimes read things quite absorb everything always good idea back reread student text underline important information details help answer questions about afterwards keep knowledge 
    - student strategies going today look some word question 
    - student student context

    - student remember when look ng question always look important word 
    - student then look text same word find answer 
    - student often when read will tell sequence will tell what happened first then what happens next important when answering questions look gone order story 
    - student because want want prove even just reading want evidence find evidence 
    - student don't want just agree good agree people also good know think something 
    - student when given questions we'd like find answers very specific because more specific more sense make later 
    - student think we've kind learned lesson when reading information attention just assume 
    - student make sense know know different things about space also need make sure really reading information being given 
    - student well think about what student text student paper 
    - student looked very closely text look d word 
    - alright look back question thinks explain student what what ke word find text question 
    - student what need definitely through student passage then highlight important details always want highlight student headings student headings 
    - student because details there could give some really good text evidence that's what need want find details along student question could possibly support student answer 
    - student maybe like chronological timeline events text broke down text circled like what happened first then what happened then what happened might able find more suitable answer question 
    - student built student answer appreciate build student answer more specific narrowed down core knowledge look ng then said okay what machine what 
    - student okay much like student earlier just trying look question specifically boiling down just core components 
    - student sometimes takes little work everything together called summarizing want able together word come best answer 
    - student really like race format going restate question going answer question going cite evidence then going explain evidence 
    - student example when read what equipment scientist discover water moon think restate question into answer then fill blank spots questions asking 
    - student example might equipment scientist used discover moon would then leave answer blank then could back text determine what exactly what equipment 
    - student think next time need strategy look ng ke word really specific 
    - student very important highlight ke word give best answer 
    - student sometimes okay back reread find answer 
    - exactly what would like goes everyone just student when student answering questions what already know well specific information from what reading 
    - student great that's good strategy find ng clues ke word help find student answer 
    - student what think include after using background knowledge answer student question after student background knowledge what think what strategy think help promote learning answering question 
    - student told before what read no ice word water question scanned through look d things related water 
    - student great really liked response because explained student self really well said read question what question asking then found explained really great response 
    - there part article haven't really heard before what uses kind like tool maybe tool because realm academic language using lunar orbiter microscope student 
    - student definitely student imagination really like visualize situation before giving student answer that's really good strategy answering questions 
    - student perfect response used direct language from text used specific vocab provided reasoning very specific perfect response good 
    - student find evidence need quotes from text like student quoted said paragraph three could look text find where reading 
    - student responses want academic language 
    - student like student connecting student background knowledge help great student using student notes help further understand text that's excellent strategy good readers 
    - student then provided reasoning which can't survive without water very important backup student answers reasoning 
    - student hearing read text details evidence help support student thinking 
    - student student connecting details another part text explain could valuable 
    - student you'll finish okay move question same strategy find ke word question okay 
    - student student using student background knowledge definition orbiter able apply student answer 
    - student when answering comprehension questions like really need into text make sure using information 
    - student going give some sentence starters going help really solidify learning reading strategies 
    - student going help really solidify learning reading strategies 
    - student think about thinking thinking strategy when reading text answering question 
    - student change student answer what student also wrote what thinking 
    - student she's going back text find ng specific piece evidence used discover water moon 
    - student remember restate what strategy 
    - student really good thing just able when rereading student able where found student answer able find another part could 
    - student that's excellent strategy look ng text pull ng ke word 
    - think that's excellent strategy anyone think about when reading text think 
    - yeah student great right glad much background 
    - student when student trying answer question just locate word paragraph 
    - student when read want make sure backing what saying information from text 
    - that's great that's great segue what wanted guys next because just gave specific evidence what question said analyze pick d answer based specifically that's great process 
    - student when drawing prior knowledge things complex reviewing couple times important 
    - student important look back passage determine what best answer question always helpful circle word question 
    - student mean student 100% right using background knowledge when answer questions especially questions about text always want make sure answers evidence found directly from text 
    - student moon want make sure answers questions incorporate components 
    - student question same concepts talked about right look ng question figure what asking want answer another question like question 
    - student what going suggest when start first thing before start reading actually look closely question 
    - student guess other strategy student going want think about question they're asking then student trying make some connections between concepts student reading 
    - student help make some inferences want read little more closely meaning material before 
    - student yeah really important skill scientist need able look text quotes information from text support answers 
    - anyone else strategy when going back revise answers 
    - student okay look ng evidence text circling evidence great strategy make sure answering question completely 
    - student going thinking about what strategies revise answers strategies next time come across question like 
    - student love look ng ke word that's really strong reading technique 
    - student that's good yeah thing about thing about reading ke word sometimes authors will synonyms word mean same thing when thinking about discover definitely found 
    - student think little specificity putting little effort save trouble revise several times 
    - student sort no ice through talking student mean also add d some specificity student answer think helped more full response 
    - student think that's totally great strategy think question provide student answer just look over student answer more time then make sure answers matches question you'll good 
    - student fantastic really appreciate something student just took little parts world lunar orbit draw conclusion from really look ng small details here 
    - student question when look ng answer important think about ke word also helpful create sentence wouldn't necessarily student response 
    - student think ice though when read text scan text specific pieces equipment then when write answers ever asked tell what paragraph found student able point exact part text 
    - student think student just when just read beginning paragraph 
    - student yeah exactly could specify small machine that's strategy response questions 
    - student well case add ng name would sufficient talking more about strategy specifying student responses instead just like add ng name into 
    - student student strategy absolutely right locate ke word question find text 
    - thank okay student feel like student changed student student process working through text questions 
    - student whatever think okay student response hasn't changed okay changed just curious what thinking take moment before conversation thought after conversation thought 
    - want guys make sure when look always look ng back text because look small machine just like what student said nasa sent small machine into space right  
    - student think what need take away when answering reading comprehension questions really need focus going back reading article detail maybe highlighting text annotating text really understand detail what learning learning 
    - student okay from reading text today using tool going back rereading text circling important information broaden student understanding future topic discuss whether space farming 
    - student student knowledge restating question next lesson 
    - student when answering questions like what's something need make sure when answering question 
    - student like shared student opinion next time when share student opinion just just told understand little more because 
    - student next time question underline student ke word help more specific 
    - student student figured full answer what will next time when student look ng back text 
    - student alright next time 
    - student alright next time back look story find student answer 
    - student next time answering question like think make student answer better 
    - will apply what learned student next task give guys couple minutes think about then will around circle answering 
    - start student just repeat want state started thinking strategy used changed based feedback gave what will next time make sure fully answering question 
    - just going around student what think first student going what strategy used will build student next assignment task 
    - last least student what about what think what strategy will take either build change future 
    - student next time answer question like what want hear actual equipment using 
    - student right next time question text going student background knowledge read text going read text then student background knowledge 
    - student right that's good that's school right because don't know everything don't know everything probably good student student text next time write 
    - student right what things next time when student quite sure student answers there 
    - student right went back read what want next time teacher asks little more information
