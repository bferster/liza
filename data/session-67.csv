0,Teacher,140.1,12000.09,"That's awesome before we get started, I want to ask, if you guys can come up with a name that you want me to call you in the collective. I don't like to say boys and girls and I don't like to say you guys, so do is it a school mascot do you want to be the jedis the eagles the ketchup packets, what can I call you as a group?",210
0,Farrah,140.1,33000.06,"how about how about the wildcats because that's our that's our school team",310
0,Teacher,,36999.6,awesome wildcats I love it okay wildcats,310
0,Teacher,,36999.6,yes Luis your question.,410
0,Luis,,43999.92,yeah i'm okay I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,150
0,Teacher,110.3,57999.78,"that's awesome if you are, then you can help us figure out these couple questions so we're so glad to have you in this group, and you can you can kind of help us to follow the prompts of the, the question that we were that we were answering so i'm so glad you're here all right",150
0,Teacher,150.1,70000.08,So we all as wild cats, were talking about water on the moon right? All right,150
0,Teacher,,79999.11,yeah Farrah what What was your response to the prompt you remember?,230
0,Farrah,,85999.2,yeah okay I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,230
0,Teacher,130.1,96999.15,"that's totally correct I think we'd all agree with you that if you had a microscope you would use it to look at water really closely, although let's think about what happens before that point right",310
0,Teacher,110.1,107999.7,"And Oliver I think you said this, did you say the same thing is that right?",230
0,Oliver,,112999.56,yeah yeah, same thing as Farrah,430
0,Teacher,310.1,116999.22,awesome so Farrah and Oliver get awesome points for circling the parts in the text prompt because that was the the direction so A+  direction for following points,310
0,Teacher,210.2,131999.91,"So let's think about before we actually look at water with the microscope what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water they found on the moon, so they use the microscope after they had found it, but what did they use to find it Do you remember",210
0,Teacher,110.1,155999.1,"hi Jazmin I see you've got your hand up. we're going to wait because  i'm talking to Farrah because this is specific to the question that they that they asked is that OK, I put a pin you i'll come back to you",420
0,Farrah,110.1,168999.18,"As well Okay, you said, what do they use before the microscope and I guess, I don't really know I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",210
0,Teacher,410.3,180999.78,"Your answer isn't it wrong that they use the microscope to look at the water, but in the text that we just read It describes a piece of machinery that the scientists use to locate that water on the moon",410
0,Teacher,420.3,187999.68,"Can you and Oliver work together to go back to the text and figure figure out what that machine was called, is that cool?",420
0,Farrah,,202999.14,yeah, yeah we can work together we work together really well,150
0,Teacher,130.2,206999.19,"awesome awesome okay Farrah and Oliver will pair up and and find the answer to that question, thank you folks",230
0,Teacher,,214999.17,Okay Jazmin,210
0,Jazmin,,218999.67,"Well Okay, I said NASA sent a small machine",230
0,Teacher,110.4,224999.4,that's right you totally did and NASA did send a small machine,410
0,Teacher,210.4,229999.89,Do you remember what they called that machine. Science has all sorts of wacky names for their machines so that's what we're looking for we're looking to see if we can find The name of what that small machine was. Do you remember?,210
0,Jazmin,,248999.58,I don't know if I could remember but I have to look so yeah,420
0,Teacher,210.4,251999.4,"yep totally yeah look at the text look back, I think it's close to that same line about the small machine i'm not sure, but let us know",210
0,Jazmin,,260999.52,"Okay, and NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter",230
0,Teacher,110.4,267999.51,nailed it yes Jazmin high five. hashtag awesome lunar orbiter is the name of the machine great,210
0,Teacher,210.3,276999.54,"Farrah and Oliver are you ready to come back to us with an answer, or do you want me to to investigate some other answers first",210
0,Farrah,210.3,285999.21,"Okay well so we we saw where it said lunar orbiter and we also heard you tell Jazmin that lunar orbiter is the right answer, and so I guess I know that now, but I don't know um how I how I would have picked lunar orbiter instead of microscope does that make sense",210
0,Teacher,210.4,341999.82,"I yeah totally um so the microscope if you look at the are three sentences Here are three paragraphs In paragraph three, it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you would need a scientific cool tool called a microscope to look really closely so there's the part with the microscope but, if we go before then. We see where you found it called the Lunar orbiter and paragraph two right?",210
0,Teacher,210.2,346999.35,"It says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and so that is the question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, not to look at it afterwards, does that make sense",210
0,Farrah,210.2,362999.16,Oh yeah okay okay so First they find it with the orbiter and then then also it's like they then they like study it they study it with a microscope,210
0,Teacher,110.4,376999.11,Totally You got it,150
0,Teacher,130.2,377999.97,Oliver are you are you on board with that?,230
0,Oliver,130.2,383999.73,um yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense it's like they use one then they use the other,230
0,Teacher,,390999.69,You got it awesome,150
0,Teacher,,394999.62,"Chris, Do you want to talk about your answer, do you have a different question",520
0,Chris,,398999.19,"Oh well, it's kind of a comment",210
0,Teacher,,400999.62,let's hear it,150
0,Chris,,401999.19,yeah I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,420
0,Teacher,110.3,415999.86,"You nailed it they absolutely do they use so much equipment in science and NASA and they get to play with like lasers all day and I am jealous of them, yes thumbs up",210
0,Teacher,120.4,429999.42,"So let's see Chris, what answer, did you put for the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",210
0,Chris,120.4,447999.66,"Oh man oh I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch. But I wanted to say thank you so much for coming in and bringing so much energy and helping us learn in such a fun way I didn't know that this was going to be so fun looking at this article, and I just wanted to say thank you for listening and explaining but also making it fun",310
0,Teacher,,470999.22,awesome thanks Chris have a good lunch,310
