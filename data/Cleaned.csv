1,Teacher,100,student student answer around think there multiple answers here right we've identified equipment actually 
1,Teacher,100,student well that's great thing answer multiple answers sometimes want circle many 
1,Teacher,100,student didn't wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student student right 
1,Teacher,100,student didn't wrong 
1,Teacher,100,only person student only person said valuable kind told thought valuable 
1,Teacher,100,student okay definitely need oxygen when space don't because don't oxygen there like here 
1,Teacher,100,student student student answer wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student need microscope able 
1,Teacher,100,student true could there's enough water 
1,Teacher,100,well student don't think student answer wrong sweetheart 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wrong honey student student right 
1,Teacher,100,student scientists found crater full water moon absolutely correct 
1,Teacher,100,student want back student answer need scientific tool called microscope look really closely very very true 
1,Teacher,100,student looking equipment definitely found crater full water 
1,Teacher,100,student like connection made there right 
1,Teacher,100,student thank that's great glad could clarify 
1,Teacher,100,student that's right weren't wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student would probably need microscope they're going test water 
1,Teacher,100,student orbiter good okay said said small machine student exactly right here 
1,Teacher,100,student don't student answer isn't wrong 
1,Teacher,100,guys said scientific tool called microscope which that's answering question right 
1,Teacher,100,student equipment don't 
1,Teacher,100,yeah there's usually passage guys read didn't equipment used very very right that's good connection student good 
1,Teacher,100,student okay i've microscope really closely 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wrong student right used microscope look very closely okay student right about 
1,Teacher,100,student right small machine correct 
1,Teacher,100,student right back look text equipment space correct 
1,Teacher,100,student exactly that's text very good look ng text pull ng awesome 
1,Teacher,100,student once look student nasa send small machine which correct about well 
1,Teacher,100,student exactly exactly think three read question understood text 
1,Teacher,100,student right correct 
1,Teacher,100,text very good find ng pull ng text student 
1,Teacher,100,think what    think guys read text understood text 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wrong student answer right because talking student answer especially talking about equipment said need some microscope look water moon right 
1,Teacher,100,student very good that's very good answer 
1,Teacher,100,actually oxygen things there moon discover water that's something really good  thank student 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope very good very good there other equipment no ice there other microscope 
1,Teacher,100,absolutely absolutely guys seem hitting 
1,Teacher,100,think student really well kind identifying part haven't talked much about that's know found crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,important part very good identifying kind like main idea article reading just question might necessarily trying there student talk 
1,Teacher,100,student discovered water right nose 
1,Teacher,100,student would better answers question wanted make sure perfect might include 
1,Teacher,100,student closer there like growth definitely getting closer there starting student sort response need right 
1,Teacher,100,student right good that's what trying really want look specific about what student trying look when respond something right 
1,Teacher,100,student small machine right perfect what small machine called 
1,Teacher,100,student student both right which good thing that's great about working groups participate contribute 
1,Teacher,100,right here where couldn't because wouldn't ability look closely student good couldn't moon without student student both right just didn't the-- 
1,Teacher,100,student well good liked student answers scientist found crater full water moon using what 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely correct errors very valuable when student talking about space raft because takes force stuff right don't heavy water 
1,Teacher,100,okay student student answer wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student earlier asked didn't understand student answer wrong student answer never wrong 's original answer scientist 
1,Teacher,100,student that's very good point would need something help find what look ng when look ng water 
1,Teacher,100,would like student said scientist found crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer correct need microscope order things very very small smaller what student human eyes 
1,Teacher,100,that's good that's correct student 
1,Teacher,100,student that's correct wouldn't need order protect while they're outer space moon 
1,Teacher,100,student both correct what machine y needed locate find able article from moon 
1,Teacher,100,student they're necessarily wrong 
1,Teacher,100,really good answer student really good answers 
1,Teacher,100,student there's nothing wrong student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student there could 
1,Teacher,100,student small machine correct 
1,Teacher,100,student small machine collect water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student answer said think scientific tool called microscope look really closely right student 
1,Teacher,100,student correct microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student ma'am keep student answer same 
1,Teacher,100,good good right student question 
1,Teacher,100,student well that's correct certain equipment moon 
1,Teacher,100,student okay 's answer about moon okay astronaut things around oxygen order moon correct 
1,Teacher,100,thank student absolutely none wrong correct extent thank being here lunch 
1,Teacher,100,student student exactly right also says second paragraph could breathe oxygen suits oxygen tanks when they're moon when they're space 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah student exactly right here thank add d comment 
1,Teacher,100,student correct 
1,Teacher,100,student scientists part 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope used there other some other equipment also used probably just piece equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe  student answer correct 
1,Teacher,100,student okay thank that's great thing circle 
2,Teacher,100,student right saying student student answer wrong 
2,Teacher,100,student garden okay 
2,Teacher,100,student rightly said machine 
2,Teacher,100,student small machine that's right 
2,Teacher,100,student student answer wasn't wrong question 
2,Teacher,100,student wrong student still correct will need microscope want water 
2,Teacher,100,student would awesome very good thinking 
2,Teacher,100,student correct 
2,Teacher,100,student one's answer wrong 
2,Teacher,100,very good student student answer needs little further 
2,Teacher,100,student well wrong 
2,Teacher,100,student think maybe long r search future could possibility 
2,Teacher,100,student okay student right equipment part question 
2,Teacher,100,student water other things like garden like said 
2,Teacher,100,guys right there 
2,Teacher,100,student yeah no ice pointed oxygen tanks really cool answer gave there more information always learn didn't know before know name orbiter 
2,Teacher,100,student well definitely helped because know space there's oxygen tanks help breathe equipment 
2,Teacher,100,student well right 
2,Teacher,100,student because send small machine called think probe something 
2,Teacher,100,student could then guess would would good investment because would could grow things side planet 
2,Teacher,100,student mean he's wrong 
2,Teacher,100,perfect excellent okay student 
2,Teacher,100,student okay several types equipment okay thank 
2,Teacher,100,student exactly 
2,Teacher,100,student okay sorry believe student answer wrong student everybody's answer 
2,Teacher,100,student student answer very right microscope 
2,Teacher,100,figure answers student need scientific tool called microscope look really closely correct miss savanna need microscope look very closely 
2,Teacher,100,equipment student correct things before start explorations right student 
2,Teacher,100,getting little topic here student said astronaut oxygen tanks space shuttles types equipment student right about 
2,Teacher,100,would would really useful student what about 
2,Teacher,100,student right will take time money might worked student 
2,Teacher,100,student think well water because look ng what what equipment used find water there other important word 
2,Teacher,100,student didn't student answer isn't wrong just wanting find kind even more about nasa sent small machine correct 
2,Teacher,100,good that's right that's right sorry missed student student answer student sent mall machine that's very good student exactly right that's tool look ng 
2,Teacher,100,student correct 
2,Teacher,100,student using microscope find water just look water found 
2,Teacher,100,microscope everybody where student found paragraph three 
2,Teacher,100,good  everybody hear while student reading 
2,Teacher,100,wonderful answer anyone else want answer 
2,Teacher,100,student student answer correct because microscope tool equipment very broad when comes machine tool what refer 
2,Teacher,100,student yeah student answer wouldn't wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student cute yeah don't think wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student answer wrong student 
1,Teacher,100,student small machine well don't think student wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer incorrect 
1,Teacher,100,student right what could also include scientist tool called microscope discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer correct 
1,Teacher,100,correct equipment student both correct oxygen tanks that's specifically what hadn't used find water crater 
1,Teacher,100,student going student response wrong means okay 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe student answer right answer nasa send small machine look what written actually look number there 
1,Teacher,100,student didn't student answer wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student said small machine lunar orbiter type machine student answer right 
1,Teacher,100,student student answers wrong 
1,Teacher,100,right different types equipment scientist guys right oxygen tanks space suits equipment equipment help discover water 
1,Teacher,100,student really good stating scientist found crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student could something drink could something could stay clean good 
1,Teacher,100,student student right great understanding what water even valuable moon 
1,Teacher,100,yeah drink bake great guys thank 
1,Teacher,100,student great answer 
1,Teacher,100,student mean small machine student student still correct 
1,Teacher,100,student well would definitely know really come handy know scientist astrologers might perhaps moon 
1,Teacher,100,student would definitely know perhaps provide sort know sort some greenhouses might able construct moon perhaps scientist could even perhaps grow vegetables something grow moon 
1,Teacher,100,just like  brought about space he's look ng into knows just about equipment about space student 
1,Teacher,100,student when look d over student answer there some great points brought about wasn't wasn't wrong what 
1,Teacher,100,great that's good connection loved student response about word used word hydrate hydrate student said 
1,Teacher,100,student like response because that's something student proving whenever asked about garden what makes think could student telling 
1,Teacher,100,student thought great idea look glad look d detail about hearing shoes because heavy 
1,Teacher,100,student great there's dealing article because that's like equipment right like read about equipment passage 
1,Teacher,100,student okay good response 
1,Teacher,100,okay know what student sounds like good point maybe there there's probably more just thing used find water 
1,Teacher,100,student gave really good answers 
1,Teacher,100,student student student answer wrong paragraph three talks about water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able think that's where thinking would need tool walk microscope types things moon help understand more 
1,Teacher,100,student nothing's wrong student paragraph 
1,Teacher,100,student pretty good definitely lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,student that's absolutely true 
1,Teacher,100,student right student answer seems pretty solid 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer's don't think student answer incorrect student answer's student answer correct 
1,Teacher,100,yeah that's great point student would oxygen tanks stuff actually explore moon yeah would need equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer necessarily wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student student student answers necessarily wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student that's definitely true scientist find crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student okay glad student no ice 
1,Teacher,100,student went right into said scientist want crater some water moon true 
1,Teacher,100,think guys 
1,Teacher,100,exactly right equipment tool guys correct stating both things microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student small machine both equipment tool 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely correct appreciate sharing fact article today discusses importance oxygen 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer drink water stay hydrated very good answer mentioned here text 
1,Teacher,100,student extremely extremely close 
1,Teacher,100,student saying saying wrong didn't machine y think whenever talked about question find student actually went wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student weren't wrong after 
1,Teacher,100,student wrong 
1,Teacher,100,very good like student said equipment like oxygen tanks moon able survive moon 
1,Teacher,100,student didn't wrong student answer isn't wrong 
1,Teacher,100,okay well going second right  wrong just going there different answer okay right student share what underline paragraph 
1,Teacher,100,student said needed tool called microscope look really closely true 
1,Teacher,100,student exactly exactly need special tool called microscope little microscopic whatever ends being case microscopic amounts water 
1,Teacher,100,student essence kind both correct 
1,Teacher,100,student reality sure teacher would count wrong included every 
1,Teacher,100,student know lunar order microscope just about anything don't think counted wrong because technically correct 
1,Teacher,100,student every little moon find water technically correct 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah would based text here they've used different equipment discover there water moon 
1,Teacher,100,good student exactly right look paragraph three will fact says need microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student fact microscope part answers right microscope 
1,Teacher,100,will student student answer right 
1,Teacher,100,student suppose large polar crater right okay student answer correct equipment there deposit 
1,Teacher,100,student okay test hear about might need microscope view water molecules right 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wrong 
1,Teacher,100,okay could water student 
1,Teacher,100,student love found microscope used find water 
1,Teacher,100,student wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student said 100% correct said nasa send small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student everybody's answer correct 
1,Teacher,100,student don't think student answer necessarily wrong small machine 
1,Teacher,100,guys gave answers very valid 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah good answer 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's very well eloped answer 
1,Teacher,100,student long gathered information about values then student answer correct whether think 
1,Teacher,100,just going student just want start really enjoy student answer really pick d from text 
1,Teacher,100,student really pick d object which microscope basically kind described what used outside text using language really appreciate 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah student answer right scientist find crater full water moon student right 
1,Teacher,100,student that's awesome student then help figure couple questions 
1,Teacher,100,glad group kind help follow prompt question answering glad student here right 
1,Teacher,100,student nailed absolutely much equipment science nasa play like lasers jealous thumbs 
1,Teacher,100,love know much prior knowledge about space yeah appreciate know think you'll bring whatever group student 
1,Teacher,100,student glad glad hear think will contribute student knowledge

1,Teacher,100,maybe share something know student 
1,Teacher,100,good well even happy hear sound confident student knowledge there here good knowledge share being group doesn't mean don't necessarily know about maybe student going helping student classmates learn about 
1,Teacher,100,student that's very exciting sounds like some first hand experience really glad little circle here because that's great getting some more perspective like 
1,Teacher,100,that's incredibly exciting would hope that's case water here could help future exploration glad guys listening topic trying expand knowledge know student visit nasa very excited 
1,Teacher,100,that's awesome help other kids about once just chill minute 
1,Teacher,100,okay awesome what student background knowledge which going help answer question because background knowledge already understand topic that's great 
1,Teacher,100,awesome student used background knowledge able infer based information coming from passage scientist need lots equipment that's awesome  
1,Teacher,100,awesome student student also able reference student background knowledge help deeper into passage 
1,Teacher,100,awesome student able background knowledge know infer from everything tells passage here nasa scientist using equipment agree 
1,Teacher,100,what know about space know help rest group what know 
1,Teacher,100,okay mister student that's good point glad know about space 
1,Teacher,100,student that's okay maybe help help someone else later wait okay 
1,Teacher,100,student well wonderful glad know about space maybe friends don't maybe help teach some things about space 
1,Teacher,100,student would good thing 
1,Teacher,100,well wonderful  still learning more information about space going teach friends hopefully during group anybody else questions maybe help help 
1,Teacher,100,student very good like connected student experience going nasa help understand reading text better that's great experience really cool 
1,Teacher,100,student thanks sharing student astronaut sure know there's always more learn reading find ng more details text always learn more 
1,Teacher,100,student that's really cool student astronaut about that's that's talk about

1,Teacher,100,student that's where find student answer okay always remember experience 
1,Teacher,100,well  glad part group maybe share some student 
1,Teacher,100,student knowledge help expand learning space 
1,Teacher,100,student okay some prior knowledge space travel right 
1,Teacher,100,student that's really cool what learned there they're very scientific studies 
1,Teacher,100,student well maybe help others 
1,Teacher,100,ties because sometimes personal experience helps understand what reading  when reading student seen things nasa helps visualize know more about that's great thing share student anyone else experience similar 
1,Teacher,100,student good sometimes already know something think always learn more about maybe could student classmates maybe don't know need student help 
1,Teacher,100,student well maybe benefit others listening offering some suggestions

1,Teacher,100,student you'll able share student knowledge 
1,Teacher,100,student good every time learn something continue growing learning going listen friends okay thank student input glad know about space learn from right 
1,Teacher,100,student very good background information know know about space 
1,Teacher,100,student okay going student 
1,Teacher,100,student background knowledge okay we've talked about background knowledge help 
1,Teacher,100,student more information about what learning okay 
1,Teacher,100,student well think don't know exactly everything quite always learn more some student knowledge from what know about space help 
1,Teacher,100,student really 
1,Teacher,100,right  that's sort what student said right that's great student using student background knowledge awesome 
1,Teacher,100,well help teach others really need still group help help understand little better 
1,Teacher,100,great was-- i've seen some equipment that's very neat thank much student 
1,Teacher,100,student that's okay well always learn things about topics help know help learn more about 
1,Teacher,100,well really need stay group help like information things okay 
1,Teacher,100,student help helper 
1,Teacher,100,student would neat when that's only four years away 
1,Teacher,100,student awesome know extra stuff just trying learn about water know much more student going some equipment student 
1,Teacher,100,student well know liked student response scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well maybe help help other students understanding space pull from details from text just reaffirm student knowledge what student prior knowledge 
1,Teacher,100,student okay alright well glad know information 
1,Teacher,100,student there's things need whenever into space that's very fascinating able visit nasa 
1,Teacher,100,student that's great cultural experience gives little insight into some prior knowledge move forward student science classes 
1,Teacher,100,student astronauts scientist kinds equipment certain materials wear when into space because such unknown area want safe possible 
1,Teacher,100,student when things nasa able some space suits some tool equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student right super jealous nasa 
1,Teacher,100,maybe help student partner's  think would great add tion group 
1,Teacher,100,student well that's really great that's that's awesome know about space maybe conversation 
1,Teacher,100,student like said scientist oxygen space survive 
1,Teacher,100,student glad know stuff about oxygen tanks things like will help 
1,Teacher,100,well maybe help some understand things better being group then 
1,Teacher,100,student that's awesome always good when background knowledge pull 
1,Teacher,100,student that's great know stuff what like help other students learn more would like 
1,Teacher,100,student help some other students we'll student contribution help help other students well 
1,Teacher,100,student know about some equipment nasa uses 
1,Teacher,100,right student you'll able share some information maybe learn from student friends okay 
1,Teacher,100,student right student said same thing right  what something said scientist 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well glad know about space 
1,Teacher,100,student think both great using student outside resource different things student experienced student life related think that's awesome wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe even help others learn more about science sort explore strengths within type knowledge 
1,Teacher,100,student well that's that's that's really cool know sort idea sort special inroads know student know first hand knowledge some might actually come know sort handy help somebody goes kind understand material 
1,Teacher,100,student glad know about space because need knowledge help especially questions today glad brought about space because that's here today 
1,Teacher,100,okay student brought about space glad that's good point 
1,Teacher,100,different some things different school right learning differently guys done great look ng more into because some student knowledge student read about nasa help things like help partners alright back question 
1,Teacher,100,student that's awesome information because know what help today about learning about importance 
1,Teacher,100,thank student because know make some great connections about student because know shared information about things done work 
1,Teacher,100,student could confirm about probably told right  
1,Teacher,100,that's great student know what gave great idea want each little piece paper 
1,Teacher,100,student okay some some good found tion space when cover more about space seems like you'll able help some student classmates right 
1,Teacher,100,okay maybe maybe forward maybe i'll group leaders okay 
1,Teacher,100,think means probably could share rest group about some student experience nasa maybe could talk about here little could tell some more interesting facts 
1,Teacher,100,okay maybe student could leaders when comes some little more knowledge about space okay 
1,Teacher,100,think know know about space don't think would make even better group help rest maybe could learn from each other 
1,Teacher,100,student know much about space maybe share some student classmates 
1,Teacher,100,student obviously shows student understanding space that's really cool 
1,Teacher,100,student i've never nasa that's really cool experience 
1,Teacher,100,student okay read aloud right read because know everything about space already 
1,Teacher,100,student love wish could nasa very away 
1,Teacher,100,student think that's really cool love experience about space know there's different types equipment work together 
1,Teacher,100,student know could tell student answer really enjoy space know oxygen tanks space explore there 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah lunar orbiter like talking about that's super cool 
1,Teacher,100,would like student knowledge already know share other students group okay 
1,Teacher,100,student response know quite maybe actually help teach other students here 
1,Teacher,100,student think think student help learn some stuff 
1,Teacher,100,well thank letting know student 
1,Teacher,100,student hopefully kevin unless tell little about experience there well 
1,Teacher,100,student student very enthusiastic about space enjoy 
1,Teacher,100,student well definitely think would help stuck around maybe help encourage student classmates learn little more even learn little more student self 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe understand everything help some student classmates 
1,Teacher,100,student like said think planning building base moon 
1,Teacher,100,student that's referencing text believe right about 
1,Teacher,100,whoo that's fabulous maybe help understand even more about space stay group might able help 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe help some other students because some students might first time learning about space 
1,Teacher,100,student could actually help next question 
1,Teacher,100,needs things student being astronaut okay we'll start over here student

1,Teacher,100,alright  student best look through text going come back okay student what student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student about 
1,Teacher,100,student well there's multiple pieces equipment they're right what student original answer build 
1,Teacher,100,student what student answer remind 
1,Teacher,100,alright student student turn remind what student answer question number 
1,Teacher,100,student sorry when hydrogen while 
1,Teacher,100,student asked question what equipment scientist discover water moon what student answers 
1,Teacher,100,student wants share first 
1,Teacher,100,anybody else like share what would change answer 
1,Teacher,100,student what would change student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student what would change student answer 
1,Teacher,100,would anybody else like share what would change answers 
1,Teacher,100,student because already went yesterday 
1,Teacher,100,student want share what attend student interview 
1,Teacher,100,student want some things know years before 
1,Teacher,100,don't around table  start then will on student 
1,Teacher,100,student

1,Teacher,100,student first 
1,Teacher,100,student ahead 
1,Teacher,100,right perfect which student wants speak first about what equipment scientist used discover water moon student 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah what said student answer what tell 
1,Teacher,100,student going look going told student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student could tell what think 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe 
1,Teacher,100,student what student answer tell 
1,Teacher,100,student repeat student answer 
1,Teacher,100,anybody want explain answer question initially 
1,Teacher,100,awesome okay look ng responses anyone just raise student hand anyone would anyone like share response 
1,Teacher,100,spot  since small group think just comfortable maybe sharing 
1,Teacher,100,student mind tell what tool need 
1,Teacher,100,student which what like- 
1,Teacher,100,want share student sentence really quick student  well 
1,Teacher,100,student perfect what's student answer okay 
1,Teacher,100,student what 
1,Teacher,100,anyone know answer question 
1,Teacher,100,anyone else want share answers 
1,Teacher,100,student okay hear 
1,Teacher,100,student perfect wants share answer first 
1,Teacher,100,student what student answer hear more time 
1,Teacher,100,student wants share answer first 
1,Teacher,100,student read student answer more time please 
1,Teacher,100,student read student answer please 
1,Teacher,100,student going call first what when answer question 
1,Teacher,100,student tell what responded question 
1,Teacher,100,student tell what answered what student answer 
1,Teacher,100,today student could tell what equipment scientist discover moon could read student answer 
1,Teacher,100,alright student tell what answered what said 
1,Teacher,100,student tell what said 
1,Teacher,100,guys tell little about what think equipment look like student 
1,Teacher,100,student sounds great want start 
1,Teacher,100, student that's that's totally correct think we'd agree microscope would look water really closely although think about what happens before point right 
1,Teacher,100,student know exactly equipment used discover water moon right think each like piece then just just needed microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student like couple people just circle microscope that's great example there multiple tool like just pointed come from things 
1,Teacher,100,student need microscope look really closely things what scientist used find water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student semi right could went into more detail small machine small machine called lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,student very close 
1,Teacher,100,student exactly like student thinking what keeps water together passage 
1,Teacher,100,student partially correct need microscope however that's didn't just send microscope moon 
1,Teacher,100,student well partially correct equipment sent machine called lunar orbiter able across ground surface moon surface check deposit 
1,Teacher,100,student then once figured there 
1,Teacher,100,student deposits very small water then microscope make sure what thought there okay microscope actually gave evidence 
1,Teacher,100,student there water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student then tool used microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student completely wrong will send small machine really doesn't 
1,Teacher,100,student that's said student student right track 
1,Teacher,100,student okay said student meet scientific tool called microscope look really closely right microscope piece equipment 
1,Teacher,100,yeah sure okay student also right scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,valuable okay agree valuable word that's right going look more thing more other word question student could tell what word another word circled 
1,Teacher,100,student scientist found crater full water moon absolutely true that's absolutely something reading 
1,Teacher,100,student okay there's pieces equipment actually look ng here 
1,Teacher,100,student kind version other slits think about 
1,Teacher,100,student wouldn't needed pieces equipment actually figure there water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student equipment microscope piece scientific equipment correct 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's right 
1,Teacher,100,student awesome okay yeah would used equipment would oxygen they're moon astronaut moon right 
1,Teacher,100,student well enough that's right astronaut correct 
1,Teacher,100,student well okay pieces equipment correct 
1,Teacher,100,okay read student answers think very good points everyone think little more about what question about example question what question 
1,Teacher,100,student says nasa sent small machine right enough question sent small machine look better word answer question 
1,Teacher,100,student okay said nasa send small machine right think read little 
1,Teacher,100,student think even better think that's great response think make amazing response question asking what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,that's right  what kind learn from student here learn look ng middle ground between both both pretty much gave good answer gave 
1,Teacher,100,student really really good almost exactly where want still make couple improvements there close thank student 
1,Teacher,100,student that's right piece puzzle right that's what talking earlier mentioned microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student know what that's correct statement wrote down need microsoft skype look something that's really small when back look question 
1,Teacher,100,student look student answer scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student that's very knowledgeable point 
1,Teacher,100,that's very critical tool when learning together group that's awesome dead 
1,Teacher,100,student okay track find right answer going deeper 
1,Teacher,100,student right small machine that's what using discover where water 
1,Teacher,100,okay  student think scientist used microscope look very very closely 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wrong totally right either 
1,Teacher,100,would almost there student would because question very specific meaning what piece equipment said small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student examples equipment just particular moment 
1,Teacher,100,student okay nasa good point question 
1,Teacher,100,student sort right send machine 
1,Teacher,100,student said scientist equipment like oxygen tanks equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student really close sure 
1,Teacher,100,student obviously true statement right can't live without water 
1,Teacher,100,student well microscope definitely equipment used space like because 
1,Teacher,100,student okay getting there 
1,Teacher,100,okay great okay reread over text because  student really close answer 
1,Teacher,100,student well yeah that's what just there 
1,Teacher,100,student that's true couldn't crystals investigate without small machine right 
1,Teacher,100,student tools used some observation some research 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe there's something back text could find some more 's information student information work together come full more complete answer 
1,Teacher,100,student okay that's that's part answer could more space more room 
1,Teacher,100,student okay good that's good start student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student good start 
1,Teacher,100,student well completely wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student okay yeah understand really close 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah look d really close microscope weren't exactly wrong there just more specific answer yeah good 
1,Teacher,100,student that's very interesting take actually first read through answering question thought same thing 
1,Teacher,100,student because would 
1,Teacher,100,student wrong okay just need elaborate little more okay 
1,Teacher,100,student right things question about what equipment scientist discover water moon they're moon know they're using oxygen tanks stuff like what need find about water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student nasa sent small machine didn't sent astronaut space make sense 
1,Teacher,100,really like what said nasa send small machine right direction want everybody look text 
1,Teacher,100,student polar crater student part answer right 
1,Teacher,100,student student piece 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah sound like agree oxygen tanks when they're space moon think what trying figure 
1,Teacher,100,student well student right need microscope look water 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer necessarily wrong just little deeper make student answer more detailed just little better what right what great start 
1,Teacher,100,student said nasa sent small machine correct send student small machine order discover water 
1,Teacher,100,student that's good need 
1,Teacher,100,student oxygen tank maybe used breathe 
1,Teacher,100,student okay find 
1,Teacher,100,student craters water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer incredibly wrong headed right direction would definitely need microscope because water 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer scientist found crater full water moon article found crater some water moon didn't full water 
1,Teacher,100,student mhmm good student answer just needed little more whole small piece answer 
1,Teacher,100,because student just responded thinks knows just about everything about  want tell really enjoyed reading student answer because talked about water split said split into parts hydrogen oxygen correct 
1,Teacher,100,student okay yeah student right scientist would oxygen tank breathe space 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah maybe just little more attention exact question correct student response just didn't specifically answer question 
1,Teacher,100,astronauts didn't oxygen oxygen tanks like student said 
1,Teacher,100,yeah okay look ng student responses will student probably closest getting correct answer student response 
1,Teacher,100,student sounds filming crater full water moon okay find crater water 
1,Teacher,100,student necessarily 
1,Teacher,100,right student nasa send small machine student almost 100% right 
1,Teacher,100,student right okay good maybe microscope isn't what used discover 
1,Teacher,100,because look listen look student answers student said scientist found crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student that's entirely true find water some places 
1,Teacher,100,microscopes discover things just like guys said tool help discover things 
1,Teacher,100,student what tool scientist used microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student think both right fact scientific tool just need clarify what tool 
1,Teacher,100,right small machine great student 
1,Teacher,100,student moon isn't ready live student absolutely right 
1,Teacher,100,student tools scientist just make sure student reading question what specific equipment used discover water moon okay 
1,Teacher,100,student okay would would correct there's definitely oxygen space 
1,Teacher,100,student well part part answer 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well student able find there used small machine know very good able discover sort what answer 
1,Teacher,100,student know correct student able find where able find water 
1,Teacher,100,student well would definitely equipment especially know breathe sort operate within space around moon moon good yeah yeah 
1,Teacher,100,student totally sure could like maybe entire moon being covered garden 
1,Teacher,100,student wrong answer could better ch ice going talk about more about when talking just like brought discover before when look question look discover 
1,Teacher,100,student both right track here equipment they're using microscope water 
1,Teacher,100,student might made observation about scientist find ng crater which very good student noticing crater that's where water 
1,Teacher,100,student partially correct student right sense nasa send small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student correct nasa types equipment boots special special article clothing some some things like oxygen tanks different things things might like when they're exploring space around space missions they're talking about machine find about find about deposit 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's really good question lunar orbiter wouldn't need microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student student partially right when kind 
1,Teacher,100,student that's really interesting don't know that's truth mean don't know like that's like truthful like 
1,Teacher,100,talk about student student answer scientist equipment like oxygen tanks true 
1,Teacher,100,student that's true tell read part text that's true student talking about water which questions asking talk about water 
1,Teacher,100,student right student definitely right 
1,Teacher,100,on said need scientific tool called microscope look really closely water moon guys both right track guys really thinking like where student headed 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely absolutely some great observations yeah absolutely would equipment nasa would refer back question what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student scientific tool think right track 
1,Teacher,100,perfect student absolutely right track 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely student absolutely right equipment huge what 
1,Teacher,100,think guys great right track 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely fact true focus what question actually asking 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah said would look closely discover d found there water there 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student correct scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student think answers getting right track 
1,Teacher,100,student getting right answer 
1,Teacher,100,student know what mean microscope look closely water 
1,Teacher,100,student equipment while moon stuff like 
1,Teacher,100,well that's very good microscope would part answer lunar orbiter would also part answer right student 
1,Teacher,100,okay student look student answer said scientist equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks very true know when space need oxygen able breathe 
1,Teacher,100,student scientists need other other equipment like oxygen tanks when into space help 
1,Teacher,100,student small actually smaller small microscopic really word means very very small small enough where can't actually without special tool 
1,Teacher,100,student that's great question student partially right entirely there student very right when actually microscope water absolutely 
1,Teacher,100,student that's absolutely right only halfway right know foot door rest 
1,Teacher,100,student halfway 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely microscope actually water 
1,Teacher,100,student sure absolutely some equipment moon can't imagine just know stroll moon absolutely equipment there student wrong regard 
1,Teacher,100,student essence yeah should probably oxygen tanks when space need breathe right 
1,Teacher,100,student student right whenever into space there's equipment into space moon land moon 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely student initial answer correct need water able drink able survive 
1,Teacher,100,what miss  just read what's advantages told makes think there might full water what guys think 
1,Teacher,100,student oxygen tanks find water know exactly purpose oxygen tanks designed 
1,Teacher,100,student right even though wasn't even though didn't oxygen takes help mission find samples 
1,Teacher,100,student okay look ng wouldn't need space exploration 
1,Teacher,100,student tools like 
1,Teacher,100,student well right thing then find other tool scientist used almost right just more tool 
1,Teacher,100,student helped saying there matter microscope still trying figure what other tool even audio 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope wrong we've answered part question want says what other what tool found tool want find other tool microscope correct want find other tool also story even said 
1,Teacher,100,student items needed find water moon find other item needed moon 
1,Teacher,100,student think helped each other come conclusion bunch answers might thought after read first time ice talk other people ideas right 
1,Teacher,100,student okay student answer wasn't completely wrong mention nasa send small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student would love actual student student answer completely wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah pretty good response because lunar orbiter definitely small machine what sent moon 
1,Teacher,100,student really awesome response because definitely true scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah definitely like used oxygen tanks equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student okay really good thing bring on appreciate student response isn't wrong just focus different section text kind focused microscope very right 
1,Teacher,100,student that's great that's great answer small machine that's what microscope real word want find here last paragraph 
1,Teacher,100,student would wouldn't thing found water 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well after asked question student answer maybe didn't include what question look ng 
1,Teacher,100,student also found different paragraph there multiple answers 
1,Teacher,100,yeah there's multiple pieces equipment that's guys answering 
1,Teacher,100,student lunar orbiter another equipment then fellow classmate also mentioned sentences shall getting sort said microscope yeah 
1,Teacher,100,student just maybe add ng couple more equipment sentence help just bulk give more understanding follow reader reading sentence 
1,Teacher,100,correct student answer exactly look ng 
1,Teacher,100,student true fully insured 
1,Teacher,100,student moon equipment 
1,Teacher,100,said everyone else student answer correct exactly answer look ng 
1,Teacher,100,student know student background knowledge correct he's answer would where answer 
1,Teacher,100,student because student intro wasn't exactly what look ng 
1,Teacher,100,wide range could multiple answers like  said machine there well couldn't find water didn't there right machine microscope excuse student 
1,Teacher,100,alright student saying there's multiple tool used find water because there order find water right that's really good answer 
1,Teacher,100,student started student response really well 
1,Teacher,100,student said nasa sent small machine student correct nasa mentioned part 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer okay student wrong student just fully there okay 
1,Teacher,100,student student student answer nasa sent small machine student right about like small machine piece equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student there some more evidence used also said can't survive without water 
1,Teacher,100,student which right know that's known fact 
1,Teacher,100,student didn't answer question 
1,Teacher,100,student doesn't really explain water being moon would valuable 
1,Teacher,100,student well wrong sense going moment 
1,Teacher,100,student that's good point focusing equipment used find water 
1,Teacher,100,student what wear 
1,Teacher,100,student student right path just need more makes sense 
1,Teacher,100,part student other part need together 
1,Teacher,100,student right track mention microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah microscope part 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah just getting closer closer answer 
1,Teacher,100,student answers little just -they're right direction they're exactly meeting expectations 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah what's student student response i'll read nasa send small machine which true nasa send small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student student right need scientific tool called microscope that's right student right also need 
1,Teacher,100,right student talked about need scientific tool called microscope look really closely that's great sentence great start 
1,Teacher,100,student very true equipment many times many different things actually what used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student answer question because often chicks definitely 
1,Teacher,100,student just think could little more room improvement 
1,Teacher,100,well student background knowledge student science equipment think what question asking doesn't mean necessarily background knowledge more look evidence from text 
1,Teacher,100,student question didn't necessarily background knowledge what said probably would used potentially find water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student question look text evidence don't think text talks about oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wasn't wrong think really great start response there said nasa uses small machine sent small machine that's true that's correct 
1,Teacher,100,student there both right because text actually talks about both things used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,need just like telling student well  right about 
1,Teacher,100,student also sometimes might answer student answer wrong answering question asked want also look question because sometimes might find something that's text might very true nothing question asked 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah other tool scientist 
1,Teacher,100,next time good okay chose same answer shows guys highlighting right answers passage 
1,Teacher,100,student student absolutely right found water moon that's what passage told 
1,Teacher,100,student student absolutely right while student answer right scientist oxygen tank sometimes when talking about water being found moon 
1,Teacher,100,student don't think answers specific question understand 
1,Teacher,100,student exactly there's possibility lunar there's microscope lunar orbiter helps look ashes moon 
1,Teacher,100,student part 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer great start okay 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah really really important 
1,Teacher,100,student just because didn't talk about reading doesn't mean important 
1,Teacher,100,student weren't wrong just think could build upon student answer more make even stronger 
1,Teacher,100,don't think student answer like saying student answers necessarily wrong student sitting group think student answers work could some improvement 
1,Teacher,100,give same note gave student although answer correct think could build deeper meaning build build upon student answer elop even more make even stronger already 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer correct just when look ng answers know there more parts answer make stronger answer doesn't doesn't mean right wrong just stronger 
1,Teacher,100,student part what think student answer although stated used microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer although come straight from article reading 
1,Teacher,100,student well there couple answers 
1,Teacher,100,then student going look student answer really great think really understood text sure quite understood question asking 
1,Teacher,100,tell what equipment  student student completely wrong microscope piece equipment that's full answer 
1,Teacher,100,right then student also know microscope well once discover d water remember reading 
1,Teacher,100,student that's good thought through wasn't answer just wasn't correct question 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer correct 
1,Teacher,100,student right might used different equipment moon survive moon field walk around breathe student right 
1,Teacher,100,student spaceship there talking specifically about discover water just like says from reading 
1,Teacher,100,want take look even closer student there's another scientific equipment used specifically find water because microscope going help maybe look water closer look other things maybe just magnified didn't specifically find water 
1,Teacher,100,equipment look ng equipment into creators wouldn't exactly microscope into crater find student just something student like 
1,Teacher,100,student what just only thing student answer great because right from text saying water there important 
1,Teacher,100,student some equipment moon focus other what discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student find anything specifically related think student really good path quite there 
1,Teacher,100,student part part answer 
1,Teacher,100,student okay there another tool there 
1,Teacher,100,student totally totally completely understand love answered question because student question 
1,Teacher,100,student student question wrong student question right student question spectacular plus going student question right 
1,Teacher,100,student that's like okay know want student question student answer spectacular 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope tool think there's more more important piece equipment 
1,Teacher,100,thank answer student used lunar orbiter discover water then used microscope order able closer since small 
1,Teacher,100,student teacher almost there nice 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wasn't totally wasn't completely incorrect 
1,Teacher,100,missing step number student great explaining step number great explaining step number need together 
1,Teacher,100,student right sure that's absolutely right into space need tons equipment don't down here right 
1,Teacher,100,need there's parts answer need combine what  answer what student said answer there's parts 
1,Teacher,100,that's great start student 
1,Teacher,100,student right probably would need microscope anything that's tiny can't student naked 
1,Teacher,100,student student right wouldn't need microscope order look water order find water 
1,Teacher,100,student don't think would oxygen tanks think would helpful don't think exactly what scientist used discover water 
1,Teacher,100,student investigate little more into text might there something used before microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah student exactly right water water grow things sure would work moon 
1,Teacher,100,student don't think could don't think could grow plants water other uses moon 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah think student right think might take scientist long time water doesn't mean less valuable because think there lots different 
1,Teacher,100,student true water moon microscopic first first step reviewing question 
1,Teacher,100,student about water know asked what discover water true water small need microscope that's what's really being asked 
1,Teacher,100,equipment gone moon process that's exact equipment used discover water student 
1,Teacher,100,student that's quite really answering question like 
1,Teacher,100,student getting closer answer sent small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope part equipment used discover water right student right there there part equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student student right oxygen tanks equipment sometimes need moon that's when 
1,Teacher,100,student when need astronaut need human beings because human beings human beings needs oxygen over there 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer isn't wrong because answers question want there's maybe better answer sometimes there's answers them's little more specific 
1,Teacher,100,student actually like moment that's exactly what object called 
1,Teacher,100,student said nasa sense small machine okay know student actually correct 
1,Teacher,100,student that's great place start thank 
1,Teacher,100,student even though like student answer think even better answering question 
1,Teacher,100,student think included microscope student student answer lunar orbiter would like best answer ever 
1,Teacher,100,student important both things want microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student right track find ng right answer 
1,Teacher,100,student well student answer actually wrong just half piece student more smaller picture 
1,Teacher,100,exactly right know what onto something student microscope response because really essential part analyzing dirt moon however microscope dirt analyze student what's 
1,Teacher,100,student unfortunately don't think oxygen tank time 
1,Teacher,100,student right student when said need find would need microscope because water microscopic probably microscope that's necessarily what using find discover water right 
1,Teacher,100,yeah exactly okay what hearing from guys different tool really important 
1,Teacher,100,what really want focus right what's important water right because true like said when student need oxygen tanks right need breathe 
1,Teacher,100,would kind pair little more student saying student right track 
1,Teacher,100,student find paragraph tech scientist like sentence where corresponds because answer oxygen tanks didn't from paragraph student find paragraph 
1,Teacher,100,pieces equipment right lunar orbiter student talked about response microscope talked about student response 
1,Teacher,100,talked about microscope didn't talk about lunar orbiter student talked about lunar orbiter microscope used pieces equipment because takes things find water moon discover 
1,Teacher,100,question equipment just talked about lunar orbiter microscope   student talked about discover water 
1,Teacher,100,student okay scientist better 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's part there's also right small machine thinking about right right 
1,Teacher,100,student know think student think student right track there look article article 
1,Teacher,100,student think student right track 
1,Teacher,100,student okay possible pieces equipment thank sharing student thinking 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's really great point each what noticing like spoken about piece equipment maybe other 
1,Teacher,100,student think about could know circle both civic equipment only also think about what each piece equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student think great response know could even step 
1,Teacher,100,student okay okay well that's good there's oxygen tanks discover water they're going need more oxygen tanks right probably going need more 
1,Teacher,100,student okay great that's almost there think circled whole sentence investigate lunar orbiter then together savannas answer 
1,Teacher,100,awesome awesome okay  student will pair find answer question thank folks 
1,Teacher,100,student board 
1,Teacher,100,student someone else build samantha's answer someone else talk about 
1,Teacher,100,microscope would allow discover water then first part question right equipment someone think about connects discover ng water ark student 
1,Teacher,100,student awesome lunar orbiter someone else answer allow scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,what other folks think about where want agree answer ahead student 
1,Teacher,100,student about 's answer compare student answers while work other people 
1,Teacher,100,yeah   guys both reading find something similar something different student 
1,Teacher,100,what investigate mean anybody know student 
1,Teacher,100,anybody like title 
1,Teacher,100,what astronaut student 
1,Teacher,100,there convincing evidence valuable resource student 
1,Teacher,100,don't don't look back student work together since same answer 
1,Teacher,100,talk about going speak student moment okay 
1,Teacher,100,student could help little more maybe find ng different piece equipment might used 
1,Teacher,100,student tell what tool what tool 
1,Teacher,100,student circle word 
1,Teacher,100,okay well look back reading passage   since guys same answer microscope want guys look back student reading passage 
1,Teacher,100,student finish before come back ahead work next question 
1,Teacher,100,wonder maybe student help because sent mission find answer 
1,Teacher,100,would agree what student said 
1,Teacher,100,back student second able find what answered answer specific question 
1,Teacher,100,figure because student same answer talk  work together 
1,Teacher,100,okay that's great question anyone tell what think would answer s question which wouldn't microscope discover d water  support answer evidence lunar orbiter okay student what think 
1,Teacher,100,okay anybody else different answer 
1,Teacher,100,tell maybe about student he's sure moon maybe help give different answer 
1,Teacher,100,okay student able help 
1,Teacher,100,perfect yeah many guys pick d equipment discover 
1,Teacher,100,student what 
1,Teacher,100,student answer scientist found using smaller machine guys know water rightq 
1,Teacher,100,student okay perfect about kind work together back look text look specifically what piece equipment used look what look ng 
1,Teacher,100,perfect awesome about   guys look together okay 
1,Teacher,100,about  kind work together look back maybe guys help each other look text 
1,Teacher,100,student about together reread passage together talk about student answer 
1,Teacher,100,maybe   guys want look over text together starting paragraph three think help reread okay 
1,Teacher,100,what think  what feel about what student said 
1,Teacher,100,kind build student could remind what question what question answering here 
1,Teacher,100,well i'll here  appreciate student feedback what microscope attached help student 
1,Teacher,100,well mean won't back reread help savannnah  what think said circled same answer student what microscope attached find water crater 
1,Teacher,100,really that's good guess student what 
1,Teacher,100,okay really good guesses still missing point student calling what 
1,Teacher,100,awesome anyone else different response student 
1,Teacher,100,would like know would like hear from student found what found then student elbow partner agrees 
1,Teacher,100,would anyone else like build response 
1,Teacher,100,don't  talk student want what come together 
1,Teacher,100,okay   look ng back they're thinking about 's answer would like four student jump combine student answers what come 
1,Teacher,100,look ng paragraph sent small machine  student thought needed microscope don't five talk together combine answers 
1,Teacher,100,what think about student 
1,Teacher,100,what student think equipment might possibly small machine well 
1,Teacher,100,absolutely correct good  okay want guys give give thumbs agree thumbs middle student quite sure thumbs down disagree  guys 
1,Teacher,100,okay anybody different answer student 
1,Teacher,100,anybody different answer from   what student what 
1,Teacher,100,anyone else find anything different 
1,Teacher,100,student what equipment used find water moon about scientist 
1,Teacher,100,student 
1,Teacher,100,student okay speaking water heavy 's answer okay there's said water heavy good don't carry 
1,Teacher,100,student help 
1,Teacher,100,student what else oxygen hydrogen could used 
1,Teacher,100,right very good want talk each other student groups going    group  student 
1,Teacher,100,very good question anyone anybody wants help answer would microscope along lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,look something what anything else    student investigate means what what mean 
1,Teacher,100,there other word text might help maybe someone else group right answer lunar orbiter what some word think could underline circle might help friend someone sitting next 
1,Teacher,100,what word text might help someone else answer question what think student what might help student friend 
1,Teacher,100,student while talked some others maybe we'll discover together what think 
1,Teacher,100,student together work together find answer okay 
1,Teacher,100,student what other answers could talk about work together 
1,Teacher,100,student raise student hand think that's true statement found crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,okay eventually think should along what student said don't think quite ready think maybe long r search future could possibility 
1,Teacher,100,work together y'all work combine student answers help each other 
1,Teacher,100,things evidence could drink water from moon think could work student 
1,Teacher,100,look student text  work together because guys kind same page student 
1,Teacher,100,sure  student might thinking well pick d specific tool 
1,Teacher,100,student agree answer 
1,Teacher,100,what could somebody help student 
1,Teacher,100,read about student 
1,Teacher,100,student questions help somebody else help 
1,Teacher,100,student somebody help 
1,Teacher,100,student help there 
1,Teacher,100,student 
1,Teacher,100,anybody student tell 
1,Teacher,100,rest talk student about because he's trying find which discover microscope lunar orbiter think answer talk  help discover which 
1,Teacher,100,good  what student about water 
1,Teacher,100,then student would valuable water space don't from earth moon 
1,Teacher,100,student want answer 's question 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well student other classmates 
1,Teacher,100,break into groups   will group then   student 
1,Teacher,100,student take about seconds each person going share 
1,Teacher,100,group members while first person sharing 
1,Teacher,100,just listening going start student will first person share 
1,Teacher,100,debbie will second  you'll third  forth then  last each person student going about seconds share student answer  will first then student i'll tell when when start 
1,Teacher,100,after okay you'll share group student 
1,Teacher,100,student talk rest classmates what thought then maybe 
1,Teacher,100,okay student agree also something else 
1,Teacher,100,right anybody anything else thanks important everybody else agree convincing evidence valuable role very important word 
1,Teacher,100,want guys turn talk share pair about seconds look through there find some places show through text water valuable resource 
1,Teacher,100,just paragraph four five okay on  guys  work together  student work together 
1,Teacher,100,anybody answer 
1,Teacher,100,about  student show another water could useful tell paragraph student start read sentence comes from well okay 
1,Teacher,100,very good that's claim student said right  
1,Teacher,100,well  question  mentioned nasa sent small machine what kind machine nasa send maybe help student 
1,Teacher,100,okay student know about space tell what lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,that's great guys think microscope find water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student what scientist fine 
1,Teacher,100,okay yeah what small machine student look paragraph tell what small machine 
1,Teacher,100,okay student help tell what lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,anybody else another aspect what also sent astronaut 
1,Teacher,100,okay  agree student 
1,Teacher,100,okay that's type equipment anyone else know about another type equipment 
1,Teacher,100,maybe  think help student 
1,Teacher,100,okay based what student just read about lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,what point microscope according article know what paragraph anyone help  find paragraph microscope mentioned student 
1,Teacher,100,what think about student 
1,Teacher,100,hear what said student 
1,Teacher,100,anybody else other equipment other answers could possibly related 
1,Teacher,100,student equipment 
1,Teacher,100,okay thumbs agree student thumbs down think something needs add d answer 
1,Teacher,100,okay everyone  what think agree student 
1,Teacher,100,anybody else different answer stuck between microscope lunar orbiter right 
1,Teacher,100,teacher then student able help push answer little further identify lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,anybody find different word equipment question 
1,Teacher,100,somebody help student what another word maybe only said once t ice could look text what's another ke word somebody else found 
1,Teacher,100,yeah convincing important word like valuable valuable good also convincing what convincing convincing what what being convinced anybody word along savannas word convincing 
1,Teacher,100,exactly reading piece astronaut went space company called nasa sent piece equipment space anybody remember name piece equipment 
1,Teacher,100,okay circled student ke word would like turn person beside   youtube talk  student talk 
1,Teacher,100,student then eighth share student answer want talk person beside about word underline thought important help answer question ahead take seconds 
1,Teacher,100,want guys talk about same partner 
1,Teacher,100,talk together   talk then student talk 
1,Teacher,100,student want take couple seconds talk person sachi 
1,Teacher,100,work together  together student work okay take couple seconds 
1,Teacher,100,okay equipment discover anyone else underlying equipment 
1,Teacher,100,guess what talked  student here right which don't mind 
1,Teacher,100,student answer nasa send small machine student think machine look because couldn't eyes 
1,Teacher,100,anyone know 
1,Teacher,100,anyone agree disagree student 
1,Teacher,100,believe don't need help well going work through together we'll actually what learn along anyone else questions before begin 
1,Teacher,100,entirely there just student what 
1,Teacher,100,well absolutely right track student what 
1,Teacher,100,okay think right what discuss student neighbor even group kind talk about where guys student answers from what student like know more about 
1,Teacher,100,okay well what  student thought well 
1,Teacher,100,okay that's really good thought  want hear from student classmates then going come back together what everyone thinks about student terms okay student would like next 
1,Teacher,100,hear from  what we'll come together group response okay 
1,Teacher,100,want guys break into small groups    then maybe   guys will work together just little questions while student discussing what want guys focus 
1,Teacher,100,sure well know couple guys student hand raised  would like share student student reconstructed maybe will help  word since guys similar answers 
1,Teacher,100,split water into elements like said student said oxygen tanks come what astronaut could water main 
1,Teacher,100,using what   talk student good student response  just wanted work together help astronaut 
1,Teacher,100,student think takes someone find 
1,Teacher,100,guys guys close  history student death 
1,Teacher,100,what other kinds equipment would guys would need find water moon other microscope 
1,Teacher,100,anybody ideas student 
1,Teacher,100,right anybody else anything else text might microscope student 
1,Teacher,100,know student remember what tool scientist used 
1,Teacher,100,there somebody student would like help 
1,Teacher,100,alright student tell other item needed 
1,Teacher,100,okay continue look maybe student help 
1,Teacher,100,student want help 
1,Teacher,100,anybody know what either hydrogen oxygen within water 
1,Teacher,100,really good answer well brought guys together because guys varying answers hoping when guys hear student responses like student classmates responses 
1,Teacher,100,ideas well because even smartest people world work other people make things better because collaborate then guys learn same time 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe from listening student classmates might text things learn from what really happening along what found prior knowledge okay then listen classmates right 
1,Teacher,100,maybe keep listening heard from  might hear from on student 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well that's great don't asked about cars we'll come back there's anything more afterwards okay 
1,Teacher,100,student there anything student like we've look d through text want review there's anything else 
1,Teacher,100,we've heard everyone else's responses anything reflect about what student heard equipment used find water moon 
1,Teacher,100,everyone look first before share anyone besides-- anyone else student what come 
1,Teacher,100,good knowing answer anyone else want student want yeah ahead 
1,Teacher,100,want- before into want anyone else share other equipment circled

1,Teacher,100,okay anyone else anyone else guesses 
1,Teacher,100,want into some small groups really quickly going   then   student going work together want compare contrast difference between lunar orbiter microscope 
1,Teacher,100,want small group   together    also small group want circle equipment reading think important then want come back minute 
1,Teacher,100,student saying answer's wrong right just want collaborate student peers because different answers then want collaborate okay thank question 
1,Teacher,100,student what answer question what equipment scientist discover water moon

1,Teacher,100,okay perfect alright start 's group what some things said make water valuable resource from moon student 
1,Teacher,100,student question 
1,Teacher,100,what else think would make water valuable student what student thoughts 
1,Teacher,100,student what's another water could valuable what's another thing could water 
1,Teacher,100,okay student ahead 
1,Teacher,100,what some things oxygen what think student 
1,Teacher,100,student what think 
1,Teacher,100,student what think used determine water moon what what reading tell 
1,Teacher,100,student question 
1,Teacher,100,student ideas about might detect water from orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,student thoughts about 
1,Teacher,100,ahead what think student ahead 
1,Teacher,100,student what 
1,Teacher,100,student sabina care share student response 
1,Teacher,100,student what what 
1,Teacher,100,water moon could valuable astronaut student stated there convincing evidence correct 
1,Teacher,100,then student what astronaut could 
1,Teacher,100,teacheralright student without look ng text know answer question 
1,Teacher,100,right student what student answer discussion question 
1,Teacher,100,student 
1,Teacher,100,alright student kind want explain student answer 
1,Teacher,100,what student 
1,Teacher,100,student what discover 
1,Teacher,100,student 
1,Teacher,100,student haven't spoken what believe sent moon 
1,Teacher,100,would like least beginning student  e know what first question 
1,Teacher,100,student what student answer question 
1,Teacher,100,okay over first group 
1,Teacher,100,student what's something learn from student partners 
1,Teacher,100,student okay student answer will refresh memory tell what student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student 
1,Teacher,100,student 
1,Teacher,100,okay student isn't what mentioned student need scientific tool called what 
1,Teacher,100,okay right student 
1,Teacher,100,student seems like  here kind same path  read student response please 
1,Teacher,100,then while student hear from some people haven't talked about what about  student when tell what what read 
1,Teacher,100,okay what what find what what like share together group 
1,Teacher,100,sounds very good would anyone like open what thought response first discussion question 
1,Teacher,100,student anything would like share 
1,Teacher,100,what called guys     guys other information about lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,student what small machine called 
1,Teacher,100,student well then ahead 
1,Teacher,100,student even ahead start 
1,Teacher,100,someone else talk second anyone hand raised 
1,Teacher,100,student what know about equipment used space 
1,Teacher,100,what thinking student haven't heard much from 
1,Teacher,100,student what thinking 
1,Teacher,100,student what thinking number 
1,Teacher,100,actually anyone want start share opinion allowed 
1,Teacher,100,glad haven't figured  remind student student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student share student answer 
1,Teacher,100,alright student find where 
1,Teacher,100,student found oxygen tank 
1,Teacher,100,student question 
1,Teacher,100,student finished 
1,Teacher,100,more seconds 987654321 right actually start student we'll move around circle  what word circle  
1,Teacher,100,student what circle 
1,Teacher,100,what student 
1,Teacher,100,student what 
1,Teacher,100,student what 
1,Teacher,100,what  student tell about microscope there 
1,Teacher,100,anybody want to-- 
1,Teacher,100,student that's that's totally correct think we'd agree microscope would look water really closely although think about what happens before point right 
1,Teacher,100,student know exactly equipment used discover water moon right think each like piece then just just needed microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student like couple people just circle microscope that's great example there multiple tool like just pointed come from things 
1,Teacher,100,student need microscope look really closely things what scientist used find water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student semi right could went into more detail small machine small machine called lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,student very close 
1,Teacher,100,student exactly like student thinking what keeps water together passage 
1,Teacher,100,student partially correct need microscope however that's didn't just send microscope moon 
1,Teacher,100,student well partially correct equipment sent machine called lunar orbiter able across ground surface moon surface check deposit 
1,Teacher,100,student then once figured there 
1,Teacher,100,student deposits very small water then microscope make sure what thought there okay microscope actually gave evidence 
1,Teacher,100,student there water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student then tool used microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student completely wrong will send small machine really doesn't 
1,Teacher,100,student that's said student student right track 
1,Teacher,100,student okay said student meet scientific tool called microscope look really closely right microscope piece equipment 
1,Teacher,100,yeah sure okay student also right scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,valuable okay agree valuable word that's right going look more thing more other word question student could tell what word another word circled 
1,Teacher,100,student scientist found crater full water moon absolutely true that's absolutely something reading 
1,Teacher,100,student okay there's pieces equipment actually look ng here 
1,Teacher,100,student kind version other slits think about 
1,Teacher,100,student wouldn't needed pieces equipment actually figure there water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student equipment microscope piece scientific equipment correct 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's right 
1,Teacher,100,student awesome okay yeah would used equipment would oxygen they're moon astronaut moon right 
1,Teacher,100,student well enough that's right astronaut correct 
1,Teacher,100,student well okay pieces equipment correct 
1,Teacher,100,okay read student answers think very good points everyone think little more about what question about example question what question 
1,Teacher,100,student says nasa sent small machine right enough question sent small machine look better word answer question 
1,Teacher,100,student okay said nasa send small machine right think read little 
1,Teacher,100,student think even better think that's great response think make amazing response question asking what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,that's right  what kind learn from student here learn look ng middle ground between both both pretty much gave good answer gave 
1,Teacher,100,student really really good almost exactly where want still make couple improvements there close thank student 
1,Teacher,100,student that's right piece puzzle right that's what talking earlier mentioned microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student know what that's correct statement wrote down need microsoft skype look something that's really small when back look question 
1,Teacher,100,student look student answer scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student that's very knowledgeable point 
1,Teacher,100,that's very critical tool when learning together group that's awesome dead 
1,Teacher,100,student okay track find right answer going deeper 
1,Teacher,100,student right small machine that's what using discover where water 
1,Teacher,100,okay  student think scientist used microscope look very very closely 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wrong totally right either 
1,Teacher,100,would almost there student would because question very specific meaning what piece equipment said small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student examples equipment just particular moment 
1,Teacher,100,student okay nasa good point question 
1,Teacher,100,student sort right send machine 
1,Teacher,100,student said scientist equipment like oxygen tanks equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student really close sure 
1,Teacher,100,student obviously true statement right can't live without water 
1,Teacher,100,student well microscope definitely equipment used space like because 
1,Teacher,100,student okay getting there 
1,Teacher,100,okay great okay reread over text because  student really close answer 
1,Teacher,100,student well yeah that's what just there 
1,Teacher,100,student that's true couldn't crystals investigate without small machine right 
1,Teacher,100,student tools used some observation some research 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe there's something back text could find some more 's information student information work together come full more complete answer 
1,Teacher,100,student okay that's that's part answer could more space more room 
1,Teacher,100,student okay good that's good start student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student good start 
1,Teacher,100,student well completely wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student okay yeah understand really close 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah look d really close microscope weren't exactly wrong there just more specific answer yeah good 
1,Teacher,100,student that's very interesting take actually first read through answering question thought same thing 
1,Teacher,100,student because would 
1,Teacher,100,student wrong okay just need elaborate little more okay 
1,Teacher,100,student right things question about what equipment scientist discover water moon they're moon know they're using oxygen tanks stuff like what need find about water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student nasa sent small machine didn't sent astronaut space make sense 
1,Teacher,100,really like what said nasa send small machine right direction want everybody look text 
1,Teacher,100,student polar crater student part answer right 
1,Teacher,100,student student piece 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah sound like agree oxygen tanks when they're space moon think what trying figure 
1,Teacher,100,student well student right need microscope look water 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer necessarily wrong just little deeper make student answer more detailed just little better what right what great start 
1,Teacher,100,student said nasa sent small machine correct send student small machine order discover water 
1,Teacher,100,student that's good need 
1,Teacher,100,student oxygen tank maybe used breathe 
1,Teacher,100,student okay find 
1,Teacher,100,student craters water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer incredibly wrong headed right direction would definitely need microscope because water 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer scientist found crater full water moon article found crater some water moon didn't full water 
1,Teacher,100,student mhmm good student answer just needed little more whole small piece answer 
1,Teacher,100,because student just responded thinks knows just about everything about  want tell really enjoyed reading student answer because talked about water split said split into parts hydrogen oxygen correct 
1,Teacher,100,student okay yeah student right scientist would oxygen tank breathe space 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah maybe just little more attention exact question correct student response just didn't specifically answer question 
1,Teacher,100,astronauts didn't oxygen oxygen tanks like student said 
1,Teacher,100,yeah okay look ng student responses will student probably closest getting correct answer student response 
1,Teacher,100,student sounds filming crater full water moon okay find crater water 
1,Teacher,100,student necessarily 
1,Teacher,100,right student nasa send small machine student almost 100% right 
1,Teacher,100,student right okay good maybe microscope isn't what used discover 
1,Teacher,100,because look listen look student answers student said scientist found crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student that's entirely true find water some places 
1,Teacher,100,microscopes discover things just like guys said tool help discover things 
1,Teacher,100,student what tool scientist used microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student think both right fact scientific tool just need clarify what tool 
1,Teacher,100,right small machine great student 
1,Teacher,100,student moon isn't ready live student absolutely right 
1,Teacher,100,student tools scientist just make sure student reading question what specific equipment used discover water moon okay 
1,Teacher,100,student okay would would correct there's definitely oxygen space 
1,Teacher,100,student well part part answer 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well student able find there used small machine know very good able discover sort what answer 
1,Teacher,100,student know correct student able find where able find water 
1,Teacher,100,student well would definitely equipment especially know breathe sort operate within space around moon moon good yeah yeah 
1,Teacher,100,student totally sure could like maybe entire moon being covered garden 
1,Teacher,100,student wrong answer could better ch ice going talk about more about when talking just like brought discover before when look question look discover 
1,Teacher,100,student both right track here equipment they're using microscope water 
1,Teacher,100,student might made observation about scientist find ng crater which very good student noticing crater that's where water 
1,Teacher,100,student partially correct student right sense nasa send small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student correct nasa types equipment boots special special article clothing some some things like oxygen tanks different things things might like when they're exploring space around space missions they're talking about machine find about find about deposit 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's really good question lunar orbiter wouldn't need microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student student partially right when kind 
1,Teacher,100,student that's really interesting don't know that's truth mean don't know like that's like truthful like 
1,Teacher,100,talk about student student answer scientist equipment like oxygen tanks true 
1,Teacher,100,student that's true tell read part text that's true student talking about water which questions asking talk about water 
1,Teacher,100,student right student definitely right 
1,Teacher,100,on said need scientific tool called microscope look really closely water moon guys both right track guys really thinking like where student headed 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely absolutely some great observations yeah absolutely would equipment nasa would refer back question what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student scientific tool think right track 
1,Teacher,100,perfect student absolutely right track 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely student absolutely right equipment huge what 
1,Teacher,100,think guys great right track 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely fact true focus what question actually asking 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah said would look closely discover d found there water there 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student correct scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student think answers getting right track 
1,Teacher,100,student getting right answer 
1,Teacher,100,student know what mean microscope look closely water 
1,Teacher,100,student equipment while moon stuff like 
1,Teacher,100,well that's very good microscope would part answer lunar orbiter would also part answer right student 
1,Teacher,100,okay student look student answer said scientist equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks very true know when space need oxygen able breathe 
1,Teacher,100,student scientists need other other equipment like oxygen tanks when into space help 
1,Teacher,100,student small actually smaller small microscopic really word means very very small small enough where can't actually without special tool 
1,Teacher,100,student that's great question student partially right entirely there student very right when actually microscope water absolutely 
1,Teacher,100,student that's absolutely right only halfway right know foot door rest 
1,Teacher,100,student halfway 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely microscope actually water 
1,Teacher,100,student sure absolutely some equipment moon can't imagine just know stroll moon absolutely equipment there student wrong regard 
1,Teacher,100,student essence yeah should probably oxygen tanks when space need breathe right 
1,Teacher,100,student student right whenever into space there's equipment into space moon land moon 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely student initial answer correct need water able drink able survive 
1,Teacher,100,what miss  just read what's advantages told makes think there might full water what guys think 
1,Teacher,100,student oxygen tanks find water know exactly purpose oxygen tanks designed 
1,Teacher,100,student right even though wasn't even though didn't oxygen takes help mission find samples 
1,Teacher,100,student okay look ng wouldn't need space exploration 
1,Teacher,100,student tools like 
1,Teacher,100,student well right thing then find other tool scientist used almost right just more tool 
1,Teacher,100,student helped saying there matter microscope still trying figure what other tool even audio 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope wrong we've answered part question want says what other what tool found tool want find other tool microscope correct want find other tool also story even said 
1,Teacher,100,student items needed find water moon find other item needed moon 
1,Teacher,100,student think helped each other come conclusion bunch answers might thought after read first time ice talk other people ideas right 
1,Teacher,100,student okay student answer wasn't completely wrong mention nasa send small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student would love actual student student answer completely wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah pretty good response because lunar orbiter definitely small machine what sent moon 
1,Teacher,100,student really awesome response because definitely true scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah definitely like used oxygen tanks equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student okay really good thing bring on appreciate student response isn't wrong just focus different section text kind focused microscope very right 
1,Teacher,100,student that's great that's great answer small machine that's what microscope real word want find here last paragraph 
1,Teacher,100,student would wouldn't thing found water 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well after asked question student answer maybe didn't include what question look ng 
1,Teacher,100,student also found different paragraph there multiple answers 
1,Teacher,100,yeah there's multiple pieces equipment that's guys answering 
1,Teacher,100,student lunar orbiter another equipment then fellow classmate also mentioned sentences shall getting sort said microscope yeah 
1,Teacher,100,awesome awesome okay  student will pair find answer question thank folks 
1,Teacher,100,student board 
1,Teacher,100,student someone else build samantha's answer someone else talk about 
1,Teacher,100,microscope would allow discover water then first part question right equipment someone think about connects discover ng water ark student 
1,Teacher,100,student awesome lunar orbiter someone else answer allow scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,what other folks think about where want agree answer ahead student 
1,Teacher,100,student about 's answer compare student answers while work other people 
1,Teacher,100,yeah   guys both reading find something similar something different harris  student 
1,Teacher,100,what investigate mean anybody know student 
1,Teacher,100,anybody like title 
1,Teacher,100,what astronaut student 
1,Teacher,100,there convincing evidence valuable resource student 
1,Teacher,100,don't don't look back student work together since same answer 
1,Teacher,100,talk about going speak student moment okay 
1,Teacher,100,student could help little more maybe find ng different piece equipment might used 
1,Teacher,100,student tell what tool what tool 
1,Teacher,100,student circle word 
1,Teacher,100,okay well look back reading passage   since guys same answer microscope want guys look back student reading passage 
1,Teacher,100,student finish before come back ahead work next question 
1,Teacher,100,wonder maybe student help because sent mission find answer 
1,Teacher,100,would agree what student said 
1,Teacher,100,back student second able find what answered answer specific question 
1,Teacher,100,figure because student same answer talk  work together 
1,Teacher,100,okay that's great question anyone tell what think would answer s question which wouldn't microscope discover d water  support answer evidence lunar orbiter okay student what think 
1,Teacher,100,okay anybody else different answer 
1,Teacher,100,tell maybe about student he's sure moon maybe help give different answer 
1,Teacher,100,okay student able help 
1,Teacher,100,perfect yeah many guys pick d equipment discover

1,Teacher,100,right very good want talk each other student groups going    group  student 
1,Teacher,100,very good question anyone anybody wants help answer would microscope along lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,look something what anything else    student investigate means what what mean 
1,Teacher,100,there other word text might help maybe someone else group right answer lunar orbiter what some word think could underline circle might help friend someone sitting next 
1,Teacher,100,what word text might help someone else answer question what think student what might help student friend 
1,Teacher,100,student while talked some others maybe we'll discover together what think 
1,Teacher,100,student together work together find answer okay 
1,Teacher,100,student what other answers could talk about work together 
1,Teacher,100,student raise student hand think that's true statement found crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,okay eventually think should along what student said don't think quite ready think maybe long r search future could possibility 
1,Teacher,100,work together y'all work combine student answers help each other 
1,Teacher,100,things evidence could drink water from moon think could work student 
1,Teacher,100,look student text  work together because guys kind same page student 
1,Teacher,100,sure  student might thinking well pick d specific tool 
1,Teacher,100,student agree answer

1,Teacher,100,student 
1,Teacher,100,anybody student tell 
1,Teacher,100,rest talk student about because he's trying find which discover microscope lunar orbiter think answer talk  help discover which 
1,Teacher,100,good  what student about water 
1,Teacher,100,then student would valuable water space don't from earth moon 
1,Teacher,100,student want answer 's question 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well student other classmates 
1,Teacher,100,break into groups   will group then   student

1,Teacher,100,about  student show another water could useful tell paragraph student start read sentence comes from well okay 
1,Teacher,100,very good that's claim student said right  
1,Teacher,100,well  question  mentioned nasa sent small machine what kind machine nasa send maybe help student 
1,Teacher,100,okay student know about space tell what lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,that's great guys think microscope find water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student what scientist fine 
1,Teacher,100,okay yeah what small machine student look paragraph tell what small machine 
1,Teacher,100,okay student help tell what lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,guys come name want call collective don't like boys girls don't like guys school mascot want eyes eagles ketchup packets what call group 
1,Teacher,100,student awesome told about kind thing 
1,Teacher,100,student okay when deposit something much what deposit deposit really large piece something smaller pieces 
1,Teacher,100,student well when think paycheck every week would smaller amount what would make entire month make sense 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah seen frost wintertime fall 
1,Teacher,100,student seen student mom's windows grass 
1,Teacher,100,student what what when he's investigating crimes just leave unsolved 
1,Teacher,100,student could tell some equipment took there used general while space 
1,Teacher,100,student ever seen something through microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student what thing 
1,Teacher,100,student that's really good well sounds exciting enjoy student self nasa 
1,Teacher,100,good information anybody else anything about input what think about space 
1,Teacher,100,student would-- think would need oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,about  tell something know about space also what  student telling 
1,Teacher,100,good point because atmosphere which breathe which oxygen tanks talking about going into space messed then won't here earth would look some other place possibly live about student anything input 
1,Teacher,100,well that's people aren't into space some people more into environment like  talking about some people into oceans stuff which very interesting learn about about  input group 
1,Teacher,100,student what would consider fiction nonfiction story 
1,Teacher,100,student laughs 
1,Teacher,100,student didn't phones back then cell phones like didn't anything like wind wall 
1,Teacher,100,student gasps 
1,Teacher,100,student there cartoons book about phones 
1,Teacher,100,student people thought just going be-- science fiction realistic today 
1,Teacher,100,student right right used science fiction would able into space which what we've studying about space going moon being able different explorations like seen latest results stuff from titan moon saturn 
1,Teacher,100,student saturn moon floating around there's actually moon that's called titan think found life 
1,Teacher,100,student gasps 
1,Teacher,100,student well they're microscopic aliens live very very cold because really really cold moon moon like below zero really cold there think equipment like what moon was-- used find water moon think found some lifeforms existed titan 
1,Teacher,100,student that's pretty good stuff what think about audio know there outer space stuff 
1,Teacher,100,student we'll into more study about outer space different equipment they're using rockets satellites stuff they're using there 
1,Teacher,100,anything else interest student about aliens moon saturn 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wasn't wrong talking about atmosphere which something exploring space find different atmospheres would hold life from earth which very good said 
1,Teacher,100,student would make what would need order able really good garden moon 
1,Teacher,100,student would bring artificial greenhouse something like possibly maybe 
1,Teacher,100,everybody like reading 
1,Teacher,100,student like martian 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah good movie 
1,Teacher,100,student where find water 
1,Teacher,100,student polar crater what mean around earth bottom 
1,Teacher,100,student well science videos family love watch science videos documentaries great places learn 
1,Teacher,100,student great place learn more about what talking about 
1,Teacher,100,student kind think about like refrigerator 
1,Teacher,100,student somebody asked what keeps student food cold would like refrigerator wouldn't plug plugs into outlet supplies power 
1,Teacher,100,student well fact when first grade wanted astronaut obviously didn't live know goal 
1,Teacher,100,student texas florida john kennedy center or-- 
1,Teacher,100,student think that's named after president kennedy 
1,Teacher,100,while student look ng back student because pretty excited astronaut 
1,Teacher,100,student mean know everything about what scientist using space oxygen tank work 
1,Teacher,100,anyone ever microscope before 
1,Teacher,100,student what some thoughts student text prior answering questions 
1,Teacher,100,student next time invite 
1,Teacher,100,student convince people student best minecraft what 
1,Teacher,100,student well actually show beating game right student using actions instead word convince 
1,Teacher,100,student know name facility student works 
1,Teacher,100,student well that's that's unfortunate able speak regular basis perhaps some online activity hearing stories 
1,Teacher,100,student right because look ng what equipment just like today sitting front okay student sitting there school 
1,Teacher,100,scientist astronaut there's some things know right every student student school right what's equipment right thats helping student work student 
1,Teacher,100,student glad brought about nasa because know what today when learning student tablets 
1,Teacher,100,student pencil front things changing just like when research 
1,Teacher,100,student enjoy reading passage 
1,Teacher,100,student want each little piece paper don't want write down what know about space okay 
1,Teacher,100,alright over want share partner first group going    three work together   work share what know about space okay each other quietly okay y'all turn each other show each other what know about space 
1,Teacher,100,student okay what's something today student ever used want look something very close really small what's something could 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah like magnifying glass many ever seen microscope 
1,Teacher,100,right student where microscope 
1,Teacher,100,already know about space good what want tell about space student 
1,Teacher,100,student correct went nasa well when younger different times kinds really cool equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student great time there well 
1,Teacher,100,student question asked about equipment article talking about moon like desert anything about moon being like desert when student 
1,Teacher,100,well that's great seems like learned something today anyone else know moon like desert 
1,Teacher,100,student isn't tell what know about space 
1,Teacher,100,student there's interesting stuff like gravity others 
1,Teacher,100,student like don't know necessarily possible read that's super cool where read 
1,Teacher,100,student possibly mean point time year anything could happen honestly wouldn't surprised next year something crazy everything happening 
1,Teacher,100,student tool give some examples tool debbie student hand raised give example tool 
1,Teacher,100,yeah absolutely that's absolutely right there anybody else wanted share tool 
1,Teacher,100,student wouldn't stranded right think about like station drive very need fill station station what allow fill student halfway through trip 
1,Teacher,100,student won't like student going beach halfway there's station turn back around right 
1,Teacher,100,student we'll just more keep going 
1,Teacher,100,student know least growing always most confident when came answering questions even knew know knew answer easy plus four maybe actually wouldn't 
1,Teacher,100,student answer fear ridicule from friends even teacher 
1,Teacher,100,student like 
1,Teacher,100,student look something that's smaller because didn't eyes 
1,Teacher,100,student like organisms 
1,Teacher,100,student knows what periodic element oxygen 
1,Teacher,100,student periodic element table there owed stands oxygen water on 
1,Teacher,100,student okay where left talking about elements water element periodic table 
1,Teacher,100,student know anywhere else might microscope 
1,Teacher,100,what oxygen tanks usually designed anybody know 
1,Teacher,100,student know what oxygen suits student classmates might 
1,Teacher,100,that's really cool fact student where read 
1,Teacher,100,student okay what about equipment that's talked about text 
1,Teacher,100,student moon 
1,Teacher,100,student awesome well since student gone there could think like things there 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah think something eggs something military both might something like that's really cool that's really cool yeah

1,Teacher,100,student yeah thought great really liked space like seeing moon there night fact there's water really intriguing 
1,Teacher,100,know there's there information article wasn't there student someone who's experienced about space wasn't there information about article 
1,Teacher,100,student like reading over paragraph know find interesting thoughts 
1,Teacher,100,yeah student like spark interest 
1,Teacher,100,student that's more like know mean i've i've like crater like swimming well that's different 
1,Teacher,100,awesome thanks student okay first briefly before know tackle student guys's responses wanted know just raise hands would love moon someday 
1,Teacher,100,student want moon 
1,Teacher,100,absolutely know some didn't raise student hand wouldn't want moon anyone wants share 
1,Teacher,100,kind unpack lunar orbiter minute minute there anyone chance group speak spanish raise hands anyone

1,Teacher,100,student really favorite topics especially when student 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's great fact things think remember right like pounds something don't feel when student bouncing around moon right because gravity different 
1,Teacher,100,anybody know what water made what types molecules water made anybody know 
1,Teacher,100,student what some jobs what some some people usually investigate know 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's really good question there's much technology world times places without actually physically being there right we've seen cameras we've seen like 
1,Teacher,100,really student some what where else would explore that's outer space maybe actually yeah outer space what's another planet would explore really small machine could 
1,Teacher,100,that's cool student what about where would what planning would 
1,Teacher,100,student hydrogen part heard people talk about 
1,Teacher,100,student okay found there's there's some there's hydrogen there maybe part water would exciting right because there's water know

1,Teacher,100,student wild cats talking about water moon right 
1,Teacher,100,student sound okay 
1,Teacher,100,just stop pause minute guys questions yeah student 
1,Teacher,100,yeah student learning about space little also practicing good science thinking skills learn more about science thinking skills  
1,Teacher,100,absolutely absolutely guys think should understanding what word equipment means 
1,Teacher,100,anybody questions about about what mean when specific examples 
1,Teacher,100,make sense everybody anybody clarifying questions yeah

2,Teacher,200,good hear today group because going focus today's lesson which about scientific tool used moon 
2,Teacher,200,student other going talk about whether moon valuable resource people able live moon 
2,Teacher,200,there short reading gave guys questions just remind what questions i'll read loud guys first question what equipment scientist discover water moon student 
2,Teacher,200,okay we'll just work question number thank letting know guys will time write down student answers questions 
2,Teacher,200,class pull d into small group because think really good answering discussion question about water moon text want work each little more just make student responses more academic little longer student 
2,Teacher,200,going discussing trying expand more upon sentences would like just other passage student 
2,Teacher,200,think guys really great thinking while using text going around room give little feedback each student start

2,Teacher,200,here because concerns about each student guys's responses water moon passage going work improving student 
2,Teacher,200,student know about space doesn't really anything learning about space going about improving responses questions when read passage 
2,Teacher,200,student think about before actually look water microscope what equipment scientist discover water found moon microscope after found what find remember 
1,Teacher,200,student says nasa send small machine called lunar orbiter investigate question what equipment scientist discover water moon look afterwards make sense 
1,Teacher,200,student absolutely first like talk about question when word equipment what what mean what equipment mean 
1,Teacher,200,student absolutely asked write down student answer sheet paper what kind equipment will using 
1,Teacher,200,student vecause thinking about word evidence evidence basically just just means proof 
1,Teacher,200,student absolutely what evidence called text al evidence means student drawing student answer from source

1,Teacher,200,trying discover trying look student something tell 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah things really important think really cool experience article what specifically asking about water right 
1,Teacher,200,going tell about equipment that's used water what equipment main guys 
1,Teacher,200,student sent small machine called lunar orbiter investigate what small machine what's another word maybe that's question means same thing 
1,Teacher,200,good anybody know synonym word investigate 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah they're look ng really closely they're look ng they're discover ng what order look really closely already found right 
1,Teacher,200,student when look back text trying figure what equipment scientist used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student look says what equipment think asking like title object 
1,Teacher,200,student student right look back question telling talk about what equipment find water crater what tool where using 
1,Teacher,200,student need find equipment used 
1,Teacher,200,student find water question wants know what equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student what equipment find 
1,Teacher,200,student used moon need figure exactly which piece equipment discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student need oxygen specifically talking about which piece equipment used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student specific tool equipment used 
1,Teacher,200,student question talks about equipment there another word equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student what ways being used 
1,Teacher,200,student useful 
1,Teacher,200,student would read unintellible where says nasa send small machine called lunar orbiter investigate because understand what question asking 
1,Teacher,200,student what equipment scientist discover water moon would student question question didn't anything about what found what find 
1,Teacher,200,student refer back question mention equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student think important word could equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student good okay word really want focus equipment discover 
1,Teacher,200,student scientists remember second word circled underline question discover paragraph says equipment discover water find water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student said when circled second word 
1,Teacher,200,student question need also look word discover d what discover discover action word something 
1,Teacher,200,words wanting guys find evidence valuable 
1,Teacher,200,student wonder asking about equipment that's kind like machine used discover know where asking about machine 
1,Teacher,200,student right equipment tool equipment another word tool when something that's same word tool would call synonym they're synonyms each other 
1,Teacher,200,student know difference explain difference between discover ng look ng 
1,Teacher,200,student when discover something ever seen before 
1,Teacher,200,student finding planning first time 
1,Teacher,200,student remember look ng equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student discovering water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student doesn't tell what equipment used discover 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah look ng specific tool used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student trying figure which used discover water plot twist 
1,Teacher,200,student someone raised hand tell what question asking what trying answer someone raise student hand what question asking 
1,Teacher,200,okay what equipment discover water that's what student saying 
1,Teacher,200,gotcha yeah that's really good question remember question being asked determine like student says equipment that's used discover water 
1,Teacher,200,equipment discover water good guys pick d some really good ke word word look d equipment discover 
1,Teacher,200,good okay well equipment same thing tool right trying figure equipment used discover guys know what discover means 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah trying figure equipment used scientist find water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student want look question said question asked what equipment scientist discover water moon trying figure what equipment what what sort tool scientist find water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student look more question asking equipment what kind equipment search s what what look ng 
1,Teacher,200,student question specifically asking what piece equipment search water moon specifically right 
1,Teacher,200,student they're look ng specific piece information specific piece equipment sorry

1,Teacher,200,equipment here means could plural could more maybe good response could talking about know including multiple ones read about there student think that's good idea talking about more piece 
1,Teacher,200,student when giving response question what equipment scientist discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student word there look question asked what need look water 
1,Teacher,200,student discover water right rereading passage what would think scientist discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student right look question what equipment scientist used discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student putting together 
1,Teacher,200,student saying about value water moon very valuable 
1,Teacher,200,student potential means going valuable right potential valuable

1,Teacher,200,student tool right 
1,Teacher,200,student very good what about word discover 
1,Teacher,200,know what word discover means student 
1,Teacher,200,student right what look ng then tool actually used find water right 
1,Teacher,200,student okay great said discover means find right equipment means tool right question asking identify equipment used discover could tool find water okay 
1,Teacher,200,student okay look ng word discover right said word what word discover means 
1,Teacher,200,student said word discover means find truth 
1,Teacher,200,student okay look back question 
1,Teacher,200,student word equipment what mean talk student selves about word equipment discuss what means 
1,Teacher,200,alright there anybody wants share answer what what word equipment means student 
1,Teacher,200,student good look word discover talk student self about word discover 
1,Teacher,200,student share what means each other 
1,Teacher,200,student exactly right question asked what used look what find 
1,Teacher,200,student looked discover because word because there tool scientist used talked about text what discover mean 
1,Teacher,200,student what discover mean 
1,Teacher,200,student very good question focusing more what used find water specifically 
1,Teacher,200,student know there water moon scientist discover d question says there evidence water could valuable okay what think valuable means 
1,Teacher,200,student what think means 
1,Teacher,200,student okay awesome valuable means useful asking could water from moon useful okay 
1,Teacher,200,student think water from moon could useful scientist 
1,Teacher,200,student think 
1,Teacher,200,student when reading text student look ng equipment text discussing know what equipment means know what word means 
1,Teacher,200,student looking some scientific terms remembers what term 
1,Teacher,200,student question there's term question look ng 
1,Teacher,200,student water important because question about water 
1,Teacher,200,student what word already talked about water discover equipment right 
1,Teacher,200,student there word 
1,Teacher,200,student right convincing good there's more word science 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what evidence 
1,Teacher,200,student student right remember question just specifically asking discover d water equipment very important didn't need look ng tool water 
1,Teacher,200,student feel like more student opinion based details facts student passage 
1,Teacher,200,student more student opinion based what gave passage 
1,Teacher,200,student teacheri feel like question phrased specifically talking about olive ice discover d water behind scenes like 
1,Teacher,200,student because question feel like little more specific what discover d water because could also argue astronaut discover d water 
1,Teacher,200,student right think question little wanting more specifics what olive ice actually discover d water 
1,Teacher,200,student might equipment might need equipment there think question actually asking holding tool hand right would discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student actual passage says water valuable resource then list whole bunch reasons know valuable think question really asking convinced there valuable 
1,Teacher,200,would very beautiful very find text student 
1,Teacher,200,student using information paragraph what equipment scientist find water investigate there water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student there convincing evidence remember convincing evidence means look ng details article what says directly okay water moon could valuable 
1,Teacher,200,student tricky question okay because valuable definition gave article word 
1,Teacher,200,student what meaning valuable there 
1,Teacher,200,student right question asking what type equipment scientist used discover water moon what type equipment order-- there 
1,Teacher,200,student maybe there another machine mentioned discover d water know look water microscope discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student good glad recognize just oxygen when they're space look title talking about water space question asks 
1,Teacher,200,student question says what equipment where find 
1,Teacher,200,student okay agree used look water what find water 
1,Teacher,200,student talking about water talking about 
1,Teacher,200,student want specifically look question says there convincing evidence 
1,Teacher,200,what valuable mean maybe that's what need what mean valuable student 
1,Teacher,200,student talking about water moon that's little more depth just oxygen tank wanted talk 
1,Teacher,200,student question specifically says what equipment scientist discover water moon really important word question 
1,Teacher,200,student discover when discover something student look ng 
1,Teacher,200,student investigate 
1,Teacher,200,student used well what machine what piece equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student trying trying find find water because what look d know where water 
1,Teacher,200,also talk about crater story which  brought everybody little part story want talk about what found find water moon don't student 
1,Teacher,200,student before even look into text want look question question specifically asking what equipment scientist discover water 
1,Teacher,200,right there know want look some sort equipment based around water text evidence something wanted talk guys about 
1,Teacher,200,student text evidence going support student answers pull straight from text always know student answers close semi correct 
1,Teacher,200,student evidence really important word because means there's going proof passage want find proof question what equipment discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student right equipment such question specifically wants know what equipment discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student about word evidence word value 
1,Teacher,200,student evidence means going prove answer passage tells answer question will there convincing evidence will there we'll find 
1,Teacher,200,student ready come back answer want investigate some other answers first 
1,Teacher,200,student know sure paragraph tell scientist used 
1,Teacher,200,awesome student could rewrite student answer include piece information 
1,Teacher,200,okay question what equipment scientist sentence mentioned scientist actually microscope student 
1,Teacher,200,scientists yeah thinking about equipment student  student answer mentioned equipment 
1,Teacher,200,trying text text mention oxygen tanks student 
1,Teacher,200,student question both scientist actually equipment when working moon 
1,Teacher,200,absolutely student asked what equipment scientist discover water moon would answer using text al evidence 
1,Teacher,200,student student right talk about water look discussion question 
1,Teacher,200,student anything about equipment used 
1,Teacher,200,student need narrow down student answer more specific 
1,Teacher,200,okay student which what what where circle word 
1,Teacher,200,student what important word words circle question 
1,Teacher,200,just like student asked discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student when read deeper into passage answer gave else could found what other olive ice could used find water moon crater 
1,Teacher,200,student think could important express water valuable future 
1,Teacher,200,student equipment find water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah which really isn't telling 
1,Teacher,200,student what machine right 
1,Teacher,200,student find anything talking about oxygen 
1,Teacher,200,student scientists oxygen tanks discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,think student told about oxygen tanks oxygen tanks discover water moon something else 
1,Teacher,200,student okay know know much still don't know what used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student find evidence when look ng answer different question 
1,Teacher,200,think student asking about equipment that's used water would need different equipment only just parts would help discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student think-- 
1,Teacher,200,student right that's look ng 's answer said nasa send small machine what else could instead just small machine 
1,Teacher,200,student well yeah what else could student answer instead just saying small machine could made more depth answered more depth 
1,Teacher,200,student small machine could anything couldn't 
1,Teacher,200,student what else could student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student know what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,teacher know want student self position little when response like hard know what meant because maybe what grade student paper before grade student 
1,Teacher,200,student okay there's definitely some room improvement there gave some good information 
1,Teacher,200,student improvement tell what changes make 
1,Teacher,200,student depending size could lunar order maybe also small machine 
1,Teacher,200,just kind circle back little think  we've kind talked some other people student there feel about student answer giving another shot what might instead 
1,Teacher,200,student perfect what microscope attached 
1,Teacher,200,student didn't didn't actually name machine right 
1,Teacher,200,student look into student statement answer question 
1,Teacher,200,student that's going very valuable what else valuable there talks about there 
1,Teacher,200,student going information just part 
1,Teacher,200,student that's right what else what other purposes takes point answer 
1,Teacher,200,student right used what else 
1,Teacher,200,student right what know there's more think 
1,Teacher,200,very much student there's more 
1,Teacher,200,student right what would being able split hydrogen oxygen apart what benefit would give astronaut 
1,Teacher,200,that's good answer student just need little more detail 
1,Teacher,200,student would would work atmosphere right 
1,Teacher,200,student like discussing last session about what thought science fiction long time like wrinkle time actually happen possibly lifetime where they're able 
1,Teacher,200,student need into little more detail 
1,Teacher,200,student right water being moon future continue space journeys explorations then possibly water will very very valuable moon 
1,Teacher,200,student according think people actually moon time just send machine called lunar lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,200,student other ke word 
1,Teacher,200,student there could would great another reason look back people base don't need oxygen breathe 
1,Teacher,200,student would oxygen breathing what about hydrogen part would hydrogen useful 
1,Teacher,200,student student answers changed after discussing 's 's 's 
1,Teacher,200,student what what into little more detail 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah since they're small amounts going able like amount water earth 
1,Teacher,200,student good okay found piece equipment found tool used microscope used find water begin first machine find water 
1,Teacher,200,student think student answer wrong 
1,Teacher,200,same answer student follow along what just went 
1,Teacher,200,student okay oxygen tanks allows breathe better when they're moon 
1,Teacher,200,student well take microscope moon 
1,Teacher,200,student just want little clarification 
1,Teacher,200,student well yeah think about like what uses talks about microscope right microscope small right could talking about know oxygen tank wanted know specifically knew what equipment used know what mean 
1,Teacher,200,student needs clarified 
1,Teacher,200,student what 
1,Teacher,200,student okay could valuable astronaut 
1,Teacher,200,student right what think student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student okay think think take space hip could easier without weight water 
1,Teacher,200,student hold just said haven't moon 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah would valuable resource 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what mean what water essential 
1,Teacher,200,student right well yeah take literally essentially central take bath right essential drink water 
1,Teacher,200,student okay well read article question 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what question asking 
1,Teacher,200,question said circled same student actually read article 
1,Teacher,200,student mean already find water 
1,Teacher,200,there okay student where find ng water 
1,Teacher,200,student microscope actually find water 
1,Teacher,200,student okay reasons could valuable 
1,Teacher,200,student okay read paragraph listen hear somewhere else 
1,Teacher,200,there other word important student 
1,Teacher,200,student okay need look closely means already found right 
1,Teacher,200,student okay nasa send small machine called lunar orbiter investigate look question answers what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student says good good don't carry ships an more that's some good information convince water moon valuable 
1,Teacher,200,student what think think that's partially convincing evidence water moon could valuable 
1,Teacher,200,student okay well just because can't right moment mean future wouldn't valuable what think 
1,Teacher,200,student maybe instead using word tool could different word what would another word 
1,Teacher,200,student expanding thinking want learn more okay important read discuss learn little more about water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student improve response what could improve response 
1,Teacher,200,anybody else answer question though need microscope water there water crater there just little water crater 
1,Teacher,200,student what discover before microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah before microscope what discover 
1,Teacher,200,student microscopes moon would maybe collect samples then we'll back earth 
1,Teacher,200,student type equipment used discover investigate water 
1,Teacher,200,student there better answer 
1,Teacher,200,student there type equipment might used investigate water 
1,Teacher,200,anyone know 
1,Teacher,200,student however best piece evidence grab from article 
1,Teacher,200,student okay just told water split into parts hydrogen oxygen tell information about moon about astronaut 
1,Teacher,200,student right after reading last paragraph just read 
1,Teacher,200,just like student mentioned some well equipment while that's true what used 
1,Teacher,200,sorry guys says would need scientific tool called microscope look really closely okay that's what nasa sent though student 
1,Teacher,200,student that's what sent 
1,Teacher,200,student used 
1,Teacher,200,student could restate question 
1,Teacher,200,student restate question answer know when student reciting 
1,Teacher,200,student question 
1,Teacher,200,student what will know number like somebody didn't know what what passage even about could read answer question know taught what talking about could restate question 
1,Teacher,200,student little deeper tell really valuable right 
1,Teacher,200,student think about feel valuable while little deeper tell going valuable while 
1,Teacher,200,student like things time money wasn't problem could know think about 
1,Teacher,200,know trying think about issues could important think about next time okay student 
1,Teacher,200,student fact water split telling anything about good space tell 
1,Teacher,200,student just says found evidence there water found water just evidence meaning seen water there mean there's 
1,Teacher,200,student whole whole thing article about about water moon think space uit could help find water just tool astronaut protect 
1,Teacher,200,student student answer talked about microscope being tool what microscope discover water used look water 
1,Teacher,200,student that's right examine water they're using microscope examine water equipment used discover 
1,Teacher,200,student okay water could other word could important 
1,Teacher,200,already telling valuable  student know here weren't quite sure valuable resource heading first line already start identifying valuable resource 
1,Teacher,200,student says what equipment scientist used discover water moon small machine could mean anything 
1,Teacher,200,student understand what student saying same time student able find water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student moving forward could very valuable 
1,Teacher,200,right what oxygen tank student 
1,Teacher,200,student astronauts could what water 
1,Teacher,200,student there water moon help 
1,Teacher,200,student mean example small machine could sort mean could anything know from maybe even remote even clock wall can't sort discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student example need need water live earth 
1,Teacher,200,student able know perhaps expand know space traveling capabilities able actually water moon might little more inexpensive inexpensive actually transport 
1,Teacher,200,anybody might know another reason might actually sort beneficial water moon might actually help astronaut 
1,Teacher,200,student think perhaps like said perhaps future there enough evidence know know least going forward some type know human habitation there surface moon water become more valuable live there 
1,Teacher,200,student okay when answer something think sometimes maybe little more specific there's confusion 
1,Teacher,200,student think took student answer send small machine which student correctly what else could make little more clear somebody idea what student talking about 
1,Teacher,200,student okay could what machine what what machine here being used 
1,Teacher,200,student need expand upon some answers 
1,Teacher,200,student scientific tool called microscope microscope what show 
1,Teacher,200,student when look student answer oxygen tanks equipment used discover water 
1,Teacher,200,yeah then also when talking student 
1,Teacher,200,student just need support 
1,Teacher,200,absolutely look back some answers look d question what equipment scientist used discover water moon answers microscope small machine then some other equipment which answer makes most sense what would found moon student 
1,Teacher,200,student student time look back what equipment passage 
1,Teacher,200,student said nasa sent small machine what word find what word what pieces equipment find 
1,Teacher,200,student microscope wasn't best choice 
1,Teacher,200,student because microscope tool fact 
1,Teacher,200,student makes sense able they're saying look really closely water would need tool discover another word find water only other piece equipment text small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student right microscope help water what's thing helps water first place 
1,Teacher,200,student point nasa small machine microscope small machine right 
1,Teacher,200,student question would know water valuable even split what parts would question 
1,Teacher,200,student there other ways which water that's found moon 
1,Teacher,200,student think other reasons water would valuable resource because based what we've talked about today 
1,Teacher,200,student would change student answer want keep same what student already down 
1,Teacher,200,student okay water important many since article about water says whole time throughout article 
1,Teacher,200,student need oxygen tanks moon 
1,Teacher,200,student that's true very true people moon though 
1,Teacher,200,student people moon article what just read anything about people being moon article 
1,Teacher,200,student true there title machine there name machine number 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah after number where student answer read rest response rest article 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah talk about using microscope equipment what used moon there microscope there moon look need something else before could microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student used microscope what name machine needed space remember 
1,Teacher,200,student what 
1,Teacher,200,student underline 
1,Teacher,200,student time share person beside would like person each group share answers group  want view give what word guys underlying question 
1,Teacher,200,student question wondering student answer wasn't best answer correct 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah okay know student answer could wasn't best answer 
1,Teacher,200,student what word could underline question help answer best answer 
1,Teacher,200,student okay like underline equipment good word underline correct there another word question help under help answer question 
1,Teacher,200,depth tell what word guys underline 
1,Teacher,200,student could more specific answering student student answer  
1,Teacher,200,student could more specific student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student teacherr could look back 
1,Teacher,200,student find answer 
1,Teacher,200,student no ice anything could more specific student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student talking about equipment anything from microscope giant rocket anything 
1,Teacher,200,yeah guess student also soften student answer water microscopic  just from lunar orbiter above above moon special kind equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student after after reading paragraph three think able water eyes 
1,Teacher,200,anyone want share what circled 
1,Teacher,200,okay student find anything helps change student answer circling word question 
1,Teacher,200,student able find paragraph where talking about answers 
1,Teacher,200,think student answer answers question student 
1,Teacher,200,student think there's another part student answer other small microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student student text doesn't there astronaut 
1,Teacher,200,student there able observe said water 
1,Teacher,200,student used order find water don't think quite 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah maybe look back down student answer which there full water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student completely accurate 
1,Teacher,200,want guys after student talked student partners student group members circled underline terms text student questions guys think could reconstruct student answer just little more detailed 
1,Teacher,200,student remember uses microscope humans look through microscope right scientist look through microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student remember what called machine science sorts wacky names machine that's what look ng look ng find name what small machine 
1,Teacher,200,student totally yeah look text look back think close same line about small machine sure know 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah totally microscope look three sentences here three paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student paragraph three says water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able look ng straight would need scientific cool tool called microscope look really closely there's part microscope before then 
1,Teacher,200,student where found called lunar orbiter paragraph right 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah what machine call 
1,Teacher,200,student tiny water well love lunar orbiter going into polar crater look ng small water where's small water located 
1,Teacher,200,student what form like 
1,Teacher,200,student looking giant lake look ng what yeah well what form water what same text part don't 
1,Teacher,200,student what equipment okay look ng name what's name small machine came 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah think there even very short text different pieces equipment mentioned right 
1,Teacher,200,student third paragraph tell scientist used microscope find water 
1,Teacher,200,awesome student which piece equipment think most important here 
1,Teacher,200,student awesome little machine lands moon 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah that's right doesn't really scientist using 
1,Teacher,200,yeah that's awesome text both found text question what small machine student what machine 
1,Teacher,200,student alright sound 
1,Teacher,200,student could yeah look something discover 
1,Teacher,200,talking about what equipment maybe equipment name right what small machine name anybody anybody circle what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student microscope great example piece equipment also thing called lunar orbiter investigate things work together 
1,Teacher,200,looking both sentences guys want look student sheet paper student look ng word lunar orbiter microscope there word kind signal what equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student there second part sentence tells maybe what called like name equipment 
1,Teacher,200,going paragraph going read while reading look ng student 
1,Teacher,200,student going look paragraph okay just want listen while reading find particular equipment might stop talk about okay 
1,Teacher,200,student means moon still drier driest desert earth water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able look ng straight 
1,Teacher,200,need scientific toll called microscope look really closely what microscope helping guys 
1,Teacher,200,student because passage look back find says nasa sent small machine called looper lunar orbiter investigate lunar orbiter look deposit large polar crater what name machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student small machine look back what that's called read sentence okay number nasa sent small machine called lunar orbiter investigate 
1,Teacher,200,student what microscope what microscope text 
1,Teacher,200,find water before look right anyone know what discover means 
1,Teacher,200,student right discover when find find first going lunar orbiter find before look 
1,Teacher,200,student okay microscope discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student need scientific tool called microscope look very closely 
1,Teacher,200,student look back student passage what equipment find water 
1,Teacher,200,student look number 
1,Teacher,200,student lunar orbiter look deposit large polar crater deposit very small what what 
1,Teacher,200,student back text specific answers from text what equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student need back into text find specifically where states what equipment used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student back into text look 
1,Teacher,200,student says text back look 
1,Teacher,200,student text 
1,Teacher,200,back look what's another word student 
1,Teacher,200,student small machine right what name machine 
1,Teacher,200,student look what what says astronaut 
1,Teacher,200,student water main 
1,Teacher,200,student what astronaut water 
1,Teacher,200,student what text about astronaut water should under bottle water valuable source valid valuable resource what 
1,Teacher,200,student right hydrogen oxygen 
1,Teacher,200,student back think second paragraph you'll nasa sent small machine called lunar orbiter investigate lunar orbiter look deposit large polar crater 
1,Teacher,200,student that's where found think right 
1,Teacher,200,student landed moon south pole that's where found look d deposit since wasn't necessarily water frozen water look large polar crater guess really cold 
1,Teacher,200,underlined equipment discover great tell just reading passage student tell what word equipment might refer passage what kind equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student deposits what tell what says deposit very small 
1,Teacher,200,very small they're look ng something very small they're take lunar orbiter there also read paragraph three student 
1,Teacher,200,student word could that's second sentence circle word could student pencil will second sentence paragraph four says could useful lots ways 
1,Teacher,200,student would think word useful also same maybe valuable look back paragraph telling could useful 
1,Teacher,200,student stop second what first paragraph tells know 
1,Teacher,200,student okay someone paraphrase paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah what would deposit what think would look like 
1,Teacher,200,student tool because deposit small can't student eyes tool microscope able 
1,Teacher,200,student okay moisture that's still bigger moisture found moon frost naked what found moon would even able tell there without lunar orbiter microscope being able 
1,Teacher,200,student okay think water moon look same glass water would drink 
1,Teacher,200,student paragraph three what about 
1,Teacher,200,student when when says able 
1,Teacher,200,student what right after 
1,Teacher,200,student good glass water lunch can't wait there's something glass 
1,Teacher,200,student what tell water moon what compared water here 
1,Teacher,200,student well might because found crater there might lots there small can't naked know turned before naked yeah 
1,Teacher,200,student think lunar orbiter being able 
1,Teacher,200,student because remember paragraph three says wouldn't able water 
1,Teacher,200,student found there 
1,Teacher,200,student right passage only talking about 
1,Teacher,200,student what found moon there anything passage talks about oxygen 
1,Teacher,200,student lunar orbiter helped find water want look paragraph three 
1,Teacher,200,student what about water paragraph three 
1,Teacher,200,student what need find can't 
1,Teacher,200,student look paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student fourth sentence look down four sentence 
1,Teacher,200,student right here ounces 
1,Teacher,200,student would though word water take surface which 
1,Teacher,200,student couldn't even describe would trucks trucks loads topsoil okay upload moon still would only fill glass 
1,Teacher,200,student would like look back student paragraph find 
1,Teacher,200,student answer 
1,Teacher,200,okay student correct nasa sand small machine look back student paragraph find name machine 
1,Teacher,200,okay anybody paragraph four word valuable actually beginning paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student lunar orbiter different called lunar orbiter what 
1,Teacher,200,student discover water microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student look back paragraph second 
1,Teacher,200,sent orbiter look clues didn't talk anyone moon sent lunar look clues what find lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,200,student lunar orbiter discover ng orbiting look ng around used investigate 
1,Teacher,200,student remind what investigating means 
1,Teacher,200,student good look clues order figure there water moon 
1,Teacher,200,also water firsthand what water student 
1,Teacher,200,able relate what student saying where lunar orbiter what actually discover water microscope what study water 
1,Teacher,200,student right discover water lunar orbiter okay someone raise student hand tell some other equipment we've talked about reading 
1,Teacher,200,student what we've talked about lunar lunar orbiter we've talked about microscope there other equipment they've talked about 
1,Teacher,200,student what read what read paragraph there other equipment discussed paragraph read 
1,Teacher,200,student exactly right send small machine know what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student okay want look back passage figure what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,okay many guys look ng word water passage 
1,Teacher,200,student whenever look ng passage able read understand moon same thing water 
1,Teacher,200,lunar orbiter paragraph says look deposit large polar crater deposit very small answer help student 
1,Teacher,200,student look back text where text find word look word machine machine there 
1,Teacher,200,student exactly exactly back look text 
1,Teacher,200,student what look ng 
1,Teacher,200,student asking text field like back text there's piece equipment used look ng water right 
1,Teacher,200,student right exactly think microscope help look water while they're physically moon 
1,Teacher,200,student right look text lunar orbiter right 
1,Teacher,200,microscopes both there when talking specifically about find ng water look back text find where says film equipment used find water moon yeah student 
1,Teacher,200,student back text look first part where they're talking about piece equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student they've talked about moon being desert right think there's water 
1,Teacher,200,student then look ng what 
1,Teacher,200,student well look ng water moon right 
1,Teacher,200,student what about lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,200,student okay think little more about questions because says word essential student answer word equipment word water think about word before make answer 
1,Teacher,200,read said student said scientist used equipment like oxygen tanks question asking about what using moon something savanah 
1,Teacher,200,student what think microscope look really closely what think need look things really closely 
1,Teacher,200,student that's amazing really know what something microscope something really really really small right 
1,Teacher,200,student example think microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student read text 
1,Teacher,200,student even little more basic there what equipment talk about text what what what's getting used 
1,Teacher,200,very good very good glad student seeing take look back student no ice paragraph could some insight take back what sort equipment mentioned specifically paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student also part getting moon about search ng there we've whole elaborate backstory right what makes very interesting read 
1,Teacher,200,student while there some water there might whole might buckets buckets buckets oceans water 
1,Teacher,200,student make sure speaking nasa they're ones sent lunar orbiter right 
1,Teacher,200,student they're ones microscope look small small know article water when find moon know they're kind subject they're kind article talking about right 
1,Teacher,200,student that's part actually goes down look very closely need figure found water crater correct 
1,Teacher,200,student once take quick glance 
1,Teacher,200,student what find 
1,Teacher,200,student right what text tell about 
1,Teacher,200,student correct what's small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student what nasa sent will look going help read okay nasa send small machine what just first little text tell 
1,Teacher,200,student right what called 
1,Teacher,200,student what about water split into 
1,Teacher,200,student what could possibly water used 
1,Teacher,200,nasa said small machine pull d from second paragraph everyone will look back second paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,discovered student later they're going other equipment right they've discover d water later study deeper 
1,Teacher,200,student into water right want look closely that's what passage says tell want look really closely paragraph three going need another tool called 
1,Teacher,200,student microscope microscope scientist using equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student scientists using equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student using microscope what microscope helping scientist 
1,Teacher,200,student right correct using microscope study look deeper into water first find water equipment small lunar orbiter that's what passage about 
1,Teacher,200,student then later passage learned used other equipment study water deeper 
1,Teacher,200,student where find passage 
1,Teacher,200,student well microscope able look microscopic things moon find water digging equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student right important thing separated oxygen astronaut could breathe also fuel hydrogen oxygen separate into atoms make fuel 
1,Teacher,200,student remember atmosphere what breathe oxygen and-- 
1,Teacher,200,student moon doesn't oxygen 
1,Teacher,200,student well rockets hydrogen will break into-- breaks down able make rocket fuel which help space rafts move like story like cars know 
1,Teacher,200,student helps student without student won't just like rocket fuel which made different strands hydrogen also some oxygen would fill tank move throughout space 
1,Teacher,200,student water heavy there water moon then wouldn't carry which would drain fuel supply would also take space spacecraft being able stop somewhere pick water better carry around time water heavy 
1,Teacher,200,student okay look look back reading says nasa send small machine called lunar orbiter investigate 
1,Teacher,200,student there isn't said didn't clearly there people there would assume well would just machine called lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,200,student look back paragraph take moment look back paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student then paragraph threee says found water found microscopic meaning super small microscope look 
1,Teacher,200,okay water paragraph okay what different form water there's different forms water there's frozen form what called student 
1,Teacher,200,student just different form just water different form frozen solid 
1,Teacher,200,student okay look back text real quick 
1,Teacher,200,student when discover something student correct doesn't doesn't discover 
1,Teacher,200,student right know people earth water live water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student don't worry about bringing water could just drink water moon stay hydrated 
1,Teacher,200,student second sentence correct right water broken down into parts hydrogen oxygen 
1,Teacher,200,student important what's reason would want break down what reason wanted break down water into hydrogen oxygen what could hydrogen oxygen 
1,Teacher,200,student look paragraph five 
1,Teacher,200,student could split water hydrogen oxygen rocket fuel that's could moon leave from moon right that's another reason water could such valuable commodity 
1,Teacher,200,student nope because we've more 
1,Teacher,200,student perfect okay want start look ng over question paragraph okay look paragraph passage 
1,Teacher,200,anybody tell heard something sentences just read sounds like might answer question what equipment used 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what seeing paragraph three second sentence starts saying 
1,Teacher,200,student water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able look ng straight student need scientific tool called microscope look really closely 
1,Teacher,200,student that's very good question what going considered look back little further before microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student perfect okay i'll read second sentence after tell what nasa send investigate tell what called 
1,Teacher,200,student know scientist back paragraph found there water moon because crater find crater remember happened just read little part 
1,Teacher,200,student about oxygen tanks find maybe another type equipment might used help find water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student says means moon still drier driest desert earth water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able even student look ng straight 
1,Teacher,200,student there oxygen tanks microscope there that's what says 
1,Teacher,200,student well look first paragraph could read 
1,Teacher,200,student correct crater where full water water below crater 
1,Teacher,200,student student correct four glasses water water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student very much think could fill crater 
1,Teacher,200,student they're they're full there's such tiny amount water almost special tool 
1,Teacher,200,student student right lunar lunar orbiter find water moon find water little water 
1,Teacher,200,student think really great starting answers just want really work look ng text little more make answers more complete built text al evidence reading 
1,Teacher,200,student think different strengths here just want really prac ice just like knowing content also being able skill backing responses text evidence from text 
1,Teacher,200,student okay think part what right isn't just about knowledge what learning 
1,Teacher,200,first thing want talk about when here group want think what question asking what what mean circle evidence yeah student 
1,Teacher,200,student lunar orbiter will land moon south pole look deposit large polar crater deposit very small scientist said lastudent moon surface would hold total about ounces water what deposit 
1,Teacher,200,student some really great responses going make sure answers proven from text 
1,Teacher,200,student text tells astronaut using water from moon need back into text figure think water moon could valuable 
1,Teacher,200,student well learn some more 
1,Teacher,200,thank joining small group table guys appreciate answers gave ahead review some things we've talked about 
1,Teacher,200,student well great know about space going specifically talk about moon water found moon 
1,Teacher,200,going look questions okay want just want guys look together deeper understanding reading passage 
1,Teacher,200,student want look deeper into question asked okay because struggled little giving specific answer question okay 
1,Teacher,200,everybody want challenge think about answer right find evidence text support answer student what's going 
1,Teacher,200,excited excited about space challenge back into reading think about response gave read discussion question student 
1,Teacher,200,student figure look back story figure more depth answer 
1,Teacher,200,student need every student classmate right explain need look another answer okay 
1,Teacher,200,wanted kind dive into here want make sure same page kind understanding test text full extent student 
1,Teacher,200,should look responses kind where grow where improve understanding article read about something really cool really excited talk guys about 
1,Teacher,200,student more specific response 
1,Teacher,200,student well together just look ng article closely together 
1,Teacher,200,student just what take away from just reading then discussion just together just look ng little reading together 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what wanted pull back here about because even though might information we've learned other places about space reading text specifically mission find ng water moon correct 
1,Teacher,200,question what equipment used find water student found different types equipment used background knowledge that's exactly what question asking okay look deeper into question okay yeah 
1,Teacher,200,student want just thank much answers given here just clarify answer best work around arrive more suitable answer okay 
1,Teacher,200,left where trying actually locate answer from passage going just briefly recap look ng word student 
1,Teacher,200,going focus elaborating answers okay okay okay alright concern while guys student text answer question 
1,Teacher,200,okay well going work together team answer question team effort just person answering okay 
1,Teacher,200,just diving deeper into text team everyone same page 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah what's some strategies find answer question knows strategy 
1,Teacher,200,student case that's what going take look student answers 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah well always good background knowledge space that's really cool student interested always learn names machine y things like that's read passage together hopes would learn more 
1,Teacher,200,student okay think just wanted just deeper discussion 
1,Teacher,200,student question what equipment scientist discover water feel like just wanted just discussion what thought answers 
1,Teacher,200,student okay student we've reading about water moon talked about moon desert going think little thorough okay know what thorough 
1,Teacher,200,student talking about moon desert right answered student questions going discuss understand questions going discuss listen friends responses 
1,Teacher,200,student okay going think strategies ways improve answer okay find word 
1,Teacher,200,student writing going help connect learn 
1,Teacher,200,student better okay want want process going 
1,Teacher,200,student reflect answer think improve response 
1,Teacher,200,student good thing here talk about information we've just read learning about 
1,Teacher,200,okay right great here's what guys going talk about skill skill circling underlining word from question text okay what question someone read 
1,Teacher,200,okay look back student answer real quick going through each student responses okay look student response first what 
1,Teacher,200,we've already read text about moon class just want talk guys about some student answers student questions discover more answers think more deeply about passage sound good guys student 
1,Teacher,200,student want really focus what says article today want learn more details about scientist especially moon 
1,Teacher,200,right student best answering question some really went into detail pull ng specific sentences from text want specific answer remember discussion question is-- student 
1,Teacher,200,well that's very statement because don't even know about space space broad there's many unanswered questions think eager learn about didn't even know about water moon though might think might know some stuff sure there's something might could gain from think very beneficial student group 
1,Teacher,200,student going look some student answers ways could improve some some strengths many student answers 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah wonderful buddy going talk just little more about text evidence help questions want look question number 
1,Teacher,200,right probably extensive knowledge outer space through know stuff group focus 
1,Teacher,200,student extracting information from from informative text that's main goal what working together suppose will start 
1,Teacher,200,well sometimes feel student might some knowledge wasn't really covered inside text maybe student other friends group learn from 
1,Teacher,200,student work learn from each other kind discuss what we've read questions teacher name will gladly answer okay 
1,Teacher,200,really great responses reason kind small group kind build responses although asks what equipment scientist discover water moon there's little more could probably answers help better make sense 
1,Teacher,200,student well good what going today look article previous read called water moon going look discussion question regards what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student what just kind around room just raise student hand i'll call then look student response kind figure where came response saying correct could little work will just kind raise student hand i'll call 
1,Teacher,200,student today what hope kind come together work some strategies kind hone answer specifically wanting okay 
1,Teacher,200,student well hope student right think through second question will able make sure understand kind really dive deeper into question find evidence from text sound good 
1,Teacher,200,because just yeah just look ng space look ng well read text just working group kind share knowledge each other okay 
1,Teacher,200,bits pieces there anybody want volunteer first where kind critique through answers look find maybe some more detail support answer 
1,Teacher,200,good seen student responses discussion question wanted talk about came know answers student 
1,Teacher,200,wanted over discussion question answer student 
1,Teacher,200,student great alright what talking about student student article student passage what equipment scientist discover water moon student talking about space 
1,Teacher,200,student reason look ng back over student answers want help better understanding space exactly there water moon 
1,Teacher,200,want little deeper into question figure exactly what they're talking about expand some ideas y'all write down student answers 
1,Teacher,200,guys some really great work some good answer ch ice don't feel complete understanding what question asking firstly what want 
1,Teacher,200,student okay first want make sure clear understanding what question actually asking 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah well that's good corrected student answer going look going deeper together figure more precise answer something little more evidence okay 
1,Teacher,200,no ice changed student answer going hang like what changed student answer going some what thought student answer going help other people group same thought process okay 
1,Teacher,200,student okay when reading question found ke word trying find word back text know what answer give 
1,Teacher,200,okay well going work reading comprehension group 
1,Teacher,200,student today want work find ng 
1,Teacher,200,student ke word questions help better answer questions 
1,Teacher,200,student think able work together kind pull resource there come right answer 
1,Teacher,200,going group learn together discuss what read 
1,Teacher,200,just group discussion we've read 
1,Teacher,200,okay well group help each other learn 
1,Teacher,200,student seems like some understanding what trying find quite there just what like like around read little little person time then going work through question together sound like plan 
1,Teacher,200,student fantastic love amount enthusiasm real quick before begin would like just address thing tell students whenever walk into classroom first time 
1,Teacher,200,student thing like mention students like mention well philosophy answering questions might weird thing hear like mistakes 
1,Teacher,200,that's weird thing hear teacher save right like mistakes student probably going hear many make mistakes student 
1,Teacher,200,guys bring back together group answers changed based student group discussion 
1,Teacher,200,want make sure everybody really good understanding lunar orbiter helped discover microscopic water 
1,Teacher,200,student okay well want focus student attention article just read going examine article determine scientist gone about find ng water crater moon 
1,Teacher,200,student well guess what going learn some things today might find something didn't know 
1,Teacher,200,point group just elaborate more guys 
1,Teacher,200,just wanted talk about answers kind where guys student answers from 
1,Teacher,200,well collectively talk each other wanted aspect another persons answer well guys could totally about getting different parts 
1,Teacher,200,student what kind hoping from search text kind show what learned from text 
1,Teacher,200,group just going focus some things read change answers better reading sound good student 
1,Teacher,200,tweak little improve adjust student sentences just show understand what text saying just wanted guys examples exactly from text know guys easy time reading 
1,Teacher,200,okay well today going experiment different kinds groups know about space then maybe help student table mates probably don't know much sounds good student 
1,Teacher,200,good hear today group because going focus today's lesson which about scientific tool used moon 
1,Teacher,200,student other going talk about whether moon valuable resource people able live moon 
1,Teacher,200,there short reading gave guys questions just remind what questions i'll read loud guys first question what equipment scientist discover water moon student 
1,Teacher,200,okay we'll just work question number thank letting know guys will time write down student answers questions 
1,Teacher,200,class pull d into small group because think really good answering discussion question about water moon text want work each little more just make student responses more academic little longer student 
1,Teacher,200,going discussing trying expand more upon sentences would like just other passage student 
1,Teacher,200,think guys really great thinking while using text going around room give little feedback each student start 
1,Teacher,200,student know know about space isn't about learning about space about going work creating better responses when read text makes sense 
1,Teacher,200,student there's just things need work order create better responses better understanding text 
1,Teacher,200,here because concerns about each student guys's responses water moon passage going work improving student 
1,Teacher,200,student know about space doesn't really anything learning about space going about improving responses questions when read passage 
1,Teacher,200,reason five today because some concerns about student responses would like address improve guys better understand 
1,Teacher,200,#NAME?
1,Teacher,200,everyone today heard read water moon correct anyone everyone read want revise answers because understanding didn't deep deep understanding going today want one-- student 
1,Teacher,200,everyone today going revising answers from question what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,everyone good understanding reading want work answers just little because think getting little confused between aspects first before share answers student want independently minute look question 
1,Teacher,200,student well really want work because want hear what student answer want know what make even better 
1,Teacher,200,think maybe guys good understanding text think little deeper relate text student answers pull evidence from text 
1,Teacher,200,student from reading 
1,Teacher,200,student however think important sometimes even know material think good work word things just really working answering questions skills really helpful 
1,Teacher,200,student true however today using science 
1,Teacher,200,student drive reading skills actually going using science reading about science about 
1,Teacher,200,guys done going using reading 
1,Teacher,200,student going reviewing responses questions 
1,Teacher,200,student actually going using reading work reading skills going learning also- about science 
1,Teacher,200,student also going learning work reading writing skills 
1,Teacher,200,student work break down questions such 
1,Teacher,200,student think more work answers make little more expectation using specific language 
1,Teacher,200,text uses well just working writing skills like said student earlier just working science skills also working reading writing skills 
1,Teacher,200,yeah also using today only reading help know little more about space like student knows about 
1,Teacher,200,student also going using reading learn prac ice reading writing skills understanding break down 
1,Teacher,200,student information might even know about stuff 
1,Teacher,200,just want make sure everybody using right language everybody understands find find evidence answer such student student hand well 
1,Teacher,200,student about right wrong here right about building response strengthening text al evidence look ng ideas question 
1,Teacher,200,like where where found answer text student 
1,Teacher,200,student read line where found story what 
1,Teacher,200,yeah student more about where found text said 
1,Teacher,200,student read article because sure really need answer because circled same 
1,Teacher,200,student chance back look find same answer find something different 
1,Teacher,200,student maybe other equipment might used just find oxygen excuse just find water moon what some other points made passage read what some other points made 
1,Teacher,200,what makes think student based passage what makes think evidence convincing 
1,Teacher,200,student tell read paragraph where says 
1,Teacher,200,student scientists equipment like oxygen tanks where find evidence 
1,Teacher,200,student where paragraph talk about scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,200,student great tell where what found 
1,Teacher,200,student talk about student answer said scientist found crater full water moon what paragraph tell happened 
1,Teacher,200,student help find passage where talks about oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,200,that's right good lunar orbiter tell what paragraph found student 
1,Teacher,200,student find answer text 
1,Teacher,200,told circled same answer student want challenge find text where says where talks about microscope because 
1,Teacher,200,coming back what student told about look discover that's little confusing which verb using paragraph look discover 
1,Teacher,200,student where reading find some evidence answer question 
1,Teacher,200,will refer back student article back student reading would love know where think might find answer equipment discover water student student hand 
1,Teacher,200,student could please read paragraph read sentence where think answers question about what kind equipment using discover water 
1,Teacher,200,wonderful okay  student answer change would would answer still believe paragraph three 
1,Teacher,200,student think moon moon very 
1,Teacher,200,student find crater full water just look ng water find 
1,Teacher,200,perfect student where tell what paragraph found 
1,Teacher,200,student just provided microscope look really closely what look ng closely good though 
1,Teacher,200,right well think about student should look very closely water molecules without microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student where read text 
1,Teacher,200,student responses front curious know what evidence circle tech going around would like share evidence used student start 
1,Teacher,200,student what evidence 
1,Teacher,200,student what evidence circle 
1,Teacher,200,student what evidence circle help answer 
1,Teacher,200,want hear from student really quickly  what evidence find able circle specific evidence text help 
1,Teacher,200,what name small machine anybody know 
1,Teacher,200,student what piece evidence thought about some evidence said water could valuable 
1,Teacher,200,water split different elements right student where find text 
1,Teacher,200,student good okay where find text talked about microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student that's okay could read sentence thinking tell that's where found student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student where found student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student that's paragraph talk about piece equipment used 
1,Teacher,200,student there other equipment think used discover water could look back text think about what actually discover d water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student know what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student right what what part text read gave impression 
1,Teacher,200,well student answer says microscope look really closely what look ng closely what focus like look ng something really small really student 
1,Teacher,200,student could what something moon could look moon said moon desert what else could look desert 
1,Teacher,200,well didn't student answer wrong technically correct send small machine what kind small machine send tell student 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student remember what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student found some more details reading about what machine called 
1,Teacher,200,no ice student said nasa sent small machine  look back text recall what name small machine nasa sent 
1,Teacher,200,student looking paragraph moment specifically answer question what name small machine nasa sent investigate 
1,Teacher,200,student where article doesn't talk about oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,200,student okay from student text says would need what water 
1,Teacher,200,student okay student want talk microscope what paragraph reading talk about microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student what happened study small deposit 
1,Teacher,200,student figure what name small machine 
1,Teacher,200,student just into more detail about what else what other equipment might used other just microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student right what nasa send order microscope 
1,Teacher,200,what guys think about where evidence might help question 
1,Teacher,200,anybody remember what name machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student okay understand what equipment used 
1,Teacher,200,student also read paragraph what else what other equipment should other tool 
1,Teacher,200,student what else read 
1,Teacher,200,student what tell from information just gave what other tool might using learn about water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student tell needed microscope find water 
1,Teacher,200,student deposits very small seem like water little water 
1,Teacher,200,student using equipment what 
1,Teacher,200,student right microscope discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student that's right where find passage show where found 
1,Teacher,200,student investigate right investigate evidence what using investigate evidence 
1,Teacher,200,student what some things water could used moon like says paragraph four five 
1,Teacher,200,look back some details student 
1,Teacher,200,student right actually discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student right mention paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student didn't find student answer from paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student what lame lunar orbiter keep sentence 
1,Teacher,200,student where water when heavy read sentence 
1,Teacher,200,student here's find specifically where water heavy 
1,Teacher,200,student what what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student good said sent machine what machine 
1,Teacher,200,student okay said lunar orbiter look what deposit 
1,Teacher,200,student talk about much water find 
1,Teacher,200,student whole machine given name place where given name 
1,Teacher,200,student choose tags 
1,Teacher,200,student what else think would look ng moon 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what reading tell possibly could oxygen tanks what tell story 
1,Teacher,200,student where pull oxygen tanks from text discover ng water 
1,Teacher,200,student well said scientist equipment like oxygen when responding what equipment scientist discover water moon where find student answer from text which paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student right when student look ng what type machine stuff look water when student look ng three paragraph where where would find information paragraph specifically 
1,Teacher,200,student word would paragraph just skimming 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what what what kind evidence circle text 
1,Teacher,200,student said sent small machine what what piece evidence circle 
1,Teacher,200,student okay well what paragraph think find 
1,Teacher,200,student talked about astronaut water stay hydrated like said cannot survive without water where come answer find answer 
1,Teacher,200,student what look ng closely 
1,Teacher,200,student alright look student paragraph three where talk about discover there 
1,Teacher,200,student good okay talked about nasa sending small machine look back text what send small machine 
1,Teacher,200,student teacherbut what equipment think used find what read article about equipment used 
1,Teacher,200,student find text there back text where found 
1,Teacher,200,student what lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,200,student investigate what discover when used small machine investigate what discover 
1,Teacher,200,student look what look things 
1,Teacher,200,okay that's very good  student where found student evidence well 
1,Teacher,200,student okay sent small machine where 
1,Teacher,200,student that's type equipment what else equipment what 
1,Teacher,200,student masks suits mentioned anywhere article 
1,Teacher,200,student look sentence where found small machine ahead read whole sentence where small machine included 
1,Teacher,200,want guys take second locate 
1,Teacher,200,text where found small machine microscope want guys tell what paragraph text small machine microscope

1,Teacher,200,student find because don't think robot part there that's okay 
1,Teacher,200,awesome alright student where find information about microscope text 
1,Teacher,200,student really didn't know from passage 
1,Teacher,200,student said water heavy good don't carry ships an more part about water being heavy from passage 
1,Teacher,200,student want give specific detail from text about think lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,200,student listen show where found tell where 
1,Teacher,200,student ready what made choose answer tell evidence from book made think 
1,Teacher,200,student read article 
1,Teacher,200,student where specifically paragraph three 
1,Teacher,200,student could share where found where read just read student answer scientist found crater full water moon could like just show 
1,Teacher,200,said same answer student want explain little what found when student reading 
1,Teacher,200,student point where found 
1,Teacher,200,student just wondering more specifically what small machine know used small machin like tell text where text 
1,Teacher,200,student back right look responses think about what said think about chose things find part text tells 
1,Teacher,200,student what student thoughts going support student thoughts 
1,Teacher,200,student find part story could quote said anything about oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,200,when student found look text reread no ice said scientific tool 
1,Teacher,200,good right going call student first talk about  answer told nasa send small machine where information 
1,Teacher,200,student tell where passage found answer where from 
1,Teacher,200,student show where found 
1,Teacher,200,good student  said scientist found crater full water moon like very true just tell little more about where text said 
1,Teacher,200,student show where text found answers 
1,Teacher,200,student read sentence 
1,Teacher,200,student lunar orbiter great read sentence where find 
1,Teacher,200,student perfect remember where found 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah mentioned scientist look d student tool called microscope wondering could some text evidence proves where text there quote remember 
1,Teacher,200,student text evidence from student response said nasa send small machine read about 
1,Teacher,200,student said student need scientific tool called microscope also said circle same thing where text point just everyone's same page 
1,Teacher,200,like focus first said there sufficient evidence would   student what part text makes think water would valuable resource 
1,Teacher,200,student based text what makes believe water could valuable resource 
1,Teacher,200,okay student saying found student evidence somewhere else text where find student evidence 
1,Teacher,200,student text where find student evidence isn't necessarily important long back 
1,Teacher,200,student where find know find text 
1,Teacher,200,yeah really good point know when answer want guys think where found know where found because want bring information from text where think found 
1,Teacher,200,student number point like microscope part where 
1,Teacher,200,student there anything more specific want pull from answer text 
1,Teacher,200,student find crater what part text from 
1,Teacher,200,student find anywhere specifically text 
1,Teacher,200,student good text where find text what made choose student response 
1,Teacher,200,student alright text find answer what made choose answer question 
1,Teacher,200,student right very true want walk through where found answer 
1,Teacher,200,student paragraph five find 
1,Teacher,200,student just want work kind find example text know where text 
1,Teacher,200,student think equipment like oxygen like oxygen oxygen tank 
1,Teacher,200,student look back into reading anything about microscope section tell which section like they're numbered know don't look back 
1,Teacher,200,student don't that's okay 
1,Teacher,200,student awesome from second sentence paragraph five correct 
1,Teacher,200,student question there anything about using water growing things moon article remember kind just thinking things water earth 
1,Teacher,200,student right what's what's text al evidence support 's claim main idea first paragraph scientist found lots water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student point some evidence text tells astronaut will able into space water space hips anymore 
1,Teacher,200,student very good could saying there anything more text says about water heavy 
1,Teacher,200,student find compelling evidence water would valuable 
1,Teacher,200,student pretty cool back text reread part toxin talks about gives information about hydrogen oxygen being used fuel there anything around know would useful astronaut 
1,Teacher,200,student tell where story believe just just need actual text please 
1,Teacher,200,student good glad able connect prior experience relate what talking about text anything text about things 
1,Teacher,200,student just need write down where found student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student then want tell where find evidence okay 
1,Teacher,200,student answer like student answer text okay 
1,Teacher,200,what details text what specific equipment mentioned text scientist used discover water student 
1,Teacher,300,awesome so Farrah and STUDENT get awesome points for circling the parts in the text prompt because that was the the direction so A+  direction for following points
1,Teacher,300,"amazing yeah I love that and and I love that you are you agree with Farrah and you're adding more to the answer and together, you guys have collaborated on Even better answer"
1,Teacher,300,"and I love that you guys are really using the reading and pointing to specific parts and sentences in the reading to help equipment that allow us to discover water on the moon You come up with your answer and I think we already, so now we have identified two different equipments and you guys were able to build on each other's answers to"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah and you pulled out something very specific and you found another piece of equipment that was method mentioned in the text, which is very good, as well"
1,Teacher,300,I love that you brought in that background knowledge STUDENT that fact about some about the scientists and astronauts needing those oxygen tanks that's really awesome background knowledge
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so you read it in the story I love that you found it in the story"
1,Teacher,300,yeah so I love that you picked up on the microscope because it's really important when we're thinking about the word microscopic
1,Teacher,300,yeah so STUDENT I love what you know about NASA and you're using evidence from the reading
1,Teacher,300,"yeah I love, how you summarize that are STUDENT, alright, So I love, how you summarize the article Chris"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah STUDENT that's awesome background knowledge, thank you for bringing that background knowledge so"
1,Teacher,300,yeah so I love that you both know that microscopes are used to look at small things and that you were able to pull that out of the text
1,Teacher,300,So um STUDENT what you did was you definitely got the answer correct
1,Teacher,300,"right, you, you know you know what sort of equipment scientists use to discover equipment on the moon uh to discover water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,"Absolutely yeah no, these are all great observations about how our thinking can change by sort of learning a new piece"
1,Teacher,300,I really like how you use your background knowledge to answer that question
1,Teacher,300,So I am sure that you are going to do a great job when we look back for this specific tool because you probably heard of it before
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I am so glad that you know so much about space"
1,Teacher,300,"Great, I can really tell you use your background knowledge with that"
1,Teacher,300,So you're absolutely right and ice deposit is a piece of frozen water that's on a planet
1,Teacher,300,"That's a good way of thinking about it, STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,You did mention a specific piece of equipment and although that may not be the best answer
1,Teacher,300,"And you still address the equipment part of the question, and I appreciate that"
1,Teacher,300,That's very specific and I appreciate you being really specific in your answer
1,Teacher,300,I like your revised answer and that you guys work so well together
1,Teacher,300,"But yeah, she did a great job and you were very specific also"
1,Teacher,300,"I see your line of thought and I really appreciate that you're telling us that they sent a small machine, which is the equipment and they used it to discover which is to find out, or to see"
1,Teacher,300,And I appreciate that answer
1,Teacher,300,You did a great job using your background knowledge and using all the information that was in our text
1,Teacher,300,That was one of our right answers
1,Teacher,300,It was a right answer
1,Teacher,300,"Well, I appreciate that"
1,Teacher,300,"I can see what you're thinking, and where you were going with that"
1,Teacher,300,And I really like the fact that you use those contexts clues and explain to me what extracting meant
1,Teacher,300,So I appreciate that your opinion is that no you don't think that it's  It's going to be convincing or or it's going to be valuable
1,Teacher,300,"Reading You told us that extracting was getting the water out and I see where you use that evidence, saying that it might take a lot of time and money"
1,Teacher,300,"Because it's possible that we could get it from the moon and I see Chris's thinking was, he said that water is very heavy"
1,Teacher,300,I can see how it would be very useful to leave behind all that weight because we may be able to find that water and use water on the moon and not have to carry that would be valuable
1,Teacher,300,"Um, so I can see STUDENT I appreciate the fact that you see value in that because it would be a valuable source"
1,Teacher,300,You did a good job
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, you did a very good job going back and finding the evidence"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, that is our this the two words that we really want to focus on,"
1,Teacher,300,That's a very good point
1,Teacher,300,So you could circle convincing evidence together
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, that's a great idea"
1,Teacher,300,And we always want to make sure that we're looking forward
1,Teacher,300,Even if it's not valuable right now
1,Teacher,300,Like you just said in your answer that it would be valuable in the future
1,Teacher,300,"Now, but in the future"
1,Teacher,300,"So like you said you have a good, you have a good point that it may not be valuable"
1,Teacher,300,"I love that STUDENT, use the text when she found her answer and I wonder if"
1,Teacher,300,I love that you cited where you found it in the text
1,Teacher,300,"So STUDENT, you said you need a specific tool called a microscope to look really closely which is absolutely true"
1,Teacher,300,Instead of saying equipment like the question did you just said tool
1,Teacher,300,"And that's perfectly because they're synonyms, which means that they're the same or they mean the same thing"
1,Teacher,300,You told me and you gave it to me from the text that a microscope is what is needed to look really really closely
1,Teacher,300,"I'm glad that you had some place that you could reference back to, because that's really helpful in showing me that you know where the information came from"
1,Teacher,300,"Scientists have found craters full of water on the moon, and that is absolutely true"
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, you have found some specific evidence in the text you pulled it right out"
1,Teacher,300,And I'm really proud of you for finding that
1,Teacher,300,"Oh, what a nice way to explain that"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh, I see where you're talking about it says the water they found is microscopic so I mean right, it's very small"
1,Teacher,300,Which is great and you all refer back to the text
1,Teacher,300,You got to the three of you have listed science equipment right which you that is that first part of the question
1,Teacher,300,"Well, you know, those are pieces of equipment that they use"
1,Teacher,300,Thank you for that
1,Teacher,300,That's a some awesome prior knowledge STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,So I can add a bit of background info here
1,Teacher,300,"Um, so, STUDENT Can you give me another example of equipment, maybe something from that article that we just read that you know that NASA is using in space"
1,Teacher,300,"And you offer a lot of insight,"
1,Teacher,300,"That's, that's my, my fault there so, Instead, I should have said, the way you answer that I see where you're coming from"
1,Teacher,300,"Well, maybe I phrased that poorly"
1,Teacher,300,I think that definitely gives a lot to whoever's reading that answer to include them in
1,Teacher,300,I think that's very good
1,Teacher,300,I like your use of detail there
2,Teacher,300,"And that's, that's very good"
2,Teacher,300,I'm glad you're able to get that sort of perspective on it
2,Teacher,300,You give really good strong details on that very specific part
2,Teacher,300,So I can kind of see your enjoyment there now a way we can sort of improve or something we might want to see is
2,Teacher,300,"Okay, that's, that's great"
2,Teacher,300,I think you've got the main idea
2,Teacher,300,And so at the heart of your answer there
2,Teacher,300,And that's really exciting
2,Teacher,300,We found some water on the moon
2,Teacher,300,Thank you very much for listening
2,Teacher,300,Those are very good listening skills and making sure you're always being an active learner and to I think you really took to heart
2,Teacher,300,So I appreciate that
2,Teacher,300,That was very good
2,Teacher,300,What I said there
2,Teacher,300,Why it doesn't say anything about water and that's a great point there but
2,Teacher,300,"That's right, they, you know, they, they are very valuable and I like how you pointed that out"
2,Teacher,300,But when we look back at the question
2,Teacher,300,"Okay, awesome, and I love how Deb's original response was that he found the same as STUDENT, that shows that Oliver is able to make a connection with his classmate and relate his thinking to Farrah thinking"
2,Teacher,300,And that's a good skill
2,Teacher,300,I love how Farrah Oliver Chris and STUDENT were able to look specifically in the text
2,Teacher,300,"To use our background knowledge like STUDENT used in to make inferences using our background knowledge and what the text tells us, right"
2,Teacher,300,We want to make inferences and use our use our prior knowledge that's very important
2,Teacher,300,That's a good question
2,Teacher,300,"That is a good answer, because that is part of the answer"
2,Teacher,300,So way to use that evidence there for for a reason for water being valuable to us all right now
2,Teacher,300,"So yes, that's another great example of convincing evidence"
2,Teacher,300,But you had a you had another good piece of evidence
2,Teacher,300,"And so you, you do have a good convincing Answer right there"
2,Teacher,300,I see where you're going with that
2,Teacher,300,"And it is a small machine,"
2,Teacher,300,And I'm glad that you referenced the text because that was awesome and correct
2,Teacher,300,It is the Lunar Orbiter
2,Teacher,300,"Great job, looking back at the text"
2,Teacher,300,"Yes, they could use the microscope after they found it to study it"
2,Teacher,300,That's very good deduction there
2,Teacher,300,"I like what you did there, STUDENT"
2,Teacher,300,"STUDENT That was, that was a great find in the text"
2,Teacher,300,The water before it's broken apart can be drunk by astronauts good observation there from the text and the usefulness for oxygen and hydrogen can be used for rocket fuel here
2,Teacher,300,That's great use of your background knowledge about that space station that they're planning to build it will take a lot of what in order to get that process going
2,Teacher,300,It says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely
2,Teacher,300,And it also does say in here in the third paragraph
2,Teacher,300,I'm and I see where STUDENT could have got her answer
2,Teacher,300,And she couldn't when you couldn't quite remember what the name of it was
2,Teacher,300,I like how you went back to your text and re read the information
2,Teacher,300,I like how everyone is reading their text and finding the details in the reading
2,Teacher,300,"So great job, guys"
2,Teacher,300,"So you weren't wrong, but by going back and rereading you are able to identify what the exact name of that machine was"
2,Teacher,300,"It was the right answer, but I like how you went back and read your text and offered more accurate details"
2,Teacher,300,"And Nice job, looking back at the text"
2,Teacher,300,That is a very good answer
2,Teacher,300,You remember from your text and you're elaborated by restating the question
2,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, did you want to add something"
2,Teacher,300,"Now I can see since you already have a lot of prior knowledge about space, how, why you would come up with that answer"
1,Teacher,300,"And that is a great answer, our passage"
1,Teacher,300,"I can see exactly why you would say that because it does say the water is microscopic and you would need to see a microscope, you would use a microscope to see it"
1,Teacher,300,"Well, I can, if you went to NASA and you actually saw all of those things I could, I can understand why you would think that because there's a lot of things that you probably learned"
1,Teacher,300,"And I see why you would say that,"
1,Teacher,300,"I see where you get that answer,"
1,Teacher,300,I like your thinking that is awesome
1,Teacher,300,You use details from our text to support your thinking
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I see what you're thinking too so awesome job using evidence from the text as well"
1,Teacher,300,It is like a tool that scientists use when they are discovering things
1,Teacher,300,"So, that was a really good explanation and definition of what equipment is"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, those are some things from your personal experience, and we do get information from our personal experience"
1,Teacher,300,What you did a great job finding the first part of the sentence
1,Teacher,300,"Good thinking, because we are talking about water"
1,Teacher,300,"We are talking about the moon, but there are a few more"
1,Teacher,300,"Well, I appreciate it, that you added that detail for us"
1,Teacher,300,Water is a valuable resource right
1,Teacher,300,One place we can look is exactly where you look so you found the right spot to look under the section
1,Teacher,300,Because that has the words we were just talking about
1,Teacher,300,So that was just the right place to look for that
1,Teacher,300,"And you did find some evidence, didn't you"
1,Teacher,300,"All right, let's see, when you guys are doing a great job with talking through this and working through it together and you know where to find the right place to look"
1,Teacher,300,So you guys are all given really good details
1,Teacher,300,So you guys are given really good details for that
1,Teacher,300,I've seen that you remembered a detail from the passage
1,Teacher,300,"Because I agree with you that no, maybe it's not a good investment"
1,Teacher,300,So I think that you justified your answer and
1,Teacher,300,"So I think that you and Chris and Luis All said that, yes, it's valuable and then you gave a reason why you thought it was valuable"
1,Teacher,300,And I spoke to STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,So he justified his answer
1,Teacher,300,So I wouldn't say that you are wrong because it says one are valuable
1,Teacher,300,"You said yeah and then you pulled your evidence from the text, so I would asy that your answer is right"
1,Teacher,300,"Um, I think we all had our reasons and justified our reason"
1,Teacher,300,I think that was a pretty good and complete answer because she gave the value
1,Teacher,300,"But I think that Jazmin's answer, And she said,Yeah, because they can drink the water and they can stay hydrated"
1,Teacher,300,Of the water and how the water could be used
1,Teacher,300,you summarize very well okay and about the craters
1,Teacher,300,You talked about the craters and craters full of water on the moon
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, now you elaborate a little bit more in your answer"
1,Teacher,300,I like that answer
1,Teacher,300,"Now, okay, I can see that you understand what you were reading"
1,Teacher,300,And you look back in the text to find your answer and to get all the information
1,Teacher,300,"I like how you're thinking about that how you're thinking about what you could use on the moon, even thought it's not in there, that's a very good pull from what you read, STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,They are and you're using her deep reading skills to really engage with the text and that's awesome
1,Teacher,300,And I love your use of the vocabulary term microscopic that's really good
1,Teacher,300,But I love that you're using that prior knowledge that's really good
1,Teacher,300,I loved your answer you really use the details in the article you went back and re read so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
1,Teacher,300,So like you said your answer
1,Teacher,300,And it looks like you've done that in your answer
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, the water is valuable, but we really need to discuss why"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so I can see how you may have a misunderstanding there because it's the say that you would need a tool called a microscope right STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,"I see where you found about the microscope, you can see the water"
1,Teacher,300,"But I like how you found a machine because it did ask for a tool and a machine in that question and I really like how you found that, but let's let's see if we can find another tool"
1,Teacher,300,"I really like how you restated the text, but we need to put a little really like that"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, so you, you definitely you restated the text"
1,Teacher,300,And I love how you used I'm like the text to to backup your answer
1,Teacher,300,I really like how I mean you went straight to the text and you tell me
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, yeah, you're right"
1,Teacher,300,So try to think about
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so next time I really love how you came up with that answer"
1,Teacher,300,I'm glad that's what we're talking about in the question
1,Teacher,300,"Good, I'm glad you were looking specifically that they found those the water in the craters"
1,Teacher,300,You found exactly where you should be looking at by that word machine there
1,Teacher,300,And you also found that they both talked about water
1,Teacher,300,Now what did the question ask us to find about water
1,Teacher,300,"You found exactly both of the equipment they talked about, really, really good"
1,Teacher,300,"They did say that it will be a long time because they still haven't been able to access the water,"
1,Teacher,300,"I'm glad that you're looking into the text, instead of just going off of what you know"
1,Teacher,300,So right after that the paragraph
1,Teacher,300,"We want to be in, you're exactly right"
1,Teacher,300,"Because it's asking us directly about the text, so yes"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so you did find some important information where"
1,Teacher,300,"So, you made a really important"
1,Teacher,300,"Good, I agree that they're not ready"
1,Teacher,300,"No, you're answers great it you caught on to the fact that NASA did send a small machine, but you didn't tell me what this small machine did and I wanted to know"
1,Teacher,300,They do say that and that's great text evidence to use
1,Teacher,300,"They say that this especially specifically in the text, but let's look back at our question"
1,Teacher,300,"And I say that you, you basically rephrase the first sentence"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, that was very good"
1,Teacher,300,I love how you are reading very closely and paying attention to those very big words very good
1,Teacher,300,And that's probably helped you a little bit with reading this passage and being able to connect some of the experiences that you had back to this packet passage
1,Teacher,300,"And now the reason that you could be confused is because it says it, but we haven't proved it"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so we'll keep going"
1,Teacher,300,"Which is which is good because they did use a small machine and it does say small machine,"
1,Teacher,300,"So you you just used a, one sentence from the paragraph that had a piece of equipment in it"
1,Teacher,300,"Your answer was, NASA sent a small machine"
1,Teacher,300,So you're in the ballpark
1,Teacher,300,So you found the equipment
1,Teacher,300,And I like that you use that wording scientific tool
1,Teacher,300,I like that you use that word scientific tool
1,Teacher,300,"Great, great job there,"
1,Teacher,300,And I really appreciate you explaining your answer
1,Teacher,300,I do understand what you mean
1,Teacher,300,"Well, I do like that you shared your opinion in your answer"
1,Teacher,300,And sometimes it's hard for us as students and even sometimes as teachers because we're not scientist to understand how long it takes for them to figure out how to get things right
1,Teacher,300,I agree with you
1,Teacher,300,"Like right now, it's not ready and I do like that you shared your opinion, good job there"
1,Teacher,300,"I think that you are correct, that sometimes it's not going to be ready"
1,Teacher,300,"So you guys have all shared your responses with us and that's been really, really good"
1,Teacher,300,I really liked that you guys tried to pull your evidence from the text
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so one of the things I would say is that you guys did a really good job trying to pull things you found Out of the text"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, that certainly makes sense from having gone to see that type of stuff"
1,Teacher,300,That's great that you had a chance to see some other things that have happened in space
1,Teacher,300,So that's a great job be able to identify what that means
1,Teacher,300,So you guys did a really good job at using your past knowledge on a microscope
1,Teacher,300,And so you looked back at the tech stuff on if there was convincing evidence that water can be valuable
1,Teacher,300,Good job so you may be redirected and rethought your answer
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, it was in the within the text, it does state that this stuff,"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, well, you know, good job"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, was within the actual document in this state that you can split up in between oxygen, hydrogen and oxygen"
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT you were able to sort of, you know, find those key evident that key evidence, very quickly"
1,Teacher,300,that is very good job
1,Teacher,300,Very good for looking deep into your question and in circle in it
1,Teacher,300,"Alright, so let's first look at the question again"
1,Teacher,300,And I was very impressed about how everyone took time to look over and look into the text and had some really deep connections they really you really thought about the things that we were asking
1,Teacher,300,A that is a great response and I love how you made a connection because that helps some of us out a detective
1,Teacher,300,Made a connection and we're studying about space and on the moon
1,Teacher,300,You made a connection a detective
1,Teacher,300,She used like a STUDENT use that his dad was an astronaut
1,Teacher,300,"So again, there you goin back in when you said you didn't understand about that word, I think, you know, more than what you think evidence you just showed me evidence about how to survive"
1,Teacher,300,"So I appreciate that you, when looking at the text you notice that the scientists use the microscope"
1,Teacher,300,So I appreciate that you care To get the correct answer
1,Teacher,300,"So that's very that's, that's very good to ask so you you are you're seeking to know why your answer was wrong"
1,Teacher,300,And so I love that y'all are all thinking about the story and are using
1,Teacher,300,"Using the text to help support your answers,"
1,Teacher,300,I do and I think you're doing a good job putting that together
1,Teacher,300,"That is such a great comment, and it's really great that you're able to tie that in with a real world experience and I would think that they definitely use those things on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,You can bring in your prior knowledge to the article sort of like STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,And I especially like what you said about an opinion because it is asking for an opinion
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, and that was perfect"
1,Teacher,300,"I really, I really think that you did a really good job I identifying and separating the fact that the now versus later"
1,Teacher,300,"So you're, you may know a lot about space, that's, I agree with you"
1,Teacher,300,You know that answer makes perfect sense
1,Teacher,300,You do a great job of talking about the question
1,Teacher,300,As far as that goes
1,Teacher,300,So you obviously understand the question
1,Teacher,300,"So again, we're just going to that"
1,Teacher,300,So you're picking up on key parts of the text which water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that's important
1,Teacher,300,So you already do parts of that you answer the question you provide evidence you explain your evidence
1,Teacher,300,You do a great your answers
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated"
1,Teacher,300,You can't survive without water
1,Teacher,300,And it's hard because I like you to have your own opinion
1,Teacher,300,"what I would really like you to do, though"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I mean, that's a great way to say it"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so we have the first noun what equipment and that's an excellent strategy to look at if our if our question is focused on on noun specific things"
1,Teacher,300,"You did, in fact, your response is very good as finding pieces of text evidence"
1,Teacher,300,That is that is a great piece of text evidence
1,Teacher,300,"That was a great thought process, putting those two together"
1,Teacher,300,Okay so convincing evidence and valuable
1,Teacher,300,And that is correct
1,Teacher,300,And I like that you found that because you did find a in paragraph four right under that heading so that helped lead you in the right direction
1,Teacher,300,And I like the way that you've gone back and put the key words from the question with your answer
1,Teacher,300,So I appreciate you looking at your
1,Teacher,300,Answer and asking why
1,Teacher,300,I like how you're making that connection
1,Teacher,300,"Well, I like how you're bringing in that prior knowledge that you already know to help you answer this question"
1,Teacher,300,"I know exactly where it's at the text as well, I believe, part three of the first pair first section"
1,Teacher,300,"So, good job there Oliveron are deaf"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I can see how you got there, I can see I can see that"
1,Teacher,300,"Good job, they're reading into that"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, that is true"
1,Teacher,300,I like that you went back in the text and had some support to support your answer and I do agree with you
1,Teacher,300,I am very glad that you went back in the texts were able to find support for your answer
1,Teacher,300,He did a really good job
1,Teacher,300,"I really liked your answer and how you can how you included both parts those, the water is heavy and that the water can be broken into two parts, and us"
1,Teacher,300,"That's actually very well done,"
1,Teacher,300,And that's a very logical series of steps you took to get to that answer
1,Teacher,300,"I love where you went with that and it was a very logical series of steps that you took,"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, that makes complete and total sense"
1,Teacher,300,That was a good job connecting the dots there
1,Teacher,300,It's good that you've pulled in the Lunar Orbiter
1,Teacher,300,"So you can definitely still say that your answer is, is a big part of what you want to reconstruct to, but I think to be a little more specific"
1,Teacher,300,"And now that you've chosen to answer that gives us more detail, instead of just circling the same as STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,Your thought process is a lot deeper as well
1,Teacher,300,"First of all, because I know that that's a really important detail, but now that we know how it was found in those craters we've answered the question with much more detail"
1,Teacher,300,"Great, that's, that's really good STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,So I appreciate that you noticed where the water was found
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, now, like how you have started thinking about question"
1,Teacher,300,"It did say what equipment do they use discover water on the moon, and you're starting to think about what equipment  Would they need to find water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,You have mentioned two pieces of equipment that are specifically referenced in the text Lunar Orbiter and microscope
1,Teacher,300,"I like how you read the text you saw mentioned microscope and you're thinking, well, I have to have a microscope to see the water deposit"
1,Teacher,300,"Therefore, the microscope is what was used to find as water deposits"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, and I do like how you have focused on part of the question you focused on the part where it says they, they discovered water on the moon and you specifically said where they found water on the moon, they found it in the craters"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, and I do like how you have referenced something in the text that is specifically mentioned it does in fact say that water can be broken down into oxygen and hydrogen"
1,Teacher,300,And that is great because you obviously went to the text and the text does in fact say that astronauts could drink the water
1,Teacher,300,"Absolutely and that's in the text says, Great your point information out of the text that water H2O can be splitting the oxygen and hydrogen"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, well, and I love that you guys were able to close your eyes and see that and help you Oliverelop that"
1,Teacher,300,So you found that directly in the text
1,Teacher,300,Anything you did use a lot of background knowledge and your answer
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I understand that"
1,Teacher,300,but I do love that you brought your outside knowledge into the conversation
1,Teacher,300,And I just like that
1,Teacher,300,That was your example
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so just like STUDENT I love that you're using your background knowledge to contribute to our discussion and they're also may be"
1,Teacher,300,"um for our first question, you said that scientists use a microscope to look closely and I wanted to say that that was really good I like that you used the specific name of the tool that scientists use, but I also want to encourage you to"
1,Teacher,300,"So STUDENT you did a really good job, saying that the microscope was a tool that they used because you're definitely correct it is"
1,Teacher,300,awesome I want to say that that is a good response because you said that they use a lot of equipment and then you were specific by saying oxygen tanks
1,Teacher,300,And I think it's really good when you're reading a text to think about what you already know and experiences you have so like STUDENT is saying
1,Teacher,300,he already knows a lot about space and he learned the astronauts use these specific things so that's great to keep in mind when you're reading the text
1,Teacher,300,"Right, I definitely appreciate that um and I like that you were able to find exactly where in the text you found your answer um I do have a concern, though, so the question"
1,Teacher,300,That is a very good response and I like that you provided a use for the water so that would be your evidence that you pulled from the text um
1,Teacher,300,And you were able to find that in the text good job
1,Teacher,300,Great job pulling that out of the text
1,Teacher,300,"So I strength so far from that was, um, you pointed out the material they use, and then you said what it's used for which is very good"
1,Teacher,300,I like that that's that's a good plan that's what I was thinking when I was reading yesterday first time I was like no not for yeah so I like your response and I like how you look for the evidence
1,Teacher,300,"For your answer, which is really good so i'm keep Keep up the good job of looking at the evidence on before they even asked that question"
1,Teacher,300,"Do you think it's a good investment um I thought I thought your answer was great because, like"
1,Teacher,300,"You know, someone could have given like a shorter and simple answer, I guess, but your answer was still very good so good job on us man, thank you very much, no problem, no problem so i'm dead, you said"
1,Teacher,300,You um I like how you added evidence that you have to stay hydrated because you can't you can't survive without water and
1,Teacher,300,um so I like how you paid attention to that and you're you paid a lot to attention you paid a lot of
1,Teacher,300,"Attention to details which is very key in reading passages like this, because if you mess up on details then your answer like could be not what you wanted to say, but like you messed up on reading so then your answer when my county all messed up if you know what I mean well"
1,Teacher,300,STUDENT your response is actually really good
1,Teacher,300,I like how you use the word microscope and you knew what it was used for
1,Teacher,300,"That is right, and I like your answer, how you use evidence from what you knew that I told you, in the name of the machine that I set up for"
1,Teacher,300,Like that it's a lot more general towards what the check said and then an opinion that you add or your guess of what you saw was there
1,Teacher,300,"I think you did a really great job, pulling from the text,"
1,Teacher,300,So it was a great response
1,Teacher,300,"You had some of your personal views, along with some thoughts that came from the text"
1,Teacher,300,So what you said related to the text really well
1,Teacher,300,"And STUDENT, I think you had some great vocab sorry, did you have a question, Jazmin"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah it's definitely a good answer to give and you use multiple paragraphs looking through to find that answer, but where the question is kind of"
1,Teacher,300,i'm glad we could expand on that and we can see how there's much more to getting to space and finding the water than we thought there was
1,Teacher,300,But you use great academic knowledge
1,Teacher,300,nd great academic vocab in your response
1,Teacher,300,"So you notice that it was a small machine was very good which they also stated, it shows that you use your context from the text, which is very good"
1,Teacher,300,But you used great academic vocab in your response
1,Teacher,300,They did use a microscope to look at the water closest answer was small I see how you connected those two
1,Teacher,300,"And the background knowledge is helpful to understand what's going on in the passage, I want you to use that background knowledge to help you understand the passage better and be able to read to find the answers"
1,Teacher,300,"I well, one thing I noticed was that you started out with your context your background knowledge which is great, and always useful"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, that is right so it's always great to have background knowledge to help us understand our text better or understand the question better"
1,Teacher,300,"Awesome you got that right from the passage,"
1,Teacher,300,"mention a piece of evidence that is in the passage that because it says clearly in the passage um, for example, future astronauts can drink water"
1,Teacher,300,"So you had said that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen, you are right, that is from passage, so you did get that from the password, which is good,"
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, just as you said, you said you understood it, but I still want to give you the feedback"
1,Teacher,300,"awesome so I see what you did,"
1,Teacher,300,"and that was great to use the reading, to help us with our answer"
1,Teacher,300,"awesome so that's what it says in the text, which is great that we used our resources,"
1,Teacher,300,"awesome So yes, that included the important details"
1,Teacher,300,"You don't think it's valuable, so I see where you're coming from because it does say right here that making a plan will take a lot of time and money,"
1,Teacher,300,"let's look at the last sentence, because I like what STUDENT brought up making this plan will take a lot of time and money"
1,Teacher,300,And STUDENT I also noticed that you have to be did your background knowledge by referencing that they use oxygen tanks on the moon
1,Teacher,300,"I knew you were using your background knowledge because in the reading, we read, we didn't read anything about oxygen tanks, but you knew that when you're on the Loon"
1,Teacher,300,"You need to have oxygen to be able to breathe, right?"
1,Teacher,300,"So I can see why you think that microscope is important, and I agree to the microscope is very important, with discovering water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so I see how you did connect but you were you were kind of scanning the page for the words that connected to water, because the question was about finding water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,That's a really good strategy
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, they did use the microscope to really look closely, and that's a really good way to use the text as evidence in your answer"
1,Teacher,300,"Thank you for pointing that out, STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,And thank you STUDENT for explaining your answer and using the text really well
1,Teacher,300,"answer because it really, like I said, it really uses the text like Farrah's"
1,Teacher,300,"You quoted the reading really well and I really like that, and you also found in the text where"
1,Teacher,300,"Um so STUDENT I really liked in your answer that you really, you mentioned the evidence from the from the reading"
1,Teacher,300,It talks about specific things that the question asks
1,Teacher,300,and I really like that you you that you took us to a very specific part in the text um
1,Teacher,300,A lot of people use a lot of good language in their responses um Farrah and Jazmin you guys really use a lot of Nice language specific language from the texts that I really appreciate
1,Teacher,300,"So Jazmin's response is really good because it does lead us to answering the question, the question was what equipment did they use"
1,Teacher,300,And she answers NASA sent a small machine
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so Jazmin's response was NASA sent a small machine"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, thank you, that is"
1,Teacher,300,"is really, really nice way to phrase that"
1,Teacher,300,"that's awesome and I love, how long is like how you worded your answer"
1,Teacher,300,"I love, how you comprehend the reading so well"
1,Teacher,300,"and I love, how you said that you look back at the reading to like determine which machine you thought would be the best one"
1,Teacher,300,"And, your answer is right about the microscope data scientists did use the microscope to look at the water they already found in the reading it says they already found the water"
1,Teacher,300,I really like how you looks back at the reading and really understood the question because you totally did
1,Teacher,300,"you're totally right about how NASA you so much equipment like oxygen tanks and other things like that, and they definitely do use that when they go to the moon, but"
1,Teacher,300,"Well that's great, and I can definitely tell that you guys read the reading and understood it"
1,Teacher,300,"I totally understand where you're coming from, and I think that's a great way that you guys interpreted interpreted the reading,"
1,Teacher,300,I definitely can see how you would find it confusing
1,Teacher,300,"and i'm glad that you guys didn't notice that when you guys read,"
1,Teacher,300,I do agree that it does say other equipment that Thank you
1,Teacher,300,Your answer is almost perfect and it does show that you read the reading and understood it and understood the question which is great
1,Teacher,300,"They definitely could have, and I do see where you're coming from,"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh, even you bring up a really great point"
1,Teacher,300,I saw that you use your background information when you
1,Teacher,300,"Right, so I think that you and Farrah and Oliver all did this, you used all of your background knowledge when answering this question, which is great"
1,Teacher,300,Good so Chris and STUDENT you both found specific information for the text so that is great
1,Teacher,300,"so you got the answer and you use evidence from the text because it says it was a small machine,"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, so you again you're using some evidence from the text which is great, but"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh right Okay, so when we read that sentence, that you immediately think okay good we need water to drink, which is a great answer, but what it goes on to say is that"
1,Teacher,300,"And I thought that was great response, I noticed that you used your vocabulary,"
1,Teacher,300,And you made it an amazing excellent well thought out response
1,Teacher,300,Now you you've built on your response
1,Teacher,300,So that is a great response
1,Teacher,300,"i'm noticing that you use the text to support your answer, you used the two words scientific tool"
1,Teacher,300,"awesome so i'm noticing, you said you were referred exactly to where in the text you found your answer you said in paragraph three"
1,Teacher,300,"I noticed the it said that they used a microscope to find water, and this is exactly what the question asks I really like how you referred back to the question to help support your answer"
1,Teacher,300,awesome so see you just improved your response by just looking back you read you read that sentence and you strengthen your response
1,Teacher,300,"The tools, the equipment, she thought about the question and then by looking back in the text you did the same thing you looked in you found another thing that they use the how they discovered this water on the moon so by adding those key terms you're answering the question what equipment"
1,Teacher,300,"awesome so you started with they found these creators of water and then you, you referred back to the question you thought about your peers responses and you ended up adding the equipment that they used"
1,Teacher,300,"Alright, so i'm noticing that you really strengthen your response from the start to the end you really use that you're thinking and you use the text to support you"
1,Teacher,300,Thank you so much for sharing your responses to me
1,Teacher,300,"I want to particularly point out, Farrah and Jazmin's responses you guys did a really good job of highlighting the exact equipment that we use"
1,Teacher,300,Naming the exact specific examples of equipment
1,Teacher,300,"I pointed out, Farrah, and STUDENT, both of you had done a really good job from the beginning"
1,Teacher,300,"Exactly, but you did an awesome job backing up your answer, I really liked that"
1,Teacher,300,"And your background knowledge is very beneficial, and I love how you have that"
1,Teacher,300,"Luis, I know that you were talking about all your knowledge"
1,Teacher,300,"OK, now, I saw a lot of vocabulary that you guys used in your responses and that's amazing"
1,Teacher,300,And you did a really good job with that
1,Teacher,300,"So using the tool that you used, was really good to take equipment and look through the text and examine it, right?"
1,Teacher,300,So that's what you did
1,Teacher,300,You looked through and you tried to find the word that fitted
1,Teacher,300,"It shows me that you understand what you're reading and you understand the questions i'm asking you, but you had a great start to your question to answer, I mean"
1,Teacher,300,"by NASA I don't think we had any oxygen tank so I love, how you use your background knowledge to answer the questions,"
1,Teacher,300,"See the orbits the craters closer and you connected that to microscopes, which is really good"
1,Teacher,300,"We do use that in science STUDENT, but"
1,Teacher,300,That was actually really good
1,Teacher,300,One thing I noticed was that you took the evidence from the text that scientists wanting to see things
1,Teacher,300,"You connect to the fact that the waters were found on the moon is used for oxygen right,"
1,Teacher,300,I love how you're challenging your capacities to think about what truly makes water valuable and it really is valuable to get from the moon
1,Teacher,300,"that's true I do love, how you were challenging the question itself, and I think that we, there is reasons to support our evidence that water is valuable and I don't think that"
1,Teacher,300,Just not a great connection
1,Teacher,300,"mm hmm so that is really good that you realize that that was from the article um,"
1,Teacher,300,"You and people use their background knowledge, because that tells me that you're really thinking about what you already know, but I do you really like that you"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, I really like that, just like STUDENT, I think you have a really good grasp on what you're trying to say, and I think you really understand the text"
1,Teacher,300,I really like that answer
1,Teacher,300,I like that you gave reason to why you think that um
1,Teacher,300,um that is like a lot of really good evidence that you shared with me in your answer
1,Teacher,300,"um which is one concern I have for you, although that is a very good point that it's going to cost a lot of money and it might take a very long time for us to get there"
1,Teacher,300,"That is what I like about your responses, you took that specifically from the text you"
1,Teacher,300,"So you said, water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore so like STUDENT I really liked this answer because they this is right from the text you took this information, right from the text, and that is a really important part of answering text specific questions"
1,Teacher,300,Great job! So that's great job using your skills in the text using the context of the text to find your answer
1,Teacher,300,I think it was a really great response and you had you used your academic vocabulary and you used something that was stated directly from the text
1,Teacher,300,You did use an idea that was stated directly from the text
1,Teacher,300,And STUDENT that answer was really great
1,Teacher,300,"um yeah I so one thing that I noticed from your response, I thought that your response was really well and you wrote it very well and you made the points very clear"
1,Teacher,300,"That, I think your answer is great, and you did do a great job again i'm clarifying you know, saying that"
1,Teacher,300,That scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks it's a clear point
1,Teacher,300,And I'm glad that you went back into the text because we know for our answers we want to focus on two things using evidence
1,Teacher,300,"I really like that you could find that specifically in the types that that tells me that you were reading very carefully, and the fact that you remembered where it came from"
1,Teacher,300,"is very good that means you were paying attention, yes, good job"
1,Teacher,300,"did have evidence and that you said, why it would be a good thing"
1,Teacher,300,"I like that you did state yours like your agreement or disagreement in this case, you would did agree, and then you did say why it would be a valuable resource because there's water on the moon, and they could drink it so your answer, you had a very good answer"
1,Teacher,300,I like that was very clarifying
1,Teacher,300,I know that they found it and that's really awesome that you picked that up because I think that's a really great piece of information
1,Teacher,300,And I like that you really pulled that from the text
1,Teacher,300,"Great so I love how that you took trying to pick tool and equipment, we use those as cinnamon synonyms and found that answer, that is a great job"
1,Teacher,300,"yep so the discover water on the moon is definitely important and it definitely was found in that first paragraph, and I understand where you would get that answer,"
1,Teacher,300,I love that you had a really specific reference to the text talking about NASA and that they sent a small machine
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, your response was really awesome"
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, your answer was really awesome"
1,Teacher,300,I love how you talked about microscopes and that was really specific
1,Teacher,300,"And you even described what a microscope does, which it allows you to see something super up close, which is what they talk about in the article"
1,Teacher,300,"Great jobs and see you use you knew the important words in the question, and then you looked at me and you saw my sweater is right, so we want to use just the same ideas for that and work with the questions that we answered before"
1,Teacher,300,yeah I understand I understand your confusion
1,Teacher,300,"How I phrase, it could have been confusing so next time i'll make sure that I more concisely explain that to you guys"
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT that's a really great job because you look through the text and you found the equipment that's mentioned, which is a lunar orbiter but you also notice that a microscope is mentioned, but you realize that the microscope does not help them find water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,guys it's a really great job I really love you guys are starting to use the text that you read previously
1,Teacher,300,And that's great that you were able to gather that information out of the article
1,Teacher,300,So that's great that you were able to point that out
1,Teacher,300,It's a piece of equipment that was mentioned in the article
1,Teacher,300,So a microscope is a type of equipment
1,Teacher,300,That's a very good thing to point out
1,Teacher,300,There's more than just those pieces of equipment that scientists have to use and the astronauts have to use to get to the moon
1,Teacher,300,you're right that is a scientific tool that we use during science to see things closely
1,Teacher,300,So that would make sense
1,Teacher,300,"And some of your science classes, maybe"
1,Teacher,300,So if you use one before
1,Teacher,300,"Right, so you're kind of using your prior knowledge and experience to come up with that answer, which is great"
1,Teacher,300,So they did use a microscope and night you found that right from the evidence
1,Teacher,300,Good to look really closely
1,Teacher,300,So I like how in your answer
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, you were specific and you said that they found the water in the Craters of the moon"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, and that's a great answer, because I see you got your information right from the article inch paragraph for that water is heavy"
1,Teacher,300,And it takes up a lot of space
1,Teacher,300,You have put the steps together very well in your brain
1,Teacher,300,They need things to even be in space
1,Teacher,300,"That is very, very, very good"
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT and I, what I like about that is if I didn't know anything about this topic of finding water on the moon, and I had never read this passage I could learn how the astronauts discovered water on the moon from your answer"
1,Teacher,300,I like that you expanded your thinking
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, what I really like what you just did there was that you started with an idea and then you came up with some of your own thoughts, your own thought of maybe If they didn't have to carry heavy water they could carry other things as well"
1,Teacher,300,And I see how we've made the link between using the water to make hydrogen fuel and oxygen into something that the astronauts use very good
1,Teacher,300,I really liked that you had an answer to what your opinion was of whether or not you think there's compelling evidence
1,Teacher,300,That there isn't much water on the moon
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, I love how you have said things that you've learned from the text is party to support your answer"
1,Teacher,300,"Right okay good, so I, like all of your answers you all really clearly worked with the text and use your best work to get to where you are"
1,Teacher,300,So I can see where you would say microscope oh go ahead
1,Teacher,300,That was wonderful thinking
1,Teacher,300,I loved the way that you are flexible and change your thinking that made your answers so much better
1,Teacher,300,"And I wanted to say, STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,"I loved in your first answer that you agreed with STUDENT, because that means that you're listening to your friends thinking"
1,Teacher,300,And that's really important and learning
1,Teacher,300,I like your second answer better because you put it in your own words
1,Teacher,300,And thank you so much for using that sentence starter
1,Teacher,300,That is a great answer
1,Teacher,300,"So both of you found your answers somewhere in the text, you were, it was clear that you read the text and I really love that you were looking at the text, you definitely read it, or at least looked at it, which is great"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, Deb, I just want to say I really love that you listened to STUDENT and listening is such an important skill as a student"
1,Teacher,300,Sometimes we're then talking and I think it's incredible that you listened to her answer and you agreed with her
1,Teacher,300,That's a really great skill
1,Teacher,300,And even I value all that information inside your brain and never lose that passion for space because it's amazing
1,Teacher,300,I love that you've used your listening skill and you listen to Farrahs answer
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT That was a really strong answer and I like how you reference the text, you said it's called the lunar orbiter because it says so right inside the text"
1,Teacher,300,"Thank you for sharing your answer and connecting with what others have said, it seems like you're asking, How come you didn't get full credit for your answer"
1,Teacher,300,I like that you gave a specific tool
1,Teacher,300,It's great to read our answers directly in the text
1,Teacher,300,I like how you took your answer correctly from the text
1,Teacher,300,So you're saying that the lunar orbiter investigates polar craters for ice that's a very strong answer because you look in the text and you quoted the text directly
1,Teacher,300,Which is good because that provides more space that's a strong answer because it's rooted in the text
1,Teacher,300,How you even expanded your thinking just now
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I really appreciate appreciate that you were looking carefully at the question and exactly the words is equipment"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I really appreciate that you give us a fact from the passage when you answer the question"
1,Teacher,300,"You really gave us the evidence you found in a text, the importance of water"
1,Teacher,300,I really appreciate that you are looking carefully at a question
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I really appreciate that you give us a fact and exactly evidence for all the passage when you answer the question"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I like it"
1,Teacher,300,You had a target to the right place in the passage you for the answer
1,Teacher,300,"so I could see you, how you got confused there"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, so I could see where that would get confusing"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, I saw that man and you did a nice job of explaining that you actually took words from the text, which is great"
1,Teacher,300,It gives us almost like a little step ahead
1,Teacher,300,"But again, that's excellent background knowledge because background knowledge always helps us understand what we're learning about even better"
1,Teacher,300,It helps us understand text a lot more when we have that
1,Teacher,300,And I love that you're using your background knowledge to connect to the texts always great
1,Teacher,300,So you have text evidence from the text
1,Teacher,300,"I like that you use the background information, though, STUDENT, it's always great to have that helps us understand and text a little more"
1,Teacher,300,"I love that you used, you told me, which paragraph you found that evidence, right, the more evidence that we have the stronger our claim is"
1,Teacher,300,"I love that you went and use a specific example from the text, right, that was"
1,Teacher,300,No need to feel bad
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I appreciate your honesty, I also really like that you are referencing specific parts of the text"
1,Teacher,300,So I see that you said they were looking for Ice deposits right in the poet large polar crater
1,Teacher,300,I see that you read the text and you were looking for A different machine different types of machines and tools they use
1,Teacher,300,I see how you got that answer
1,Teacher,300,I can definitely see where you got that because they did send a small machine
1,Teacher,300,"So I can tell that you did the reading and you're really excited to read about the water on the moon,"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I see, I see where you're coming from because you definitely would need a microscope to discover something that's too small to see"
1,Teacher,300,So you were thinking about your own knowledge that you have and what science scientists would need if they were on the moon
1,Teacher,300,Looking back at the text and adding more detail
1,Teacher,300,But I like that now you're thinking about how your you would look through the story to figure out the question that it was asking
1,Teacher,300,"Good work, paying close attention to the details of our story"
1,Teacher,300,I think definitely you could I think just paying close attention to those small details is really important
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I like how you use part of the word partial to break it down into something that you already knew"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I see that you're really getting this idea that there wasn't a lot of ice on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,"I'm really glad that you that this group was able to make some real world connections, based on your past experiences"
1,Teacher,300,That's a really good skill to be able to have
1,Teacher,300,"I see how you saw in the reading that they called them craters, but there was only a little bit of water"
1,Teacher,300,So that's what's called like texts to real world connections
1,Teacher,300,Where we found that from is from outside now
1,Teacher,300,So that's a really good skill to have
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I see how you're using the text and rereading and finding more information that's really great"
1,Teacher,300,So I can definitely see where STUDENT got his answer because like you said the paragraph says that this that the walk
1,Teacher,300,The ice is found in the crater
1,Teacher,300,"so I can definitely see where he found his answer, but other than that"
1,Teacher,300,I like that you went back in the text and dug a little deeper to see if there was more information
1,Teacher,300,And I really like that you brought up that point
1,Teacher,300,You are absolutely right
1,Teacher,300,I like that you went back into the text and you found specific details to share with us
1,Teacher,300,Now let's see some other answers STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,I really liked that you noticed that NASA had sent a small machine
1,Teacher,300,"So I really liked that you went back in and saw some details, STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,And I love how you pull that answer for number two
1,Teacher,300,And I love how just like STUDENT You're using previous knowledge and you're making connections and it's so important
1,Teacher,300,"And I love that answer, because I can see that you noticed that the sentence had a scientific tool in it"
1,Teacher,300,I love how you identify the microscope as a scientific tool
1,Teacher,300,Thank you see that was a much more detailed answer you just added more detail to your first answer
1,Teacher,300,Thank you for that STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,So you wasn't wrong you just added more detail to show your understanding
1,Teacher,300,That was that's a much more specific detailed answer
1,Teacher,300,"They would be able to learn something, because he was very specific in describing what the machine was and what it did"
1,Teacher,300,and I'm sure if someone who has never read this informational texts before if they read your answer
1,Teacher,300,yeah I like how you're thinking very much like what can we do right now with this with this stuff
1,Teacher,300,awesome I love how confident you are in your answer and I love that you're thinking about what these astronauts would need to be in space
1,Teacher,300,awesome great and I love how you're all looking back at the text
1,Teacher,300,"Use the technique core like locating the keywords and to find help you find the answer, but my"
1,Teacher,300,Locating this into the second paragraph
1,Teacher,300,And I'm glad that you are you are ready to read the text that that tells me that you read the text and that you understand the meaning of these facts
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so, um, I know that sometimes can be difficult to remember scientific words"
1,Teacher,300,Answer is not wrong
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, that's great evidence to support it"
1,Teacher,300,You all brought your background knowledge to answer this question and I'm happy that you are able to do that
1,Teacher,300,That's a really good point
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, so I see both of your points"
1,Teacher,300,So I like that answer
1,Teacher,300,"but that's a good answer, because it does refers to something back in the text"
1,Teacher,300,I love how you went back and you found specific you even found even more evidence than you already had that was very impressive
1,Teacher,300,And what it did was it three great things
1,Teacher,300,He told us what equipment they use and what it was called
1,Teacher,300,I love your answer
1,Teacher,300,And you use that to make a complete answer
1,Teacher,300,"And so, so while you're here"
1,Teacher,300,So I like that you found some details in the article
1,Teacher,300,Let me talk to you and STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,"um yeah Okay, I see what you're saying"
1,Teacher,300,awesome thanks for looking back at the text for me STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,"That told us how they were able to discover it, so I had the same question when I was reading it right, I was thinking, how did they find it they can't even see it"
1,Teacher,300,um that's that's good thinking that you that you did not notice that
1,Teacher,300,yeah it does seem like that would be really important
1,Teacher,300,hmm I definitely understood that um you were looking for different
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so we have that ice detail there, which is good that we are adding details"
1,Teacher,300,"that's great STUDENT and i'm glad that you were able to really think deeply about on how you were answering that question, and what you can do moving forward that's fantastic"
1,Teacher,300,And STUDENT you have your hand raised before
1,Teacher,300,"Okay yep and that's that's a valid argument there, but you know, I think"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, so STUDENT I see how you got that from our text and you focused on our fifth paragraph and talked about what what water is made up of"
1,Teacher,300,"I really liked how you pointed out that they did find water and that they found water in craters because that's exactly right that's where they found the water, but I was wondering STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,And you know what's the banner that could be a little bit confusing
1,Teacher,300,"And that's a really great question that's what I bought to STUDENT, but when I read about the"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah but I like even how your mind was thinking about other types of equipment that scientists use that shows that it's something that really interests, you and I really liked it that's where your"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so I hear that you found some specific items from the text"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah so awesome that you found that really specific name for the tool right that microscopic water, you need a special instrument in order to find it but"
1,Teacher,300,Okay cool so I can hear the specific evidence from that you use your response it's clear in the text where you got that from
1,Teacher,300,So just using that one sentence STUDENT and i'm really like i'm really glad that you're making sure that you prove your answer with a point that one sentence you just read you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
1,Teacher,300,"You also made sure that it matched lunar orbit orbiter which has to do with the moon so like I love, how you really use the key vocabulary, to help you find your answer so really great job,"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah it seems like you have a ton of background knowledge about what equipment that astronauts use, could you tell me specifically because we learned something really cool about water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,"but I love, how you both had different opinions and said your evidence, and went there, yes STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,"Perfect so I love, how you identified that like NASA sends a small machine and I think you're on the right track,"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, and I think it's great that you're identifying that as non scientists, we would need a microscope in order to see that water right"
1,Teacher,300,that's a great sentence to point out because that's the whole point of our question right is
1,Teacher,300,I like you added all that in there and accessed your background knowledge um
1,Teacher,300,mm hmm so the miscroscope is the equipment that we might have had more experience with
1,Teacher,300,"You might have seen it or heard of it, so I can see why you would have picked it out from the passage"
1,Teacher,300,"But yeah they had to really, really dig deep to find any particles that they can even look at it, so I love it you like expanded that an understatement That was good"
1,Teacher,300,"But let's look at it again, it said, the water we found was microscopic"
1,Teacher,300,Where you got that answer so she did a really good job of using the text
1,Teacher,300,awesome so that was a great idea of trying to think about what types of tools scientists use
1,Teacher,300,scientists definitely use microscopes
1,Teacher,300,That was a good connection
1,Teacher,300,"Okay STUDENT I see you located a specific piece of the text, that was a good a good move,"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, very good, and this was a tricky one because micro of microscope also has some US so one could think of it as an equipment, so I completely understand why you may have been confused and if"
1,Teacher,300,"makes sense, I completely understand why you could think that"
1,Teacher,300,"lovely and that that makes complete sense, of course, like if we send people to the moon, how will they be able to do that"
1,Teacher,300,"and you guys are already provide the evidence you guys already circle, the evidence and the text that we can use for the answer the questions so STUDENT why don't I just start off with you"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh, I see, so you are making a prediction there right and you're making connections that is excellent job STUDENT However, my question here is particularly asking you to find a text evidence from the reading that I gave you so"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah and you found the text evidence as well, you did an excellent job, all right, you did you did either disappear job excellent"
1,Teacher,300,"awesome well, I really enjoyed your response STUDENT because it really displays the most outstanding aspect of background knowledge and"
1,Teacher,300,"I love the how you identify the word equipment, because that was actually the question you were asking so you're halfway there"
1,Teacher,300,"So I love, how you a thoroughly enjoy the reading I could see that you understand the text and that really impressed me STUDENT that are really, really great job"
1,Teacher,300,"OK, I see that the best part about your best part about your work, is that you understood the text passage correctly"
1,Teacher,300,awesome great job and telling me but small machine wasn't necessarily a small machine and you did a really great job and showing me how you understood the text okay excellent STUDENT go right ahead
1,Teacher,300,"yeah I love how you're telling us about the process find any so locate in the US, or perhaps and"
1,Teacher,300,"I love how utilizing all the words from the question sentence and you're trying to find that word and try to revisiting of the paragraph, I really, really great job so you're correct indeed"
1,Teacher,300,"That appears in twice in this passage right so that's why it was a little bit confusing, but you did a really great job thoroughly reading an entire paragraph and telling me how it actually works to find water good"
1,Teacher,300,"that's awesome he said I love that how you're sharing your answer with us the beginning of the STUDENT and really, really appreciate it, and then you also show me how outstanding aspect of background knowledge that you have an insight as class"
1,Teacher,300,"Sure okay I love that you gave the answer, and it will really impressed me was that you capture the word Microsoft scoping from the passage some important key word there,"
1,Teacher,300,I really liked that you're sharing your process with us yeah go ahead
1,Teacher,300,yeah you're right right right right okay I love that you're sharing all this thoughts great
1,Teacher,300,yeah so I love that you're sharing that with us and the water being discovered that is called the microscopic okay
1,Teacher,300,"yeah oh good good I love that you're giving connections and predictions they're great great I love it all right Oliverin, I would like to circle back oh yeah go ahead"
1,Teacher,300,that's some really good thinking you're absolutely right there STUDENT that you need to be able to see it in order to know that you found it
1,Teacher,300,It's always a great idea
1,Teacher,300,"Oh great, I love that you decided to look back in the text to find out the answer to the question when you weren't sure"
1,Teacher,300,"got it thanks guys, so it tells me that you all really spend some good time examining this article, and looking for answers to this question about the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,That would be easy for you to sign and come back to
1,Teacher,300,I love that a lot of you circle that answer in your text
1,Teacher,300,"That your original answer was close but it wasn't quite right, thank you for noticing that on your own"
1,Teacher,300,so STUDENT used his knowledge of those two words individually to put them together and figure out more about what a lunar orbiter is
1,Teacher,300,that's right i'm really glad that you pointed up paragraph six that's a good point
1,Teacher,300,"I love love love that you brought up that example that's that's what's called an analogy, and it is a great analogy STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,I see how you found the answer in the text you looked for the scientific tool and the text
1,Teacher,300,"It is, I see how you mean that connection"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh well, that's Okay, I see how you got to your answer by talking about what they discovered which was another important part"
1,Teacher,300,yeah I see I see how you came to that conclusion that having water on the moon would be valuable to have for astronauts in space if they can't go by any
1,Teacher,300,but I see how you came to your conclusion
1,Teacher,300,I think i'm I see how you got to your answer
1,Teacher,300,"yeah I see I see how you got to your answer so i'm assuming that the answer you gave me was just no, but the question asks for you to provide some evidence, so I suggest"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh that's really interesting I have not, I have not read that but I see how you could use that maybe as evidence to support your your answer that maybe, yes it is valuable"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, I see how you found found you got to that"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh Okay, so you made a connection between equipment and oxygen tanks interesting"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh, so you have made a connection between deep and pools, and then that makes you feel that there is going to be a lot of water on the moon interesting"
1,Teacher,300,"now let's take deeper STUDENT I really value, how you have made a reference to a machine that was sent to the moon"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, thank you, that was very gracious of you STUDENT and Dave to have this discussion and to clarify this concern"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh OK, so I really value, how you have talked you have thought about all the costs that are going to be involved in this exploration, which is an important component in determining the value of any exploration"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so thank you so much for sharing your responses, I really value how both of you did until I know you have been able to identify reasons why it might not be a good idea for us to invest"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay Thank you so much for sharing your response STUDENT I really value, how you have stated, the costs and benefits and stated your own personal opinion at the end"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, well, I could totally see why you would think that, STUDENT, right because you were looking for equipment, something that's going to help us look at water"
1,Teacher,300,Clearer a little bit sharper in terms of understanding what that small machine is because
1,Teacher,300,"And you talked about equipment, I think a microscope is certainly an equipment,"
1,Teacher,300,Oh yeah that's a good idea
1,Teacher,300,I totally see where you're coming from on the microscope part I think my um
1,Teacher,300,"yep that's true so you're right in that they do use a lot of equipment and oxygen tanks were mentioned in the text,"
1,Teacher,300,"And if not, which component is missing missing I think even did a really good job of identifying which component was missing from his"
1,Teacher,300,And STUDENT I was curious with your response
1,Teacher,300,I thank you first for Providing that response and I love that you use scientific language like saying the word scientific and tool and even saying the word microscope
1,Teacher,300,"yeah so a lot of times, and I love that you're bringing in science STUDENT i'm sure you guys have done some really amazing fun stuff in that class"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so even I like the fact that you're identifying a piece of equipment that's scientists used"
1,Teacher,300,"Ah, I see what you're saying interesting I see your perspective in and you're thinking about what scientists might need as part of the equipment that they need to go searching for the water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so I like the way that you went back to the passage and he looked more closely to see if you could find more information, so there was nothing wrong with your answer before, in that it gave us a hint but"
1,Teacher,300,"And you know, sometimes we do that when we're reading text and that's really great when we're visualizing"
1,Teacher,300,i'm so glad that you were using your visualization skills STUDENT so make sure you go back and revise some of your thinking that you did there okay
1,Teacher,300,yeah I love Thank you that's I love the way that you stated that it showed a new thinking STUDENT yes
1,Teacher,300,"I think that the progression by which you identify those events was very clear, and it may painted such a clear picture for others, so thank you for restating that"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, STUDENT I saw from your response that you really use your background knowledge well and you did a great job using that background knowledge"
1,Teacher,300,awesome so I saw in your answer STUDENT that you did a great job identifying evidence identifying equipment that scientists use to reach the moon
1,Teacher,300,"Oh that's true that's true, but what I see you doing STUDENT is pulling out your background knowledge which is really strong you're doing a great job pulling out that background knowledge"
1,Teacher,300,"I love that critical thinking Farrah I love, looking back at your answer like that awesome so let's as a team has Oliver and Farrah let's as a team go back to the text and i'd like you to, yes STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,"That is so true and I love that you brought in that background information STUDENT that's super important when you're reading a text like this, so great job"
1,Teacher,300,"Hello everyone, I just want to say thank you so much for sharing your answers with me, I can tell by everything that you guys put down that you really understood this passage and done a great job looking in the text, for your answers STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,"that's a great point STUDENT, which is why answering these questions can be kind of tricky"
1,Teacher,300,"But I think we all did a great job really breaking down with this question with asking us for and finding a great sentence that helps us answer this question, so if we want to answer another question"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so you identified a piece of equipment right and I like that you started off with that,"
1,Teacher,300,"I OK, I see how that makes a lot of sense"
1,Teacher,300,Oh really great point STUDENT Farrah with yours on specifically I noticed that you did a really good job naming a piece of equipment and then telling me what it does
1,Teacher,300,"And then for Chris and STUDENT I noticed that you two have really great you know you either side, you have the first part, the second part that's great now we need to work on adding in that missing part"
1,Teacher,300,Right so glad that you were able to pick that up and go back to the question and read it and notice that mismatch between your answer in the question
1,Teacher,300,ooh I like that you're looking for that keyword right
1,Teacher,300,"ooh really great detail with your Farrah I loved how you did all those three steps right, you told me here's a piece of equipment, this is what it does now question to you, does"
1,Teacher,300,"it's in the text right you're exactly right STUDENT great job connecting directly from the text, so this is what we're looking for when we mean finding directly from the text i'm"
1,Teacher,300,"Discover is the action verb that we want to emphasize on for answering this question and i've noticed that, on your answer is like really matches what the question is asked about because"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so yeah you give a specific answer that included the name of the equipment that's really concrete"
1,Teacher,300,I really appreciate how you went back to the text and found evidence to include in your answer
1,Teacher,300,that's a great point
1,Teacher,300,that's a great point STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, great I appreciate how you were looking at the whole story in a really detailed way to pick out that evidence, just like Luis was picking out that evidence and so was Farrah Oliver and STUDENT so"
1,Teacher,300,"Great I love how you're reflecting on the keywords in that question and you realize that you were missing a little part of the question, there"
1,Teacher,300,yeah a lunar orbiter yeah so that's the name of it that's getting more specific and more into the details that the the writer used
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah these are such good guesses right, and that's a great way to use what you already know about the word orbiter to understand what a lunar orbiter is"
1,Teacher,300,"because sometimes readers, even if they don't have all the details, they make a picture in their head and they might update that picture as they keep reading, but they start to form an idea in their head in a picture of what that would look like"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I see what you're thinking there"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I love that you all brought in so many interesting facts that you read about in the article into your responses"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so I think that you guys did a really great job of Combining all of what you found in the text to create the best answer right Luis and Jazmin you guys talked about the small machine called the Lunar orbiter"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, that's awesome and I see you found some great evidence in the text because they do say that, precisely, thank you for sharing"
1,Teacher,300,STUDENT I I love your thinking that you really found the the theme of the text and you're totally on point with
1,Teacher,300,"You also I see how you're connecting your knowledge about astronauts to this article, which is great"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, definitely I see how you're connecting original answer and growing your"
1,Teacher,300,"So you use the text to inform your answer, which is great so i'm"
1,Teacher,300,that's how you feel a great so let's just let's just do like a little thought experiment so even though you don't like writing and maybe that's why you're not being so specific which I can understand
1,Teacher,300,That sounds like a really good strategy and will probably set you up for success next time we're coming up with a problem
1,Teacher,300,I like that you found relationship between the words
1,Teacher,300,"It allows you to kind of visualize maybe even if I don't know what a lunar orbiter is it helps me kind of imagine some type of machine, so thank you for that Thank you"
1,Teacher,300,I think that you you all circled a really important parts of the text that allow us to understand the different sorts of equipment that NASA uses to find water on space
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I think that's a great strategy that you're using so yeah, so I think that is an important part of the question, what blah blah blah like does that or what equipment and then what are we looking for with the equipment"
1,Teacher,300,"Nice, I, like the way that you're using the strategy to kind of pull apart the important parts of the question"
1,Teacher,300,yeah so thank you yeah so I like how you phrase that we're looking for equipment that's used to discover water um and great
1,Teacher,300,"Nice yeah so thank you so you're right, it is equipment, which is what we're looking for and you found it in the third paragraph I like I use the text"
1,Teacher,300,yeah so I definitely like the way that you're going about this about answering this question is you're thinking about equipment and they're thinking about equipment us to discover or find or look for the water
1,Teacher,300,yeah so I also see the Lunar orbiter in paragraph two
1,Teacher,300,"yeah I like how your second half, got a little bit more specific after our conversation"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah so thank you for offering the different functions of different tools, so that was a great revision"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh, I really like that strategy of looking for keywords I think that that can be really helpful i'm i'm actually really happy that you chose to use that strategy"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, well, I think that it's great that you guys have been looking for keywords when I was speaking with STUDENT, he also He also mentioned the same thing, and I think that that's a really great strategy"
1,Teacher,300,"and I really value how, in your answer you guys directly talked about a piece of equipment"
1,Teacher,300,"I agree yeah oxygen tanks, is an important piece of equipment for astronauts so I really like that you included that in your response"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, well, I really value that you talked about a small machine and that you went back into the passage to look for evidence that supports your answer because"
1,Teacher,300,"All right, I appreciate you paraphrasing that and putting it into your own words"
1,Teacher,300,"Great well, I really appreciate how you guys chose to look for a piece of equipment"
1,Teacher,300,"awesome, and so what I really like about what you said STUDENT is this word machine that you mentioned,"
1,Teacher,300,"Great yeah and STUDENT when I read your answer you use the word tool to describe the microscope, and so I think that that's another great word when we're thinking of different types of equipment mentioned"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah great, so I think STUDENT I liked in your original answer, how you mentioned a small machine"
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT you said something interesting you said not yet, and I really like that, because it makes me think that maybe there's more to the story, maybe something might happen, where it might be valuable"
1,Teacher,300,"The scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so it's very good that you guys use textual evidence in the text um, but how do you think"
1,Teacher,300,Oh that's what you were thinking okay cool um
1,Teacher,300,um I really appreciate your active reflection and self regulation
1,Teacher,300,"um you guys located the information in the text very, very well um"
1,Teacher,300,"I think you were, you definitely used some great skills on figuring out okay which in which sentence, did they find water right?"
1,Teacher,300,"And you looked at the sentence that said microscopic and thought , oh microscope"
1,Teacher,300,Of course I love that you advocated for yourself in that way
1,Teacher,300,"that's beautiful I love, how you use that context you use evidence from the reading"
1,Teacher,300,"mm hmm no That was really good using her background knowledge, because it didn't say it in the text, so it was very good"
1,Teacher,300,That was actually good using background knowledge to make connections
1,Teacher,300,"Using the context clues that we use before, when we were analyzing the question you know, using words like investigate and seeing that it's a small machine that they use it's a great job"
1,Teacher,300,Good alright so that's good background knowledge understanding what they found
1,Teacher,300,"so that's actually a good context to as well, using that background knowledge understanding our tools"
1,Teacher,300,yeah and I see how you're answering this question by using your own knowledge rate your own experiences from watching movies and seeing the equipment that's being used
1,Teacher,300,"Both had this inclusion about the microscope right this detail about the microscope, and so I see how you're providing this specific tool to support your answer"
1,Teacher,300,"Great and then STUDENT you've included some great pass knowledge about how water is composed of these two parts, hydrogen and oxygen it's a great time to chemistry that makes sense, with why we need water, we need these perks"
1,Teacher,300,So I see how that connects to what we're talking about here
1,Teacher,300,And I see how your even mentioning other answers like Jazmin's she mentioned it's needed to be
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so I see that what you did is when you were looking at the article you identified words that remind you of equipment right, and one piece of equipment is a microscope"
1,Teacher,400,student didn't exactly answer question about equipment what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,400,student little concerned connect question text look ng back question what's question look ng tell able tell what question 
1,Teacher,400,student water found would microscope study doesn't explain found water 
1,Teacher,400,student wasn't exact answer question student answer would there scientific tool called microscope look really closely water 
1,Teacher,400,student well student answer wasn't necessarily incorrect some really good vocabulary terms weren't completely answering question question sorry pull back 
1,Teacher,400,student however think point doesn't answer directly main question next step after discover d water moon part equipment discover d what 
1,Teacher,400,student correct need microscope look really closely they're asking what equipment scientist discover 
1,Teacher,400,student correct need microscope look really closely they're asking what equipment scientist discover microscope equipment look d really closely water discover water microscope 
1,Teacher,400,student alright student when look back question says what equipment scientist discover water moon while true scientist oxygen tanks probably very often equipment find water moon 
1,Teacher,400,student specific tool used water samples that's what question asking 
1,Teacher,400,student student student response scientist found crater full water moon although correct answer wasn't necessarily answering question understand 
1,Teacher,400,student because asking about equipment what found 
1,Teacher,400,student that's actually really good know about space thing going noticing some responses really pinpointing answering question asked 
1,Teacher,400,student that's what that's what question what equipment scientist discover water moon said things what used discover water moon lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,400,student looking used discover find think another equipment mentioned passage apart from microscope 
1,Teacher,400,student question actually wanting know what equipment used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,400,student student true that's true doesn't answer question while equipment that's what look ng question 
1,Teacher,400,student yeah absolutely kind part moon something caught water doesn't quite answer question about being piece equipment scientist using 
1,Teacher,400,student specific question wants know what specifically used find water wouldn't necessarily like oxygen tanks things like 
1,Teacher,400,student doesn't truly answer question 
1,Teacher,400,guys getting there student almost there main concern three didn't fully answer question stated 
1,Teacher,400,student however knowledge help overall topic specific question makes sense 
1,Teacher,400,student question want make sure student answering what questions asking about equipment expand specifically 
1,Teacher,400,student really focused trying find evidence text answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student help understand question question specifically asking what what equipment discover water equipment help discover water actual equipment discover ng water 
1,Teacher,400,student mentioned microscope which mentioned passage which good just need reread question take step farther because concerned didn't fully understand what question asking 
1,Teacher,400,student that's what found look ng what equipment used discover moon 
1,Teacher,400,student very good correct tool equipment word hand hand together then back question figure what asking specifically 
1,Teacher,400,student didn't talk about equipment 
1,Teacher,400,student while oxygen tank mask suits part equipment question only focusing what discover water moon 
1,Teacher,400,student question asked talk about equipment 
1,Teacher,400,student also student student question student answer equipment well talked about oxygen tanks trying figure which equipment used discover ng water oxygen moon 
1,Teacher,400,student what equipment scientist discover water moon oxygen tanks pieces equipment don't really water moon 
1,Teacher,400,harris good find ng know what machine equipment using then student recognizing know small machine still missing concept what action will seen right 
1,Teacher,400,student another really important part question action 
1,Teacher,400,student question want focus equipment discover water 
1,Teacher,400,student want reread question because don't think fully understood what question asking 
1,Teacher,400,student concerned though question asking specifically water found 
1,Teacher,400,student want reread question because don't think fully understood what question asking because student answer didn't anything equipment just said water found moon 
1,Teacher,400,student true where discover d water question equipment used 
2,Teacher,400,student because look ng specific word equipment 
2,Teacher,400,student microscope used discover water article thinking more general what equipment would used along microscope 
2,Teacher,400,student talking about equipment name where found question more focused equipment 
2,Teacher,400,student question though said what equipment scientist student talking about astronaut 
2,Teacher,400,student concerned question asking what used discover water right we've only mentioned tool that's used once discover d 
2,Teacher,400,student that's great observation would need focus specific question asking asking 
2,Teacher,400,absolutely that's something like student into answer right like correct look ng what question asking 
2,Teacher,400,student question based videos watched youtube videos watch about what read 
2,Teacher,400,want guys take seconds seconds think what word what word jumps when read question word should will help find answer question okay going give guys seconds seconds think about then going someone volunteer okay 
2,Teacher,400,student there different types tool like equipment gear other things right question asking ones will help find water 
2,Teacher,400,student connected student background knowledge text reading right only concern didn't answer question originally asked 
2,Teacher,400,student which what equipment scientist discover water moon think scientist oxygen tanks discover water moon 
2,Teacher,400,student yeah that's actually great background knowledge assignment could also help question being asked 
2,Teacher,400,student student correctthat different types equipment astronaut particular question equipment used discover water 
2,Teacher,400,student specific equipment scientist find water 
2,Teacher,400,student kind need both although really love student answer teach something want answer question 
2,Teacher,400,student just concerned understanding full question because question what equipment scientist discover water moon 
2,Teacher,400,student right talking about question only suggestion suggestion 
2,Teacher,400,student question actually asking what discover water moon while much equipment moon need focus what used discover water specifically 
2,Teacher,400,student what useful important saying split into hydrogen oxygen true doesn't totally answer question 
2,Teacher,400,student read question carefully would no ice ke word equipment scientist discover lunar 
2,Teacher,400,student weren't really thinking about what actually space student right oxygen tanks things like because there oxygen space focusing more water piece versus what space 
2,Teacher,400,student think confused question 
2,Teacher,400,student however what what question asking 
2,Teacher,400,student sure maybe understood question correctly need scientific tool called microscope look really closely 
2,Teacher,400,student student sure maybe understood question correctly need scientific tool called microscope look really closely well need microscope look really closely question look ng name piece equipment scientist discover water moon 
2,Teacher,400,student right look ng actual piece equipment used discover water moon 
2,Teacher,400,student don't think read question correctly either 
2,Teacher,400,student question think need little more specific right 
2,Teacher,400,student that's right that's very good split into parts hydrogen oxygen think student little confused what questions asking 
2,Teacher,400,student lots equipment right that's what there think still little confused about what questions asking 
2,Teacher,400,student right like said know that's look question actually specifically pointing toward what's potential value 
2,Teacher,400,student read water moon valuable right question actually says could valuable some point future 
2,Teacher,400,concern guys want make sure really focusing equipment used scientist find water moon 
2,Teacher,400,student yeah correct that's what wear look ng what used find water 
2,Teacher,400,student water overload along passage concern other students circle word like equipment agree 
2,Teacher,400,student question asking right 
2,Teacher,400,student concerned though question asking would want water moon 
2,Teacher,400,student really what look ng evidence water moon could valuable 
2,Teacher,400,student when look student don't necessarily answer question tell what student getting reading student evidence don't actually specifically answer question then provide evidence then just explain 
2,Teacher,400,student concerned though question asking specifically about water 
2,Teacher,400,student student definitely right about nasa uses much equipment many different things question only asking specific machine equipment used find water 
2,Teacher,400,student true basically just what told student scientist equipment much equipment many different things question only asking specific piece equipment used find water 
2,Teacher,400,student think that's answering question 
2,Teacher,400,student when look back question only asking specifically what machine used find water other machine 
2,Teacher,400,student part question think student missing 
2,Teacher,400,student like said because going take time money question answered think would good investment question water valuable 
2,Teacher,400,student really want reiterate important question really reading asking enough evidence would valuable they're ready 
2,Teacher,400,student because answered whether good investment don't think answer actual question water being valuable think 
2,Teacher,400,student great yeah think that's really solid concern would like make sure understanding what question asking 
1,Teacher,400,student question what equipment scientist discover crater full water type equipment 
1,Teacher,400,right guys want right look question want underline question what think most important word word question 
1,Teacher,400,student mind reading question find ng word think really important 
1,Teacher,400,student want look back question just read want find most important word word think most important question 
1,Teacher,400,student question which most important word pick 
1,Teacher,400,student want look question want find action word because we've underline equipment we've underline water haven't underline action word 
1,Teacher,400,right everybody find action word underline 
1,Teacher,400,student look back question find word question synonym investigate 
1,Teacher,400,student when answering questions need make sure answering question that's being asked okay 
1,Teacher,400,student look back question take student pencil maybe circle important word question 
1,Teacher,400,student concern student answer doesn't really address question given 
1,Teacher,400,student what's really important word question could help find answer take student pencil just underline really important word could help find answer 
1,Teacher,400,student ahead look back question want circle underline word think important question 
1,Teacher,400,student look back question look word will help understand what look ng reading passage 
1,Teacher,400,student ahead look word past question 
1,Teacher,400,look student answer look question student answer actually answered question word same student answer actually answering question while student look ng going over student 
1,Teacher,400,what want just minute want guys look question number 
1,Teacher,400,want guys figure underline pick word question think word important word might help answer question little more depth 
1,Teacher,400,student want look question number find ke word words important might help answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student read text read question what word kind synonyms each other 
1,Teacher,400,student what specifically remember post look what questions asking what text 
1,Teacher,400,student saying what specifically 
1,Teacher,400,student that's right look question once reread question remember student posts look question what specific information look ng 
1,Teacher,400,student student reading test information student question trying answer scam look question then read answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student want start using scale after circle student evidence want back think deeper about question what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,400,student what might word question help answer question what's word 
1,Teacher,400,anybody word want look 
1,Teacher,400,student what's another word could list 
1,Teacher,400,student then told student need scientific tool called microscope look closely could find nasa found moon 
1,Teacher,400,student because what just described moon 
1,Teacher,400,student right back reread question take student highlighters slowly student look ng equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,400,student want look question more time there word don't understand circle 
1,Teacher,400,student ahead circle word student sure know meaning 
1,Teacher,400,student look word share student ideas what think word mean 
1,Teacher,400,student okay what word find text helped answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student there word circled underline text 
1,Teacher,400,student yeah suggestion when reading prompt answering questions would read questions first then read passage 
1,Teacher,400,student could little more specific question answering 
1,Teacher,400,student think about word question think about student then will discuss what word 
1,Teacher,400,student there's word very important question name word question might important 
1,Teacher,400,student okay want look student paper want circle word question circle maybe word from question i'll give about seconds 
1,Teacher,400,student will just look when student finished when student circled student word 
1,Teacher,400,student that's right okay which which most most important word question word what think 
1,Teacher,400,student i'll give seconds think some synonyms word similar each word what's another word equipment what's another word discover 
1,Teacher,400,right look like finished what guys think what another word equipment 
1,Teacher,400,student close think might need look question little maybe rephrase sometimes feel like helpful question word understand what really asking 
1,Teacher,400,student what want want circle action word question main action word verbs question 
1,Teacher,400,student verbs question i'll give about 
1,Teacher,400,student seconds want take student pencil just circle action word question 
1,Teacher,400,student right what think should after look ng answers kind look question kind determine some ke word question 
1,Teacher,400,pull highlight look evidence back text y'all look d question first question answered where think what think word question 
1,Teacher,400,student okay within question just like talked about first session what think some word there need pull before even worry about answering question 
1,Teacher,400,student what want just couple minutes look back question want take student pencil circle highlight some important word feel important something stands 
1,Teacher,400,student even questoin like sure miss teacher what about word confusing minute stop just minute take some time look back question circle okay 
1,Teacher,400,student talk about question because wanting first look about what they're asking then we'll talk about text make connections about first want look about question what's about question something about 
1,Teacher,400,think when circle helps bring back because went even deeper because just asked word student used went deeper explained little more connection text helps when circled 
1,Teacher,400,student what going break into even smaller groups because liked look d some s savannas answers want work together right look more into what circled what connects text questions 
1,Teacher,400,student okay what going right going same strategy we've taught before about important make connections find what question's asking help back text first what want student pencil highlighter look back over find important word words feel don't understand okay 
1,Teacher,400,okay question want there anyone here question found there's word student sure about what means there anyone here because want make sure understand question 
1,Teacher,400,need water survive right there anything here right right student also raise student hand about there concerned about question there some word weren't sure about same word evidence different 
1,Teacher,400,student then sometimes when look ng questions really careful because sometimes they'll trick throwing little something could answer clever make sure watch make sure student look ng what could best answer give 
1,Teacher,400,throwing little something could answer clever make sure watch make sure student look ng what could best answer give student what's student question 
1,Teacher,400,student when answer question want really careful answering right question 
1,Teacher,400,student might great build knowledge answer questions might even asked when comes being successful student especially other tests might from other teachers want make sure look ng question that's being asked address ng just response make sense 
1,Teacher,400,look back question proposed what question what question trying answer would anybody like reread 
1,Teacher,400,okay great thank anybody word would help look back text determine what exactly look ng 
1,Teacher,400,student word important word going give clue what going look ng answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student when given question look word 
1,Teacher,400,student once decided student answer then need 
1,Teacher,400,student plug back need look back question make sure makes sense make sure restate student answer fully answering question look ng word reading text really closely think you'll able better 
1,Teacher,400,student looking ke word student question well 
1,Teacher,400,student want either circle star word think most important question 
1,Teacher,400,what want before start take minute look back question number guys going look ng word question important word could look back student text answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student student answer closer correct answer what what ke word number what word 
1,Teacher,400,want guys first start look ng back question want either underline highlight circle word question need help answer question take about seconds look back over question want circle word question 
1,Teacher,400,student word question need help answer question take about seconds look back over question want circle word question 
1,Teacher,400,student underline word equipment discover 
1,Teacher,400,student what word underline question help answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student what some main main word sentence just second here back question maybe underline what think main parts question what need 
1,Teacher,400,student could find question student paper circle points circle like word question could lead text find correct answer 
1,Teacher,400,student want talk about what think correct answer would maybe think student right right going give seconds timer going right 
1,Teacher,400,yeah student would where would like like adjust student response think really good answers just want make sure 
1,Teacher,400,student student fully understanding what questions asking because could makes difference from present future 
1,Teacher,400,student want focus exactly what question asking answer completely 
1,Teacher,400,student always good bring background knowledge question isn't asking specific answer focus what asking where find test text 
1,Teacher,400,student when going answer question want make sure answer parts question student specific possible 
1,Teacher,400,student good reread question back find word help answer need 
1,Teacher,400,before share answers student want independently minute circle word word think important question want circle then want minute share back what circled 
1,Teacher,400,student looking back first question want independently minute want circle word important word question think important want minute then come back 
1,Teacher,400,student suggestion would through look equipment like then we'd able find what machine used 
1,Teacher,400,student yeah maybe look equipment like different pieces equipment 
1,Teacher,400,what suggest what guys next time look question look reading ke word 
1,Teacher,400,student when student reading question from about something want make sure look want know what creates question what information going look ng 
1,Teacher,400,student want look question want find choose really important word want work student partner want person left starts talking first then want person right after want work minutes want look choose really important word question 
1,Teacher,400,student want person left starts talking first then want person right after want work minutes want look choose really important word question 
1,Teacher,400,student where find word passage alright minutes student partners 
1,Teacher,400,student when back want both reread question student selves what kind equipment question asking about what equipment used where could find information text 
1,Teacher,400,student student identified main idea passage very good back question reread please attention first half question make note what kind answer look ng 
1,Teacher,400,student background knowledge subject want back question identify what kind equipment question asking about what scientist equipment look action word question 
1,Teacher,400,student identify what kind answer question asking yeah 
1,Teacher,400,student while would like maybe reread question then reread text review student answer student answer actually answers question okay 
1,Teacher,400,student clarified question asking opinion really good able read question helpful able read question understand what specifically asking 
1,Teacher,400,student look question going find ke word most important word question before answer 
1,Teacher,400,student pick pencil like circle word think most important word question 
1,Teacher,400,student please remember circle most important word helped find specific place passage answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student okay please read question going find important word question before answer 
1,Teacher,400,student okay please read question going find ke word most important word sentence help best answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student pick pencil circle word think most important question word going circle will help find specific place passage answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student want underline circle ke word word think important i'll give minute

1,Teacher,400,student once that's also very important that's good information when answer questions need make sure answer what's being asked 
1,Teacher,400,before start answer question would like dissect guys figure what asking what need look order answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student would like break down question figure what because once figure what's what accent figure answer question what's answer question convincing evidence water moon could valuable 
1,Teacher,400,student what some important word need attention question important part sentence 
1,Teacher,400,thank sharing student said evidence evidence important what's another important piece sentence upon part sentence need order answer question specifically 
1,Teacher,400,student looking more piece sentence more piece question 
1,Teacher,400,thank student helping when reading question what some what some strategies prac ice before even answer question what some strategies prac ice make sure answering question that's being asked 
1,Teacher,400,should look most important parts someone raise hand student 
1,Teacher,400,student when answering question want look important word 
1,Teacher,400,student another strategy when answering questions really focus word question circle word question action word most important word text question here once word raise student hand 
1,Teacher,400,student like circle word question action word most important word text question here once word raise student hand 
1,Teacher,400,student circle some ke word 
1,Teacher,400,student tell what question asking what question asking 
1,Teacher,400,student know what question actually asking what what 
1,Teacher,400,student okay first want attention question attention word details tell where main word question 
1,Teacher,400,student know like attention another word question 
1,Teacher,400,student know another ke word under question help answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student what main word question order answer attention question know what exactly thing asking 
1,Teacher,400,student want reread think about what most important part question circle okay 
1,Teacher,400,everybody take second think about what most important part question 
1,Teacher,400,student take second reread question circle most important part 
1,Teacher,400,student important look language question look ng oxygen tank going help find water 
1,Teacher,400,student identify word focus when back into text word help answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student tool helps focus make sure find ng information reading take minute take student pencil circle what think most important word question that's going help know what look what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,400,student take student take student pencil circle what think most important word question that's going help know what look what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,400,student what's important word take minute circle student question going what circled 
1,Teacher,400,student really instead going straight text really know understand question before turn text someone tell exactly what question asking what asking find 
1,Teacher,400,student don't really solid understanding what being asked said what question asking find article read 
1,Teacher,400,student yeah really good think about when reading question says used discover water moon look 
1,Teacher,400,student looking ke word like 
1,Teacher,400,student going give about little less minute just read question circle what think most important word question 
1,Teacher,400,student right want identify object look ng from question circling equipment 
1,Teacher,400,student underline last part scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,400,student think most important thing already most important equipment going underline equipment 
1,Teacher,400,student underline discover water moon right 
1,Teacher,400,look question what word that's really important everybody look question student piece paper find word think important answering question 
1,Teacher,400,student what think most important word question what word kind giving clues answer want 
1,Teacher,400,other word question gives clue going help figure what look ng what other word think going help figure exactly what question asking student 
1,Teacher,400,student will describe particular question order make sure fully answered want make sure student answering specific question that's being asked 
1,Teacher,400,student look little clues text question 
1,Teacher,400,student strategy just question pick word question tell what should look ng 
1,Teacher,400,student right question sort what know when when analyze things read look specifically what question asking 
1,Teacher,400,student like treasure hunt right what could take second circle word question student look ng 
1,Teacher,400,student want reread prompt want circle most important word prompt just take minute ahead 
1,Teacher,400,student student right small need microscope concern student response need piece equipment made initial discover right 
1,Teacher,400,student what exactly question asking maybe some what already know about space answer question 
1,Teacher,400,right back question hand everyone want when unpacking question look specific details what look ng 
1,Teacher,400,student want focus action word question 
1,Teacher,400,student cells ahead look back first question what want like really like would super helpful could later 
1,Teacher,400,student what want first find most important word question look back question then want read pick most important word will help answer question take seconds then we'll come back 
1,Teacher,400,student look back question then want read pick most important word will help answer question take seconds then we'll come back 
1,Teacher,400,student what want circle more three word phrases think most important question remember should something leads student response take minutes 
1,Teacher,400,everyone circle word question think most important word focus when answering 
1,Teacher,400,student look water discover d student totally right article think little more deeply about question 
1,Teacher,400,student what's important word question 
1,Teacher,400,student actually like take moment take look question just independently student self read over question maybe circle some word phrases think might help answering what question asking i'll give minute 
1,Teacher,400,student look back question tell what think question asking tell maybe just three word what question asking 
1,Teacher,400,student great completely correct want focus pieces question want focus first word which equipment second which discover 
1,Teacher,400,student what's specific part question need look think about 
1,Teacher,400,student follow thread correct response 
1,Teacher,400,student what suggesting should order answer look some ke word ke word some co text clues will help find find question 
1,Teacher,400,student what some word some co text clues will help answer what's main part question what look ng question 
1,Teacher,400,student ce cool cool good good know what look ng equipment break down little more what some word some word relate equipment will help find 
1,Teacher,400,student focus really building answer identifying scientific equipment 
1,Teacher,400,student then explain equipment used discover water moon then once student gotten student answer 
1,Teacher,400,student work text find something that's going give even more specific information about small machine 
1,Teacher,400,student excellent would add d student answer would make ice specific 
1,Teacher,400,student mentioned small machine better answer would tell what machine 
1,Teacher,400,student asking question where asking like what equipment scientist then telling circle student answer student answer needs come from what just read 
1,Teacher,400,take second write answer student 
1,Teacher,400,instead student answer being circled same student could said instead just saying circled same 
1,Teacher,400,student student student pretty much right could went little more into detail small machine 
1,Teacher,400,student more specific look back paragraph find rest more detailed part answer 
1,Teacher,400,student just need find little more evidence 
1,Teacher,400,student would like ahead start look ng back through passage word discover 
1,Teacher,400,know said same answer student could find text circle know where student answer came from would awesome 
1,Teacher,400,student just want little more specific what tell 
1,Teacher,400,student hear gave little more specific name instead just saying small machine called microscope 
1,Teacher,400,student looking into find ng first time that's would change student answer just little make little more clear 
1,Teacher,400,student look 
1,Teacher,400,student change think about student answer change answers question 
1,Teacher,400,student just needed just little more depth right 
1,Teacher,400,student able come same sort answer give more details might able better inform student reader who's teacher 
1,Teacher,400,student smaller amount able kind rephrase answer think student know interesting perspective there 
1,Teacher,400,student think little more specific student response said oxygen tanks yeah absolutely they're oxygen tanks there could tell maybe another piece equipment nasa used article help discover water moon 
1,Teacher,400,student help discover water moon right because that's ends 
1,Teacher,400,student very specific when writing 
1,Teacher,400,student words seem tough making sure student reader knows exactly what saying long don't confusion know student just smart know 
1,Teacher,400,student think kind change sets 
1,Teacher,400,student right kind want readers know talking about scientist specifically could nasa could scientist used want either think would convey student meeting 
1,Teacher,400,student yeah remember that's what trying information what ring correct 
1,Teacher,400,student maybe next time when student could could more specific said nasa sent small machine 
1,Teacher,400,student could clarify student statement little more right well that'd good strategy 
1,Teacher,400,student however also specific text evidence just like student learned can't just stop nasa said small machine right 
1,Teacher,400,student keep reading what small machine very specific student answer sure answer every single part question using evidence from text student 
1,Teacher,400,student would help into little more detail about 
1,Teacher,400,student pull things together 
1,Teacher,400,student just need because drink water 
1,Teacher,400,student waters moon that's convincing evidence valuable just rework student answer 
1,Teacher,400,student long answer what student answer 
1,Teacher,400,student just water split into parts hydrogen oxygen because allows people breathe make rocket fuel 
1,Teacher,400,student just need just hydrogen used rocket fuel oxygen help people breathe just need little student answer 
1,Teacher,400,student just need little more just idea 
1,Teacher,400,student lost train thought just explain little more think going able useful just because they're smaller amounts okay 
1,Teacher,400,student look tool inside text because every time story reading questions about answers always going passage okay 
1,Teacher,400,student there place text mentions what hydrogen oxygen used 
1,Teacher,400,student exactly exactly more detail better student answer 
1,Teacher,400,student lunar orbiter right nasa sent small machine called lunar orbiter think could clarified student answer 
1,Teacher,400,student take little answer make great answer make make more sense make concrete 
1,Teacher,400,student about restate question form answer 
1,Teacher,400,answer grows yeah really short word answer created whole sentence where anybody reading answer identify what talking about what learning about 
1,Teacher,400,student make student answer very clear clarify 
1,Teacher,400,student misconceptions 
1,Teacher,400,student just write down questions then word student paper student ipad just rearrange restate question 
1,Teacher,400,student when answering questions probably should refer back reading given find answers need 
1,Teacher,400,student would answer convince water valuable could valuable moon 
1,Teacher,400,student perhaps could word d saying water valuable could valuable 
1,Teacher,400,student very specific answer because specific name text 
1,Teacher,400,student student wrote nasa sent small machine that's very good maybe need investigate look little further what machine called 
1,Teacher,400,student strategy could work together student help figure what could okay what strategy look back text know where look text 
1,Teacher,400,student good student right broken down into hydrogen oxygen little further answer also find what broken down oxygen hydrogen along student evidence 
1,Teacher,400,student right maybe include student answer microscope 
1,Teacher,400,student looking more specifically want find exact name machine kind able explain what machine student answer right just wanted some more detail 
1,Teacher,400,student when look ng answer want look details will tell water going valuable 
1,Teacher,400,student want give like question think valuable student details together valuable because surviving 
1,Teacher,400,student rocket fuel split apart 
1,Teacher,400,student maybe also passage remember student reading passage help figure would valuable 
1,Teacher,400,student yeah that's what student said said could useful because broken down could extended answer little more said what valuable about breaking down 
1,Teacher,400,student said what valuable about breaking down 
1,Teacher,400,student that's only thing would done 
1,Teacher,400,student suggest write even though almost same student 
1,Teacher,400,student friends would like know understanding what student reading write down student word thank 
1,Teacher,400,student important make sure read information before answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student look nasa sent small machine what small machine called want turn somebody next 
1,Teacher,400,student really important when answering questions even though found part question stem student answer student look around make sure that's total 
1,Teacher,400,student student answer nasa send small machine student right small machine called lunar orbiter student answer almost there just need little more information okay 
1,Teacher,400,student yeah sometimes works sometimes look around small machine small machine answer question because also small machine what 
1,Teacher,400,exactly because whenever explanation whatever evidence from article sentence evidence sentences explanation describe student 
1,Teacher,400,student right name machine give specific details 
1,Teacher,400,student name 
1,Teacher,400,student always look back text refer when trying find answers 
1,Teacher,400,okay look ke word equipment find text where talks about type equipment could machine word like machine tool anybody find where says machine tool anyone find text student 
1,Teacher,400,student student teacher people know like fewer 
1,Teacher,400,student need restate question answers 
1,Teacher,400,student student right equipment that's reason need very specific answer isn't 
1,Teacher,400,student when restate question kind take some some some word from question student answer 
1,Teacher,400,student equipment scientist discover water moon lunar orbiter gives reader more information know nothing about topic helps learn more about doesn't 
1,Teacher,400,quite details yeah yeah guys want some more details others definitely make sure details 
1,Teacher,400,student whenever look ng passage really want focus text al evidence text al evidence when question refer back student passage find exact answer close possible 
1,Teacher,400,student student right nasa equipment just very specific identifying which equipment make sense 
1,Teacher,400,student always want prove student answer always know right 
1,Teacher,400,possibly guys understand important text evidence help answer student questions more importantly justify student answers 
1,Teacher,400,student want detailed possible when answer questions information need response 
1,Teacher,400,student well answers kind what just went over some text support ng details prove answer what 
1,Teacher,400,student when talked about could break down into hydrogen oxygen talked about makes student water valuable 
1,Teacher,400,student another when talked about being heavy carry also makes very valuable moon don't carry 
1,Teacher,400,want make sure answering question fully descriptively possible help better explain student 
1,Teacher,400,student correct make sure answer question when answer student question make sure student details 
1,Teacher,400,student should look ng something more specific what small machine called would more solid answer just small machine when student reading says what equipment scientist discover water moon should name machine 
1,Teacher,400,student looking specific question says what equipment scientist discover water moon could should name machine 
1,Teacher,400,student correct response like just just conversation someone like super excited about moon asked what kind machine discover water then student answer should more specific answer student conversation like would name machine tell used that's kind answer should look ng answering 
1,Teacher,400,student answer student conversation like would name machine tell used that's kind answer should look ng answering attacks 
1,Teacher,400,student text informative text list some machine says names machine right before talk about discover okay would more solid answer 
1,Teacher,400,student answers question better okay 
1,Teacher,400,student know student found piece equipment used little more specific here 
1,Teacher,400,student next time when asked question instead saying answered like student neighbor make sure write answer instead saying found same thing friend want hear what found 
1,Teacher,400,student well always good detail answers more detail provide answer better stronger answer 
1,Teacher,400,student think could wrote answer differently include question 
1,Teacher,400,student student answer incorrect because third paragraph states exactly what said maybe add ng exactly what they're look ng also help student other friends maybe student working partners 
1,Teacher,400,student that's only thing would student what correct student teacher want little more specific could just name actual machine called lunar orbiter student very just little more specific 
1,Teacher,400,student yeah want specific evidence from reading want pull straight shows found answer question student thing think will help really pull answer what student reading 
1,Teacher,400,student thing think will help really pull answer what student reading 
1,Teacher,400,student instead just agreeing student maybe think about agree student what pick d agree could still agree student then tell reason agree 
1,Teacher,400,yeah okay rewrote answers might minute ahead think about might agree student 
1,Teacher,400,student need help getting started could equipment scientist used discover water what then write student response 
1,Teacher,400,student little more spits specific naming what machine 
1,Teacher,400,alright student want make sure going back text find answer 
1,Teacher,400,student what sort wondering could little more specific perhaps identifying what small machine could possibly little more specific would then know want choose perhaps lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,400,student little more specific would then know want choose perhaps lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,400,student able look idea answer lunar orbiter would little more specific 
1,Teacher,400,student think back into text look mention equipment scientist used underline could then build student answer we'd complete full answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student usually best when answer question just stick question save extra information discussions like when right 
1,Teacher,400,student think could little more specific response because there lots small machine world right 
1,Teacher,400,student back into text type small machine sent give name when respond question being specific answer 
1,Teacher,400,student student answer said nasa sent small machine would like tell little more about small machine look ng text what could expand give more details what small machine 
1,Teacher,400,student expand 
1,Teacher,400,student give more details what small machine 
1,Teacher,400,student just would like build more upon student answer 
1,Teacher,400,student don't starting know agree lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,400,student whenever student opinion student opinion student opinion just what think always best face what think facts read 
1,Teacher,400,don't want opinion most time just something make because necessarily true student 
1,Teacher,400,student alright talk about what found what student found just maybe read just look ng what equipment scientist find water talk about student self another student clue i've never read text i'll read student question know exactly what student talking about when answer 
1,Teacher,400,student talk about student self another student 
1,Teacher,400,student clue i've never read text i'll read student question know exactly what student talking about when answer 
1,Teacher,400,student what would helpful 
1,Teacher,400,student yeah tell something about what else what identifies machine 
1,Teacher,400,student yeah student name probably machine name well 
1,Teacher,400,student just need make specific you'll ahead just make sure student bringing from text 
1,Teacher,400,student love when students make question alright equipment scientist discover water moon then into student answer 
1,Teacher,400,student what you'll example going restate question there convincing evidence water moon could valuable 
1,Teacher,400,student would there convinced student answering question student reciting question there convincing evidence 
1,Teacher,400,student sorry there convincing evidence water moon valuable there restated question answered question 
1,Teacher,400,student then would text what says water split into parts hydrogen oxygen then would explain that's important 
1,Teacher,400,student only thing would like just restate question 
1,Teacher,400,right could there enough evidence water moon guys then student student saying student just also bringing question into 
1,Teacher,400,student then need evidence support student answer then found evidence from number that's perfect just provide evidence then explain 
1,Teacher,400,student found evidence from number that's perfect just provide evidence then explain 
1,Teacher,400,student yeah that's good train thought we'll just restate question answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student would need more evidence student evidence bringing water moon hard would also talk about water moon would good 
1,Teacher,400,student find 
1,Teacher,400,student best place start word question then going back headings look underneath heading answer 
1,Teacher,400,yeah all figure going oxygen going hydrogen okay y'all talk about minute know just second okay 
1,Teacher,400,okay heard think about text though okay student question student hand just second 
1,Teacher,400,student correct want more specific good answer could said nasa sent small machine called lunar orbiter student right track 
1,Teacher,400,student then more specific answer could name what machine called 
1,Teacher,400,student talk about student answers could improved answers more specific 
1,Teacher,400,question using word guys underline ke word 
1,Teacher,400,student student said scientist equipment like oxygen tanks could more specific passage 
1,Teacher,400,student okay need more specific when answering questions 
1,Teacher,400,want guys look answer question want read over student answer want think student self could more specific when answering question 
1,Teacher,400,student student right nasa send small machine give more specific best answer could nasa sent small machine gave name 
1,Teacher,400,student looking something specific that's when would want refer back text when says what equipment scientist discover water moon when would want look back into text find student answer because already know various tool like said mask 
1,Teacher,400,student when would want look back into text find student answer because already know various tool like said mask 
1,Teacher,400,student microscope stuff like then there's specific tool states text would want look back text find student answer 
1,Teacher,400,student just want little deeper into text maybe help student fellow students figure some more details about what nasa find water moon 
1,Teacher,400,want help each other understand text know word everybody thinks want guys reconstruct student answer give little more detail about equipment specifically helped discover water 
1,Teacher,400,thing help future answer question teaching about question somebody reading passage just like guys would best explain would full picture what guys reading 
1,Teacher,400,student sure also remind teaching even from student perspective student answer question then give little more detail student answer will help more concrete answer 
1,Teacher,400,student because must always refer text 
1,Teacher,400,student detail just add d critical that's valuable fact when break down oxygen hydrogen astronaut breathe oxygen oxygen hydrogen fuel second part just gave that's valuable that's great answer 
1,Teacher,400,student second part just gave that's valuable that's great answer 
1,Teacher,400,student student first answer correct add d detail kind gets even more valuable what mentioned 
1,Teacher,400,student well question asked according text what text answer questions find evidence might right from what know from student going nasa text order answer question 
1,Teacher,400,student yeah want look back story make sure student answering whole question stories like student friend want keep look ng back student answers 
1,Teacher,400,then student really liked student answer also thinking about microscope would loved give another example maybe add d mars venus thought definitely like student answer 
1,Teacher,400,student understand maybe next time same idea someone could just little more felt like didn't wanted bring 
1,Teacher,400,student could like bring example 
1,Teacher,400,they're using microscope like when student reading text think they're using microscope think helped find crater think made easier look water moon just student thought process student 
1,Teacher,400,student would loved just said what machine just talked more about what machine 
1,Teacher,400,student just said what machine just talked more about what machine 
1,Teacher,400,student what could saying nasa sent small machine called lunar orbiter just like said previously then kind 
1,Teacher,400,student what's going moon 
1,Teacher,400,student might slip through cracks just very keep simple like nasa said lunar orbiter investigate 
1,Teacher,400,student yeah like should fill blanks just make sentence little meteor 
1,Teacher,400,student okay always rephrase student sentence nasa sent little over there know student using information that's text sound good 
1,Teacher,400,student always write even scientist microscope 
1,Teacher,400,student sometimes there still things small cannot better 
1,Teacher,400,student just want little further student explanation some evidence from what read about 
1,Teacher,400,student just want student answer little more specific sometimes mean writing more stuff 
1,Teacher,400,student when student answering discussion questions text read just incorporate something specifically from text text mentions lunar orbiter would good thing include student response add tion what said about find ng crater water they're like suits masks oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,400,student something specifically from text text mentions lunar orbiter would good thing include student response add tion what said about find ng crater water they're like suits masks oxygen tanks make sense 
1,Teacher,400,student yeah really good answer student definitely correct want elaborate little more nasa sent small machine what small machine called 
1,Teacher,400,student right when term lunar orbiter using evidence support response that's something want make sure student because shows 
1,Teacher,400,student also want make sure when student answering question student specifically using evidence examples text gives 
1,Teacher,400,student awesome make connections student background knowledge order answer question want make sure comes from text 
1,Teacher,400,student however when look question asks what equipment found crater water would similar student where just want make sure student using specific piece evidence support what said when said there's crater water 
1,Teacher,400,student what could student response could add d something like another article read said there could base moon then connect article reading idea could 
1,Teacher,400,student pretty good would maybe just little about like said they're carrying water ships an more because they're keeping base they're going build moon 
1,Teacher,500,student somebody tell want student hands raised what mean find evidence 
1,Teacher,500,student when talking about evidence thinking about what word text reading help answer question 
1,Teacher,500,student might look word leading word like called like no ice called before that's great example word might might 
1,Teacher,500,student alright student explain what evidence 
1,Teacher,500,student when look ng evidence need find certain specific things text will help 
1,Teacher,500,student want look story where find answers 
1,Teacher,500,want think about what differently next time when student answering student next question make sure specific answer look ng because guys really close just needed look more closely text 
1,Teacher,500,student next time student reading tough question help look action word question because that's going help know specifically what student look ng 
1,Teacher,500,student means means student word what heard paragraph 
1,Teacher,500,student when read something three step process when student trying answer question 
1,Teacher,500,student first time scan right just read really fast know just know blah blah blah more flow through 
1,Teacher,500,student then look student question look what really asking then read 
1,Teacher,500,student when read text read question need correlate need together what they're actually asking 
1,Teacher,500,student okay what find answer thank 
1,Teacher,500,student strategy talked about 
1,Teacher,500,student want good something keep over over over 
1,Teacher,500,student remember when look d question found keyword 
1,Teacher,500,student remember what asked find 
1,Teacher,500,student ke word help answer question 
1,Teacher,500,student always find identify ke word really understand what student look ng back text 
1,Teacher,500,student used passage provided find answer didn't just background knowledge made sure back find something text 
1,Teacher,500,student right know what that's perfectly fine sometimes come across scenarios where know think know much maybe take moment read back over i'll come back okay 
1,Teacher,500,student important read right 
1,Teacher,500,student make sure when student reading passage take holiday highlight important facts when student question 
1,Teacher,500,student highlight important word student question back find passage 
1,Teacher,500,student remember small machine like went back reread student text figure what machine actually called 
1,Teacher,500,student sometimes read things quite absorb everything always good idea back reread student text underline important information details help answer questions about afterwards keep knowledge 
1,Teacher,500,student strategies going today look some word question 
1,Teacher,500,student student context 
1,Teacher,500,student restate question 
1,Teacher,500,student restating question listen carefully word being used such question 
1,Teacher,500,student answer question using race method restate question 
1,Teacher,500,student look really closely word question 
1,Teacher,500,student remember when reading question look really closely word word need look text 
1,Teacher,500,student remember when look ng question always look important word 
1,Teacher,500,student then look text same word find answer 
1,Teacher,500,student often when read will tell sequence will tell what happened first then what happens next important when answering questions look gone order story 
1,Teacher,500,student because want want prove even just reading want evidence find evidence 
1,Teacher,500,student don't want just agree good agree people also good know think something 
1,Teacher,500,student when given questions we'd like find answers very specific because more specific more sense make later 
1,Teacher,500,student think we've kind learned lesson when reading information attention just assume 
1,Teacher,500,student make sense know know different things about space also need make sure really reading information being given 
1,Teacher,500,student well think about what student text student paper 
1,Teacher,500,student looked very closely text look d word 
1,Teacher,500,alright look back question thinks explain student what what ke word find text question 
1,Teacher,500,student what need definitely through student passage then highlight important details always want highlight student headings student headings 
1,Teacher,500,student because details there could give some really good text evidence that's what need want find details along student question could possibly support student answer 
1,Teacher,500,student maybe like chronological timeline events text broke down text circled like what happened first then what happened then what happened might able find more suitable answer question 
1,Teacher,500,student built student answer appreciate build student answer more specific narrowed down core knowledge look ng then said okay what machine what 
1,Teacher,500,student okay much like student earlier just trying look question specifically boiling down just core components 
1,Teacher,500,student sometimes takes little work everything together called summarizing want able together word come best answer 
1,Teacher,500,student really like race format going restate question going answer question going cite evidence then going explain evidence 
1,Teacher,500,student example when read what equipment scientist discover water moon think restate question into answer then fill blank spots questions asking 
1,Teacher,500,student example might equipment scientist used discover moon would then leave answer blank then could back text determine what exactly what equipment 
1,Teacher,500,student think next time need strategy look ng ke word really specific 
1,Teacher,500,student very important highlight ke word give best answer 
1,Teacher,500,student sometimes okay back reread find answer 
1,Teacher,500,exactly what would like goes everyone just student when student answering questions what already know well specific information from what reading 
1,Teacher,500,student great that's good strategy find ng clues ke word help find student answer 
1,Teacher,500,student what think include after using background knowledge answer student question after student background knowledge what think what strategy think help promote learning answering question 
1,Teacher,500,student told before what read no ice word water question scanned through look d things related water 
1,Teacher,500,student great really liked response because explained student self really well said read question what question asking then found explained really great response 
1,Teacher,500,there part article haven't really heard before what uses kind like tool maybe tool because realm academic language using lunar orbiter microscope student 
1,Teacher,500,student definitely student imagination really like visualize situation before giving student answer that's really good strategy answering questions 
1,Teacher,500,student perfect response used direct language from text used specific vocab provided reasoning very specific perfect response good 
1,Teacher,500,student find evidence need quotes from text like student quoted said paragraph three could look text find where reading 
1,Teacher,500,student responses want academic language 
1,Teacher,500,student like student connecting student background knowledge help great student using student notes help further understand text that's excellent strategy good readers 
1,Teacher,500,student then provided reasoning which can't survive without water very important backup student answers reasoning 
1,Teacher,500,student hearing read text details evidence help support student thinking 
1,Teacher,500,student student connecting details another part text explain could valuable 
1,Teacher,500,student you'll finish okay move question same strategy find ke word question okay 
1,Teacher,500,student student using student background knowledge definition orbiter able apply student answer 
1,Teacher,500,student when answering comprehension questions like really need into text make sure using information 
1,Teacher,500,student going give some sentence starters going help really solidify learning reading strategies 
1,Teacher,500,student going help really solidify learning reading strategies 
1,Teacher,500,student think about thinking thinking strategy when reading text answering question 
1,Teacher,500,student change student answer what student also wrote what thinking 
1,Teacher,500,student she's going back text find ng specific piece evidence used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,500,student remember restate what strategy 
1,Teacher,500,student really good thing just able when rereading student able where found student answer able find another part could 
1,Teacher,500,student that's excellent strategy look ng text pull ng ke word 
1,Teacher,500,think that's excellent strategy anyone think about when reading text think 
1,Teacher,500,yeah student great right glad much background 
1,Teacher,500,student when student trying answer question just locate word paragraph 
1,Teacher,500,student when read want make sure backing what saying information from text 
1,Teacher,500,that's great that's great segue what wanted guys next because just gave specific evidence what question said analyze pick d answer based specifically that's great process 
1,Teacher,500,student when drawing prior knowledge things complex reviewing couple times important 
1,Teacher,500,student important look back passage determine what best answer question always helpful circle word question 
1,Teacher,500,student mean student 100% right using background knowledge when answer questions especially questions about text always want make sure answers evidence found directly from text 
1,Teacher,500,student moon want make sure answers questions incorporate components 
1,Teacher,500,student question same concepts talked about right look ng question figure what asking want answer another question like question 
1,Teacher,500,student what going suggest when start first thing before start reading actually look closely question 
1,Teacher,500,student guess other strategy student going want think about question they're asking then student trying make some connections between concepts student reading 
1,Teacher,500,student help make some inferences want read little more closely meaning material before 
1,Teacher,500,student yeah really important skill scientist need able look text quotes information from text support answers 
1,Teacher,500,anyone else strategy when going back revise answers 
1,Teacher,500,student okay look ng evidence text circling evidence great strategy make sure answering question completely 
1,Teacher,500,student going thinking about what strategies revise answers strategies next time come across question like 
1,Teacher,500,student love look ng ke word that's really strong reading technique 
1,Teacher,500,student that's good yeah thing about thing about reading ke word sometimes authors will synonyms word mean same thing when thinking about discover definitely found 
1,Teacher,500,student think little specificity putting little effort save trouble revise several times 
1,Teacher,500,student sort no ice through talking student mean also add d some specificity student answer think helped more full response 
1,Teacher,500,student think that's totally great strategy think question provide student answer just look over student answer more time then make sure answers matches question you'll good 
1,Teacher,500,student fantastic really appreciate something student just took little parts world lunar orbit draw conclusion from really look ng small details here 
1,Teacher,500,student question when look ng answer important think about ke word also helpful create sentence wouldn't necessarily student response 
1,Teacher,500,student think ice though when read text scan text specific pieces equipment then when write answers ever asked tell what paragraph found student able point exact part text 
1,Teacher,500,student think student just when just read beginning paragraph 
1,Teacher,500,student yeah exactly could specify small machine that's strategy response questions 
1,Teacher,500,student well case add ng name would sufficient talking more about strategy specifying student responses instead just like add ng name into 
1,Teacher,500,student student strategy absolutely right locate ke word question find text 
1,Teacher,500,thank okay student feel like student changed student student process working through text questions 
1,Teacher,500,student whatever think okay student response hasn't changed okay changed just curious what thinking take moment before conversation thought after conversation thought 
1,Teacher,500,want guys make sure when look always look ng back text because look small machine just like what student said nasa sent small machine into space right �
1,Teacher,500,student think what need take away when answering reading comprehension questions really need focus going back reading article detail maybe highlighting text annotating text really understand detail what learning learning 
1,Teacher,500,student okay from reading text today using tool going back rereading text circling important information broaden student understanding future topic discuss whether space farming 
1,Teacher,500,student student knowledge restating question next lesson 
1,Teacher,500,student when answering questions like what's something need make sure when answering question 
1,Teacher,500,student like shared student opinion next time when share student opinion just just told understand little more because

1,Teacher,500,student next time answer question like what want hear actual equipment using 
1,Teacher,500,student right next time question text going student background knowledge read text going read text then student background knowledge 
1,Teacher,500,student right that's good that's school right because don't know everything don't know everything probably good student student text next time write 
1,Teacher,500,student right what things next time when student quite sure student answers there 
1,Teacher,500,student right went back read what want next time teacher asks little more information 
1,Teacher,500,student wondering what you'll next time question like arrive answer like what's something next time when question like 
1,Teacher,500,student hearing idea repeat answer future think might great write down process notebook 
1,Teacher,500,student that's right that's excellent when forward answering comprehension questions dev's amazing example where restate question sure evidence from text 
1,Teacher,500,student next time answering another question about certain text maybe different question about particular text know exactly what 
1,Teacher,500,student okay next time question like that's asking about text what going 
1,Teacher,500,student next time question like where look text going talk about strategy 
1,Teacher,500,student type same student going reference back text order find evidence 
2,Teacher,500,student next time kind question please specific answer question okay 
2,Teacher,500,student specific name things described okay 
2,Teacher,500,student every single time using information from text order answer discussion question want make sure referencing back text even though might know about subject reading already 
2,Teacher,500,student even thinking beyond today what some tool future text like 
2,Teacher,500,student when thinking about answering questions like later future think what said about details very important 
2,Teacher,500,what about when guys thinking about what parts future when reading question like think there's word understand better anything about about space under about moon understand better water 
2,Teacher,500,student what think would next time question like 
2,Teacher,500,student what think will stick next time student answering similar question 
2,Teacher,500,student what want know add d completely question would able find text here going give question need write down question ahead write down question ready 
2,Teacher,500,student what learn right what take away from process making inferences making connections what learn about might able apply next time encounter question like 
2,Teacher,500,student next time question asking about text what will 
2,Teacher,500,student suggest next time question like read through text look specific word might help more rounded answer 
2,Teacher,500,student figured full answer what could next time don't much revising
