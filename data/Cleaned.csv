1,Teacher,100,student student answer around think there multiple answers here right we've identified equipment actually 
1,Teacher,100,student well that's great thing answer multiple answers sometimes want circle many 
1,Teacher,100,student didn't wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student student right 
1,Teacher,100,student didn't wrong 
1,Teacher,100,only person student only person said valuable kind told thought valuable 
1,Teacher,100,student okay definitely need oxygen when space don't because don't oxygen there like here 
1,Teacher,100,student student student answer wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student need microscope able 
1,Teacher,100,student true could there's enough water 
1,Teacher,100,well student don't think student answer wrong sweetheart 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wrong honey student student right 
1,Teacher,100,student scientists found crater full water moon absolutely correct 
1,Teacher,100,student want back student answer need scientific tool called microscope look really closely very very true 
1,Teacher,100,student looking equipment definitely found crater full water 
1,Teacher,100,student like connection made there right 
1,Teacher,100,student thank that's great glad could clarify 
1,Teacher,100,student that's right weren't wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student would probably need microscope they're going test water 
1,Teacher,100,student orbiter good okay said said small machine student exactly right here 
1,Teacher,100,student don't student answer isn't wrong 
1,Teacher,100,guys said scientific tool called microscope which that's answering question right 
1,Teacher,100,student equipment don't 
1,Teacher,100,yeah there's usually passage guys read didn't equipment used very very right that's good connection student good 
1,Teacher,100,student okay i've microscope really closely 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wrong student right used microscope look very closely okay student right about 
1,Teacher,100,student right small machine correct 
1,Teacher,100,student right back look text equipment space correct 
1,Teacher,100,student exactly that's text very good looking text pulling awesome 
1,Teacher,100,student once look student nasa send small machine which correct about well 
1,Teacher,100,student exactly exactly think three read question understood text 
1,Teacher,100,student right correct 
1,Teacher,100,text very good finding pulling text student 
1,Teacher,100,think whatthink guys read text understood text 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wrong student answer right because talking student answer especially talking about equipment said need some microscope look water moon right 
1,Teacher,100,student very good that's very good answer 
1,Teacher,100,actually oxygen things there moon discover water that's something really goodthank student 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope very good very good there other equipment no ice there other microscope 
1,Teacher,100,absolutely absolutely guys seem hitting 
1,Teacher,100,think student really well kind identifying part haven't talked much about that's know found crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,important part very good identifying kind like main idea article reading just question might necessarily trying there student talk 
1,Teacher,100,student discovered water right nose 
1,Teacher,100,student would better answers question wanted make sure perfect might include 
1,Teacher,100,student closer there like growth definitely getting closer there starting student sort response need right 
1,Teacher,100,student right good that's what trying really want look specific about what student trying look when respond something right 
1,Teacher,100,student small machine right perfect what small machine called 
1,Teacher,100,student student both right which good thing that's great about working groups participate contribute 
1,Teacher,100,right here where couldn't because wouldn't ability look closely student good couldn't moon without student student both right just didn't the-- 
1,Teacher,100,student well good liked student answers scientist found crater full water moon using what 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely correct errors very valuable when student talking about space raft because takes force stuff right don't heavy water 
1,Teacher,100,okay student student answer wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student earlier asked didn't understand student answer wrong student answer never wrong 's original answer scientist 
1,Teacher,100,student that's very good point would need something help find what looking when looking water 
1,Teacher,100,would like student said scientist found crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer correct need microscope order things very very small smaller what student human eyes 
1,Teacher,100,that's good that's correct student 
1,Teacher,100,student that's correct wouldn't need order protect while they're outer space moon 
1,Teacher,100,student both correct what machine y needed locate find able article from moon 
1,Teacher,100,student they're necessarily wrong 
1,Teacher,100,really good answer student really good answers 
1,Teacher,100,student there's nothing wrong student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student there could 
1,Teacher,100,student small machine correct 
1,Teacher,100,student small machine collect water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student answer said think scientific tool called microscope look really closely right student 
1,Teacher,100,student correct microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student ma'am keep student answer same 
1,Teacher,100,good good right student question 
1,Teacher,100,student well that's correct certain equipment moon 
1,Teacher,100,student okay 's answer about moon okay astronaut things around oxygen order moon correct 
1,Teacher,100,thank student absolutely none wrong correct extent thank being here lunch 
1,Teacher,100,student student exactly right also says second paragraph could breathe oxygen suits oxygen tanks when they're moon when they're space 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah student exactly right here thank added comment 
1,Teacher,100,student correct 
1,Teacher,100,student scientists part 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope used there other some other equipment also used probably just piece equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student maybestudent answer correct 
1,Teacher,100,student okay thank that's great thing circle 
2,Teacher,100,student right saying student student answer wrong 
2,Teacher,100,student garden okay 
2,Teacher,100,student rightly said machine 
2,Teacher,100,student small machine that's right 
2,Teacher,100,student student answer wasn't wrong question 
2,Teacher,100,student wrong student still correct will need microscope want water 
2,Teacher,100,student would awesome very good thinking 
2,Teacher,100,student correct 
2,Teacher,100,student one's answer wrong 
2,Teacher,100,very good student student answer needs little further 
2,Teacher,100,student well wrong 
2,Teacher,100,student think maybe long r search future could possibility 
2,Teacher,100,student okay student right equipment part question 
2,Teacher,100,student water other things like garden like said 
2,Teacher,100,guys right there 
2,Teacher,100,student yeah no ice pointed oxygen tanks really cool answer gave there more information always learn didn't know before know name orbiter 
2,Teacher,100,student well definitely helped because know space there's oxygen tanks help breathe equipment 
2,Teacher,100,student well right 
2,Teacher,100,student because send small machine called think probe something 
2,Teacher,100,student could then guess would would good investment because would could grow things side planet 
2,Teacher,100,student mean he's wrong 
2,Teacher,100,perfect excellent okay student 
2,Teacher,100,student okay several types equipment okay thank 
2,Teacher,100,student exactly 
2,Teacher,100,student okay sorry believe student answer wrong student everybody's answer 
2,Teacher,100,student student answer very right microscope 
2,Teacher,100,figure answers student need scientific tool called microscope look really closely correct miss student need microscope look very closely 
2,Teacher,100,equipment student correct things before start explorations right student 
2,Teacher,100,getting little topic here student said astronaut oxygen tanks space shuttles types equipment student right about 
2,Teacher,100,would would really useful student what about 
2,Teacher,100,student right will take time money might worked student 
2,Teacher,100,student think well water because looking what what equipment used find water there other important word 
2,Teacher,100,student didn't student answer isn't wrong just wanting find kind even more about nasa sent small machine correct 
2,Teacher,100,good that's right that's right sorry missed student student answer student sent mall machine that's very good student exactly right that's tool looking 
2,Teacher,100,student correct 
2,Teacher,100,student using microscope find water just look water found 
2,Teacher,100,microscope everybody where student found paragraph three 
2,Teacher,100,good everybody hear while student reading 
2,Teacher,100,wonderful answer anyone else want answer 
2,Teacher,100,student student answer correct because microscope tool equipment very broad when comes machine tool what refer 
2,Teacher,100,student yeah student answer wouldn't wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student cute yeah don't think wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student answer wrong student 
1,Teacher,100,student small machine well don't think student wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer incorrect 
1,Teacher,100,student right what could also include scientist tool called microscope discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer correct 
1,Teacher,100,correct equipment student both correct oxygen tanks that's specifically what hadn't used find water crater 
1,Teacher,100,student going student response wrong means okay 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe student answer right answer nasa send small machine look what written actually look number there 
1,Teacher,100,student didn't student answer wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student said small machine lunar orbiter type machine student answer right 
1,Teacher,100,student student answers wrong 
1,Teacher,100,right different types equipment scientist guys right oxygen tanks space suits equipment equipment help discover water 
1,Teacher,100,student really good stating scientist found crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student could something drink could something could stay clean good 
1,Teacher,100,student student right great understanding what water even valuable moon 
1,Teacher,100,yeah drink bake great guys thank 
1,Teacher,100,student great answer 
1,Teacher,100,student mean small machine student student still correct 
1,Teacher,100,student well would definitely know really come handy know scientist astrologers might perhaps moon 
1,Teacher,100,student would definitely know perhaps provide sort know sort some greenhouses might able construct moon perhaps scientist could even perhaps grow vegetables something grow moon 
1,Teacher,100,just likebrought about space he's looking into knows just about equipment about space student 
1,Teacher,100,student when looked over student answer there some great points brought about wasn't wasn't wrong what 
1,Teacher,100,great that's good connection loved student response about word used word hydrate hydrate student said 
1,Teacher,100,student like response because that's something student proving whenever asked about garden what makes think could student telling 
1,Teacher,100,student thought great idea look glad looked detail about hearing shoes because heavy 
1,Teacher,100,student great there's dealing article because that's like equipment right like read about equipment passage 
1,Teacher,100,student okay good response 
1,Teacher,100,okay know what student sounds like good point maybe there there's probably more just thing used find water 
1,Teacher,100,student gave really good answers 
1,Teacher,100,student student student answer wrong paragraph three talks about water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able think that's where thinking would need tool walk microscope types things moon help understand more 
1,Teacher,100,student nothing's wrong student paragraph 
1,Teacher,100,student pretty good definitely lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,student that's absolutely true 
1,Teacher,100,student right student answer seems pretty solid 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer's don't think student answer incorrect student answer's student answer correct 
1,Teacher,100,yeah that's great point student would oxygen tanks stuff actually explore moon yeah would need equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer necessarily wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student student student answers necessarily wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student that's definitely true scientist find crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student okay glad student no ice 
1,Teacher,100,student went right into said scientist want crater some water moon true 
1,Teacher,100,think guys 
1,Teacher,100,exactly right equipment tool guys correct stating both things microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student small machine both equipment tool 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely correct appreciate sharing fact article today discusses importance oxygen 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer drink water stay hydrated very good answer mentioned here text 
1,Teacher,100,student extremely extremely close 
1,Teacher,100,student saying saying wrong didn't machine y think whenever talked about question find student actually went wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student weren't wrong after 
1,Teacher,100,student wrong 
1,Teacher,100,very good like student said equipment like oxygen tanks moon able survive moon 
1,Teacher,100,student didn't wrong student answer isn't wrong 
1,Teacher,100,okay well going second rightwrong just going there different answer okay right student share what underline paragraph 
1,Teacher,100,student said needed tool called microscope look really closely true 
1,Teacher,100,student exactly exactly need special tool called microscope little microscopic whatever ends being case microscopic amounts water 
1,Teacher,100,student essence kind both correct 
1,Teacher,100,student reality sure teacher would count wrong included every 
1,Teacher,100,student know lunar order microscope just about anything don't think counted wrong because technically correct 
1,Teacher,100,student every little moon find water technically correct 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah would based text here they've used different equipment discover there water moon 
1,Teacher,100,good student exactly right look paragraph three will fact says need microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student fact microscope part answers right microscope 
1,Teacher,100,will student student answer right 
1,Teacher,100,student suppose large polar crater right okay student answer correct equipment there deposit 
1,Teacher,100,student okay test hear about might need microscope view water molecules right 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wrong 
1,Teacher,100,okay could water student 
1,Teacher,100,student love found microscope used find water 
1,Teacher,100,student wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student said 100% correct said nasa send small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student everybody's answer correct 
1,Teacher,100,student don't think student answer necessarily wrong small machine 
1,Teacher,100,guys gave answers very valid 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah good answer 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's very well eloped answer 
1,Teacher,100,student long gathered information about values then student answer correct whether think 
1,Teacher,100,just going student just want start really enjoy student answer really picked from text 
1,Teacher,100,student really picked object which microscope basically kind described what used outside text using language really appreciate 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah student answer right scientist find crater full water moon student right 
1,Teacher,100,student that's awesome student then help figure couple questions 
1,Teacher,100,glad group kind help follow prompt question answering glad student here right 
1,Teacher,100,student nailed absolutely much equipment science nasa play like lasers jealous thumbs 
1,Teacher,100,love know much prior knowledge about space yeah appreciate know think you'll bring whatever group student 
1,Teacher,100,student glad glad hear think will contribute student knowledge 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah happy hear already

1,Teacher,100,good well means help think student background knowledge going very helpful group student 
1,Teacher,100,student well really glad feel like good understanding space just just talk really about answer real quick excited hear what share though whenever student turn 
1,Teacher,100,glad student really excited learn about space student 
1,Teacher,100,student well completely understand tell from student answer know things about space because talked about oxygen tanks tell know about space just want help drill specific answer question okay 
1,Teacher,100,student well would awesome didn't know taught something 
1,Teacher,100,don't think should group well glad student group because maybe help some questions answered glad student here 
1,Teacher,100,really like fact knowledge about because tells student probably really interested space student help understand 
1,Teacher,100,student well know what because know means help rest don't know much 
1,Teacher,100,student well will really help knowing some things because might able teach some things don't know 
1,Teacher,100,student even that's ice thing about because know different information where know little more maybe teach some things along okay 
1,Teacher,100,student know about space 
1,Teacher,100,such awesome information proud look information student free time can't wait share information rest student when back 
1,Teacher,100,student right love know there's oxygen tanks ice thumbs that's awesome love know about oxygen 
1,Teacher,100,sure student could probably tell more share information together 
1,Teacher,100,student then you'll able help explore little more about what what we've read about 
1,Teacher,100,student know know about space know really help here 
1,Teacher,100,student that's awesome love know because very very helpful necessary astronaut there 
1,Teacher,100,student that's wonderful well maybe you'll able help answer question little differently think could student listening ears maybe help answer question better sound okay

1,Teacher,100,well student that's exactly need here need here help help 
1,Teacher,100,awesomewell thanks much joining really need group today since know about space okay thank 
1,Teacher,100,student science expert 
1,Teacher,100,okay maybe there something don't know would like learn will grateful after student learn thing 
1,Teacher,100,student there 
1,Teacher,100,really cool maybe should tell about another student about everything there 
1,Teacher,100,student seems really awesome 
1,Teacher,100,student student astronaut that's know about space 
1,Teacher,100,that's good maybe today another student share something learned from student 
1,Teacher,100,maybe share something know student 
1,Teacher,100,good well even happy hear sound confident student knowledge there here good knowledge share being group doesn't mean don't necessarily know about maybe student going helping student classmates learn about 
1,Teacher,100,student that's very exciting sounds like some first hand experience really glad little circle here because that's great getting some more perspective like 
1,Teacher,100,that's incredibly exciting would hope that's case water here could help future exploration glad guys listening topic trying expand knowledge know student visit nasa very excited 
1,Teacher,100,that's awesome help other kids about once just chill minute 
1,Teacher,100,okay awesome what student background knowledge which going help answer question because background knowledge already understand topic that's great 
1,Teacher,100,awesome student used background knowledge able infer based information coming from passage scientist need lots equipment that's awesome
1,Teacher,100,awesome student student also able reference student background knowledge help deeper into passage 
1,Teacher,100,awesome student able background knowledge know infer from everything tells passage here nasa scientist using equipment agree 
1,Teacher,100,what know about space know help rest group what know 
1,Teacher,100,okay mister student that's good point glad know about space 
1,Teacher,100,student that's okay maybe help help someone else later wait okay 
1,Teacher,100,student well wonderful glad know about space maybe friends don't maybe help teach some things about space 
1,Teacher,100,student would good thing 
1,Teacher,100,well wonderfulstill learning more information about space going teach friends hopefully during group anybody else questions maybe help help 
1,Teacher,100,student very good like connected student experience going nasa help understand reading text better that's great experience really cool 
1,Teacher,100,student thanks sharing student astronaut sure know there's always more learn reading finding more details text always learn more

1,Teacher,100,student that's where find student answer okay always remember experience 
1,Teacher,100,wellglad part group maybe share some student 
1,Teacher,100,student knowledge help expand learning space 
1,Teacher,100,student okay some prior knowledge space travel right 
1,Teacher,100,student that's really cool what learned there they're very scientific studies 
1,Teacher,100,student well maybe help others 
1,Teacher,100,ties because sometimes personal experience helps understand what readingwhen reading student seen things nasa helps visualize know more about that's great thing share student anyone else experience similar 
1,Teacher,100,student good sometimes already know something think always learn more about maybe could student classmates maybe don't know need student help 
1,Teacher,100,student well maybe benefit others listening offering some suggestions

1,Teacher,100,student maybe could help 
1,Teacher,100,well just like last time something contribute group going hang tight maybe contribute some more what think 
1,Teacher,100,student you'll able share student knowledge 
1,Teacher,100,student good every time learn something continue growing learning going listen friends okay thank student input glad know about space learn from right 
1,Teacher,100,student very good background information know know about space 
1,Teacher,100,student okay going student 
1,Teacher,100,student background knowledge okay we've talked about background knowledge help 
1,Teacher,100,student more information about what learning okay 
1,Teacher,100,student well think don't know exactly everything quite always learn more some student knowledge from what know about space help 
1,Teacher,100,student really 
1,Teacher,100,rightthat's sort what student said right that's great student using student background knowledge awesome 
1,Teacher,100,well help teach others really need still group help help understand little better 
1,Teacher,100,great was-- i've seen some equipment that's very neat thank much student 
1,Teacher,100,student that's okay well always learn things about topics help know help learn more about 
1,Teacher,100,well really need stay group help like information things okay 
1,Teacher,100,student help helper 
1,Teacher,100,student would neat when that's only four years away 
1,Teacher,100,student awesome know extra stuff just trying learn about water know much more student going some equipment student 
1,Teacher,100,student well know liked student response scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well maybe help help other students understanding space pull from details from text just reaffirm student knowledge what student prior knowledge 
1,Teacher,100,student okay alright well glad know information 
1,Teacher,100,student there's things need whenever into space that's very fascinating able visit nasa 
1,Teacher,100,student that's great cultural experience gives little insight into some prior knowledge move forward student science classes 
1,Teacher,100,student astronauts scientist kinds equipment certain materials wear when into space because such unknown area want safe possible 
1,Teacher,100,student when things nasa able some space suits some tool equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student right super jealous nasa 
1,Teacher,100,maybe help student partner'sthink would great add tion group 
1,Teacher,100,student well that's really great that's that's awesome know about space maybe conversation 
1,Teacher,100,student like said scientist oxygen space survive 
1,Teacher,100,student glad know stuff about oxygen tanks things like will help 
1,Teacher,100,well maybe help some understand things better being group then 
1,Teacher,100,student that's awesome always good when background knowledge pull 
1,Teacher,100,student that's great know stuff what like help other students learn more would like 
1,Teacher,100,student help some other students we'll student contribution help help other students well 
1,Teacher,100,student know about some equipment nasa uses 
1,Teacher,100,right student you'll able share some information maybe learn from student friends okay 
1,Teacher,100,student right student said same thing rightwhat something said scientist 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well glad know about space 
1,Teacher,100,student think both great using student outside resource different things student experienced student life related think that's awesome wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe even help others learn more about science sort explore strengths within type knowledge 
1,Teacher,100,student well that's that's that's really cool know sort idea sort special inroads know student know first hand knowledge some might actually come know sort handy help somebody goes kind understand material 
1,Teacher,100,student glad know about space because need knowledge help especially questions today glad brought about space because that's here today 
1,Teacher,100,okay student brought about space glad that's good point 
1,Teacher,100,different some things different school right learning differently guys done great looking more into because some student knowledge student read about nasa help things like help partners alright back question 
1,Teacher,100,student that's awesome information because know what help today about learning about importance 
1,Teacher,100,thank student because know make some great connections about student because know shared information about things done work 
1,Teacher,100,student could confirm about probably told right
1,Teacher,100,that's great student know what gave great idea want each little piece paper 
1,Teacher,100,student okay some some good found tion space when cover more about space seems like you'll able help some student classmates right 
1,Teacher,100,okay maybe maybe forward maybe i'll group leaders okay 
1,Teacher,100,think means probably could share rest group about some student experience nasa maybe could talk about here little could tell some more interesting facts 
1,Teacher,100,okay maybe student could leaders when comes some little more knowledge about space okay 
1,Teacher,100,think know know about space don't think would make even better group help rest maybe could learn from each other 
1,Teacher,100,student know much about space maybe share some student classmates 
1,Teacher,100,student obviously shows student understanding space that's really cool 
1,Teacher,100,student i've never nasa that's really cool experience 
1,Teacher,100,student okay read aloud right read because know everything about space already 
1,Teacher,100,student love wish could nasa very away 
1,Teacher,100,student think that's really cool love experience about space know there's different types equipment work together 
1,Teacher,100,student know could tell student answer really enjoy space know oxygen tanks space explore there 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah lunar orbiter like talking about that's super cool 
1,Teacher,100,would like student knowledge already know share other students group okay 
1,Teacher,100,student response know quite maybe actually help teach other students here 
1,Teacher,100,student think think student help learn some stuff 
1,Teacher,100,well thank letting know student 
1,Teacher,100,student hopefully kevin unless tell little about experience there well 
1,Teacher,100,student student very enthusiastic about space enjoy 
1,Teacher,100,student well definitely think would help stuck around maybe help encourage student classmates learn little more even learn little more student self 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe understand everything help some student classmates 
1,Teacher,100,student like said think planning building base moon 
1,Teacher,100,student that's referencing text believe right about 
1,Teacher,100,whoo that's fabulous maybe help understand even more about space stay group might able help 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe help some other students because some students might first time learning about space 
1,Teacher,100,student could actually help next question 
1,Teacher,100,needs things student being astronaut okay we'll start over here student 
1,Teacher,100,student well awesome glad know about space maybe should share some other things student friends today while talking okay

1,Teacher,100,student whoa whoa what respond question 
1,Teacher,100,student okay want share what thought water valuable resource 
1,Teacher,100,yeah that's reason anybody other reason thought water valuable resource 
1,Teacher,100,never know student what think okay 
1,Teacher,100,student what water valuable resource 
1,Teacher,100,student hear some student responses 
1,Teacher,100,anyone else want share wrote 
1,Teacher,100,good studentdidn't want want share
1,Teacher,100,student read something different similar

1,Teacher,100,good right student student turn 
1,Teacher,100,alrightstudent best look through text going come back okay student what student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student about 
1,Teacher,100,student well there's multiple pieces equipment they're right what student original answer build 
1,Teacher,100,student what student answer remind 
1,Teacher,100,alright student student turn remind what student answer question number 
1,Teacher,100,student sorry when hydrogen while 
1,Teacher,100,student asked question what equipment scientist discover water moon what student answers 
1,Teacher,100,student wants share first 
1,Teacher,100,anybody else like share what would change answer 
1,Teacher,100,student what would change student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student what would change student answer 
1,Teacher,100,would anybody else like share what would change answers 
1,Teacher,100,student because already went yesterday 
1,Teacher,100,student want share what attend student interview 
1,Teacher,100,student want some things know years before 
1,Teacher,100,don't around tablestart then will on student

1,Teacher,100,student first 
1,Teacher,100,student ahead 
1,Teacher,100,right perfect which student wants speak first about what equipment scientist used discover water moon student 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah what said student answer what tell 
1,Teacher,100,student going look going told student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student could tell what think 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe 
1,Teacher,100,student what student answer tell 
1,Teacher,100,student repeat student answer 
1,Teacher,100,anybody want explain answer question initially 
1,Teacher,100,awesome okay looking responses anyone just raise student hand anyone would anyone like share response 
1,Teacher,100,spotsince small group think just comfortable maybe sharing 
1,Teacher,100,student mind tell what tool need 
1,Teacher,100,student which what like- 
1,Teacher,100,want share student sentence really quick studentwell 
1,Teacher,100,student perfect what's student answer okay 
1,Teacher,100,student what 
1,Teacher,100,anyone know answer question 
1,Teacher,100,anyone else want share answers 
1,Teacher,100,student okay hear 
1,Teacher,100,student perfect wants share answer first 
1,Teacher,100,student what student answer hear more time 
1,Teacher,100,student wants share answer first 
1,Teacher,100,student read student answer more time please 
1,Teacher,100,student read student answer please 
1,Teacher,100,student going call first what when answer question 
1,Teacher,100,student tell what responded question 
1,Teacher,100,student tell what answered what student answer 
1,Teacher,100,today student could tell what equipment scientist discover moon could read student answer 
1,Teacher,100,alright student tell what answered what said 
1,Teacher,100,student tell what said 
1,Teacher,100,guys tell little about what think equipment look like student 
1,Teacher,100,student sounds great want start 
1,Teacher,100, student that's that's totally correct think we'd agree microscope would look water really closely although think about what happens before point right 
1,Teacher,100,student know exactly equipment used discover water moon right think each like piece then just just needed microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student like couple people just circle microscope that's great example there multiple tool like just pointed come from things 
1,Teacher,100,student need microscope look really closely things what scientist used find water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student semi right could went into more detail small machine small machine called lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,student very close 
1,Teacher,100,student exactly like student thinking what keeps water together passage 
1,Teacher,100,student partially correct need microscope however that's didn't just send microscope moon 
1,Teacher,100,student well partially correct equipment sent machine called lunar orbiter able across ground surface moon surface check deposit 
1,Teacher,100,student then once figured there 
1,Teacher,100,student deposits very small water then microscope make sure what thought there okay microscope actually gave evidence 
1,Teacher,100,student there water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student then tool used microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student completely wrong will send small machine really doesn't 
1,Teacher,100,student that's said student student right track 
1,Teacher,100,student okay said student meet scientific tool called microscope look really closely right microscope piece equipment 
1,Teacher,100,yeah sure okay student also right scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,valuable okay agree valuable word that's right going look more thing more other word question student could tell what word another word circled 
1,Teacher,100,student scientist found crater full water moon absolutely true that's absolutely something reading 
1,Teacher,100,student okay there's pieces equipment actually looking here 
1,Teacher,100,student kind version other slits think about 
1,Teacher,100,student wouldn't needed pieces equipment actually figure there water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student equipment microscope piece scientific equipment correct 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's right 
1,Teacher,100,student awesome okay yeah would used equipment would oxygen they're moon astronaut moon right 
1,Teacher,100,student well enough that's right astronaut correct 
1,Teacher,100,student well okay pieces equipment correct 
1,Teacher,100,okay read student answers think very good points everyone think little more about what question about example question what question 
1,Teacher,100,student says nasa sent small machine right enough question sent small machine look better word answer question 
1,Teacher,100,student okay said nasa send small machine right think read little 
1,Teacher,100,student think even better think that's great response think make amazing response question asking what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,that's rightwhat kind learn from student here learn looking middle ground between both both pretty much gave good answer gave 
1,Teacher,100,student really really good almost exactly where want still make couple improvements there close thank student 
1,Teacher,100,student that's right piece puzzle right that's what talking earlier mentioned microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student know what that's correct statement wrote down need microsoft skype look something that's really small when back look question 
1,Teacher,100,student look student answer scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student that's very knowledgeable point 
1,Teacher,100,that's very critical tool when learning together group that's awesome dead 
1,Teacher,100,student okay track find right answer going deeper 
1,Teacher,100,student right small machine that's what using discover where water 
1,Teacher,100,okaystudent think scientist used microscope look very very closely 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wrong totally right either 
1,Teacher,100,would almost there student would because question very specific meaning what piece equipment said small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student examples equipment just particular moment 
1,Teacher,100,student okay nasa good point question 
1,Teacher,100,student sort right send machine 
1,Teacher,100,student said scientist equipment like oxygen tanks equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student really close sure 
1,Teacher,100,student obviously true statement right can't live without water 
1,Teacher,100,student well microscope definitely equipment used space like because 
1,Teacher,100,student okay getting there 
1,Teacher,100,okay great okay reread over text becausestudent really close answer 
1,Teacher,100,student well yeah that's what just there 
1,Teacher,100,student that's true couldn't crystals investigate without small machine right 
1,Teacher,100,student tools used some observation some research 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe there's something back text could find some more 's information student information work together come full more complete answer 
1,Teacher,100,student okay that's that's part answer could more space more room 
1,Teacher,100,student okay good that's good start student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student good start 
1,Teacher,100,student well completely wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student okay yeah understand really close 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah looked really close microscope weren't exactly wrong there just more specific answer yeah good 
1,Teacher,100,student that's very interesting take actually first read through answering question thought same thing 
1,Teacher,100,student because would 
1,Teacher,100,student wrong okay just need elaborate little more okay 
1,Teacher,100,student right things question about what equipment scientist discover water moon they're moon know they're using oxygen tanks stuff like what need find about water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student nasa sent small machine didn't sent astronaut space make sense 
1,Teacher,100,really like what said nasa send small machine right direction want everybody look text 
1,Teacher,100,student polar crater student part answer right 
1,Teacher,100,student student piece 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah sound like agree oxygen tanks when they're space moon think what trying figure 
1,Teacher,100,student well student right need microscope look water 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer necessarily wrong just little deeper make student answer more detailed just little better what right what great start 
1,Teacher,100,student said nasa sent small machine correct send student small machine order discover water 
1,Teacher,100,student that's good need 
1,Teacher,100,student oxygen tank maybe used breathe 
1,Teacher,100,student okay find 
1,Teacher,100,student craters water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer incredibly wrong headed right direction would definitely need microscope because water 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer scientist found crater full water moon article found crater some water moon didn't full water 
1,Teacher,100,student mhmm good student answer just needed little more whole small piece answer 
1,Teacher,100,because student just responded thinks knows just about everything aboutwant tell really enjoyed reading student answer because talked about water split said split into parts hydrogen oxygen correct 
1,Teacher,100,student okay yeah student right scientist would oxygen tank breathe space 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah maybe just little more attention exact question correct student response just didn't specifically answer question 
1,Teacher,100,astronauts didn't oxygen oxygen tanks like student said 
1,Teacher,100,yeah okay looking student responses will student probably closest getting correct answer student response 
1,Teacher,100,student sounds filming crater full water moon okay find crater water 
1,Teacher,100,student necessarily 
1,Teacher,100,right student nasa send small machine student almost 100% right 
1,Teacher,100,student right okay good maybe microscope isn't what used discover 
1,Teacher,100,because look listen look student answers student said scientist found crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student that's entirely true find water some places 
1,Teacher,100,microscopes discover things just like guys said tool help discover things 
1,Teacher,100,student what tool scientist used microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student think both right fact scientific tool just need clarify what tool 
1,Teacher,100,right small machine great student 
1,Teacher,100,student moon isn't ready live student absolutely right 
1,Teacher,100,student tools scientist just make sure student reading question what specific equipment used discover water moon okay 
1,Teacher,100,student okay would would correct there's definitely oxygen space 
1,Teacher,100,student well part part answer 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well student able find there used small machine know very good able discover sort what answer 
1,Teacher,100,student know correct student able find where able find water 
1,Teacher,100,student well would definitely equipment especially know breathe sort operate within space around moon moon good yeah yeah 
1,Teacher,100,student totally sure could like maybe entire moon being covered garden 
1,Teacher,100,student wrong answer could better ch ice going talk about more about when talking just like brought discover before when look question look discover 
1,Teacher,100,student both right track here equipment they're using microscope water 
1,Teacher,100,student might made observation about scientist finding crater which very good student noticing crater that's where water 
1,Teacher,100,student partially correct student right sense nasa send small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student correct nasa types equipment boots special special article clothing some some things like oxygen tanks different things things might like when they're exploring space around space missions they're talking about machine find about find about deposit 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's really good question lunar orbiter wouldn't need microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student student partially right when kind 
1,Teacher,100,student that's really interesting don't know that's truth mean don't know like that's like truthful like 
1,Teacher,100,talk about student student answer scientist equipment like oxygen tanks true 
1,Teacher,100,student that's true tell read part text that's true student talking about water which questions asking talk about water 
1,Teacher,100,student right student definitely right 
1,Teacher,100,on said need scientific tool called microscope look really closely water moon guys both right track guys really thinking like where student headed 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely absolutely some great observations yeah absolutely would equipment nasa would refer back question what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student scientific tool think right track 
1,Teacher,100,perfect student absolutely right track 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely student absolutely right equipment huge what 
1,Teacher,100,think guys great right track 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely fact true focus what question actually asking 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah said would look closely discovered found there water there 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student correct scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student think answers getting right track 
1,Teacher,100,student getting right answer 
1,Teacher,100,student know what mean microscope look closely water 
1,Teacher,100,student equipment while moon stuff like 
1,Teacher,100,well that's very good microscope would part answer lunar orbiter would also part answer right student 
1,Teacher,100,okay student look student answer said scientist equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks very true know when space need oxygen able breathe 
1,Teacher,100,student scientists need other other equipment like oxygen tanks when into space help 
1,Teacher,100,student small actually smaller small microscopic really word means very very small small enough where can't actually without special tool 
1,Teacher,100,student that's great question student partially right entirely there student very right when actually microscope water absolutely 
1,Teacher,100,student that's absolutely right only halfway right know foot door rest 
1,Teacher,100,student halfway 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely microscope actually water 
1,Teacher,100,student sure absolutely some equipment moon can't imagine just know stroll moon absolutely equipment there student wrong regard 
1,Teacher,100,student essence yeah should probably oxygen tanks when space need breathe right 
1,Teacher,100,student student right whenever into space there's equipment into space moon land moon 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely student initial answer correct need water able drink able survive 
1,Teacher,100,what missjust read what's advantages told makes think there might full water what guys think 
1,Teacher,100,student oxygen tanks find water know exactly purpose oxygen tanks designed 
1,Teacher,100,student right even though wasn't even though didn't oxygen takes help mission find samples 
1,Teacher,100,student okay looking wouldn't need space exploration 
1,Teacher,100,student tools like 
1,Teacher,100,student well right thing then find other tool scientist used almost right just more tool 
1,Teacher,100,student helped saying there matter microscope still trying figure what other tool even audio 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope wrong we've answered part question want says what other what tool found tool want find other tool microscope correct want find other tool also story even said 
1,Teacher,100,student items needed find water moon find other item needed moon 
1,Teacher,100,student think helped each other come conclusion bunch answers might thought after read first time ice talk other people ideas right 
1,Teacher,100,student okay student answer wasn't completely wrong mention nasa send small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student would love actual student student answer completely wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah pretty good response because lunar orbiter definitely small machine what sent moon 
1,Teacher,100,student really awesome response because definitely true scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah definitely like used oxygen tanks equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student okay really good thing bring on appreciate student response isn't wrong just focus different section text kind focused microscope very right 
1,Teacher,100,student that's great that's great answer small machine that's what microscope real word want find here last paragraph 
1,Teacher,100,student would wouldn't thing found water 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well after asked question student answer maybe didn't include what question looking 
1,Teacher,100,student also found different paragraph there multiple answers 
1,Teacher,100,yeah there's multiple pieces equipment that's guys answering 
1,Teacher,100,student lunar orbiter another equipment then fellow classmate also mentioned sentences shall getting sort said microscope yeah 
1,Teacher,100,student just maybe adding couple more equipment sentence help just bulk give more understanding follow reader reading sentence 
1,Teacher,100,correct student answer exactly looking 
1,Teacher,100,student true fully insured 
1,Teacher,100,student moon equipment 
1,Teacher,100,said everyone else student answer correct exactly answer looking 
1,Teacher,100,student know student background knowledge correct he's answer would where answer 
1,Teacher,100,student because student intro wasn't exactly what looking 
1,Teacher,100,wide range could multiple answers likesaid machine there well couldn't find water didn't there right machine microscope excuse student 
1,Teacher,100,alright student saying there's multiple tool used find water because there order find water right that's really good answer 
1,Teacher,100,student started student response really well 
1,Teacher,100,student said nasa sent small machine student correct nasa mentioned part 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer okay student wrong student just fully there okay 
1,Teacher,100,student student student answer nasa sent small machine student right about like small machine piece equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student there some more evidence used also said can't survive without water 
1,Teacher,100,student which right know that's known fact 
1,Teacher,100,student didn't answer question 
1,Teacher,100,student doesn't really explain water being moon would valuable 
1,Teacher,100,student well wrong sense going moment 
1,Teacher,100,student that's good point focusing equipment used find water 
1,Teacher,100,student what wear 
1,Teacher,100,student student right path just need more makes sense 
1,Teacher,100,part student other part need together 
1,Teacher,100,student right track mention microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah microscope part 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah just getting closer closer answer 
1,Teacher,100,student answers little just -they're right direction they're exactly meeting expectations 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah what's student student response i'll read nasa send small machine which true nasa send small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student student right need scientific tool called microscope that's right student right also need 
1,Teacher,100,right student talked about need scientific tool called microscope look really closely that's great sentence great start 
1,Teacher,100,student very true equipment many times many different things actually what used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student answer question because often chicks definitely 
1,Teacher,100,student just think could little more room improvement 
1,Teacher,100,well student background knowledge student science equipment think what question asking doesn't mean necessarily background knowledge more look evidence from text 
1,Teacher,100,student question didn't necessarily background knowledge what said probably would used potentially find water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student question look text evidence don't think text talks about oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wasn't wrong think really great start response there said nasa uses small machine sent small machine that's true that's correct 
1,Teacher,100,student there both right because text actually talks about both things used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,need just like telling student wellright about 
1,Teacher,100,student also sometimes might answer student answer wrong answering question asked want also look question because sometimes might find something that's text might very true nothing question asked 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah other tool scientist 
1,Teacher,100,next time good okay chose same answer shows guys highlighting right answers passage 
1,Teacher,100,student student absolutely right found water moon that's what passage told 
1,Teacher,100,student student absolutely right while student answer right scientist oxygen tank sometimes when talking about water being found moon 
1,Teacher,100,student don't think answers specific question understand 
1,Teacher,100,student exactly there's possibility lunar there's microscope lunar orbiter helps look ashes moon 
1,Teacher,100,student part 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer great start okay 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah really really important 
1,Teacher,100,student just because didn't talk about reading doesn't mean important 
1,Teacher,100,student weren't wrong just think could build upon student answer more make even stronger 
1,Teacher,100,don't think student answer like saying student answers necessarily wrong student sitting group think student answers work could some improvement 
1,Teacher,100,give same note gave student although answer correct think could build deeper meaning build build upon student answer elop even more make even stronger already 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer correct just when looking answers know there more parts answer make stronger answer doesn't doesn't mean right wrong just stronger 
1,Teacher,100,student part what think student answer although stated used microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer although come straight from article reading 
1,Teacher,100,student well there couple answers 
1,Teacher,100,then student going look student answer really great think really understood text sure quite understood question asking 
1,Teacher,100,tell what equipmentstudent student completely wrong microscope piece equipment that's full answer 
1,Teacher,100,right then student also know microscope well once discovered water remember reading 
1,Teacher,100,student that's good thought through wasn't answer just wasn't correct question 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer correct 
1,Teacher,100,student right might used different equipment moon survive moon field walk around breathe student right 
1,Teacher,100,student spaceship there talking specifically about discover water just like says from reading 
1,Teacher,100,want take look even closer student there's another scientific equipment used specifically find water because microscope going help maybe look water closer look other things maybe just magnified didn't specifically find water 
1,Teacher,100,equipment looking equipment into creators wouldn't exactly microscope into crater find student just something student like 
1,Teacher,100,student what just only thing student answer great because right from text saying water there important 
1,Teacher,100,student some equipment moon focus other what discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student find anything specifically related think student really good path quite there 
1,Teacher,100,student part part answer 
1,Teacher,100,student okay there another tool there 
1,Teacher,100,student totally totally completely understand love answered question because student question 
1,Teacher,100,student student question wrong student question right student question spectacular plus going student question right 
1,Teacher,100,student that's like okay know want student question student answer spectacular 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope tool think there's more more important piece equipment 
1,Teacher,100,thank answer student used lunar orbiter discover water then used microscope order able closer since small 
1,Teacher,100,student teacher almost there nice 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wasn't totally wasn't completely incorrect 
1,Teacher,100,missing step number student great explaining step number great explaining step number need together 
1,Teacher,100,student right sure that's absolutely right into space need tons equipment don't down here right 
1,Teacher,100,need there's parts answer need combine whatanswer what student said answer there's parts 
1,Teacher,100,that's great start student 
1,Teacher,100,student right probably would need microscope anything that's tiny can't student naked 
1,Teacher,100,student student right wouldn't need microscope order look water order find water 
1,Teacher,100,student don't think would oxygen tanks think would helpful don't think exactly what scientist used discover water 
1,Teacher,100,student investigate little more into text might there something used before microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah student exactly right water water grow things sure would work moon 
1,Teacher,100,student don't think could don't think could grow plants water other uses moon 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah think student right think might take scientist long time water doesn't mean less valuable because think there lots different 
1,Teacher,100,student true water moon microscopic first first step reviewing question 
1,Teacher,100,student about water know asked what discover water true water small need microscope that's what's really being asked 
1,Teacher,100,equipment gone moon process that's exact equipment used discover water student 
1,Teacher,100,student that's quite really answering question like 
1,Teacher,100,student getting closer answer sent small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope part equipment used discover water right student right there there part equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student student right oxygen tanks equipment sometimes need moon that's when 
1,Teacher,100,student when need astronaut need human beings because human beings human beings needs oxygen over there 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer isn't wrong because answers question want there's maybe better answer sometimes there's answers them's little more specific 
1,Teacher,100,student actually like moment that's exactly what object called 
1,Teacher,100,student said nasa sense small machine okay know student actually correct 
1,Teacher,100,student that's great place start thank 
1,Teacher,100,student even though like student answer think even better answering question 
1,Teacher,100,student think included microscope student student answer lunar orbiter would like best answer ever 
1,Teacher,100,student important both things want microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student right track finding right answer 
1,Teacher,100,student well student answer actually wrong just half piece student more smaller picture 
1,Teacher,100,exactly right know what onto something student microscope response because really essential part analyzing dirt moon however microscope dirt analyze student what's 
1,Teacher,100,student unfortunately don't think oxygen tank time 
1,Teacher,100,student right student when said need find would need microscope because water microscopic probably microscope that's necessarily what using find discover water right 
1,Teacher,100,yeah exactly okay what hearing from guys different tool really important 
1,Teacher,100,what really want focus right what's important water right because true like said when student need oxygen tanks right need breathe 
1,Teacher,100,would kind pair little more student saying student right track 
1,Teacher,100,student find paragraph tech scientist like sentence where corresponds because answer oxygen tanks didn't from paragraph student find paragraph 
1,Teacher,100,pieces equipment right lunar orbiter student talked about response microscope talked about student response 
1,Teacher,100,talked about microscope didn't talk about lunar orbiter student talked about lunar orbiter microscope used pieces equipment because takes things find water moon discover 
1,Teacher,100,question equipment just talked about lunar orbiter microscope student talked about discover water 
1,Teacher,100,student okay scientist better 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's part there's also right small machine thinking about right right 
1,Teacher,100,student know think student think student right track there look article article 
1,Teacher,100,student think student right track 
1,Teacher,100,student okay possible pieces equipment thank sharing student thinking 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's really great point each what noticing like spoken about piece equipment maybe other 
1,Teacher,100,student think about could know circle both civic equipment only also think about what each piece equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student think great response know could even step 
1,Teacher,100,student okay okay well that's good there's oxygen tanks discover water they're going need more oxygen tanks right probably going need more 
1,Teacher,100,student okay great that's almost there think circled whole sentence investigate lunar orbiter then together student's answer 
1,Teacher,100,awesome awesome okaystudent will pair find answer question thank folks 
1,Teacher,100,student board 
1,Teacher,100,student someone else build samantha's answer someone else talk about 
1,Teacher,100,microscope would allow discover water then first part question right equipment someone think about connects discovering water ark student 
1,Teacher,100,student awesome lunar orbiter someone else answer allow scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,what other folks think about where want agree answer ahead student 
1,Teacher,100,student about 's answer compare student answers while work other people 
1,Teacher,100,yeah guys both reading find something similar something different student 
1,Teacher,100,what investigate mean anybody know student 
1,Teacher,100,anybody like title 
1,Teacher,100,what astronaut student 
1,Teacher,100,there convincing evidence valuable resource student 
1,Teacher,100,don't don't look back student work together since same answer 
1,Teacher,100,talk about going speak student moment okay 
1,Teacher,100,student could help little more maybe finding different piece equipment might used 
1,Teacher,100,student tell what tool what tool 
1,Teacher,100,student circle word 
1,Teacher,100,okay well look back reading passage since guys same answer microscope want guys look back student reading passage 
1,Teacher,100,student finish before come back ahead work next question 
1,Teacher,100,wonder maybe student help because sent mission find answer 
1,Teacher,100,would agree what student said 
1,Teacher,100,back student second able find what answered answer specific question 
1,Teacher,100,figure because student same answer talkwork together 
1,Teacher,100,okay that's great question anyone tell what think would answer s question which wouldn't microscope discovered watersupport answer evidence lunar orbiter okay student what think 
1,Teacher,100,okay anybody else different answer 
1,Teacher,100,tell maybe about student he's sure moon maybe help give different answer 
1,Teacher,100,okay student able help 
1,Teacher,100,perfect yeah many guys picked equipment discover 
1,Teacher,100,student what 
1,Teacher,100,student answer scientist found using smaller machine guys know water rightq 
1,Teacher,100,student okay perfect about kind work together back look text look specifically what piece equipment used look what looking 
1,Teacher,100,perfect awesome about guys look together okay 
1,Teacher,100,aboutkind work together look back maybe guys help each other look text 
1,Teacher,100,student about together reread passage together talk about student answer 
1,Teacher,100,maybe guys want look over text together starting paragraph three think help reread okay 
1,Teacher,100,what thinkwhat feel about what student said 
1,Teacher,100,kind build student could remind what question what question answering here 
1,Teacher,100,well i'll hereappreciate student feedback what microscope attached help student 
1,Teacher,100,well mean won't back reread help student what think said circled same answer student what microscope attached find water crater 
1,Teacher,100,really that's good guess student what 
1,Teacher,100,okay really good guesses still missing point student calling what 
1,Teacher,100,awesome anyone else different response student 
1,Teacher,100,would like know would like hear from student found what found then student elbow partner agrees 
1,Teacher,100,would anyone else like build response 
1,Teacher,100,don'ttalk student want what come together 
1,Teacher,100,okay looking back they're thinking about 's answer would like four student jump combine student answers what come 
1,Teacher,100,looking paragraph sent small machinestudent thought needed microscope don't five talk together combine answers 
1,Teacher,100,what think about student 
1,Teacher,100,what student think equipment might possibly small machine well 
1,Teacher,100,absolutely correct goodokay want guys give give thumbs agree thumbs middle student quite sure thumbs down disagreeguys 
1,Teacher,100,okay anybody different answer student 
1,Teacher,100,anybody different answer from what student what 
1,Teacher,100,anyone else find anything different 
1,Teacher,100,student what equipment used find water moon about scientist 
1,Teacher,100,student 
1,Teacher,100,student okay speaking water heavy 's answer okay there's said water heavy good don't carry 
1,Teacher,100,student help 
1,Teacher,100,student what else oxygen hydrogen could used 
1,Teacher,100,right very good want talk each other student groups goinggroupstudent 
1,Teacher,100,very good question anyone anybody wants help answer would microscope along lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,look something what anything elsestudent investigate means what what mean 
1,Teacher,100,there other word text might help maybe someone else group right answer lunar orbiter what some word think could underline circle might help friend someone sitting next 
1,Teacher,100,what word text might help someone else answer question what think student what might help student friend 
1,Teacher,100,student while talked some others maybe we'll discover together what think 
1,Teacher,100,student together work together find answer okay 
1,Teacher,100,student what other answers could talk about work together 
1,Teacher,100,student raise student hand think that's true statement found crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,okay eventually think should along what student said don't think quite ready think maybe long r search future could possibility 
1,Teacher,100,work together y'all work combine student answers help each other 
1,Teacher,100,things evidence could drink water from moon think could work student 
1,Teacher,100,look student textwork together because guys kind same page student 
1,Teacher,100,surestudent might thinking well picked specific tool 
1,Teacher,100,student agree answer 
1,Teacher,100,what could somebody help student 
1,Teacher,100,read about student 
1,Teacher,100,student questions help somebody else help 
1,Teacher,100,student somebody help 
1,Teacher,100,student help there 
1,Teacher,100,student 
1,Teacher,100,anybody student tell 
1,Teacher,100,rest talk student about because he's trying find which discover microscope lunar orbiter think answer talkhelp discover which 
1,Teacher,100,goodwhat student about water 
1,Teacher,100,then student would valuable water space don't from earth moon 
1,Teacher,100,student want answer 's question 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well student other classmates 
1,Teacher,100,break into groups will group then student 
1,Teacher,100,student take about seconds each person going share

1,Teacher,100,just listening going start student will first person share 
1,Teacher,100,debbie will secondyou'll thirdforth thenlast each person student going about seconds share student answerwill first then student i'll tell when when start 
1,Teacher,100,after okay you'll share group student 
1,Teacher,100,student talk rest classmates what thought then maybe 
1,Teacher,100,okay student agree also something else 
1,Teacher,100,right anybody anything else thanks important everybody else agree convincing evidence valuable role very important word 
1,Teacher,100,want guys turn talk share pair about seconds look through there find some places show through text water valuable resource 
1,Teacher,100,just paragraph four five okay onguyswork togetherstudent work together 
1,Teacher,100,anybody answer 
1,Teacher,100,aboutstudent show another water could useful tell paragraph student start read sentence comes from well okay 
1,Teacher,100,very good that's claim student said right
1,Teacher,100,wellquestionmentioned nasa sent small machine what kind machine nasa send maybe help student 
1,Teacher,100,okay student know about space tell what lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,that's great guys think microscope find water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student what scientist fine 
1,Teacher,100,okay yeah what small machine student look paragraph tell what small machine 
1,Teacher,100,okay student help tell what lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,anybody else another aspect what also sent astronaut 
1,Teacher,100,okayagree student 
1,Teacher,100,okay that's type equipment anyone else know about another type equipment 
1,Teacher,100,maybethink help student 
1,Teacher,100,okay based what student just read about lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,what point microscope according article know what paragraph anyone helpfind paragraph microscope mentioned student 
1,Teacher,100,what think about student 
1,Teacher,100,hear what said student 
1,Teacher,100,anybody else other equipment other answers could possibly related 
1,Teacher,100,student equipment 
1,Teacher,100,okay thumbs agree student thumbs down think something needs added answer 
1,Teacher,100,okay everyonewhat think agree student 
1,Teacher,100,anybody else different answer stuck between microscope lunar orbiter right 
1,Teacher,100,teacher then student able help push answer little further identify lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,anybody find different word equipment question 
1,Teacher,100,somebody help student what another word maybe only said once t ice could look text what's another ke word somebody else found 
1,Teacher,100,yeah convincing important word like valuable valuable good also convincing what convincing convincing what what being convinced anybody word along student's word convincing 
1,Teacher,100,exactly reading piece astronaut went space company called nasa sent piece equipment space anybody remember name piece equipment 
1,Teacher,100,okay circled student ke word would like turn person beside youtube talkstudent talk 
1,Teacher,100,student then eighth share student answer want talk person beside about word underline thought important help answer question ahead take seconds 
1,Teacher,100,want guys talk about same partner 
1,Teacher,100,talk together talk then student talk 
1,Teacher,100,student want take couple seconds talk person sachi 
1,Teacher,100,work togethertogether student work okay take couple seconds 
1,Teacher,100,okay equipment discover anyone else underlying equipment 
1,Teacher,100,guess what talkedstudent here right which don't mind 
1,Teacher,100,student answer nasa send small machine student think machine look because couldn't eyes 
1,Teacher,100,anyone know 
1,Teacher,100,anyone agree disagree student 
1,Teacher,100,believe don't need help well going work through together we'll actually what learn along anyone else questions before begin 
1,Teacher,100,entirely there just student what 
1,Teacher,100,well absolutely right track student what 
1,Teacher,100,okay think right what discuss student neighbor even group kind talk about where guys student answers from what student like know more about 
1,Teacher,100,okay well whatstudent thought well 
1,Teacher,100,okay that's really good thoughtwant hear from student classmates then going come back together what everyone thinks about student terms okay student would like next 
1,Teacher,100,hear fromwhat we'll come together group response okay 
1,Teacher,100,want guys break into small groupsthen maybe guys will work together just little questions while student discussing what want guys focus 
1,Teacher,100,sure well know couple guys student hand raisedwould like share student student reconstructed maybe will helpword since guys similar answers 
1,Teacher,100,split water into elements like said student said oxygen tanks come what astronaut could water main 
1,Teacher,100,using what talk student good student responsejust wanted work together help astronaut 
1,Teacher,100,student think takes someone find 
1,Teacher,100,guys guys closehistory student death 
1,Teacher,100,what other kinds equipment would guys would need find water moon other microscope 
1,Teacher,100,anybody ideas student 
1,Teacher,100,right anybody else anything else text might microscope student 
1,Teacher,100,know student remember what tool scientist used 
1,Teacher,100,there somebody student would like help 
1,Teacher,100,alright student tell other item needed 
1,Teacher,100,okay continue look maybe student help 
1,Teacher,100,student want help 
1,Teacher,100,anybody know what either hydrogen oxygen within water 
1,Teacher,100,really good answer well brought guys together because guys varying answers hoping when guys hear student responses like student classmates responses 
1,Teacher,100,ideas well because even smartest people world work other people make things better because collaborate then guys learn same time 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe from listening student classmates might text things learn from what really happening along what found prior knowledge okay then listen classmates right 
1,Teacher,100,maybe keep listening heard frommight hear from on student 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well that's great don't asked about cars we'll come back there's anything more afterwards okay 
1,Teacher,100,student there anything student like we've looked through text want review there's anything else 
1,Teacher,100,we've heard everyone else's responses anything reflect about what student heard equipment used find water moon 
1,Teacher,100,everyone look first before share anyone besides-- anyone else student what come 
1,Teacher,100,good knowing answer anyone else want student want yeah ahead 
1,Teacher,100,want- before into want anyone else share other equipment circled 
1,Teacher,100,anybody else 
1,Teacher,100,okay anyone else anyone else guesses 
1,Teacher,100,want into some small groups really quickly going then student going work together want compare contrast difference between lunar orbiter microscope 
1,Teacher,100,want small group togetheralso small group want circle equipment reading think important then want come back minute 
1,Teacher,100,student saying answer's wrong right just want collaborate student peers because different answers then want collaborate okay thank question 
1,Teacher,100,student what answer question what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student wondering could volunteer share

1,Teacher,100,what else student 
1,Teacher,100,student what valuable mean 
1,Teacher,100,okay perfect alright start 's group what some things said make water valuable resource from moon student 
1,Teacher,100,student question 
1,Teacher,100,what else think would make water valuable student what student thoughts 
1,Teacher,100,student what's another water could valuable what's another thing could water 
1,Teacher,100,okay student ahead 
1,Teacher,100,what some things oxygen what think student 
1,Teacher,100,student what think 
1,Teacher,100,student what think used determine water moon what what reading tell 
1,Teacher,100,student question 
1,Teacher,100,student ideas about might detect water from orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,student thoughts about 
1,Teacher,100,ahead what think student ahead 
1,Teacher,100,student what 
1,Teacher,100,student sabina care share student response 
1,Teacher,100,student what what 
1,Teacher,100,water moon could valuable astronaut student stated there convincing evidence correct 
1,Teacher,100,then student what astronaut could 
1,Teacher,100,teacheralright student without looking text know answer question 
1,Teacher,100,right student what student answer discussion question 
1,Teacher,100,student 
1,Teacher,100,alright student kind want explain student answer 
1,Teacher,100,what student 
1,Teacher,100,student what discover 
1,Teacher,100,student 
1,Teacher,100,student haven't spoken what believe sent moon 
1,Teacher,100,would like least beginning studente know what first question 
1,Teacher,100,student what student answer question 
1,Teacher,100,okay over first group 
1,Teacher,100,student what's something learn from student partners 
1,Teacher,100,student okay student answer will refresh memory tell what student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student 
1,Teacher,100,student 
1,Teacher,100,okay student isn't what mentioned student need scientific tool called what 
1,Teacher,100,okay right student 
1,Teacher,100,student seems likehere kind same pathread student response please 
1,Teacher,100,then while student hear from some people haven't talked about what aboutstudent when tell what what read 
1,Teacher,100,okay what what find what what like share together group 
1,Teacher,100,sounds very good would anyone like open what thought response first discussion question 
1,Teacher,100,student anything would like share 
1,Teacher,100,what called guys guys other information about lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,student what small machine called 
1,Teacher,100,student well then ahead 
1,Teacher,100,student even ahead start 
1,Teacher,100,someone else talk second anyone hand raised 
1,Teacher,100,student what know about equipment used space 
1,Teacher,100,what thinking student haven't heard much from 
1,Teacher,100,student what thinking 
1,Teacher,100,student what thinking number 
1,Teacher,100,actually anyone want start share opinion allowed 
1,Teacher,100,glad haven't figuredremind student student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student share student answer 
1,Teacher,100,alright student find where 
1,Teacher,100,student found oxygen tank 
1,Teacher,100,student question 
1,Teacher,100,student finished 
1,Teacher,100,more seconds 987654321 right actually start student we'll move around circlewhat word circle
1,Teacher,100,student what circle 
1,Teacher,100,what student 
1,Teacher,100,student what 
1,Teacher,100,student what 
1,Teacher,100,whatstudent tell about microscope there 
1,Teacher,100,anybody want to-- 
1,Teacher,100,student that's that's totally correct think we'd agree microscope would look water really closely although think about what happens before point right 
1,Teacher,100,student know exactly equipment used discover water moon right think each like piece then just just needed microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student like couple people just circle microscope that's great example there multiple tool like just pointed come from things 
1,Teacher,100,student need microscope look really closely things what scientist used find water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student semi right could went into more detail small machine small machine called lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,student very close 
1,Teacher,100,student exactly like student thinking what keeps water together passage 
1,Teacher,100,student partially correct need microscope however that's didn't just send microscope moon 
1,Teacher,100,student well partially correct equipment sent machine called lunar orbiter able across ground surface moon surface check deposit 
1,Teacher,100,student then once figured there 
1,Teacher,100,student deposits very small water then microscope make sure what thought there okay microscope actually gave evidence 
1,Teacher,100,student there water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student then tool used microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student completely wrong will send small machine really doesn't 
1,Teacher,100,student that's said student student right track 
1,Teacher,100,student okay said student meet scientific tool called microscope look really closely right microscope piece equipment 
1,Teacher,100,yeah sure okay student also right scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,valuable okay agree valuable word that's right going look more thing more other word question student could tell what word another word circled 
1,Teacher,100,student scientist found crater full water moon absolutely true that's absolutely something reading 
1,Teacher,100,student okay there's pieces equipment actually looking here 
1,Teacher,100,student kind version other slits think about 
1,Teacher,100,student wouldn't needed pieces equipment actually figure there water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student equipment microscope piece scientific equipment correct 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's right 
1,Teacher,100,student awesome okay yeah would used equipment would oxygen they're moon astronaut moon right 
1,Teacher,100,student well enough that's right astronaut correct 
1,Teacher,100,student well okay pieces equipment correct 
1,Teacher,100,okay read student answers think very good points everyone think little more about what question about example question what question 
1,Teacher,100,student says nasa sent small machine right enough question sent small machine look better word answer question 
1,Teacher,100,student okay said nasa send small machine right think read little 
1,Teacher,100,student think even better think that's great response think make amazing response question asking what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,that's rightwhat kind learn from student here learn looking middle ground between both both pretty much gave good answer gave 
1,Teacher,100,student really really good almost exactly where want still make couple improvements there close thank student 
1,Teacher,100,student that's right piece puzzle right that's what talking earlier mentioned microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student know what that's correct statement wrote down need microsoft skype look something that's really small when back look question 
1,Teacher,100,student look student answer scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student that's very knowledgeable point 
1,Teacher,100,that's very critical tool when learning together group that's awesome dead 
1,Teacher,100,student okay track find right answer going deeper 
1,Teacher,100,student right small machine that's what using discover where water 
1,Teacher,100,okaystudent think scientist used microscope look very very closely 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wrong totally right either 
1,Teacher,100,would almost there student would because question very specific meaning what piece equipment said small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student examples equipment just particular moment 
1,Teacher,100,student okay nasa good point question 
1,Teacher,100,student sort right send machine 
1,Teacher,100,student said scientist equipment like oxygen tanks equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student really close sure 
1,Teacher,100,student obviously true statement right can't live without water 
1,Teacher,100,student well microscope definitely equipment used space like because 
1,Teacher,100,student okay getting there 
1,Teacher,100,okay great okay reread over text becausestudent really close answer 
1,Teacher,100,student well yeah that's what just there 
1,Teacher,100,student that's true couldn't crystals investigate without small machine right 
1,Teacher,100,student tools used some observation some research 
1,Teacher,100,student maybe there's something back text could find some more 's information student information work together come full more complete answer 
1,Teacher,100,student okay that's that's part answer could more space more room 
1,Teacher,100,student okay good that's good start student answer 
1,Teacher,100,student good start 
1,Teacher,100,student well completely wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student okay yeah understand really close 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah looked really close microscope weren't exactly wrong there just more specific answer yeah good 
1,Teacher,100,student that's very interesting take actually first read through answering question thought same thing 
1,Teacher,100,student because would 
1,Teacher,100,student wrong okay just need elaborate little more okay 
1,Teacher,100,student right things question about what equipment scientist discover water moon they're moon know they're using oxygen tanks stuff like what need find about water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student nasa sent small machine didn't sent astronaut space make sense 
1,Teacher,100,really like what said nasa send small machine right direction want everybody look text 
1,Teacher,100,student polar crater student part answer right 
1,Teacher,100,student student piece 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah sound like agree oxygen tanks when they're space moon think what trying figure 
1,Teacher,100,student well student right need microscope look water 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer necessarily wrong just little deeper make student answer more detailed just little better what right what great start 
1,Teacher,100,student said nasa sent small machine correct send student small machine order discover water 
1,Teacher,100,student that's good need 
1,Teacher,100,student oxygen tank maybe used breathe 
1,Teacher,100,student okay find 
1,Teacher,100,student craters water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer incredibly wrong headed right direction would definitely need microscope because water 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer scientist found crater full water moon article found crater some water moon didn't full water 
1,Teacher,100,student mhmm good student answer just needed little more whole small piece answer 
1,Teacher,100,because student just responded thinks knows just about everything aboutwant tell really enjoyed reading student answer because talked about water split said split into parts hydrogen oxygen correct 
1,Teacher,100,student okay yeah student right scientist would oxygen tank breathe space 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah maybe just little more attention exact question correct student response just didn't specifically answer question 
1,Teacher,100,astronauts didn't oxygen oxygen tanks like student said 
1,Teacher,100,yeah okay looking student responses will student probably closest getting correct answer student response 
1,Teacher,100,student sounds filming crater full water moon okay find crater water 
1,Teacher,100,student necessarily 
1,Teacher,100,right student nasa send small machine student almost 100% right 
1,Teacher,100,student right okay good maybe microscope isn't what used discover 
1,Teacher,100,because look listen look student answers student said scientist found crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student that's entirely true find water some places 
1,Teacher,100,microscopes discover things just like guys said tool help discover things 
1,Teacher,100,student what tool scientist used microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student think both right fact scientific tool just need clarify what tool 
1,Teacher,100,right small machine great student 
1,Teacher,100,student moon isn't ready live student absolutely right 
1,Teacher,100,student tools scientist just make sure student reading question what specific equipment used discover water moon okay 
1,Teacher,100,student okay would would correct there's definitely oxygen space 
1,Teacher,100,student well part part answer 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well student able find there used small machine know very good able discover sort what answer 
1,Teacher,100,student know correct student able find where able find water 
1,Teacher,100,student well would definitely equipment especially know breathe sort operate within space around moon moon good yeah yeah 
1,Teacher,100,student totally sure could like maybe entire moon being covered garden 
1,Teacher,100,student wrong answer could better ch ice going talk about more about when talking just like brought discover before when look question look discover 
1,Teacher,100,student both right track here equipment they're using microscope water 
1,Teacher,100,student might made observation about scientist finding crater which very good student noticing crater that's where water 
1,Teacher,100,student partially correct student right sense nasa send small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student correct nasa types equipment boots special special article clothing some some things like oxygen tanks different things things might like when they're exploring space around space missions they're talking about machine find about find about deposit 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's really good question lunar orbiter wouldn't need microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student student partially right when kind 
1,Teacher,100,student that's really interesting don't know that's truth mean don't know like that's like truthful like 
1,Teacher,100,talk about student student answer scientist equipment like oxygen tanks true 
1,Teacher,100,student that's true tell read part text that's true student talking about water which questions asking talk about water 
1,Teacher,100,student right student definitely right 
1,Teacher,100,on said need scientific tool called microscope look really closely water moon guys both right track guys really thinking like where student headed 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely absolutely some great observations yeah absolutely would equipment nasa would refer back question what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student scientific tool think right track 
1,Teacher,100,perfect student absolutely right track 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely student absolutely right equipment huge what 
1,Teacher,100,think guys great right track 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely fact true focus what question actually asking 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah said would look closely discovered found there water there 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student correct scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student think answers getting right track 
1,Teacher,100,student getting right answer 
1,Teacher,100,student know what mean microscope look closely water 
1,Teacher,100,student equipment while moon stuff like 
1,Teacher,100,well that's very good microscope would part answer lunar orbiter would also part answer right student 
1,Teacher,100,okay student look student answer said scientist equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks very true know when space need oxygen able breathe 
1,Teacher,100,student scientists need other other equipment like oxygen tanks when into space help 
1,Teacher,100,student small actually smaller small microscopic really word means very very small small enough where can't actually without special tool 
1,Teacher,100,student that's great question student partially right entirely there student very right when actually microscope water absolutely 
1,Teacher,100,student that's absolutely right only halfway right know foot door rest 
1,Teacher,100,student halfway 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely microscope actually water 
1,Teacher,100,student sure absolutely some equipment moon can't imagine just know stroll moon absolutely equipment there student wrong regard 
1,Teacher,100,student essence yeah should probably oxygen tanks when space need breathe right 
1,Teacher,100,student student right whenever into space there's equipment into space moon land moon 
1,Teacher,100,student absolutely student initial answer correct need water able drink able survive 
1,Teacher,100,what missjust read what's advantages told makes think there might full water what guys think 
1,Teacher,100,student oxygen tanks find water know exactly purpose oxygen tanks designed 
1,Teacher,100,student right even though wasn't even though didn't oxygen takes help mission find samples 
1,Teacher,100,student okay looking wouldn't need space exploration 
1,Teacher,100,student tools like 
1,Teacher,100,student well right thing then find other tool scientist used almost right just more tool 
1,Teacher,100,student helped saying there matter microscope still trying figure what other tool even audio 
1,Teacher,100,student microscope wrong we've answered part question want says what other what tool found tool want find other tool microscope correct want find other tool also story even said 
1,Teacher,100,student items needed find water moon find other item needed moon 
1,Teacher,100,student think helped each other come conclusion bunch answers might thought after read first time ice talk other people ideas right 
1,Teacher,100,student okay student answer wasn't completely wrong mention nasa send small machine 
1,Teacher,100,student would love actual student student answer completely wrong 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah pretty good response because lunar orbiter definitely small machine what sent moon 
1,Teacher,100,student really awesome response because definitely true scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah definitely like used oxygen tanks equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student okay really good thing bring on appreciate student response isn't wrong just focus different section text kind focused microscope very right 
1,Teacher,100,student that's great that's great answer small machine that's what microscope real word want find here last paragraph 
1,Teacher,100,student would wouldn't thing found water 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well after asked question student answer maybe didn't include what question looking 
1,Teacher,100,student also found different paragraph there multiple answers 
1,Teacher,100,yeah there's multiple pieces equipment that's guys answering 
1,Teacher,100,student lunar orbiter another equipment then fellow classmate also mentioned sentences shall getting sort said microscope yeah 
1,Teacher,100,awesome awesome okaystudent will pair find answer question thank folks 
1,Teacher,100,student board 
1,Teacher,100,student someone else build samantha's answer someone else talk about 
1,Teacher,100,microscope would allow discover water then first part question right equipment someone think about connects discovering water ark student 
1,Teacher,100,student awesome lunar orbiter someone else answer allow scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,100,what other folks think about where want agree answer ahead student 
1,Teacher,100,student about 's answer compare student answers while work other people 
1,Teacher,100,yeah guys both reading find something similar something different harrisstudent 
1,Teacher,100,what investigate mean anybody know student 
1,Teacher,100,anybody like title 
1,Teacher,100,what astronaut student 
1,Teacher,100,there convincing evidence valuable resource student 
1,Teacher,100,don't don't look back student work together since same answer 
1,Teacher,100,talk about going speak student moment okay 
1,Teacher,100,student could help little more maybe finding different piece equipment might used 
1,Teacher,100,student tell what tool what tool 
1,Teacher,100,student circle word 
1,Teacher,100,okay well look back reading passage since guys same answer microscope want guys look back student reading passage 
1,Teacher,100,student finish before come back ahead work next question 
1,Teacher,100,wonder maybe student help because sent mission find answer 
1,Teacher,100,would agree what student said 
1,Teacher,100,back student second able find what answered answer specific question 
1,Teacher,100,figure because student same answer talkwork together 
1,Teacher,100,okay that's great question anyone tell what think would answer s question which wouldn't microscope discovered watersupport answer evidence lunar orbiter okay student what think 
1,Teacher,100,okay anybody else different answer 
1,Teacher,100,tell maybe about student he's sure moon maybe help give different answer 
1,Teacher,100,okay student able help 
1,Teacher,100,perfect yeah many guys picked equipment discover 
1,Teacher,100,student what 
1,Teacher,100,student answer scientist found using smaller machine guys know water rightq 
1,Teacher,100,student okay perfect about kind work together back look text look specifically what piece equipment used look what looking 
1,Teacher,100,perfect awesome about guys look together okay 
1,Teacher,100,aboutkind work together look back maybe guys help each other look text 
1,Teacher,100,student about together reread passage together talk about student answer 
1,Teacher,100,maybe guys want look over text together starting paragraph three think help reread okay 
1,Teacher,100,what thinkwhat feel about what student said 
1,Teacher,100,kind build student could remind what question what question answering here 
1,Teacher,100,well i'll hereappreciate student feedback what microscope attached help student 
1,Teacher,100,well mean won't back reread help savannnahwhat think said circled same answer student what microscope attached find water crater 
1,Teacher,100,really that's good guess student what 
1,Teacher,100,okay really good guesses still missing point student calling what 
1,Teacher,100,awesome anyone else different response student 
1,Teacher,100,would like know would like hear from student found what found then student elbow partner agrees

1,Teacher,100,student help 
1,Teacher,100,student what else oxygen hydrogen could used 
1,Teacher,100,right very good want talk each other student groups goinggroupstudent 
1,Teacher,100,very good question anyone anybody wants help answer would microscope along lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,look something what anything elsestudent investigate means what what mean 
1,Teacher,100,there other word text might help maybe someone else group right answer lunar orbiter what some word think could underline circle might help friend someone sitting next 
1,Teacher,100,what word text might help someone else answer question what think student what might help student friend 
1,Teacher,100,student while talked some others maybe we'll discover together what think 
1,Teacher,100,student together work together find answer okay 
1,Teacher,100,student what other answers could talk about work together 
1,Teacher,100,student raise student hand think that's true statement found crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,100,okay eventually think should along what student said don't think quite ready think maybe long r search future could possibility 
1,Teacher,100,work together y'all work combine student answers help each other 
1,Teacher,100,things evidence could drink water from moon think could work student 
1,Teacher,100,look student textwork together because guys kind same page student 
1,Teacher,100,surestudent might thinking well picked specific tool 
1,Teacher,100,student agree answer

1,Teacher,100,student help there 
1,Teacher,100,student 
1,Teacher,100,anybody student tell 
1,Teacher,100,rest talk student about because he's trying find which discover microscope lunar orbiter think answer talkhelp discover which 
1,Teacher,100,goodwhat student about water 
1,Teacher,100,then student would valuable water space don't from earth moon 
1,Teacher,100,student want answer 's question 
1,Teacher,100,student okay well student other classmates 
1,Teacher,100,break into groups will group then student 
1,Teacher,100,student take about seconds each person going share

1,Teacher,100,right anybody anything else thanks important everybody else agree convincing evidence valuable role very important word 
1,Teacher,100,want guys turn talk share pair about seconds look through there find some places show through text water valuable resource 
1,Teacher,100,just paragraph four five okay onguyswork togetherstudent work together 
1,Teacher,100,anybody answer 
1,Teacher,100,aboutstudent show another water could useful tell paragraph student start read sentence comes from well okay 
1,Teacher,100,very good that's claim student said right
1,Teacher,100,wellquestionmentioned nasa sent small machine what kind machine nasa send maybe help student 
1,Teacher,100,okay student know about space tell what lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,that's great guys think microscope find water moon 
1,Teacher,100,student what scientist fine 
1,Teacher,100,okay yeah what small machine student look paragraph tell what small machine 
1,Teacher,100,okay student help tell what lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,100,guys come name want call collective don't like boys girls don't like guys school mascot want eyes eagles ketchup packets what call group 
1,Teacher,100,student awesome told about kind thing 
1,Teacher,100,student okay when deposit something much what deposit deposit really large piece something smaller pieces 
1,Teacher,100,student well when think paycheck every week would smaller amount what would make entire month make sense 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah seen frost wintertime fall 
1,Teacher,100,student seen student mom's windows grass 
1,Teacher,100,student what what when he's investigating crimes just leave unsolved 
1,Teacher,100,student could tell some equipment took there used general while space 
1,Teacher,100,student ever seen something through microscope 
1,Teacher,100,student what thing 
1,Teacher,100,student that's really good well sounds exciting enjoy student self nasa 
1,Teacher,100,good information anybody else anything about input what think about space 
1,Teacher,100,student would-- think would need oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,100,abouttell something know about space also whatstudent telling 
1,Teacher,100,good point because atmosphere which breathe which oxygen tanks talking about going into space messed then won't here earth would look some other place possibly live about student anything input 
1,Teacher,100,well that's people aren't into space some people more into environment liketalking about some people into oceans stuff which very interesting learn about aboutinput group 
1,Teacher,100,student what would consider fiction nonfiction story 
1,Teacher,100,student laughs 
1,Teacher,100,student didn't phones back then cell phones like didn't anything like wind wall 
1,Teacher,100,student gasps 
1,Teacher,100,student there cartoons book about phones 
1,Teacher,100,student people thought just going be-- science fiction realistic today 
1,Teacher,100,student right right used science fiction would able into space which what we've studying about space going moon being able different explorations like seen latest results stuff from titan moon saturn 
1,Teacher,100,student saturn moon floating around there's actually moon that's called titan think found life 
1,Teacher,100,student gasps 
1,Teacher,100,student well they're microscopic aliens live very very cold because really really cold moon moon like below zero really cold there think equipment like what moon was-- used find water moon think found some lifeforms existed titan 
1,Teacher,100,student that's pretty good stuff what think about audio know there outer space stuff 
1,Teacher,100,student we'll into more study about outer space different equipment they're using rockets satellites stuff they're using there 
1,Teacher,100,anything else interest student about aliens moon saturn 
1,Teacher,100,student student answer wasn't wrong talking about atmosphere which something exploring space find different atmospheres would hold life from earth which very good said 
1,Teacher,100,student would make what would need order able really good garden moon 
1,Teacher,100,student would bring artificial greenhouse something like possibly maybe 
1,Teacher,100,everybody like reading 
1,Teacher,100,student like martian 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah good movie 
1,Teacher,100,student where find water 
1,Teacher,100,student polar crater what mean around earth bottom 
1,Teacher,100,student well science videos family love watch science videos documentaries great places learn 
1,Teacher,100,student great place learn more about what talking about 
1,Teacher,100,student kind think about like refrigerator 
1,Teacher,100,student somebody asked what keeps student food cold would like refrigerator wouldn't plug plugs into outlet supplies power 
1,Teacher,100,student well fact when first grade wanted astronaut obviously didn't live know goal 
1,Teacher,100,student texas florida john kennedy center or-- 
1,Teacher,100,student think that's named after president kennedy 
1,Teacher,100,while student looking back student because pretty excited astronaut 
1,Teacher,100,student mean know everything about what scientist using space oxygen tank work 
1,Teacher,100,anyone ever microscope before 
1,Teacher,100,student what some thoughts student text prior answering questions 
1,Teacher,100,student next time invite 
1,Teacher,100,student convince people student best minecraft what 
1,Teacher,100,student well actually show beating game right student using actions instead word convince 
1,Teacher,100,student know name facility student works 
1,Teacher,100,student well that's that's unfortunate able speak regular basis perhaps some online activity hearing stories 
1,Teacher,100,student right because looking what equipment just like today sitting front okay student sitting there school 
1,Teacher,100,scientist astronaut there's some things know right every student student school right what's equipment right thats helping student work student 
1,Teacher,100,student glad brought about nasa because know what today when learning student tablets 
1,Teacher,100,student pencil front things changing just like when research 
1,Teacher,100,student enjoy reading passage 
1,Teacher,100,student want each little piece paper don't want write down what know about space okay 
1,Teacher,100,alright over want share partner first group goingthree work together work share what know about space okay each other quietly okay y'all turn each other show each other what know about space 
1,Teacher,100,student okay what's something today student ever used want look something very close really small what's something could 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah like magnifying glass many ever seen microscope 
1,Teacher,100,right student where microscope 
1,Teacher,100,already know about space good what want tell about space student 
1,Teacher,100,student correct went nasa well when younger different times kinds really cool equipment 
1,Teacher,100,student great time there well 
1,Teacher,100,student question asked about equipment article talking about moon like desert anything about moon being like desert when student 
1,Teacher,100,well that's great seems like learned something today anyone else know moon like desert 
1,Teacher,100,student isn't tell what know about space 
1,Teacher,100,student there's interesting stuff like gravity others 
1,Teacher,100,student like don't know necessarily possible read that's super cool where read 
1,Teacher,100,student possibly mean point time year anything could happen honestly wouldn't surprised next year something crazy everything happening 
1,Teacher,100,student tool give some examples tool debbie student hand raised give example tool 
1,Teacher,100,yeah absolutely that's absolutely right there anybody else wanted share tool 
1,Teacher,100,student wouldn't stranded right think about like station drive very need fill station station what allow fill student halfway through trip 
1,Teacher,100,student won't like student going beach halfway there's station turn back around right 
1,Teacher,100,student we'll just more keep going 
1,Teacher,100,student know least growing always most confident when came answering questions even knew know knew answer easy plus four maybe actually wouldn't 
1,Teacher,100,student answer fear ridicule from friends even teacher 
1,Teacher,100,student like 
1,Teacher,100,student look something that's smaller because didn't eyes 
1,Teacher,100,student like organisms 
1,Teacher,100,student knows what periodic element oxygen 
1,Teacher,100,student periodic element table there owed stands oxygen water on 
1,Teacher,100,student okay where left talking about elements water element periodic table 
1,Teacher,100,student know anywhere else might microscope 
1,Teacher,100,what oxygen tanks usually designed anybody know 
1,Teacher,100,student know what oxygen suits student classmates might 
1,Teacher,100,that's really cool fact student where read 
1,Teacher,100,student okay what about equipment that's talked about text

1,Teacher,100,student really favorite topics especially when student 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's great fact things think remember right like pounds something don't feel when student bouncing around moon right because gravity different 
1,Teacher,100,anybody know what water made what types molecules water made anybody know 
1,Teacher,100,student what some jobs what some some people usually investigate know 
1,Teacher,100,student yeah that's really good question there's much technology world times places without actually physically being there right we've seen cameras we've seen like 
1,Teacher,100,really student some what where else would explore that's outer space maybe actually yeah outer space what's another planet would explore really small machine could 
1,Teacher,100,that's cool student what about where would what planning would 
1,Teacher,100,student hydrogen part heard people talk about 
1,Teacher,100,student okay found there's there's some there's hydrogen there maybe part water would exciting right because there's water know

2,Teacher,200,good hear today group because going focus today's lesson which about scientific tool used moon 
2,Teacher,200,student other going talk about whether moon valuable resource people able live moon 
2,Teacher,200,there short reading gave guys questions just remind what questions i'll read loud guys first question what equipment scientist discover water moon student 
2,Teacher,200,okay we'll just work question number thank letting know guys will time write down student answers questions 
2,Teacher,200,class pulled into small group because think really good answering discussion question about water moon text want work each little more just make student responses more academic little longer student 
2,Teacher,200,going discussing trying expand more upon sentences would like just other passage student 
2,Teacher,200,think guys really great thinking while using text going around room give little feedback each student start 
2,Teacher,200,student know know about space isn't about learning about space about going work creating better responses when read text makes sense 
2,Teacher,200,student there's just things need work order create better responses better understanding text 
2,Teacher,200,here because concerns about each student guys's responses water moon passage going work improving student 
2,Teacher,200,student know about space doesn't really anything learning about space going about improving responses questions when read passage 
2,Teacher,200,student think about before actually look water microscope what equipment scientist discover water found moon microscope after found what find remember 
1,Teacher,200,student says nasa send small machine called lunar orbiter investigate question what equipment scientist discover water moon look afterwards make sense 
1,Teacher,200,student absolutely first like talk about question when word equipment what what mean what equipment mean 
1,Teacher,200,student absolutely asked write down student answer sheet paper what kind equipment will using 
1,Teacher,200,student vecause thinking about word evidence evidence basically just just means proof 
1,Teacher,200,student absolutely what evidence called text al evidence means student drawing student answer from source 
1,Teacher,200,student alright talking about sort evidence sort equipment scientist water find water evidence sort look 
1,Teacher,200,student specifically looking piece equipment used discover water find water 
1,Teacher,200,trying discover trying look student something tell 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah things really important think really cool experience article what specifically asking about water right 
1,Teacher,200,going tell about equipment that's used water what equipment main guys 
1,Teacher,200,student sent small machine called lunar orbiter investigate what small machine what's another word maybe that's question means same thing 
1,Teacher,200,good anybody know synonym word investigate 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah they're looking really closely they're looking they're discovering what order look really closely already found right 
1,Teacher,200,student when look back text trying figure what equipment scientist used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student look says what equipment think asking like title object 
1,Teacher,200,student student right look back question telling talk about what equipment find water crater what tool where using 
1,Teacher,200,student need find equipment used 
1,Teacher,200,student find water question wants know what equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student what equipment find 
1,Teacher,200,student used moon need figure exactly which piece equipment discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student need oxygen specifically talking about which piece equipment used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student specific tool equipment used 
1,Teacher,200,student question talks about equipment there another word equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student what ways being used 
1,Teacher,200,student useful 
1,Teacher,200,student would read unintellible where says nasa send small machine called lunar orbiter investigate because understand what question asking 
1,Teacher,200,student what equipment scientist discover water moon would student question question didn't anything about what found what find 
1,Teacher,200,student refer back question mention equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student think important word could equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student good okay word really want focus equipment discover 
1,Teacher,200,student scientists remember second word circled underline question discover paragraph says equipment discover water find water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student said when circled second word 
1,Teacher,200,student question need also look word discovered what discover discover action word something 
1,Teacher,200,words wanting guys find evidence valuable 
1,Teacher,200,student wonder asking about equipment that's kind like machine used discover know where asking about machine 
1,Teacher,200,student right equipment tool equipment another word tool when something that's same word tool would call synonym they're synonyms each other 
1,Teacher,200,student know difference explain difference between discovering looking 
1,Teacher,200,student when discover something ever seen before 
1,Teacher,200,student finding planning first time 
1,Teacher,200,student remember looking equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student discovering water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student doesn't tell what equipment used discover 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah looking specific tool used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student trying figure which used discover water plot twist 
1,Teacher,200,student someone raised hand tell what question asking what trying answer someone raise student hand what question asking 
1,Teacher,200,okay what equipment discover water that's what student saying 
1,Teacher,200,gotcha yeah that's really good question remember question being asked determine like student says equipment that's used discover water

1,Teacher,200,student what discover mean 
1,Teacher,200,student very good question focusing more what used find water specifically 
1,Teacher,200,student know there water moon scientist discovered question says there evidence water could valuable okay what think valuable means 
1,Teacher,200,student what think means 
1,Teacher,200,student okay awesome valuable means useful asking could water from moon useful okay 
1,Teacher,200,student think water from moon could useful scientist 
1,Teacher,200,student think 
1,Teacher,200,student when reading text student looking equipment text discussing know what equipment means know what word means 
1,Teacher,200,student looking some scientific terms remembers what term 
1,Teacher,200,student question there's term question looking 
1,Teacher,200,student water important because question about water 
1,Teacher,200,student what word already talked about water discover equipment right 
1,Teacher,200,student there word 
1,Teacher,200,student right convincing good there's more word science 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what evidence 
1,Teacher,200,student student right remember question just specifically asking discovered water equipment very important didn't need looking tool water 
1,Teacher,200,student feel like more student opinion based details facts student passage 
1,Teacher,200,student more student opinion based what gave passage 
1,Teacher,200,student teacheri feel like question phrased specifically talking about olive ice discovered water behind scenes like 
1,Teacher,200,student because question feel like little more specific what discovered water because could also argue astronaut discovered water 
1,Teacher,200,student right think question little wanting more specifics what olive ice actually discovered water 
1,Teacher,200,student might equipment might need equipment there think question actually asking holding tool hand right would discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student actual passage says water valuable resource then list whole bunch reasons know valuable think question really asking convinced there valuable 
1,Teacher,200,would very beautiful very find text student 
1,Teacher,200,student using information paragraph what equipment scientist find water investigate there water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student there convincing evidence remember convincing evidence means looking details article what says directly okay water moon could valuable 
1,Teacher,200,student tricky question okay because valuable definition gave article word 
1,Teacher,200,student what meaning valuable there 
1,Teacher,200,student right question asking what type equipment scientist used discover water moon what type equipment order-- there 
1,Teacher,200,student maybe there another machine mentioned discovered water know look water microscope discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student good glad recognize just oxygen when they're space look title talking about water space question asks 
1,Teacher,200,student question says what equipment where find 
1,Teacher,200,student okay agree used look water what find water 
1,Teacher,200,student talking about water talking about 
1,Teacher,200,student want specifically look question says there convincing evidence 
1,Teacher,200,what valuable mean maybe that's what need what mean valuable student 
1,Teacher,200,student talking about water moon that's little more depth just oxygen tank wanted talk 
1,Teacher,200,student question specifically says what equipment scientist discover water moon really important word question 
1,Teacher,200,student discover when discover something student looking 
1,Teacher,200,student investigate 
1,Teacher,200,student used well what machine what piece equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student trying trying find find water because what looked know where water 
1,Teacher,200,also talk about crater story whichbrought everybody little part story want talk about what found find water moon don't student 
1,Teacher,200,student before even look into text want look question question specifically asking what equipment scientist discover water 
1,Teacher,200,right there know want look some sort equipment based around water text evidence something wanted talk guys about 
1,Teacher,200,student text evidence going support student answers pull straight from text always know student answers close semi correct 
1,Teacher,200,student evidence really important word because means there's going proof passage want find proof question what equipment discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student right equipment such question specifically wants know what equipment discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student about word evidence word value 
1,Teacher,200,student evidence means going prove answer passage tells answer question will there convincing evidence will there we'll find 
1,Teacher,200,student ready come back answer want investigate some other answers first 
1,Teacher,200,student know sure paragraph tell scientist used 
1,Teacher,200,awesome student could rewrite student answer include piece information 
1,Teacher,200,okay question what equipment scientist sentence mentioned scientist actually microscope student 
1,Teacher,200,scientists yeah thinking about equipment studentstudent answer mentioned equipment 
1,Teacher,200,trying text text mention oxygen tanks student 
1,Teacher,200,student question both scientist actually equipment when working moon 
1,Teacher,200,absolutely student asked what equipment scientist discover water moon would answer using text al evidence 
1,Teacher,200,student student right talk about water look discussion question 
1,Teacher,200,student anything about equipment used 
1,Teacher,200,student need narrow down student answer more specific 
1,Teacher,200,okay student which what what where circle word 
1,Teacher,200,student what important word words circle question 
1,Teacher,200,just like student asked discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student when read deeper into passage answer gave else could found what other olive ice could used find water moon crater 
1,Teacher,200,student think could important express water valuable future 
1,Teacher,200,student equipment find water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah which really isn't telling 
1,Teacher,200,student what machine right 
1,Teacher,200,student find anything talking about oxygen 
1,Teacher,200,student scientists oxygen tanks discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,think student told about oxygen tanks oxygen tanks discover water moon something else 
1,Teacher,200,student okay know know much still don't know what used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student find evidence when looking answer different question 
1,Teacher,200,think student asking about equipment that's used water would need different equipment only just parts would help discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student think-- 
1,Teacher,200,student right that's looking 's answer said nasa send small machine what else could instead just small machine 
1,Teacher,200,student well yeah what else could student answer instead just saying small machine could made more depth answered more depth 
1,Teacher,200,student small machine could anything couldn't 
1,Teacher,200,student what else could student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student know what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,teacher know want student self position little when response like hard know what meant because maybe what grade student paper before grade student 
1,Teacher,200,student okay there's definitely some room improvement there gave some good information 
1,Teacher,200,student improvement tell what changes make 
1,Teacher,200,student depending size could lunar order maybe also small machine 
1,Teacher,200,just kind circle back little thinkwe've kind talked some other people student there feel about student answer giving another shot what might instead 
1,Teacher,200,student perfect what microscope attached 
1,Teacher,200,student didn't didn't actually name machine right 
1,Teacher,200,student look into student statement answer question 
1,Teacher,200,student that's going very valuable what else valuable there talks about there 
1,Teacher,200,student going information just part 
1,Teacher,200,student that's right what else what other purposes takes point answer 
1,Teacher,200,student right used what else 
1,Teacher,200,student right what know there's more think 
1,Teacher,200,very much student there's more 
1,Teacher,200,student right what would being able split hydrogen oxygen apart what benefit would give astronaut 
1,Teacher,200,that's good answer student just need little more detail 
1,Teacher,200,student would would work atmosphere right 
1,Teacher,200,student like discussing last session about what thought science fiction long time like wrinkle time actually happen possibly lifetime where they're able 
1,Teacher,200,student need into little more detail 
1,Teacher,200,student right water being moon future continue space journeys explorations then possibly water will very very valuable moon 
1,Teacher,200,student according think people actually moon time just send machine called lunar lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,200,student other ke word 
1,Teacher,200,student there could would great another reason look back people base don't need oxygen breathe 
1,Teacher,200,student would oxygen breathing what about hydrogen part would hydrogen useful 
1,Teacher,200,student student answers changed after discussing 's 's 's 
1,Teacher,200,student what what into little more detail 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah since they're small amounts going able like amount water earth 
1,Teacher,200,student good okay found piece equipment found tool used microscope used find water begin first machine find water 
1,Teacher,200,student think student answer wrong 
1,Teacher,200,same answer student follow along what just went 
1,Teacher,200,student okay oxygen tanks allows breathe better when they're moon 
1,Teacher,200,student well take microscope moon 
1,Teacher,200,student just want little clarification 
1,Teacher,200,student well yeah think about like what uses talks about microscope right microscope small right could talking about know oxygen tank wanted know specifically knew what equipment used know what mean 
1,Teacher,200,student needs clarified 
1,Teacher,200,student what 
1,Teacher,200,student okay could valuable astronaut 
1,Teacher,200,student right what think student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student okay think think take space hip could easier without weight water 
1,Teacher,200,student hold just said haven't moon 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah would valuable resource 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what mean what water essential 
1,Teacher,200,student right well yeah take literally essentially central take bath right essential drink water 
1,Teacher,200,student okay well read article question 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what question asking 
1,Teacher,200,question said circled same student actually read article 
1,Teacher,200,student mean already find water 
1,Teacher,200,there okay student where finding water 
1,Teacher,200,student microscope actually find water 
1,Teacher,200,student okay reasons could valuable 
1,Teacher,200,student okay read paragraph listen hear somewhere else 
1,Teacher,200,there other word important student 
1,Teacher,200,student okay need look closely means already found right 
1,Teacher,200,student okay nasa send small machine called lunar orbiter investigate look question answers what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student says good good don't carry ships an more that's some good information convince water moon valuable 
1,Teacher,200,student what think think that's partially convincing evidence water moon could valuable 
1,Teacher,200,student okay well just because can't right moment mean future wouldn't valuable what think 
1,Teacher,200,student maybe instead using word tool could different word what would another word 
1,Teacher,200,student expanding thinking want learn more okay important read discuss learn little more about water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student improve response what could improve response 
1,Teacher,200,anybody else answer question though need microscope water there water crater there just little water crater 
1,Teacher,200,student what discover before microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah before microscope what discover 
1,Teacher,200,student microscopes moon would maybe collect samples then we'll back earth 
1,Teacher,200,student type equipment used discover investigate water 
1,Teacher,200,student there better answer 
1,Teacher,200,student there type equipment might used investigate water 
1,Teacher,200,anyone know 
1,Teacher,200,student however best piece evidence grab from article 
1,Teacher,200,student okay just told water split into parts hydrogen oxygen tell information about moon about astronaut 
1,Teacher,200,student right after reading last paragraph just read 
1,Teacher,200,just like student mentioned some well equipment while that's true what used 
1,Teacher,200,sorry guys says would need scientific tool called microscope look really closely okay that's what nasa sent though student 
1,Teacher,200,student that's what sent 
1,Teacher,200,student used 
1,Teacher,200,student could restate question 
1,Teacher,200,student restate question answer know when student reciting 
1,Teacher,200,student question 
1,Teacher,200,student what will know number like somebody didn't know what what passage even about could read answer question know taught what talking about could restate question 
1,Teacher,200,student little deeper tell really valuable right 
1,Teacher,200,student think about feel valuable while little deeper tell going valuable while 
1,Teacher,200,student like things time money wasn't problem could know think about 
1,Teacher,200,know trying think about issues could important think about next time okay student 
1,Teacher,200,student fact water split telling anything about good space tell 
1,Teacher,200,student just says found evidence there water found water just evidence meaning seen water there mean there's 
1,Teacher,200,student whole whole thing article about about water moon think space uit could help find water just tool astronaut protect 
1,Teacher,200,student student answer talked about microscope being tool what microscope discover water used look water 
1,Teacher,200,student that's right examine water they're using microscope examine water equipment used discover 
1,Teacher,200,student okay water could other word could important 
1,Teacher,200,already telling valuablestudent know here weren't quite sure valuable resource heading first line already start identifying valuable resource 
1,Teacher,200,student says what equipment scientist used discover water moon small machine could mean anything 
1,Teacher,200,student understand what student saying same time student able find water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student moving forward could very valuable 
1,Teacher,200,right what oxygen tank student 
1,Teacher,200,student astronauts could what water 
1,Teacher,200,student there water moon help 
1,Teacher,200,student mean example small machine could sort mean could anything know from maybe even remote even clock wall can't sort discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student example need need water live earth 
1,Teacher,200,student able know perhaps expand know space traveling capabilities able actually water moon might little more inexpensive inexpensive actually transport 
1,Teacher,200,anybody might know another reason might actually sort beneficial water moon might actually help astronaut 
1,Teacher,200,student think perhaps like said perhaps future there enough evidence know know least going forward some type know human habitation there surface moon water become more valuable live there 
1,Teacher,200,student okay when answer something think sometimes maybe little more specific there's confusion 
1,Teacher,200,student think took student answer send small machine which student correctly what else could make little more clear somebody idea what student talking about 
1,Teacher,200,student okay could what machine what what machine here being used 
1,Teacher,200,student need expand upon some answers 
1,Teacher,200,student scientific tool called microscope microscope what show 
1,Teacher,200,student when look student answer oxygen tanks equipment used discover water 
1,Teacher,200,yeah then also when talking student 
1,Teacher,200,student just need support 
1,Teacher,200,absolutely look back some answers looked question what equipment scientist used discover water moon answers microscope small machine then some other equipment which answer makes most sense what would found moon student 
1,Teacher,200,student student time look back what equipment passage 
1,Teacher,200,student said nasa sent small machine what word find what word what pieces equipment find 
1,Teacher,200,student microscope wasn't best choice 
1,Teacher,200,student because microscope tool fact 
1,Teacher,200,student makes sense able they're saying look really closely water would need tool discover another word find water only other piece equipment text small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student right microscope help water what's thing helps water first place 
1,Teacher,200,student point nasa small machine microscope small machine right 
1,Teacher,200,student question would know water valuable even split what parts would question 
1,Teacher,200,student there other ways which water that's found moon 
1,Teacher,200,student think other reasons water would valuable resource because based what we've talked about today 
1,Teacher,200,student would change student answer want keep same what student already down 
1,Teacher,200,student okay water important many since article about water says whole time throughout article 
1,Teacher,200,student need oxygen tanks moon 
1,Teacher,200,student that's true very true people moon though 
1,Teacher,200,student people moon article what just read anything about people being moon article 
1,Teacher,200,student true there title machine there name machine number 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah after number where student answer read rest response rest article 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah talk about using microscope equipment what used moon there microscope there moon look need something else before could microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student used microscope what name machine needed space remember 
1,Teacher,200,student what 
1,Teacher,200,student underline 
1,Teacher,200,student time share person beside would like person each group share answers groupwant view give what word guys underlying question 
1,Teacher,200,student question wondering student answer wasn't best answer correct 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah okay know student answer could wasn't best answer 
1,Teacher,200,student what word could underline question help answer best answer 
1,Teacher,200,student okay like underline equipment good word underline correct there another word question help under help answer question 
1,Teacher,200,depth tell what word guys underline 
1,Teacher,200,student could more specific answering student student answer
1,Teacher,200,student could more specific student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student teacherr could look back 
1,Teacher,200,student find answer 
1,Teacher,200,student no ice anything could more specific student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student talking about equipment anything from microscope giant rocket anything 
1,Teacher,200,yeah guess student also soften student answer water microscopicjust from lunar orbiter above above moon special kind equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student after after reading paragraph three think able water eyes 
1,Teacher,200,anyone want share what circled 
1,Teacher,200,okay student find anything helps change student answer circling word question 
1,Teacher,200,student able find paragraph where talking about answers 
1,Teacher,200,think student answer answers question student 
1,Teacher,200,student think there's another part student answer other small microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student student text doesn't there astronaut 
1,Teacher,200,student there able observe said water 
1,Teacher,200,student used order find water don't think quite 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah maybe look back down student answer which there full water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student completely accurate 
1,Teacher,200,want guys after student talked student partners student group members circled underline terms text student questions guys think could reconstruct student answer just little more detailed 
1,Teacher,200,student remember uses microscope humans look through microscope right scientist look through microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student remember what called machine science sorts wacky names machine that's what looking looking find name what small machine 
1,Teacher,200,student totally yeah look text look back think close same line about small machine sure know 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah totally microscope look three sentences here three paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student paragraph three says water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able looking straight would need scientific cool tool called microscope look really closely there's part microscope before then 
1,Teacher,200,student where found called lunar orbiter paragraph right 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah what machine call 
1,Teacher,200,student tiny water well love lunar orbiter going into polar crater looking small water where's small water located 
1,Teacher,200,student what form like 
1,Teacher,200,student looking giant lake looking what yeah well what form water what same text part don't 
1,Teacher,200,student what equipment okay looking name what's name small machine came 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah think there even very short text different pieces equipment mentioned right 
1,Teacher,200,student third paragraph tell scientist used microscope find water 
1,Teacher,200,awesome student which piece equipment think most important here 
1,Teacher,200,student awesome little machine lands moon 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah that's right doesn't really scientist using 
1,Teacher,200,yeah that's awesome text both found text question what small machine student what machine 
1,Teacher,200,student alright sound 
1,Teacher,200,student could yeah look something discover 
1,Teacher,200,talking about what equipment maybe equipment name right what small machine name anybody anybody circle what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student microscope great example piece equipment also thing called lunar orbiter investigate things work together 
1,Teacher,200,looking both sentences guys want look student sheet paper student looking word lunar orbiter microscope there word kind signal what equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student there second part sentence tells maybe what called like name equipment 
1,Teacher,200,going paragraph going read while reading looking student 
1,Teacher,200,student going look paragraph okay just want listen while reading find particular equipment might stop talk about okay 
1,Teacher,200,student means moon still drier driest desert earth water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able looking straight 
1,Teacher,200,need scientific toll called microscope look really closely what microscope helping guys 
1,Teacher,200,student because passage look back find says nasa sent small machine called looper lunar orbiter investigate lunar orbiter look deposit large polar crater what name machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student small machine look back what that's called read sentence okay number nasa sent small machine called lunar orbiter investigate 
1,Teacher,200,student what microscope what microscope text 
1,Teacher,200,find water before look right anyone know what discover means 
1,Teacher,200,student right discover when find find first going lunar orbiter find before look 
1,Teacher,200,student okay microscope discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student need scientific tool called microscope look very closely 
1,Teacher,200,student look back student passage what equipment find water 
1,Teacher,200,student look number 
1,Teacher,200,student lunar orbiter look deposit large polar crater deposit very small what what 
1,Teacher,200,student back text specific answers from text what equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student need back into text find specifically where states what equipment used discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student back into text look 
1,Teacher,200,student says text back look 
1,Teacher,200,student text 
1,Teacher,200,back look what's another word student 
1,Teacher,200,student small machine right what name machine 
1,Teacher,200,student look what what says astronaut 
1,Teacher,200,student water main 
1,Teacher,200,student what astronaut water 
1,Teacher,200,student what text about astronaut water should under bottle water valuable source valid valuable resource what 
1,Teacher,200,student right hydrogen oxygen 
1,Teacher,200,student back think second paragraph you'll nasa sent small machine called lunar orbiter investigate lunar orbiter look deposit large polar crater 
1,Teacher,200,student that's where found think right 
1,Teacher,200,student landed moon south pole that's where found looked deposit since wasn't necessarily water frozen water look large polar crater guess really cold 
1,Teacher,200,underlined equipment discover great tell just reading passage student tell what word equipment might refer passage what kind equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student deposits what tell what says deposit very small 
1,Teacher,200,very small they're looking something very small they're take lunar orbiter there also read paragraph three student 
1,Teacher,200,student word could that's second sentence circle word could student pencil will second sentence paragraph four says could useful lots ways 
1,Teacher,200,student would think word useful also same maybe valuable look back paragraph telling could useful 
1,Teacher,200,student stop second what first paragraph tells know 
1,Teacher,200,student okay someone paraphrase paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah what would deposit what think would look like 
1,Teacher,200,student tool because deposit small can't student eyes tool microscope able 
1,Teacher,200,student okay moisture that's still bigger moisture found moon frost naked what found moon would even able tell there without lunar orbiter microscope being able 
1,Teacher,200,student okay think water moon look same glass water would drink 
1,Teacher,200,student paragraph three what about 
1,Teacher,200,student when when says able 
1,Teacher,200,student what right after 
1,Teacher,200,student good glass water lunch can't wait there's something glass 
1,Teacher,200,student what tell water moon what compared water here 
1,Teacher,200,student well might because found crater there might lots there small can't naked know turned before naked yeah 
1,Teacher,200,student think lunar orbiter being able 
1,Teacher,200,student because remember paragraph three says wouldn't able water 
1,Teacher,200,student found there 
1,Teacher,200,student right passage only talking about 
1,Teacher,200,student what found moon there anything passage talks about oxygen 
1,Teacher,200,student lunar orbiter helped find water want look paragraph three 
1,Teacher,200,student what about water paragraph three 
1,Teacher,200,student what need find can't 
1,Teacher,200,student look paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student fourth sentence look down four sentence 
1,Teacher,200,student right here ounces 
1,Teacher,200,student would though word water take surface which 
1,Teacher,200,student couldn't even describe would trucks trucks loads topsoil okay upload moon still would only fill glass 
1,Teacher,200,student would like look back student paragraph find 
1,Teacher,200,student answer 
1,Teacher,200,okay student correct nasa sand small machine look back student paragraph find name machine 
1,Teacher,200,okay anybody paragraph four word valuable actually beginning paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student lunar orbiter different called lunar orbiter what 
1,Teacher,200,student discover water microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student look back paragraph second 
1,Teacher,200,sent orbiter look clues didn't talk anyone moon sent lunar look clues what find lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,200,student lunar orbiter discovering orbiting looking around used investigate 
1,Teacher,200,student remind what investigating means 
1,Teacher,200,student good look clues order figure there water moon 
1,Teacher,200,also water firsthand what water student 
1,Teacher,200,able relate what student saying where lunar orbiter what actually discover water microscope what study water 
1,Teacher,200,student right discover water lunar orbiter okay someone raise student hand tell some other equipment we've talked about reading 
1,Teacher,200,student what we've talked about lunar lunar orbiter we've talked about microscope there other equipment they've talked about 
1,Teacher,200,student what read what read paragraph there other equipment discussed paragraph read 
1,Teacher,200,student exactly right send small machine know what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student okay want look back passage figure what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,okay many guys looking word water passage 
1,Teacher,200,student whenever looking passage able read understand moon same thing water 
1,Teacher,200,lunar orbiter paragraph says look deposit large polar crater deposit very small answer help student 
1,Teacher,200,student look back text where text find word look word machine machine there 
1,Teacher,200,student exactly exactly back look text 
1,Teacher,200,student what looking 
1,Teacher,200,student asking text field like back text there's piece equipment used looking water right 
1,Teacher,200,student right exactly think microscope help look water while they're physically moon 
1,Teacher,200,student right look text lunar orbiter right 
1,Teacher,200,microscopes both there when talking specifically about finding water look back text find where says film equipment used find water moon yeah student 
1,Teacher,200,student back text look first part where they're talking about piece equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student they've talked about moon being desert right think there's water 
1,Teacher,200,student then looking what 
1,Teacher,200,student well looking water moon right 
1,Teacher,200,student what about lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,200,student okay think little more about questions because says word essential student answer word equipment word water think about word before make answer 
1,Teacher,200,read said student said scientist used equipment like oxygen tanks question asking about what using moon something savanah 
1,Teacher,200,student what think microscope look really closely what think need look things really closely 
1,Teacher,200,student that's amazing really know what something microscope something really really really small right 
1,Teacher,200,student example think microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student read text 
1,Teacher,200,student even little more basic there what equipment talk about text what what what's getting used 
1,Teacher,200,very good very good glad student seeing take look back student no ice paragraph could some insight take back what sort equipment mentioned specifically paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student also part getting moon about searching there we've whole elaborate backstory right what makes very interesting read 
1,Teacher,200,student while there some water there might whole might buckets buckets buckets oceans water 
1,Teacher,200,student make sure speaking nasa they're ones sent lunar orbiter right 
1,Teacher,200,student they're ones microscope look small small know article water when find moon know they're kind subject they're kind article talking about right 
1,Teacher,200,student that's part actually goes down look very closely need figure found water crater correct 
1,Teacher,200,student once take quick glance 
1,Teacher,200,student what find 
1,Teacher,200,student right what text tell about 
1,Teacher,200,student correct what's small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student what nasa sent will look going help read okay nasa send small machine what just first little text tell 
1,Teacher,200,student right what called 
1,Teacher,200,student what about water split into 
1,Teacher,200,student what could possibly water used 
1,Teacher,200,nasa said small machine pulled from second paragraph everyone will look back second paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,discovered student later they're going other equipment right they've discovered water later study deeper 
1,Teacher,200,student into water right want look closely that's what passage says tell want look really closely paragraph three going need another tool called 
1,Teacher,200,student microscope microscope scientist using equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student scientists using equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student using microscope what microscope helping scientist 
1,Teacher,200,student right correct using microscope study look deeper into water first find water equipment small lunar orbiter that's what passage about 
1,Teacher,200,student then later passage learned used other equipment study water deeper 
1,Teacher,200,student where find passage 
1,Teacher,200,student well microscope able look microscopic things moon find water digging equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student right important thing separated oxygen astronaut could breathe also fuel hydrogen oxygen separate into atoms make fuel 
1,Teacher,200,student remember atmosphere what breathe oxygen and-- 
1,Teacher,200,student moon doesn't oxygen 
1,Teacher,200,student well rockets hydrogen will break into-- breaks down able make rocket fuel which help space rafts move like story like cars know 
1,Teacher,200,student helps student without student won't just like rocket fuel which made different strands hydrogen also some oxygen would fill tank move throughout space 
1,Teacher,200,student water heavy there water moon then wouldn't carry which would drain fuel supply would also take space spacecraft being able stop somewhere pick water better carry around time water heavy 
1,Teacher,200,student okay look look back reading says nasa send small machine called lunar orbiter investigate 
1,Teacher,200,student there isn't said didn't clearly there people there would assume well would just machine called lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,200,student look back paragraph take moment look back paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student then paragraph threee says found water found microscopic meaning super small microscope look 
1,Teacher,200,okay water paragraph okay what different form water there's different forms water there's frozen form what called student 
1,Teacher,200,student just different form just water different form frozen solid 
1,Teacher,200,student okay look back text real quick 
1,Teacher,200,student when discover something student correct doesn't doesn't discover 
1,Teacher,200,student right know people earth water live water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student don't worry about bringing water could just drink water moon stay hydrated 
1,Teacher,200,student second sentence correct right water broken down into parts hydrogen oxygen 
1,Teacher,200,student important what's reason would want break down what reason wanted break down water into hydrogen oxygen what could hydrogen oxygen 
1,Teacher,200,student look paragraph five 
1,Teacher,200,student could split water hydrogen oxygen rocket fuel that's could moon leave from moon right that's another reason water could such valuable commodity 
1,Teacher,200,student nope because we've more 
1,Teacher,200,student perfect okay want start looking over question paragraph okay look paragraph passage 
1,Teacher,200,anybody tell heard something sentences just read sounds like might answer question what equipment used 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what seeing paragraph three second sentence starts saying 
1,Teacher,200,student water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able looking straight student need scientific tool called microscope look really closely 
1,Teacher,200,student that's very good question what going considered look back little further before microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student perfect okay i'll read second sentence after tell what nasa send investigate tell what called 
1,Teacher,200,student know scientist back paragraph found there water moon because crater find crater remember happened just read little part 
1,Teacher,200,student about oxygen tanks find maybe another type equipment might used help find water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student says means moon still drier driest desert earth water found microscopic meaning wouldn't able even student looking straight 
1,Teacher,200,student there oxygen tanks microscope there that's what says 
1,Teacher,200,student well look first paragraph could read 
1,Teacher,200,student correct crater where full water water below crater 
1,Teacher,200,student student correct four glasses water water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student very much think could fill crater 
1,Teacher,200,student they're they're full there's such tiny amount water almost special tool 
1,Teacher,200,student student right lunar lunar orbiter find water moon find water little water 
1,Teacher,200,student think really great starting answers just want really work looking text little more make answers more complete built text al evidence reading 
1,Teacher,200,student think different strengths here just want really prac ice just like knowing content also being able skill backing responses text evidence from text 
1,Teacher,200,student okay think part what right isn't just about knowledge what learning 
1,Teacher,200,first thing want talk about when here group want think what question asking what what mean circle evidence yeah student 
1,Teacher,200,student lunar orbiter will land moon south pole look deposit large polar crater deposit very small scientist said lastudent moon surface would hold total about ounces water what deposit 
1,Teacher,200,student some really great responses going make sure answers proven from text 
1,Teacher,200,student text tells astronaut using water from moon need back into text figure think water moon could valuable 
1,Teacher,200,student well learn some more 
1,Teacher,200,thank joining small group table guys appreciate answers gave ahead review some things we've talked about 
1,Teacher,200,student well great know about space going specifically talk about moon water found moon 
1,Teacher,200,going look questions okay want just want guys look together deeper understanding reading passage 
1,Teacher,200,student want look deeper into question asked okay because struggled little giving specific answer question okay 
1,Teacher,200,everybody want challenge think about answer right find evidence text support answer student what's going 
1,Teacher,200,excited excited about space challenge back into reading think about response gave read discussion question student 
1,Teacher,200,student figure look back story figure more depth answer 
1,Teacher,200,student need every student classmate right explain need look another answer okay 
1,Teacher,200,wanted kind dive into here want make sure same page kind understanding test text full extent student 
1,Teacher,200,should look responses kind where grow where improve understanding article read about something really cool really excited talk guys about 
1,Teacher,200,student more specific response 
1,Teacher,200,student well together just looking article closely together 
1,Teacher,200,student just what take away from just reading then discussion just together just looking little reading together 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what wanted pull back here about because even though might information we've learned other places about space reading text specifically mission finding water moon correct 
1,Teacher,200,question what equipment used find water student found different types equipment used background knowledge that's exactly what question asking okay look deeper into question okay yeah 
1,Teacher,200,student want just thank much answers given here just clarify answer best work around arrive more suitable answer okay 
1,Teacher,200,left where trying actually locate answer from passage going just briefly recap looking word student 
1,Teacher,200,going focus elaborating answers okay okay okay alright concern while guys student text answer question 
1,Teacher,200,okay well going work together team answer question team effort just person answering okay 
1,Teacher,200,just diving deeper into text team everyone same page 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah what's some strategies find answer question knows strategy 
1,Teacher,200,student case that's what going take look student answers 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah well always good background knowledge space that's really cool student interested always learn names machine y things like that's read passage together hopes would learn more 
1,Teacher,200,student okay think just wanted just deeper discussion 
1,Teacher,200,student question what equipment scientist discover water feel like just wanted just discussion what thought answers 
1,Teacher,200,student okay student we've reading about water moon talked about moon desert going think little thorough okay know what thorough 
1,Teacher,200,student talking about moon desert right answered student questions going discuss understand questions going discuss listen friends responses 
1,Teacher,200,student okay going think strategies ways improve answer okay find word 
1,Teacher,200,student writing going help connect learn 
1,Teacher,200,student better okay want want process going 
1,Teacher,200,student reflect answer think improve response 
1,Teacher,200,student good thing here talk about information we've just read learning about 
1,Teacher,200,okay right great here's what guys going talk about skill skill circling underlining word from question text okay what question someone read 
1,Teacher,200,okay look back student answer real quick going through each student responses okay look student response first what 
1,Teacher,200,we've already read text about moon class just want talk guys about some student answers student questions discover more answers think more deeply about passage sound good guys student 
1,Teacher,200,student want really focus what says article today want learn more details about scientist especially moon 
1,Teacher,200,right student best answering question some really went into detail pulling specific sentences from text want specific answer remember discussion question is-- student 
1,Teacher,200,well that's very statement because don't even know about space space broad there's many unanswered questions think eager learn about didn't even know about water moon though might think might know some stuff sure there's something might could gain from think very beneficial student group 
1,Teacher,200,student going look some student answers ways could improve some some strengths many student answers 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah wonderful buddy going talk just little more about text evidence help questions want look question number 
1,Teacher,200,right probably extensive knowledge outer space through know stuff group focus 
1,Teacher,200,student extracting information from from informative text that's main goal what working together suppose will start 
1,Teacher,200,well sometimes feel student might some knowledge wasn't really covered inside text maybe student other friends group learn from 
1,Teacher,200,student work learn from each other kind discuss what we've read questions teacher name will gladly answer okay 
1,Teacher,200,really great responses reason kind small group kind build responses although asks what equipment scientist discover water moon there's little more could probably answers help better make sense 
1,Teacher,200,student well good what going today look article previous read called water moon going look discussion question regards what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student what just kind around room just raise student hand i'll call then look student response kind figure where came response saying correct could little work will just kind raise student hand i'll call 
1,Teacher,200,student today what hope kind come together work some strategies kind hone answer specifically wanting okay 
1,Teacher,200,student well hope student right think through second question will able make sure understand kind really dive deeper into question find evidence from text sound good 
1,Teacher,200,because just yeah just looking space looking well read text just working group kind share knowledge each other okay 
1,Teacher,200,bits pieces there anybody want volunteer first where kind critique through answers look find maybe some more detail support answer 
1,Teacher,200,good seen student responses discussion question wanted talk about came know answers student 
1,Teacher,200,wanted over discussion question answer student 
1,Teacher,200,student great alright what talking about student student article student passage what equipment scientist discover water moon student talking about space 
1,Teacher,200,student reason looking back over student answers want help better understanding space exactly there water moon 
1,Teacher,200,want little deeper into question figure exactly what they're talking about expand some ideas y'all write down student answers 
1,Teacher,200,guys some really great work some good answer ch ice don't feel complete understanding what question asking firstly what want 
1,Teacher,200,student okay first want make sure clear understanding what question actually asking 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah well that's good corrected student answer going look going deeper together figure more precise answer something little more evidence okay 
1,Teacher,200,no ice changed student answer going hang like what changed student answer going some what thought student answer going help other people group same thought process okay 
1,Teacher,200,student okay when reading question found ke word trying find word back text know what answer give 
1,Teacher,200,okay well going work reading comprehension group 
1,Teacher,200,student today want work finding 
1,Teacher,200,student ke word questions help better answer questions 
1,Teacher,200,student think able work together kind pull resource there come right answer 
1,Teacher,200,going group learn together discuss what read 
1,Teacher,200,just group discussion we've read 
1,Teacher,200,okay well group help each other learn 
1,Teacher,200,student seems like some understanding what trying find quite there just what like like around read little little person time then going work through question together sound like plan 
1,Teacher,200,student fantastic love amount enthusiasm real quick before begin would like just address thing tell students whenever walk into classroom first time 
1,Teacher,200,student thing like mention students like mention well philosophy answering questions might weird thing hear like mistakes 
1,Teacher,200,that's weird thing hear teacher save right like mistakes student probably going hear many make mistakes student 
1,Teacher,200,guys bring back together group answers changed based student group discussion 
1,Teacher,200,want make sure everybody really good understanding lunar orbiter helped discover microscopic water 
1,Teacher,200,student okay well want focus student attention article just read going examine article determine scientist gone about finding water crater moon 
1,Teacher,200,student well guess what going learn some things today might find something didn't know 
1,Teacher,200,point group just elaborate more guys 
1,Teacher,200,just wanted talk about answers kind where guys student answers from 
1,Teacher,200,well collectively talk each other wanted aspect another persons answer well guys could totally about getting different parts 
1,Teacher,200,student what kind hoping from search text kind show what learned from text 
1,Teacher,200,group just going focus some things read change answers better reading sound good student 
1,Teacher,200,tweak little improve adjust student sentences just show understand what text saying just wanted guys examples exactly from text know guys easy time reading 
1,Teacher,200,okay well today going experiment different kinds groups know about space then maybe help student table mates probably don't know much sounds good student 
1,Teacher,200,good hear today group because going focus today's lesson which about scientific tool used moon 
1,Teacher,200,student other going talk about whether moon valuable resource people able live moon 
1,Teacher,200,there short reading gave guys questions just remind what questions i'll read loud guys first question what equipment scientist discover water moon student 
1,Teacher,200,okay we'll just work question number thank letting know guys will time write down student answers questions 
1,Teacher,200,class pulled into small group because think really good answering discussion question about water moon text want work each little more just make student responses more academic little longer student 
1,Teacher,200,going discussing trying expand more upon sentences would like just other passage student 
1,Teacher,200,think guys really great thinking while using text going around room give little feedback each student start 
1,Teacher,200,student know know about space isn't about learning about space about going work creating better responses when read text makes sense 
1,Teacher,200,student there's just things need work order create better responses better understanding text 
1,Teacher,200,here because concerns about each student guys's responses water moon passage going work improving student 
1,Teacher,200,student know about space doesn't really anything learning about space going about improving responses questions when read passage 
1,Teacher,200,reason five today because some concerns about student responses would like address improve guys better understand 
1,Teacher,200,#NAME?
1,Teacher,200,everyone today heard read water moon correct anyone everyone read want revise answers because understanding didn't deep deep understanding going today want one-- student 
1,Teacher,200,everyone today going revising answers from question what equipment scientist discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,everyone good understanding reading want work answers just little because think getting little confused between aspects first before share answers student want independently minute look question 
1,Teacher,200,student well really want work because want hear what student answer want know what make even better 
1,Teacher,200,think maybe guys good understanding text think little deeper relate text student answers pull evidence from text 
1,Teacher,200,student from reading 
1,Teacher,200,student however think important sometimes even know material think good work word things just really working answering questions skills really helpful 
1,Teacher,200,student true however today using science 
1,Teacher,200,student drive reading skills actually going using science reading about science about 
1,Teacher,200,guys done going using reading 
1,Teacher,200,student going reviewing responses questions 
1,Teacher,200,student actually going using reading work reading skills going learning also- about science 
1,Teacher,200,student also going learning work reading writing skills 
1,Teacher,200,student work break down questions such 
1,Teacher,200,student think more work answers make little more expectation using specific language 
1,Teacher,200,text uses well just working writing skills like said student earlier just working science skills also working reading writing skills 
1,Teacher,200,yeah also using today only reading help know little more about space like student knows about 
1,Teacher,200,student also going using reading learn prac ice reading writing skills understanding break down 
1,Teacher,200,student information might even know about stuff 
1,Teacher,200,just want make sure everybody using right language everybody understands find find evidence answer such student student hand well 
1,Teacher,200,student about right wrong here right about building response strengthening text al evidence looking ideas question 
1,Teacher,200,like where where found answer text student 
1,Teacher,200,student read line where found story what 
1,Teacher,200,yeah student more about where found text said 
1,Teacher,200,student read article because sure really need answer because circled same 
1,Teacher,200,student chance back look find same answer find something different 
1,Teacher,200,student maybe other equipment might used just find oxygen excuse just find water moon what some other points made passage read what some other points made 
1,Teacher,200,what makes think student based passage what makes think evidence convincing 
1,Teacher,200,student tell read paragraph where says 
1,Teacher,200,student scientists equipment like oxygen tanks where find evidence 
1,Teacher,200,student where paragraph talk about scientist equipment like oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,200,student great tell where what found 
1,Teacher,200,student talk about student answer said scientist found crater full water moon what paragraph tell happened 
1,Teacher,200,student help find passage where talks about oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,200,that's right good lunar orbiter tell what paragraph found student 
1,Teacher,200,student find answer text 
1,Teacher,200,told circled same answer student want challenge find text where says where talks about microscope because 
1,Teacher,200,coming back what student told about look discover that's little confusing which verb using paragraph look discover 
1,Teacher,200,student where reading find some evidence answer question 
1,Teacher,200,will refer back student article back student reading would love know where think might find answer equipment discover water student student hand 
1,Teacher,200,student could please read paragraph read sentence where think answers question about what kind equipment using discover water 
1,Teacher,200,wonderful okaystudent answer change would would answer still believe paragraph three 
1,Teacher,200,student think moon moon very 
1,Teacher,200,student find crater full water just looking water find 
1,Teacher,200,perfect student where tell what paragraph found 
1,Teacher,200,student just provided microscope look really closely what looking closely good though 
1,Teacher,200,right well think about student should look very closely water molecules without microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student where read text 
1,Teacher,200,student responses front curious know what evidence circle tech going around would like share evidence used student start 
1,Teacher,200,student what evidence 
1,Teacher,200,student what evidence circle 
1,Teacher,200,student what evidence circle help answer 
1,Teacher,200,want hear from student really quicklywhat evidence find able circle specific evidence text help 
1,Teacher,200,what name small machine anybody know 
1,Teacher,200,student what piece evidence thought about some evidence said water could valuable 
1,Teacher,200,water split different elements right student where find text 
1,Teacher,200,student good okay where find text talked about microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student that's okay could read sentence thinking tell that's where found student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student where found student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student that's paragraph talk about piece equipment used 
1,Teacher,200,student there other equipment think used discover water could look back text think about what actually discovered water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student know what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student right what what part text read gave impression 
1,Teacher,200,well student answer says microscope look really closely what looking closely what focus like looking something really small really student 
1,Teacher,200,student could what something moon could look moon said moon desert what else could look desert 
1,Teacher,200,well didn't student answer wrong technically correct send small machine what kind small machine send tell student 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student remember what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student found some more details reading about what machine called 
1,Teacher,200,no ice student said nasa sent small machinelook back text recall what name small machine nasa sent 
1,Teacher,200,student looking paragraph moment specifically answer question what name small machine nasa sent investigate 
1,Teacher,200,student where article doesn't talk about oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,200,student okay from student text says would need what water 
1,Teacher,200,student okay student want talk microscope what paragraph reading talk about microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student what happened study small deposit 
1,Teacher,200,student figure what name small machine 
1,Teacher,200,student just into more detail about what else what other equipment might used other just microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student right what nasa send order microscope 
1,Teacher,200,what guys think about where evidence might help question 
1,Teacher,200,anybody remember what name machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student okay understand what equipment used 
1,Teacher,200,student also read paragraph what else what other equipment should other tool 
1,Teacher,200,student what else read 
1,Teacher,200,student what tell from information just gave what other tool might using learn about water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student tell needed microscope find water 
1,Teacher,200,student deposits very small seem like water little water 
1,Teacher,200,student using equipment what 
1,Teacher,200,student right microscope discover water 
1,Teacher,200,student that's right where find passage show where found 
1,Teacher,200,student investigate right investigate evidence what using investigate evidence 
1,Teacher,200,student what some things water could used moon like says paragraph four five 
1,Teacher,200,look back some details student 
1,Teacher,200,student right actually discover water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student right mention paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student didn't find student answer from paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student what lame lunar orbiter keep sentence 
1,Teacher,200,student where water when heavy read sentence 
1,Teacher,200,student here's find specifically where water heavy 
1,Teacher,200,student what what small machine called 
1,Teacher,200,student good said sent machine what machine 
1,Teacher,200,student okay said lunar orbiter look what deposit 
1,Teacher,200,student talk about much water find 
1,Teacher,200,student whole machine given name place where given name 
1,Teacher,200,student choose tags 
1,Teacher,200,student what else think would looking moon 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what reading tell possibly could oxygen tanks what tell story 
1,Teacher,200,student where pull oxygen tanks from text discovering water 
1,Teacher,200,student well said scientist equipment like oxygen when responding what equipment scientist discover water moon where find student answer from text which paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student right when student looking what type machine stuff look water when student looking three paragraph where where would find information paragraph specifically 
1,Teacher,200,student word would paragraph just skimming 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what what what kind evidence circle text 
1,Teacher,200,student said sent small machine what what piece evidence circle 
1,Teacher,200,student okay well what paragraph think find 
1,Teacher,200,student talked about astronaut water stay hydrated like said cannot survive without water where come answer find answer 
1,Teacher,200,student what looking closely 
1,Teacher,200,student alright look student paragraph three where talk about discover there 
1,Teacher,200,student good okay talked about nasa sending small machine look back text what send small machine 
1,Teacher,200,student teacherbut what equipment think used find what read article about equipment used 
1,Teacher,200,student find text there back text where found 
1,Teacher,200,student what lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,200,student investigate what discover when used small machine investigate what discover 
1,Teacher,200,student look what look things 
1,Teacher,200,okay that's very goodstudent where found student evidence well 
1,Teacher,200,student okay sent small machine where 
1,Teacher,200,student that's type equipment what else equipment what 
1,Teacher,200,student masks suits mentioned anywhere article 
1,Teacher,200,student look sentence where found small machine ahead read whole sentence where small machine included 
1,Teacher,200,want guys take second locate 
1,Teacher,200,text where found small machine microscope want guys tell what paragraph text small machine microscope 
1,Teacher,200,student oxygen tanks okay ahead locate well 
1,Teacher,200,student look microscope find where find microscope there 
1,Teacher,200,yeah student where find student answer lunar orbiter text find 
1,Teacher,200,student only paragraph provides convincing evidence 
1,Teacher,200,student where else somebody found something that's convincing evidence 
1,Teacher,200,student what what what parts going used going oxygen going hydrogen 
1,Teacher,200,where student answer from student 
1,Teacher,200,student where find student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student from passage because mentioned oxygen tanks other things from passage what some specific pieces equipment passage 
1,Teacher,200,student used microscope look closely what send moon 
1,Teacher,200,student said scientist lots equipment like oxygen tanks what using 
1,Teacher,200,student very good find answer look back text using student ke word 
1,Teacher,200,gotcha want everyone take second into reading circle where found student answer 
1,Teacher,200,okay student where find text support student answer

1,Teacher,200,okay student underline paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,okay student underline paragraph 
1,Teacher,200,student where come student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student said nasa sent small machine could tell maybe what small machine where found expert except story 
1,Teacher,200,favor look back student text help understand what conclusion what made need scientific lly tool called microscope fact everybody look back text where found student answer help understand what what conclusion when each person 
1,Teacher,200,student found 
1,Teacher,200,student ahead read where passage 
1,Teacher,200,student favor back into text help understand what student conclusion 
1,Teacher,200,student sure favor which paragraph find information about crater 
1,Teacher,200,student would mind going back text finding while student looking 
1,Teacher,200,student help help student asked find where found student information text where'd 
1,Teacher,200,student ahead refer text find text al evidence support fact need small machine 
1,Teacher,200,student well think could maybe find what machine student talking about inside student text 
1,Teacher,200,student tell where text said there crater full water moon 
1,Teacher,200,okay going coming miss student said sent small machine send small machine find paragraph sent small machine what used 
1,Teacher,200,student okay yeah okay would mind reading section passage where found answer 
1,Teacher,200,could share student section mentioned tool 
1,Teacher,200,student want describe where text found 
1,Teacher,200,student okay what text makes think 
1,Teacher,200,student find evidence using masks suits text 
1,Teacher,200,student student response question said need scientific tool called microscope look really closely what 
1,Teacher,200,student using microscope piece equipment 
1,Teacher,200,student where text find nasa sent small machine 
1,Teacher,200,student ready remove show evidence could 
1,Teacher,200,question what equipment scientist discover water moon talked about nasa send something there place text where found student 
1,Teacher,200,going each question question where reference test text from student answer answer question question student 
1,Teacher,200,student easy don't start where find student answer text 
1,Teacher,200,student questions asking student answer where refer text where student answer from text 
1,Teacher,200,thank alright student nasa sent small machine where find text 
1,Teacher,200,right awesome thank alright student student answer scientist found crater full water moon where find chat 
1,Teacher,200,right thank student where find student answer text 
1,Teacher,200,student where where find text 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah totally agree want point exactly where text found answers 
1,Teacher,200,just second student find where microscope text 
1,Teacher,200,student find because don't think robot part there that's okay 
1,Teacher,200,awesome alright student where find information about microscope text 
1,Teacher,200,student really didn't know from passage 
1,Teacher,200,student said water heavy good don't carry ships an more part about water being heavy from passage 
1,Teacher,200,student want give specific detail from text about think lunar orbiter 
1,Teacher,200,student listen show where found tell where 
1,Teacher,200,student ready what made choose answer tell evidence from book made think 
1,Teacher,200,student read article 
1,Teacher,200,student where specifically paragraph three 
1,Teacher,200,student could share where found where read just read student answer scientist found crater full water moon could like just show 
1,Teacher,200,said same answer student want explain little what found when student reading 
1,Teacher,200,student point where found 
1,Teacher,200,student just wondering more specifically what small machine know used small machin like tell text where text 
1,Teacher,200,student back right look responses think about what said think about chose things find part text tells 
1,Teacher,200,student what student thoughts going support student thoughts 
1,Teacher,200,student find part story could quote said anything about oxygen tanks 
1,Teacher,200,when student found look text reread no ice said scientific tool 
1,Teacher,200,good right going call student first talk aboutanswer told nasa send small machine where information 
1,Teacher,200,student tell where passage found answer where from 
1,Teacher,200,student show where found 
1,Teacher,200,good studentsaid scientist found crater full water moon like very true just tell little more about where text said 
1,Teacher,200,student show where text found answers 
1,Teacher,200,student read sentence 
1,Teacher,200,student lunar orbiter great read sentence where find 
1,Teacher,200,student perfect remember where found 
1,Teacher,200,student yeah mentioned scientist looked student tool called microscope wondering could some text evidence proves where text there quote remember 
1,Teacher,200,student text evidence from student response said nasa send small machine read about 
1,Teacher,200,student said student need scientific tool called microscope also said circle same thing where text point just everyone's same page 
1,Teacher,200,like focus first said there sufficient evidence would student what part text makes think water would valuable resource 
1,Teacher,200,student based text what makes believe water could valuable resource 
1,Teacher,200,okay student saying found student evidence somewhere else text where find student evidence 
1,Teacher,200,student text where find student evidence isn't necessarily important long back 
1,Teacher,200,student where find know find text 
1,Teacher,200,yeah really good point know when answer want guys think where found know where found because want bring information from text where think found 
1,Teacher,200,student number point like microscope part where 
1,Teacher,200,student there anything more specific want pull from answer text 
1,Teacher,200,student find crater what part text from 
1,Teacher,200,student find anywhere specifically text 
1,Teacher,200,student good text where find text what made choose student response 
1,Teacher,200,student alright text find answer what made choose answer question 
1,Teacher,200,student right very true want walk through where found answer 
1,Teacher,200,student paragraph five find 
1,Teacher,200,student just want work kind find example text know where text 
1,Teacher,200,student think equipment like oxygen like oxygen oxygen tank 
1,Teacher,200,student look back into reading anything about microscope section tell which section like they're numbered know don't look back 
1,Teacher,200,student don't that's okay 
1,Teacher,200,student awesome from second sentence paragraph five correct 
1,Teacher,200,student question there anything about using water growing things moon article remember kind just thinking things water earth 
1,Teacher,200,student right what's what's text al evidence support 's claim main idea first paragraph scientist found lots water moon 
1,Teacher,200,student point some evidence text tells astronaut will able into space water space hips anymore 
1,Teacher,200,student very good could saying there anything more text says about water heavy 
1,Teacher,200,student find compelling evidence water would valuable 
1,Teacher,200,student pretty cool back text reread part toxin talks about gives information about hydrogen oxygen being used fuel there anything around know would useful astronaut 
1,Teacher,200,student tell where story believe just just need actual text please 
1,Teacher,200,student good glad able connect prior experience relate what talking about text anything text about things 
1,Teacher,200,student just need write down where found student answer 
1,Teacher,200,student then want tell where find evidence okay 
1,Teacher,200,student answer like student answer text okay 
1,Teacher,200,what details text what specific equipment mentioned text scientist used discover water student 
1,Teacher,300,awesome so Farrah and STUDENT get awesome points for circling the parts in the text prompt because that was the the direction so A+direction for following points
1,Teacher,300,"amazing yeah I love that and and I love that you are you agree with Farrah and you're adding more to the answer and together, you guys have collaborated on Even better answer"
1,Teacher,300,"and I love that you guys are really using the reading and pointing to specific parts and sentences in the reading to help equipment that allow us to discover water on the moon You come up with your answer and I think we already, so now we have identified two different equipments and you guys were able to build on each other's answers to"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah and you pulled out something very specific and you found another piece of equipment that was method mentioned in the text, which is very good, as well"
1,Teacher,300,I love that you brought in that background knowledge STUDENT that fact about some about the scientists and astronauts needing those oxygen tanks that's really awesome background knowledge
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so you read it in the story I love that you found it in the story"
1,Teacher,300,yeah so I love that you picked up on the microscope because it's really important when we're thinking about the word microscopic
1,Teacher,300,yeah so STUDENT I love what you know about NASA and you're using evidence from the reading
1,Teacher,300,"yeah I love, how you summarize that are STUDENT, alright, So I love, how you summarize the article Chris"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah STUDENT that's awesome background knowledge, thank you for bringing that background knowledge so"
1,Teacher,300,yeah so I love that you both know that microscopes are used to look at small things and that you were able to pull that out of the text
1,Teacher,300,So STUDENT what you did was you definitely got the answer correct
1,Teacher,300,"right, you, you know you know what sort of equipment scientists use to discover equipment on the moon uh to discover water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,"Absolutely yeah no, these are all great observations about how our thinking can change by sort of learning a new piece"
1,Teacher,300,I really like how you use your background knowledge to answer that question
1,Teacher,300,So I am sure that you are going to do a great job when we look back for this specific tool because you probably heard of it before
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I am so glad that you know so much about space"
1,Teacher,300,"Great, I can really tell you use your background knowledge with that"
1,Teacher,300,So you're absolutely right and ice deposit is a piece of frozen water that's on a planet
1,Teacher,300,"That's a good way of thinking about it, STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,You did mention a specific piece of equipment and although that may not be the best answer
1,Teacher,300,"And you still address the equipment part of the question, and I appreciate that"
1,Teacher,300,That's very specific and I appreciate you being really specific in your answer
1,Teacher,300,I like your revised answer and that you guys work so well together
1,Teacher,300,"But yeah, she did a great job and you were very specific also"
1,Teacher,300,"I see your line of thought and I really appreciate that you're telling us that they sent a small machine, which is the equipment and they used it to discover which is to find out, or to see"
1,Teacher,300,And I appreciate that answer
1,Teacher,300,You did a great job using your background knowledge and using all the information that was in our text
1,Teacher,300,That was one of our right answers
1,Teacher,300,It was a right answer
1,Teacher,300,"Well, I appreciate that"
1,Teacher,300,"I can see what you're thinking, and where you were going with that"
1,Teacher,300,And I really like the fact that you use those contexts clues and explain to me what extracting meant
1,Teacher,300,So I appreciate that your opinion is that no you don't think that it'sIt's going to be convincing or or it's going to be valuable
1,Teacher,300,"Reading You told us that extracting was getting the water out and I see where you use that evidence, saying that it might take a lot of time and money"
1,Teacher,300,"Because it's possible that we could get it from the moon and I see Chris's thinking was, he said that water is very heavy"
1,Teacher,300,I can see how it would be very useful to leave behind all that weight because we may be able to find that water and use water on the moon and not have to carry that would be valuable
1,Teacher,300, so I can see STUDENT I appreciate the fact that you see value in that because it would be a valuable source
1,Teacher,300,You did a good job
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, you did a very good job going back and finding the evidence"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, that is our this the two words that we really want to focus on,"
1,Teacher,300,That's a very good point
1,Teacher,300,So you could circle convincing evidence together
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, that's a great idea"
1,Teacher,300,And we always want to make sure that we're looking forward
1,Teacher,300,Even if it's not valuable right now
1,Teacher,300,Like you just said in your answer that it would be valuable in the future
1,Teacher,300,"Now, but in the future"
1,Teacher,300,"So like you said you have a good, you have a good point that it may not be valuable"
1,Teacher,300,"I love that STUDENT, use the text when she found her answer and I wonder if"
1,Teacher,300,I love that you cited where you found it in the text
1,Teacher,300,"So STUDENT, you said you need a specific tool called a microscope to look really closely which is absolutely true"
1,Teacher,300,Instead of saying equipment like the question did you just said tool
1,Teacher,300,"And that's perfectly because they're synonyms, which means that they're the same or they mean the same thing"
1,Teacher,300,You told me and you gave it to me from the text that a microscope is what is needed to look really really closely
1,Teacher,300,"I'm glad that you had some place that you could reference back to, because that's really helpful in showing me that you know where the information came from"
1,Teacher,300,"Scientists have found craters full of water on the moon, and that is absolutely true"
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, you have found some specific evidence in the text you pulled it right out"
1,Teacher,300,And I'm really proud of you for finding that
1,Teacher,300,"Oh, what a nice way to explain that"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh, I see where you're talking about it says the water they found is microscopic so I mean right, it's very small"
1,Teacher,300,Which is great and you all refer back to the text
1,Teacher,300,You got to the three of you have listed science equipment right which you that is that first part of the question
1,Teacher,300,"Well, you know, those are pieces of equipment that they use"
1,Teacher,300,Thank you for that
1,Teacher,300,That's a some awesome prior knowledge STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,So I can add a bit of background info here
1,Teacher,300," so, STUDENT Can you give me another example of equipment, maybe something from that article that we just read that you know that NASA is using in space"
1,Teacher,300,"And you offer a lot of insight,"
1,Teacher,300,"That's, that's my, my fault there so, Instead, I should have said, the way you answer that I see where you're coming from"
1,Teacher,300,"Well, maybe I phrased that poorly"
1,Teacher,300,I think that definitely gives a lot to whoever's reading that answer to include them in
1,Teacher,300,I think that's very good
1,Teacher,300,I like your use of detail there
2,Teacher,300,"And that's, that's very good"
2,Teacher,300,I'm glad you're able to get that sort of perspective on it
2,Teacher,300,You give really good strong details on that very specific part
2,Teacher,300,So I can kind of see your enjoyment there now a way we can sort of improve or something we might want to see is
2,Teacher,300,"Okay, that's, that's great"
2,Teacher,300,I think you've got the main idea
2,Teacher,300,And so at the heart of your answer there
2,Teacher,300,And that's really exciting
2,Teacher,300,We found some water on the moon
2,Teacher,300,Thank you very much for listening
2,Teacher,300,Those are very good listening skills and making sure you're always being an active learner and to I think you really took to heart
2,Teacher,300,So I appreciate that
2,Teacher,300,That was very good
2,Teacher,300,What I said there
2,Teacher,300,Why it doesn't say anything about water and that's a great point there but
2,Teacher,300,"That's right, they, you know, they, they are very valuable and I like how you pointed that out"
2,Teacher,300,But when we look back at the question
2,Teacher,300,"Okay, awesome, and I love how Deb's original response was that he found the same as STUDENT, that shows that Oliver is able to make a connection with his classmate and relate his thinking to Farrah thinking"
2,Teacher,300,And that's a good skill
2,Teacher,300,I love how Farrah Oliver Chris and STUDENT were able to look specifically in the text
2,Teacher,300,"To use our background knowledge like STUDENT used in to make inferences using our background knowledge and what the text tells us, right"
2,Teacher,300,We want to make inferences and use our use our prior knowledge that's very important
2,Teacher,300,That's a good question
2,Teacher,300,"That is a good answer, because that is part of the answer"
2,Teacher,300,So way to use that evidence there for for a reason for water being valuable to us all right now
2,Teacher,300,"So yes, that's another great example of convincing evidence"
2,Teacher,300,But you had a you had another good piece of evidence
2,Teacher,300,"And so you, you do have a good convincing Answer right there"
2,Teacher,300,I see where you're going with that
2,Teacher,300,"And it is a small machine,"
2,Teacher,300,And I'm glad that you referenced the text because that was awesome and correct
2,Teacher,300,It is the Lunar Orbiter
2,Teacher,300,"Great job, looking back at the text"
2,Teacher,300,"Yes, they could use the microscope after they found it to study it"
2,Teacher,300,That's very good deduction there
2,Teacher,300,"I like what you did there, STUDENT"
2,Teacher,300,"STUDENT That was, that was a great find in the text"
2,Teacher,300,The water before it's broken apart can be drunk by astronauts good observation there from the text and the usefulness for oxygen and hydrogen can be used for rocket fuel here
2,Teacher,300,That's great use of your background knowledge about that space station that they're planning to build it will take a lot of what in order to get that process going
2,Teacher,300,It says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely
2,Teacher,300,And it also does say in here in the third paragraph
2,Teacher,300,I'm and I see where STUDENT could have got her answer
2,Teacher,300,And she couldn't when you couldn't quite remember what the name of it was
2,Teacher,300,I like how you went back to your text and re read the information
2,Teacher,300,I like how everyone is reading their text and finding the details in the reading
2,Teacher,300,"So great job, guys"
2,Teacher,300,"So you weren't wrong, but by going back and rereading you are able to identify what the exact name of that machine was"
2,Teacher,300,"It was the right answer, but I like how you went back and read your text and offered more accurate details"
2,Teacher,300,"And Nice job, looking back at the text"
2,Teacher,300,That is a very good answer
2,Teacher,300,You remember from your text and you're elaborated by restating the question
2,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, did you want to add something"
2,Teacher,300,"Now I can see since you already have a lot of prior knowledge about space, how, why you would come up with that answer"
1,Teacher,300,"And that is a great answer, our passage"
1,Teacher,300,"I can see exactly why you would say that because it does say the water is microscopic and you would need to see a microscope, you would use a microscope to see it"
1,Teacher,300,"Well, I can, if you went to NASA and you actually saw all of those things I could, I can understand why you would think that because there's a lot of things that you probably learned"
1,Teacher,300,"And I see why you would say that,"
1,Teacher,300,"I see where you get that answer,"
1,Teacher,300,I like your thinking that is awesome
1,Teacher,300,You use details from our text to support your thinking
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I see what you're thinking too so awesome job using evidence from the text as well"
1,Teacher,300,It is like a tool that scientists use when they are discovering things
1,Teacher,300,"So, that was a really good explanation and definition of what equipment is"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, those are some things from your personal experience, and we do get information from our personal experience"
1,Teacher,300,What you did a great job finding the first part of the sentence
1,Teacher,300,"Good thinking, because we are talking about water"
1,Teacher,300,"We are talking about the moon, but there are a few more"
1,Teacher,300,"Well, I appreciate it, that you added that detail for us"
1,Teacher,300,Water is a valuable resource right
1,Teacher,300,One place we can look is exactly where you look so you found the right spot to look under the section
1,Teacher,300,Because that has the words we were just talking about
1,Teacher,300,So that was just the right place to look for that
1,Teacher,300,"And you did find some evidence, didn't you"
1,Teacher,300,"All right, let's see, when you guys are doing a great job with talking through this and working through it together and you know where to find the right place to look"
1,Teacher,300,So you guys are all given really good details
1,Teacher,300,So you guys are given really good details for that
1,Teacher,300,I've seen that you remembered a detail from the passage
1,Teacher,300,"Because I agree with you that no, maybe it's not a good investment"
1,Teacher,300,So I think that you justified your answer and
1,Teacher,300,"So I think that you and Chris and Luis All said that, yes, it's valuable and then you gave a reason why you thought it was valuable"
1,Teacher,300,And I spoke to STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,So he justified his answer
1,Teacher,300,So I wouldn't say that you are wrong because it says one are valuable
1,Teacher,300,"You said yeah and then you pulled your evidence from the text, so I would asy that your answer is right"
1,Teacher,300, I think we all had our reasons and justified our reason
1,Teacher,300,I think that was a pretty good and complete answer because she gave the value
1,Teacher,300,"But I think that Jazmin's answer, And she said,Yeah, because they can drink the water and they can stay hydrated"
1,Teacher,300,Of the water and how the water could be used
1,Teacher,300,you summarize very well okay and about the craters
1,Teacher,300,You talked about the craters and craters full of water on the moon
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, now you elaborate a little bit more in your answer"
1,Teacher,300,I like that answer
1,Teacher,300,"Now, okay, I can see that you understand what you were reading"
1,Teacher,300,And you look back in the text to find your answer and to get all the information
1,Teacher,300,"I like how you're thinking about that how you're thinking about what you could use on the moon, even thought it's not in there, that's a very good pull from what you read, STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,They are and you're using her deep reading skills to really engage with the text and that's awesome
1,Teacher,300,And I love your use of the vocabulary term microscopic that's really good
1,Teacher,300,But I love that you're using that prior knowledge that's really good
1,Teacher,300,I loved your answer you really use the details in the article you went back and re read so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
1,Teacher,300,So like you said your answer
1,Teacher,300,And it looks like you've done that in your answer
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, the water is valuable, but we really need to discuss why"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so I can see how you may have a misunderstanding there because it's the say that you would need a tool called a microscope right STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,"I see where you found about the microscope, you can see the water"
1,Teacher,300,"But I like how you found a machine because it did ask for a tool and a machine in that question and I really like how you found that, but let's let's see if we can find another tool"
1,Teacher,300,"I really like how you restated the text, but we need to put a little really like that"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, so you, you definitely you restated the text"
1,Teacher,300,And I love how you used I'm like the text to to backup your answer
1,Teacher,300,I really like how I mean you went straight to the text and you tell me
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, yeah, you're right"
1,Teacher,300,So try to think about
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so next time I really love how you came up with that answer"
1,Teacher,300,I'm glad that's what we're talking about in the question
1,Teacher,300,"Good, I'm glad you were looking specifically that they found those the water in the craters"
1,Teacher,300,You found exactly where you should be looking at by that word machine there
1,Teacher,300,And you also found that they both talked about water
1,Teacher,300,Now what did the question ask us to find about water
1,Teacher,300,"You found exactly both of the equipment they talked about, really, really good"
1,Teacher,300,"They did say that it will be a long time because they still haven't been able to access the water,"
1,Teacher,300,"I'm glad that you're looking into the text, instead of just going off of what you know"
1,Teacher,300,So right after that the paragraph
1,Teacher,300,"We want to be in, you're exactly right"
1,Teacher,300,"Because it's asking us directly about the text, so yes"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so you did find some important information where"
1,Teacher,300,"So, you made a really important"
1,Teacher,300,"Good, I agree that they're not ready"
1,Teacher,300,"No, you're answers great it you caught on to the fact that NASA did send a small machine, but you didn't tell me what this small machine did and I wanted to know"
1,Teacher,300,They do say that and that's great text evidence to use
1,Teacher,300,"They say that this especially specifically in the text, but let's look back at our question"
1,Teacher,300,"And I say that you, you basically rephrase the first sentence"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, that was very good"
1,Teacher,300,I love how you are reading very closely and paying attention to those very big words very good
1,Teacher,300,And that's probably helped you a little bit with reading this passage and being able to connect some of the experiences that you had back to this packet passage
1,Teacher,300,"And now the reason that you could be confused is because it says it, but we haven't proved it"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so we'll keep going"
1,Teacher,300,"Which is which is good because they did use a small machine and it does say small machine,"
1,Teacher,300,"So you you just used a, one sentence from the paragraph that had a piece of equipment in it"
1,Teacher,300,"Your answer was, NASA sent a small machine"
1,Teacher,300,So you're in the ballpark
1,Teacher,300,So you found the equipment
1,Teacher,300,And I like that you use that wording scientific tool
1,Teacher,300,I like that you use that word scientific tool
1,Teacher,300,"Great, great job there,"
1,Teacher,300,And I really appreciate you explaining your answer
1,Teacher,300,I do understand what you mean
1,Teacher,300,"Well, I do like that you shared your opinion in your answer"
1,Teacher,300,And sometimes it's hard for us as students and even sometimes as teachers because we're not scientist to understand how long it takes for them to figure out how to get things right
1,Teacher,300,I agree with you
1,Teacher,300,"Like right now, it's not ready and I do like that you shared your opinion, good job there"
1,Teacher,300,"I think that you are correct, that sometimes it's not going to be ready"
1,Teacher,300,"So you guys have all shared your responses with us and that's been really, really good"
1,Teacher,300,I really liked that you guys tried to pull your evidence from the text
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so one of the things I would say is that you guys did a really good job trying to pull things you found Out of the text"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, that certainly makes sense from having gone to see that type of stuff"
1,Teacher,300,That's great that you had a chance to see some other things that have happened in space
1,Teacher,300,So that's a great job be able to identify what that means
1,Teacher,300,So you guys did a really good job at using your past knowledge on a microscope
1,Teacher,300,And so you looked back at the tech stuff on if there was convincing evidence that water can be valuable
1,Teacher,300,Good job so you may be redirected and rethought your answer
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, it was in the within the text, it does state that this stuff,"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, well, you know, good job"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, was within the actual document in this state that you can split up in between oxygen, hydrogen and oxygen"
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT you were able to sort of, you know, find those key evident that key evidence, very quickly"
1,Teacher,300,that is very good job
1,Teacher,300,Very good for looking deep into your question and in circle in it
1,Teacher,300,"Alright, so let's first look at the question again"
1,Teacher,300,And I was very impressed about how everyone took time to look over and look into the text and had some really deep connections they really you really thought about the things that we were asking
1,Teacher,300,A that is a great response and I love how you made a connection because that helps some of us out a detective
1,Teacher,300,Made a connection and we're studying about space and on the moon
1,Teacher,300,You made a connection a detective
1,Teacher,300,She used like a STUDENT use that his dad was an astronaut
1,Teacher,300,"So again, there you goin back in when you said you didn't understand about that word, I think, you know, more than what you think evidence you just showed me evidence about how to survive"
1,Teacher,300,"So I appreciate that you, when looking at the text you notice that the scientists use the microscope"
1,Teacher,300,So I appreciate that you care To get the correct answer
1,Teacher,300,"So that's very that's, that's very good to ask so you you are you're seeking to know why your answer was wrong"
1,Teacher,300,And so I love that y'all are all thinking about the story and are using
1,Teacher,300,"Using the text to help support your answers,"
1,Teacher,300,I do and I think you're doing a good job putting that together
1,Teacher,300,"That is such a great comment, and it's really great that you're able to tie that in with a real world experience and I would think that they definitely use those things on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,You can bring in your prior knowledge to the article sort of like STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,And I especially like what you said about an opinion because it is asking for an opinion
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, and that was perfect"
1,Teacher,300,"I really, I really think that you did a really good job I identifying and separating the fact that the now versus later"
1,Teacher,300,"So you're, you may know a lot about space, that's, I agree with you"
1,Teacher,300,You know that answer makes perfect sense
1,Teacher,300,You do a great job of talking about the question
1,Teacher,300,As far as that goes
1,Teacher,300,So you obviously understand the question
1,Teacher,300,"So again, we're just going to that"
1,Teacher,300,So you're picking up on key parts of the text which water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that's important
1,Teacher,300,So you already do parts of that you answer the question you provide evidence you explain your evidence
1,Teacher,300,You do a great your answers
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated"
1,Teacher,300,You can't survive without water
1,Teacher,300,And it's hard because I like you to have your own opinion
1,Teacher,300,"what I would really like you to do, though"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I mean, that's a great way to say it"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so we have the first noun what equipment and that's an excellent strategy to look at if our if our question is focused on on noun specific things"
1,Teacher,300,"You did, in fact, your response is very good as finding pieces of text evidence"
1,Teacher,300,That is that is a great piece of text evidence
1,Teacher,300,"That was a great thought process, putting those two together"
1,Teacher,300,Okay so convincing evidence and valuable
1,Teacher,300,And that is correct
1,Teacher,300,And I like that you found that because you did find a in paragraph four right under that heading so that helped lead you in the right direction
1,Teacher,300,And I like the way that you've gone back and put the key words from the question with your answer
1,Teacher,300,So I appreciate you looking at your
1,Teacher,300,Answer and asking why
1,Teacher,300,I like how you're making that connection
1,Teacher,300,"Well, I like how you're bringing in that prior knowledge that you already know to help you answer this question"
1,Teacher,300,"I know exactly where it's at the text as well, I believe, part three of the first pair first section"
1,Teacher,300,"So, good job there Oliveron are deaf"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I can see how you got there, I can see I can see that"
1,Teacher,300,"Good job, they're reading into that"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, that is true"
1,Teacher,300,I like that you went back in the text and had some support to support your answer and I do agree with you
1,Teacher,300,I am very glad that you went back in the texts were able to find support for your answer
1,Teacher,300,He did a really good job
1,Teacher,300,"I really liked your answer and how you can how you included both parts those, the water is heavy and that the water can be broken into two parts, and us"
1,Teacher,300,"That's actually very well done,"
1,Teacher,300,And that's a very logical series of steps you took to get to that answer
1,Teacher,300,"I love where you went with that and it was a very logical series of steps that you took,"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, that makes complete and total sense"
1,Teacher,300,That was a good job connecting the dots there
1,Teacher,300,It's good that you've pulled in the Lunar Orbiter
1,Teacher,300,"So you can definitely still say that your answer is, is a big part of what you want to reconstruct to, but I think to be a little more specific"
1,Teacher,300,"And now that you've chosen to answer that gives us more detail, instead of just circling the same as STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,Your thought process is a lot deeper as well
1,Teacher,300,"First of all, because I know that that's a really important detail, but now that we know how it was found in those craters we've answered the question with much more detail"
1,Teacher,300,"Great, that's, that's really good STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,So I appreciate that you noticed where the water was found
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, now, like how you have started thinking about question"
1,Teacher,300,"It did say what equipment do they use discover water on the moon, and you're starting to think about what equipmentWould they need to find water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,You have mentioned two pieces of equipment that are specifically referenced in the text Lunar Orbiter and microscope
1,Teacher,300,"I like how you read the text you saw mentioned microscope and you're thinking, well, I have to have a microscope to see the water deposit"
1,Teacher,300,"Therefore, the microscope is what was used to find as water deposits"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, and I do like how you have focused on part of the question you focused on the part where it says they, they discovered water on the moon and you specifically said where they found water on the moon, they found it in the craters"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, and I do like how you have referenced something in the text that is specifically mentioned it does in fact say that water can be broken down into oxygen and hydrogen"
1,Teacher,300,And that is great because you obviously went to the text and the text does in fact say that astronauts could drink the water
1,Teacher,300,"Absolutely and that's in the text says, Great your point information out of the text that water H2O can be splitting the oxygen and hydrogen"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, well, and I love that you guys were able to close your eyes and see that and help you Oliverelop that"
1,Teacher,300,So you found that directly in the text
1,Teacher,300,Anything you did use a lot of background knowledge and your answer
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I understand that"
1,Teacher,300,but I do love that you brought your outside knowledge into the conversation
1,Teacher,300,And I just like that
1,Teacher,300,That was your example
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so just like STUDENT I love that you're using your background knowledge to contribute to our discussion and they're also may be"
1,Teacher,300,"for our first question, you said that scientists use a microscope to look closely and I wanted to say that that was really good I like that you used the specific name of the tool that scientists use, but I also want to encourage you to"
1,Teacher,300,"So STUDENT you did a really good job, saying that the microscope was a tool that they used because you're definitely correct it is"
1,Teacher,300,awesome I want to say that that is a good response because you said that they use a lot of equipment and then you were specific by saying oxygen tanks
1,Teacher,300,And I think it's really good when you're reading a text to think about what you already know and experiences you have so like STUDENT is saying
1,Teacher,300,he already knows a lot about space and he learned the astronauts use these specific things so that's great to keep in mind when you're reading the text
1,Teacher,300,"Right, I definitely appreciate that and I like that you were able to find exactly where in the text you found your answer I do have a concern, though, so the question"
1,Teacher,300,That is a very good response and I like that you provided a use for the water so that would be your evidence that you pulled from the text um
1,Teacher,300,And you were able to find that in the text good job
1,Teacher,300,Great job pulling that out of the text
1,Teacher,300,"So I strength so far from that was,you pointed out the material they use, and then you said what it's used for which is very good"
1,Teacher,300,I like that that's that's a good plan that's what I was thinking when I was reading yesterday first time I was like no not for yeah so I like your response and I like how you look for the evidence
1,Teacher,300,"For your answer, which is really good so i'm keep Keep up the good job of looking at the evidence on before they even asked that question"
1,Teacher,300,"Do you think it's a good investment I thought I thought your answer was great because, like"
1,Teacher,300,"You know, someone could have given like a shorter and simple answer, I guess, but your answer was still very good so good job on us man, thank you very much, no problem, no problem so i'm dead, you said"
1,Teacher,300,You I like how you added evidence that you have to stay hydrated because you can't you can't survive without water and
1,Teacher,300,so I like how you paid attention to that and you're you paid a lot to attention you paid a lot of
1,Teacher,300,"Attention to details which is very key in reading passages like this, because if you mess up on details then your answer like could be not what you wanted to say, but like you messed up on reading so then your answer when my county all messed up if you know what I mean well"
1,Teacher,300,STUDENT your response is actually really good
1,Teacher,300,I like how you use the word microscope and you knew what it was used for
1,Teacher,300,"That is right, and I like your answer, how you use evidence from what you knew that I told you, in the name of the machine that I set up for"
1,Teacher,300,Like that it's a lot more general towards what the check said and then an opinion that you add or your guess of what you saw was there
1,Teacher,300,"I think you did a really great job, pulling from the text,"
1,Teacher,300,So it was a great response
1,Teacher,300,"You had some of your personal views, along with some thoughts that came from the text"
1,Teacher,300,So what you said related to the text really well
1,Teacher,300,"And STUDENT, I think you had some great vocab sorry, did you have a question, Jazmin"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah it's definitely a good answer to give and you use multiple paragraphs looking through to find that answer, but where the question is kind of"
1,Teacher,300,i'm glad we could expand on that and we can see how there's much more to getting to space and finding the water than we thought there was
1,Teacher,300,But you use great academic knowledge
1,Teacher,300,nd great academic vocab in your response
1,Teacher,300,"So you notice that it was a small machine was very good which they also stated, it shows that you use your context from the text, which is very good"
1,Teacher,300,But you used great academic vocab in your response
1,Teacher,300,They did use a microscope to look at the water closest answer was small I see how you connected those two
1,Teacher,300,"And the background knowledge is helpful to understand what's going on in the passage, I want you to use that background knowledge to help you understand the passage better and be able to read to find the answers"
1,Teacher,300,"I well, one thing I noticed was that you started out with your context your background knowledge which is great, and always useful"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, that is right so it's always great to have background knowledge to help us understand our text better or understand the question better"
1,Teacher,300,"Awesome you got that right from the passage,"
1,Teacher,300,"mention a piece of evidence that is in the passage that because it says clearly in the passagefor example, future astronauts can drink water"
1,Teacher,300,"So you had said that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen, you are right, that is from passage, so you did get that from the password, which is good,"
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, just as you said, you said you understood it, but I still want to give you the feedback"
1,Teacher,300,"awesome so I see what you did,"
1,Teacher,300,"and that was great to use the reading, to help us with our answer"
1,Teacher,300,"awesome so that's what it says in the text, which is great that we used our resources,"
1,Teacher,300,"awesome So yes, that included the important details"
1,Teacher,300,"You don't think it's valuable, so I see where you're coming from because it does say right here that making a plan will take a lot of time and money,"
1,Teacher,300,"let's look at the last sentence, because I like what STUDENT brought up making this plan will take a lot of time and money"
1,Teacher,300,And STUDENT I also noticed that you have to be did your background knowledge by referencing that they use oxygen tanks on the moon
1,Teacher,300,"I knew you were using your background knowledge because in the reading, we read, we didn't read anything about oxygen tanks, but you knew that when you're on the Loon"
1,Teacher,300,"You need to have oxygen to be able to breathe, right?"
1,Teacher,300,"So I can see why you think that microscope is important, and I agree to the microscope is very important, with discovering water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so I see how you did connect but you were you were kind of scanning the page for the words that connected to water, because the question was about finding water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,That's a really good strategy
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, they did use the microscope to really look closely, and that's a really good way to use the text as evidence in your answer"
1,Teacher,300,"Thank you for pointing that out, STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,And thank you STUDENT for explaining your answer and using the text really well
1,Teacher,300,"answer because it really, like I said, it really uses the text like Farrah's"
1,Teacher,300,"You quoted the reading really well and I really like that, and you also found in the text where"
1,Teacher,300,"so STUDENT I really liked in your answer that you really, you mentioned the evidence from the from the reading"
1,Teacher,300,It talks about specific things that the question asks
1,Teacher,300,and I really like that you you that you took us to a very specific part in the text um
1,Teacher,300,A lot of people use a lot of good language in their responses Farrah and Jazmin you guys really use a lot of Nice language specific language from the texts that I really appreciate
1,Teacher,300,"So Jazmin's response is really good because it does lead us to answering the question, the question was what equipment did they use"
1,Teacher,300,And she answers NASA sent a small machine
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so Jazmin's response was NASA sent a small machine"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, thank you, that is"
1,Teacher,300,"is really, really nice way to phrase that"
1,Teacher,300,"that's awesome and I love, how long is like how you worded your answer"
1,Teacher,300,"I love, how you comprehend the reading so well"
1,Teacher,300,"and I love, how you said that you look back at the reading to like determine which machine you thought would be the best one"
1,Teacher,300,"And, your answer is right about the microscope data scientists did use the microscope to look at the water they already found in the reading it says they already found the water"
1,Teacher,300,I really like how you looks back at the reading and really understood the question because you totally did
1,Teacher,300,"you're totally right about how NASA you so much equipment like oxygen tanks and other things like that, and they definitely do use that when they go to the moon, but"
1,Teacher,300,"Well that's great, and I can definitely tell that you guys read the reading and understood it"
1,Teacher,300,"I totally understand where you're coming from, and I think that's a great way that you guys interpreted interpreted the reading,"
1,Teacher,300,I definitely can see how you would find it confusing
1,Teacher,300,"and i'm glad that you guys didn't notice that when you guys read,"
1,Teacher,300,I do agree that it does say other equipment that Thank you
1,Teacher,300,Your answer is almost perfect and it does show that you read the reading and understood it and understood the question which is great
1,Teacher,300,"They definitely could have, and I do see where you're coming from,"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh, even you bring up a really great point"
1,Teacher,300,I saw that you use your background information when you
1,Teacher,300,"Right, so I think that you and Farrah and Oliver all did this, you used all of your background knowledge when answering this question, which is great"
1,Teacher,300,Good so Chris and STUDENT you both found specific information for the text so that is great
1,Teacher,300,"so you got the answer and you use evidence from the text because it says it was a small machine,"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, so you again you're using some evidence from the text which is great, but"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh right Okay, so when we read that sentence, that you immediately think okay good we need water to drink, which is a great answer, but what it goes on to say is that"
1,Teacher,300,"And I thought that was great response, I noticed that you used your vocabulary,"
1,Teacher,300,And you made it an amazing excellent well thought out response
1,Teacher,300,Now you you've built on your response
1,Teacher,300,So that is a great response
1,Teacher,300,"i'm noticing that you use the text to support your answer, you used the two words scientific tool"
1,Teacher,300,"awesome so i'm noticing, you said you were referred exactly to where in the text you found your answer you said in paragraph three"
1,Teacher,300,"I noticed the it said that they used a microscope to find water, and this is exactly what the question asks I really like how you referred back to the question to help support your answer"
1,Teacher,300,awesome so see you just improved your response by just looking back you read you read that sentence and you strengthen your response
1,Teacher,300,"The tools, the equipment, she thought about the question and then by looking back in the text you did the same thing you looked in you found another thing that they use the how they discovered this water on the moon so by adding those key terms you're answering the question what equipment"
1,Teacher,300,"awesome so you started with they found these creators of water and then you, you referred back to the question you thought about your peers responses and you ended up adding the equipment that they used"
1,Teacher,300,"Alright, so i'm noticing that you really strengthen your response from the start to the end you really use that you're thinking and you use the text to support you"
1,Teacher,300,Thank you so much for sharing your responses to me
1,Teacher,300,"I want to particularly point out, Farrah and Jazmin's responses you guys did a really good job of highlighting the exact equipment that we use"
1,Teacher,300,Naming the exact specific examples of equipment
1,Teacher,300,"I pointed out, Farrah, and STUDENT, both of you had done a really good job from the beginning"
1,Teacher,300,"Exactly, but you did an awesome job backing up your answer, I really liked that"
1,Teacher,300,"And your background knowledge is very beneficial, and I love how you have that"
1,Teacher,300,"Luis, I know that you were talking about all your knowledge"
1,Teacher,300,"OK, now, I saw a lot of vocabulary that you guys used in your responses and that's amazing"
1,Teacher,300,And you did a really good job with that
1,Teacher,300,"So using the tool that you used, was really good to take equipment and look through the text and examine it, right?"
1,Teacher,300,So that's what you did
1,Teacher,300,You looked through and you tried to find the word that fitted
1,Teacher,300,"It shows me that you understand what you're reading and you understand the questions i'm asking you, but you had a great start to your question to answer, I mean"
1,Teacher,300,"by NASA I don't think we had any oxygen tank so I love, how you use your background knowledge to answer the questions,"
1,Teacher,300,"See the orbits the craters closer and you connected that to microscopes, which is really good"
1,Teacher,300,"We do use that in science STUDENT, but"
1,Teacher,300,That was actually really good
1,Teacher,300,One thing I noticed was that you took the evidence from the text that scientists wanting to see things
1,Teacher,300,"You connect to the fact that the waters were found on the moon is used for oxygen right,"
1,Teacher,300,I love how you're challenging your capacities to think about what truly makes water valuable and it really is valuable to get from the moon
1,Teacher,300,"that's true I do love, how you were challenging the question itself, and I think that we, there is reasons to support our evidence that water is valuable and I don't think that"
1,Teacher,300,Just not a great connection
1,Teacher,300,mm hmm so that is really good that you realize that that was from the article 
1,Teacher,300,"You and people use their background knowledge, because that tells me that you're really thinking about what you already know, but I do you really like that you"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, I really like that, just like STUDENT, I think you have a really good grasp on what you're trying to say, and I think you really understand the text"
1,Teacher,300,I really like that answer
1,Teacher,300,I like that you gave reason to why you think that um
1,Teacher,300,that is like a lot of really good evidence that you shared with me in your answer
1,Teacher,300,"which is one concern I have for you, although that is a very good point that it's going to cost a lot of money and it might take a very long time for us to get there"
1,Teacher,300,"That is what I like about your responses, you took that specifically from the text you"
1,Teacher,300,"So you said, water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore so like STUDENT I really liked this answer because they this is right from the text you took this information, right from the text, and that is a really important part of answering text specific questions"
1,Teacher,300,Great job! So that's great job using your skills in the text using the context of the text to find your answer
1,Teacher,300,I think it was a really great response and you had you used your academic vocabulary and you used something that was stated directly from the text
1,Teacher,300,You did use an idea that was stated directly from the text
1,Teacher,300,And STUDENT that answer was really great
1,Teacher,300,"yeah I so one thing that I noticed from your response, I thought that your response was really well and you wrote it very well and you made the points very clear"
1,Teacher,300,"That, I think your answer is great, and you did do a great job again i'm clarifying you know, saying that"
1,Teacher,300,That scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks it's a clear point
1,Teacher,300,And I'm glad that you went back into the text because we know for our answers we want to focus on two things using evidence
1,Teacher,300,"I really like that you could find that specifically in the types that that tells me that you were reading very carefully, and the fact that you remembered where it came from"
1,Teacher,300,"is very good that means you were paying attention, yes, good job"
1,Teacher,300,"did have evidence and that you said, why it would be a good thing"
1,Teacher,300,"I like that you did state yours like your agreement or disagreement in this case, you would did agree, and then you did say why it would be a valuable resource because there's water on the moon, and they could drink it so your answer, you had a very good answer"
1,Teacher,300,I like that was very clarifying
1,Teacher,300,I know that they found it and that's really awesome that you picked that up because I think that's a really great piece of information
1,Teacher,300,And I like that you really pulled that from the text
1,Teacher,300,"Great so I love how that you took trying to pick tool and equipment, we use those as cinnamon synonyms and found that answer, that is a great job"
1,Teacher,300,"yep so the discover water on the moon is definitely important and it definitely was found in that first paragraph, and I understand where you would get that answer,"
1,Teacher,300,I love that you had a really specific reference to the text talking about NASA and that they sent a small machine
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, your response was really awesome"
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, your answer was really awesome"
1,Teacher,300,I love how you talked about microscopes and that was really specific
1,Teacher,300,"And you even described what a microscope does, which it allows you to see something super up close, which is what they talk about in the article"
1,Teacher,300,"Great jobs and see you use you knew the important words in the question, and then you looked at me and you saw my sweater is right, so we want to use just the same ideas for that and work with the questions that we answered before"
1,Teacher,300,yeah I understand I understand your confusion
1,Teacher,300,"How I phrase, it could have been confusing so next time i'll make sure that I more concisely explain that to you guys"
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT that's a really great job because you look through the text and you found the equipment that's mentioned, which is a lunar orbiter but you also notice that a microscope is mentioned, but you realize that the microscope does not help them find water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,guys it's a really great job I really love you guys are starting to use the text that you read previously
1,Teacher,300,And that's great that you were able to gather that information out of the article
1,Teacher,300,So that's great that you were able to point that out
1,Teacher,300,It's a piece of equipment that was mentioned in the article
1,Teacher,300,So a microscope is a type of equipment
1,Teacher,300,That's a very good thing to point out
1,Teacher,300,There's more than just those pieces of equipment that scientists have to use and the astronauts have to use to get to the moon
1,Teacher,300,you're right that is a scientific tool that we use during science to see things closely
1,Teacher,300,So that would make sense
1,Teacher,300,"And some of your science classes, maybe"
1,Teacher,300,So if you use one before
1,Teacher,300,"Right, so you're kind of using your prior knowledge and experience to come up with that answer, which is great"
1,Teacher,300,So they did use a microscope and night you found that right from the evidence
1,Teacher,300,Good to look really closely
1,Teacher,300,So I like how in your answer
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, you were specific and you said that they found the water in the Craters of the moon"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, and that's a great answer, because I see you got your information right from the article inch paragraph for that water is heavy"
1,Teacher,300,And it takes up a lot of space
1,Teacher,300,You have put the steps together very well in your brain
1,Teacher,300,They need things to even be in space
1,Teacher,300,"That is very, very, very good"
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT and I, what I like about that is if I didn't know anything about this topic of finding water on the moon, and I had never read this passage I could learn how the astronauts discovered water on the moon from your answer"
1,Teacher,300,I like that you expanded your thinking
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, what I really like what you just did there was that you started with an idea and then you came up with some of your own thoughts, your own thought of maybe If they didn't have to carry heavy water they could carry other things as well"
1,Teacher,300,And I see how we've made the link between using the water to make hydrogen fuel and oxygen into something that the astronauts use very good
1,Teacher,300,I really liked that you had an answer to what your opinion was of whether or not you think there's compelling evidence
1,Teacher,300,That there isn't much water on the moon
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT, I love how you have said things that you've learned from the text is party to support your answer"
1,Teacher,300,"Right okay good, so I, like all of your answers you all really clearly worked with the text and use your best work to get to where you are"
1,Teacher,300,So I can see where you would say microscope oh go ahead
1,Teacher,300,That was wonderful thinking
1,Teacher,300,I loved the way that you are flexible and change your thinking that made your answers so much better
1,Teacher,300,"And I wanted to say, STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,"I loved in your first answer that you agreed with STUDENT, because that means that you're listening to your friends thinking"
1,Teacher,300,And that's really important and learning
1,Teacher,300,I like your second answer better because you put it in your own words
1,Teacher,300,And thank you so much for using that sentence starter
1,Teacher,300,That is a great answer
1,Teacher,300,"So both of you found your answers somewhere in the text, you were, it was clear that you read the text and I really love that you were looking at the text, you definitely read it, or at least looked at it, which is great"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, Deb, I just want to say I really love that you listened to STUDENT and listening is such an important skill as a student"
1,Teacher,300,Sometimes we're then talking and I think it's incredible that you listened to her answer and you agreed with her
1,Teacher,300,That's a really great skill
1,Teacher,300,And even I value all that information inside your brain and never lose that passion for space because it's amazing
1,Teacher,300,I love that you've used your listening skill and you listen to Farrahs answer
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT That was a really strong answer and I like how you reference the text, you said it's called the lunar orbiter because it says so right inside the text"
1,Teacher,300,"Thank you for sharing your answer and connecting with what others have said, it seems like you're asking, How come you didn't get full credit for your answer"
1,Teacher,300,I like that you gave a specific tool
1,Teacher,300,It's great to read our answers directly in the text
1,Teacher,300,I like how you took your answer correctly from the text
1,Teacher,300,So you're saying that the lunar orbiter investigates polar craters for ice that's a very strong answer because you look in the text and you quoted the text directly
1,Teacher,300,Which is good because that provides more space that's a strong answer because it's rooted in the text
1,Teacher,300,How you even expanded your thinking just now
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I really appreciate appreciate that you were looking carefully at the question and exactly the words is equipment"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I really appreciate that you give us a fact from the passage when you answer the question"
1,Teacher,300,"You really gave us the evidence you found in a text, the importance of water"
1,Teacher,300,I really appreciate that you are looking carefully at a question
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I really appreciate that you give us a fact and exactly evidence for all the passage when you answer the question"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I like it"
1,Teacher,300,You had a target to the right place in the passage you for the answer
1,Teacher,300,"so I could see you, how you got confused there"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, so I could see where that would get confusing"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, I saw that man and you did a nice job of explaining that you actually took words from the text, which is great"
1,Teacher,300,It gives us almost like a little step ahead
1,Teacher,300,"But again, that's excellent background knowledge because background knowledge always helps us understand what we're learning about even better"
1,Teacher,300,It helps us understand text a lot more when we have that
1,Teacher,300,And I love that you're using your background knowledge to connect to the texts always great
1,Teacher,300,So you have text evidence from the text
1,Teacher,300,"I like that you use the background information, though, STUDENT, it's always great to have that helps us understand and text a little more"
1,Teacher,300,"I love that you used, you told me, which paragraph you found that evidence, right, the more evidence that we have the stronger our claim is"
1,Teacher,300,"I love that you went and use a specific example from the text, right, that was"
1,Teacher,300,No need to feel bad
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I appreciate your honesty, I also really like that you are referencing specific parts of the text"
1,Teacher,300,So I see that you said they were looking for Ice deposits right in the poet large polar crater
1,Teacher,300,I see that you read the text and you were looking for A different machine different types of machines and tools they use
1,Teacher,300,I see how you got that answer
1,Teacher,300,I can definitely see where you got that because they did send a small machine
1,Teacher,300,"So I can tell that you did the reading and you're really excited to read about the water on the moon,"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I see, I see where you're coming from because you definitely would need a microscope to discover something that's too small to see"
1,Teacher,300,So you were thinking about your own knowledge that you have and what science scientists would need if they were on the moon
1,Teacher,300,Looking back at the text and adding more detail
1,Teacher,300,But I like that now you're thinking about how your you would look through the story to figure out the question that it was asking
1,Teacher,300,"Good work, paying close attention to the details of our story"
1,Teacher,300,I think definitely you could I think just paying close attention to those small details is really important
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I like how you use part of the word partial to break it down into something that you already knew"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I see that you're really getting this idea that there wasn't a lot of ice on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,"I'm really glad that you that this group was able to make some real world connections, based on your past experiences"
1,Teacher,300,That's a really good skill to be able to have
1,Teacher,300,"I see how you saw in the reading that they called them craters, but there was only a little bit of water"
1,Teacher,300,So that's what's called like texts to real world connections
1,Teacher,300,Where we found that from is from outside now
1,Teacher,300,So that's a really good skill to have
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, I see how you're using the text and rereading and finding more information that's really great"
1,Teacher,300,So I can definitely see where STUDENT got his answer because like you said the paragraph says that this that the walk
1,Teacher,300,The ice is found in the crater
1,Teacher,300,"so I can definitely see where he found his answer, but other than that"
1,Teacher,300,I like that you went back in the text and dug a little deeper to see if there was more information
1,Teacher,300,And I really like that you brought up that point
1,Teacher,300,You are absolutely right
1,Teacher,300,I like that you went back into the text and you found specific details to share with us
1,Teacher,300,Now let's see some other answers STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,I really liked that you noticed that NASA had sent a small machine
1,Teacher,300,"So I really liked that you went back in and saw some details, STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,And I love how you pull that answer for number two
1,Teacher,300,And I love how just like STUDENT You're using previous knowledge and you're making connections and it's so important
1,Teacher,300,"And I love that answer, because I can see that you noticed that the sentence had a scientific tool in it"
1,Teacher,300,I love how you identify the microscope as a scientific tool
1,Teacher,300,Thank you see that was a much more detailed answer you just added more detail to your first answer
1,Teacher,300,Thank you for that STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,So you wasn't wrong you just added more detail to show your understanding
1,Teacher,300,That was that's a much more specific detailed answer
1,Teacher,300,"They would be able to learn something, because he was very specific in describing what the machine was and what it did"
1,Teacher,300,and I'm sure if someone who has never read this informational texts before if they read your answer
1,Teacher,300,yeah I like how you're thinking very much like what can we do right now with this with this stuff
1,Teacher,300,awesome I love how confident you are in your answer and I love that you're thinking about what these astronauts would need to be in space
1,Teacher,300,awesome great and I love how you're all looking back at the text
1,Teacher,300,"Use the technique core like locating the keywords and to find help you find the answer, but my"
1,Teacher,300,Locating this into the second paragraph
1,Teacher,300,And I'm glad that you are you are ready to read the text that that tells me that you read the text and that you understand the meaning of these facts
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so,I know that sometimes can be difficult to remember scientific words"
1,Teacher,300,Answer is not wrong
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, that's great evidence to support it"
1,Teacher,300,You all brought your background knowledge to answer this question and I'm happy that you are able to do that
1,Teacher,300,That's a really good point
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah, so I see both of your points"
1,Teacher,300,So I like that answer
1,Teacher,300,"but that's a good answer, because it does refers to something back in the text"
1,Teacher,300,I love how you went back and you found specific you even found even more evidence than you already had that was very impressive
1,Teacher,300,And what it did was it three great things
1,Teacher,300,He told us what equipment they use and what it was called
1,Teacher,300,I love your answer
1,Teacher,300,And you use that to make a complete answer
1,Teacher,300,"And so, so while you're here"
1,Teacher,300,So I like that you found some details in the article
1,Teacher,300,Let me talk to you and STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,"yeah Okay, I see what you're saying"
1,Teacher,300,awesome thanks for looking back at the text for me STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,"That told us how they were able to discover it, so I had the same question when I was reading it right, I was thinking, how did they find it they can't even see it"
1,Teacher,300,that's that's good thinking that you that you did not notice that
1,Teacher,300,yeah it does seem like that would be really important
1,Teacher,300,hmm I definitely understood that you were looking for different
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so we have that ice detail there, which is good that we are adding details"
1,Teacher,300,"that's great STUDENT and i'm glad that you were able to really think deeply about on how you were answering that question, and what you can do moving forward that's fantastic"
1,Teacher,300,And STUDENT you have your hand raised before
1,Teacher,300,"Okay yep and that's that's a valid argument there, but you know, I think"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, so STUDENT I see how you got that from our text and you focused on our fifth paragraph and talked about what what water is made up of"
1,Teacher,300,"I really liked how you pointed out that they did find water and that they found water in craters because that's exactly right that's where they found the water, but I was wondering STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,And you know what's the banner that could be a little bit confusing
1,Teacher,300,"And that's a really great question that's what I bought to STUDENT, but when I read about the"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah but I like even how your mind was thinking about other types of equipment that scientists use that shows that it's something that really interests, you and I really liked it that's where your"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so I hear that you found some specific items from the text"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah so awesome that you found that really specific name for the tool right that microscopic water, you need a special instrument in order to find it but"
1,Teacher,300,Okay cool so I can hear the specific evidence from that you use your response it's clear in the text where you got that from
1,Teacher,300,So just using that one sentence STUDENT and i'm really like i'm really glad that you're making sure that you prove your answer with a point that one sentence you just read you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
1,Teacher,300,"You also made sure that it matched lunar orbit orbiter which has to do with the moon so like I love, how you really use the key vocabulary, to help you find your answer so really great job,"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah it seems like you have a ton of background knowledge about what equipment that astronauts use, could you tell me specifically because we learned something really cool about water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,"but I love, how you both had different opinions and said your evidence, and went there, yes STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,"Perfect so I love, how you identified that like NASA sends a small machine and I think you're on the right track,"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, and I think it's great that you're identifying that as non scientists, we would need a microscope in order to see that water right"
1,Teacher,300,that's a great sentence to point out because that's the whole point of our question right is
1,Teacher,300,I like you added all that in there and accessed your background knowledge um
1,Teacher,300,mm hmm so the miscroscope is the equipment that we might have had more experience with
1,Teacher,300,"You might have seen it or heard of it, so I can see why you would have picked it out from the passage"
1,Teacher,300,"But yeah they had to really, really dig deep to find any particles that they can even look at it, so I love it you like expanded that an understatement That was good"
1,Teacher,300,"But let's look at it again, it said, the water we found was microscopic"
1,Teacher,300,Where you got that answer so she did a really good job of using the text
1,Teacher,300,awesome so that was a great idea of trying to think about what types of tools scientists use
1,Teacher,300,scientists definitely use microscopes
1,Teacher,300,That was a good connection
1,Teacher,300,"Okay STUDENT I see you located a specific piece of the text, that was a good a good move,"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, very good, and this was a tricky one because micro of microscope also has some US so one could think of it as an equipment, so I completely understand why you may have been confused and if"
1,Teacher,300,"makes sense, I completely understand why you could think that"
1,Teacher,300,"lovely and that that makes complete sense, of course, like if we send people to the moon, how will they be able to do that"
1,Teacher,300,"and you guys are already provide the evidence you guys already circle, the evidence and the text that we can use for the answer the questions so STUDENT why don't I just start off with you"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh, I see, so you are making a prediction there right and you're making connections that is excellent job STUDENT However, my question here is particularly asking you to find a text evidence from the reading that I gave you so"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah and you found the text evidence as well, you did an excellent job, all right, you did you did either disappear job excellent"
1,Teacher,300,"awesome well, I really enjoyed your response STUDENT because it really displays the most outstanding aspect of background knowledge and"
1,Teacher,300,"I love the how you identify the word equipment, because that was actually the question you were asking so you're halfway there"
1,Teacher,300,"So I love, how you a thoroughly enjoy the reading I could see that you understand the text and that really impressed me STUDENT that are really, really great job"
1,Teacher,300,"OK, I see that the best part about your best part about your work, is that you understood the text passage correctly"
1,Teacher,300,awesome great job and telling me but small machine wasn't necessarily a small machine and you did a really great job and showing me how you understood the text okay excellent STUDENT go right ahead
1,Teacher,300,"yeah I love how you're telling us about the process find any so locate in the US, or perhaps and"
1,Teacher,300,"I love how utilizing all the words from the question sentence and you're trying to find that word and try to revisiting of the paragraph, I really, really great job so you're correct indeed"
1,Teacher,300,"That appears in twice in this passage right so that's why it was a little bit confusing, but you did a really great job thoroughly reading an entire paragraph and telling me how it actually works to find water good"
1,Teacher,300,"that's awesome he said I love that how you're sharing your answer with us the beginning of the STUDENT and really, really appreciate it, and then you also show me how outstanding aspect of background knowledge that you have an insight as class"
1,Teacher,300,"Sure okay I love that you gave the answer, and it will really impressed me was that you capture the word Microsoft scoping from the passage some important key word there,"
1,Teacher,300,I really liked that you're sharing your process with us yeah go ahead
1,Teacher,300,yeah you're right right right right okay I love that you're sharing all this thoughts great
1,Teacher,300,yeah so I love that you're sharing that with us and the water being discovered that is called the microscopic okay
1,Teacher,300,"yeah oh good good I love that you're giving connections and predictions they're great great I love it all right Oliverin, I would like to circle back oh yeah go ahead"
1,Teacher,300,that's some really good thinking you're absolutely right there STUDENT that you need to be able to see it in order to know that you found it
1,Teacher,300,It's always a great idea
1,Teacher,300,"Oh great, I love that you decided to look back in the text to find out the answer to the question when you weren't sure"
1,Teacher,300,"got it thanks guys, so it tells me that you all really spend some good time examining this article, and looking for answers to this question about the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,That would be easy for you to sign and come back to
1,Teacher,300,I love that a lot of you circle that answer in your text
1,Teacher,300,"That your original answer was close but it wasn't quite right, thank you for noticing that on your own"
1,Teacher,300,so STUDENT used his knowledge of those two words individually to put them together and figure out more about what a lunar orbiter is
1,Teacher,300,that's right i'm really glad that you pointed up paragraph six that's a good point
1,Teacher,300,"I love love love that you brought up that example that's that's what's called an analogy, and it is a great analogy STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,I see how you found the answer in the text you looked for the scientific tool and the text
1,Teacher,300,"It is, I see how you mean that connection"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh well, that's Okay, I see how you got to your answer by talking about what they discovered which was another important part"
1,Teacher,300,yeah I see I see how you came to that conclusion that having water on the moon would be valuable to have for astronauts in space if they can't go by any
1,Teacher,300,but I see how you came to your conclusion
1,Teacher,300,I think i'm I see how you got to your answer
1,Teacher,300,"yeah I see I see how you got to your answer so i'm assuming that the answer you gave me was just no, but the question asks for you to provide some evidence, so I suggest"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh that's really interesting I have not, I have not read that but I see how you could use that maybe as evidence to support your your answer that maybe, yes it is valuable"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, I see how you found found you got to that"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh Okay, so you made a connection between equipment and oxygen tanks interesting"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh, so you have made a connection between deep and pools, and then that makes you feel that there is going to be a lot of water on the moon interesting"
1,Teacher,300,"now let's take deeper STUDENT I really value, how you have made a reference to a machine that was sent to the moon"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, thank you, that was very gracious of you STUDENT and Dave to have this discussion and to clarify this concern"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh OK, so I really value, how you have talked you have thought about all the costs that are going to be involved in this exploration, which is an important component in determining the value of any exploration"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so thank you so much for sharing your responses, I really value how both of you did until I know you have been able to identify reasons why it might not be a good idea for us to invest"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay Thank you so much for sharing your response STUDENT I really value, how you have stated, the costs and benefits and stated your own personal opinion at the end"
1,Teacher,300,"Right, well, I could totally see why you would think that, STUDENT, right because you were looking for equipment, something that's going to help us look at water"
1,Teacher,300,Clearer a little bit sharper in terms of understanding what that small machine is because
1,Teacher,300,"And you talked about equipment, I think a microscope is certainly an equipment,"
1,Teacher,300,Oh yeah that's a good idea
1,Teacher,300,I totally see where you're coming from on the microscope part I think my um
1,Teacher,300,"yep that's true so you're right in that they do use a lot of equipment and oxygen tanks were mentioned in the text,"
1,Teacher,300,"And if not, which component is missing missing I think even did a really good job of identifying which component was missing from his"
1,Teacher,300,And STUDENT I was curious with your response
1,Teacher,300,I thank you first for Providing that response and I love that you use scientific language like saying the word scientific and tool and even saying the word microscope
1,Teacher,300,"yeah so a lot of times, and I love that you're bringing in science STUDENT i'm sure you guys have done some really amazing fun stuff in that class"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so even I like the fact that you're identifying a piece of equipment that's scientists used"
1,Teacher,300,"Ah, I see what you're saying interesting I see your perspective in and you're thinking about what scientists might need as part of the equipment that they need to go searching for the water on the moon"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so I like the way that you went back to the passage and he looked more closely to see if you could find more information, so there was nothing wrong with your answer before, in that it gave us a hint but"
1,Teacher,300,"And you know, sometimes we do that when we're reading text and that's really great when we're visualizing"
1,Teacher,300,i'm so glad that you were using your visualization skills STUDENT so make sure you go back and revise some of your thinking that you did there okay
1,Teacher,300,yeah I love Thank you that's I love the way that you stated that it showed a new thinking STUDENT yes
1,Teacher,300,"I think that the progression by which you identify those events was very clear, and it may painted such a clear picture for others, so thank you for restating that"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, STUDENT I saw from your response that you really use your background knowledge well and you did a great job using that background knowledge"
1,Teacher,300,awesome so I saw in your answer STUDENT that you did a great job identifying evidence identifying equipment that scientists use to reach the moon
1,Teacher,300,"Oh that's true that's true, but what I see you doing STUDENT is pulling out your background knowledge which is really strong you're doing a great job pulling out that background knowledge"
1,Teacher,300,"I love that critical thinking Farrah I love, looking back at your answer like that awesome so let's as a team has Oliver and Farrah let's as a team go back to the text and i'd like you to, yes STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,"That is so true and I love that you brought in that background information STUDENT that's super important when you're reading a text like this, so great job"
1,Teacher,300,"Hello everyone, I just want to say thank you so much for sharing your answers with me, I can tell by everything that you guys put down that you really understood this passage and done a great job looking in the text, for your answers STUDENT"
1,Teacher,300,"that's a great point STUDENT, which is why answering these questions can be kind of tricky"
1,Teacher,300,"But I think we all did a great job really breaking down with this question with asking us for and finding a great sentence that helps us answer this question, so if we want to answer another question"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so you identified a piece of equipment right and I like that you started off with that,"
1,Teacher,300,"I OK, I see how that makes a lot of sense"
1,Teacher,300,Oh really great point STUDENT Farrah with yours on specifically I noticed that you did a really good job naming a piece of equipment and then telling me what it does
1,Teacher,300,"And then for Chris and STUDENT I noticed that you two have really great you know you either side, you have the first part, the second part that's great now we need to work on adding in that missing part"
1,Teacher,300,Right so glad that you were able to pick that up and go back to the question and read it and notice that mismatch between your answer in the question
1,Teacher,300,ooh I like that you're looking for that keyword right
1,Teacher,300,"ooh really great detail with your Farrah I loved how you did all those three steps right, you told me here's a piece of equipment, this is what it does now question to you, does"
1,Teacher,300,"it's in the text right you're exactly right STUDENT great job connecting directly from the text, so this is what we're looking for when we mean finding directly from the text i'm"
1,Teacher,300,"Discover is the action verb that we want to emphasize on for answering this question and i've noticed that, on your answer is like really matches what the question is asked about because"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so yeah you give a specific answer that included the name of the equipment that's really concrete"
1,Teacher,300,I really appreciate how you went back to the text and found evidence to include in your answer
1,Teacher,300,that's a great point
1,Teacher,300,that's a great point STUDENT
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, great I appreciate how you were looking at the whole story in a really detailed way to pick out that evidence, just like Luis was picking out that evidence and so was Farrah Oliver and STUDENT so"
1,Teacher,300,"Great I love how you're reflecting on the keywords in that question and you realize that you were missing a little part of the question, there"
1,Teacher,300,yeah a lunar orbiter yeah so that's the name of it that's getting more specific and more into the details that the the writer used
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah these are such good guesses right, and that's a great way to use what you already know about the word orbiter to understand what a lunar orbiter is"
1,Teacher,300,"because sometimes readers, even if they don't have all the details, they make a picture in their head and they might update that picture as they keep reading, but they start to form an idea in their head in a picture of what that would look like"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I see what you're thinking there"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I love that you all brought in so many interesting facts that you read about in the article into your responses"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so I think that you guys did a really great job of Combining all of what you found in the text to create the best answer right Luis and Jazmin you guys talked about the small machine called the Lunar orbiter"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, that's awesome and I see you found some great evidence in the text because they do say that, precisely, thank you for sharing"
1,Teacher,300,STUDENT I I love your thinking that you really found the the theme of the text and you're totally on point with
1,Teacher,300,"You also I see how you're connecting your knowledge about astronauts to this article, which is great"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, definitely I see how you're connecting original answer and growing your"
1,Teacher,300,"So you use the text to inform your answer, which is great so i'm"
1,Teacher,300,that's how you feel a great so let's just let's just do like a little thought experiment so even though you don't like writing and maybe that's why you're not being so specific which I can understand
1,Teacher,300,That sounds like a really good strategy and will probably set you up for success next time we're coming up with a problem
1,Teacher,300,I like that you found relationship between the words
1,Teacher,300,"It allows you to kind of visualize maybe even if I don't know what a lunar orbiter is it helps me kind of imagine some type of machine, so thank you for that Thank you"
1,Teacher,300,I think that you you all circled a really important parts of the text that allow us to understand the different sorts of equipment that NASA uses to find water on space
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, I think that's a great strategy that you're using so yeah, so I think that is an important part of the question, what blah blah blah like does that or what equipment and then what are we looking for with the equipment"
1,Teacher,300,"Nice, I, like the way that you're using the strategy to kind of pull apart the important parts of the question"
1,Teacher,300,yeah so thank you yeah so I like how you phrase that we're looking for equipment that's used to discover water and great
1,Teacher,300,"Nice yeah so thank you so you're right, it is equipment, which is what we're looking for and you found it in the third paragraph I like I use the text"
1,Teacher,300,yeah so I definitely like the way that you're going about this about answering this question is you're thinking about equipment and they're thinking about equipment us to discover or find or look for the water
1,Teacher,300,yeah so I also see the Lunar orbiter in paragraph two
1,Teacher,300,"yeah I like how your second half, got a little bit more specific after our conversation"
1,Teacher,300,"yeah so thank you for offering the different functions of different tools, so that was a great revision"
1,Teacher,300,"Oh, I really like that strategy of looking for keywords I think that that can be really helpful i'm i'm actually really happy that you chose to use that strategy"
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, well, I think that it's great that you guys have been looking for keywords when I was speaking with STUDENT, he also He also mentioned the same thing, and I think that that's a really great strategy"
1,Teacher,300,"and I really value how, in your answer you guys directly talked about a piece of equipment"
1,Teacher,300,"I agree yeah oxygen tanks, is an important piece of equipment for astronauts so I really like that you included that in your response"
1,Teacher,300,"Yes, well, I really value that you talked about a small machine and that you went back into the passage to look for evidence that supports your answer because"
1,Teacher,300,"All right, I appreciate you paraphrasing that and putting it into your own words"
1,Teacher,300,"Great well, I really appreciate how you guys chose to look for a piece of equipment"
1,Teacher,300,"awesome, and so what I really like about what you said STUDENT is this word machine that you mentioned,"
1,Teacher,300,"Great yeah and STUDENT when I read your answer you use the word tool to describe the microscope, and so I think that that's another great word when we're thinking of different types of equipment mentioned"
1,Teacher,300,"Yeah great, so I think STUDENT I liked in your original answer, how you mentioned a small machine"
1,Teacher,300,"STUDENT you said something interesting you said not yet, and I really like that, because it makes me think that maybe there's more to the story, maybe something might happen, where it might be valuable"
1,Teacher,300,The scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so it's very good that you guys use textual evidence in the textbut how do you think
1,Teacher,300,Oh that's what you were thinking okay cool um
1,Teacher,300,I really appreciate your active reflection and self regulation
1,Teacher,300,"you guys located the information in the text very, very well um"
1,Teacher,300,"I think you were, you definitely used some great skills on figuring out okay which in which sentence, did they find water right?"
1,Teacher,300,"And you looked at the sentence that said microscopic and thought , oh microscope"
1,Teacher,300,Of course I love that you advocated for yourself in that way
1,Teacher,300,"that's beautiful I love, how you use that context you use evidence from the reading"
1,Teacher,300,"mm hmm no That was really good using her background knowledge, because it didn't say it in the text, so it was very good"
1,Teacher,300,That was actually good using background knowledge to make connections
1,Teacher,300,"Using the context clues that we use before, when we were analyzing the question you know, using words like investigate and seeing that it's a small machine that they use it's a great job"
1,Teacher,300,Good alright so that's good background knowledge understanding what they found
1,Teacher,300,"so that's actually a good context to as well, using that background knowledge understanding our tools"
1,Teacher,300,yeah and I see how you're answering this question by using your own knowledge rate your own experiences from watching movies and seeing the equipment that's being used
1,Teacher,300,"Both had this inclusion about the microscope right this detail about the microscope, and so I see how you're providing this specific tool to support your answer"
1,Teacher,300,"Great and then STUDENT you've included some great pass knowledge about how water is composed of these two parts, hydrogen and oxygen it's a great time to chemistry that makes sense, with why we need water, we need these perks"
1,Teacher,300,So I see how that connects to what we're talking about here
1,Teacher,300,And I see how your even mentioning other answers like Jazmin's she mentioned it's needed to be
1,Teacher,300,"Okay, so I see that what you did is when you were looking at the article you identified words that remind you of equipment right, and one piece of equipment is a microscope"
1,Teacher,400,But we didn't exactly answer the question about equipment. What equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon.
1,Teacher,400,"But I'm a little concerned that you did not connect the question to the text. So looking back at the question, what's the question that we're looking for. Can you tell me that. Are you able to tell me what the question is."
1,Teacher,400,"Yes, so the water they found, you would use a microscope to study it, but it doesn't explain how they found the water."
1,Teacher,400,"However, I think that this point doesn't answer directly the main question. This is the next step after they discovered water for the moon, hey, this is part of the equipment that they discovered what are the one."
1,Teacher,400,"You are correct with you need a microscope to look at it really closely, but they're asking what equipment do the scientists use to discover it."
1,Teacher,400,"You are correct with you need a microscope to look at it really closely, but they're asking what equipment do the scientists use to discover it. The microscope is equipment that they looked really closely at the water with, but did they discover the water with the microscope."
1,Teacher,400,"Alright STUDENT, so, when we look back at the question, it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. While it may be true that scientists do use oxygen tanks and probably very often, it's not the equipment that they use to find water on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,It's not the specific tool used to get to the water to get those samples. That's what the question was asking.
1,Teacher,400,"Because we were asking about equipment, not what they found."
1,Teacher,400,"They do. But that's not what the,that's not what. The question is what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon? It said that those things are not what they used to discover water on the moon. It was the Lunar Orbiter."
1,Teacher,400,The question is actually wanting to know what equipment they used to discover water on the moon.
1,Teacher,400,"Yeah absolutely it's kind of part of the moon so it is something that caught the water, but it doesn't quite answer a question about it being a piece of equipment that the scientists are using."
1,Teacher,400,"But for this specific question, it wants to know what specifically they used to find that water. And that wouldn't necessarily be like oxygen tanks and things like that."
1,Teacher,400,"However, having that knowledge does help you with this overall topic, but it's not specific to that question, if that makes sense."
1,Teacher,400,"To help you understand this question, this question specifically is asking what what equipment they use to discover the water, yes, they do use that equipment to help them discover the water, but that is not the actual equipment that is discovering the water."
1,Teacher,400,"So that's what they found, but we were looking for what equipment that they used to discover that on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,"So while oxygen tank and a mask and suits are part of the equipment they use for this question, we're only focusing on what they use to discover water on the moon"
1,Teacher,400,The question asked for you to talk about the equipment.
1,Teacher,400,"What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Oxygen tanks are pieces of equipment, but they don't really go with the water on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,"But in the question, we want to focus on the equipment they use to discover that water."
1,Teacher,400,"And i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically for how the water was found"
1,Teacher,400,"So I want you to reread the question because I don't think you fully understood what the question was asking. Because your answer didn't have anything to do with equipment, it just said that water was found on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,"That is true, that is where they discovered the water, but the question was the equipment that they used"
1,Teacher,400,Because we are looking for the specific word of the equipment that they use.
1,Teacher,400,"Microscope is used to discover water, but the article is thinking more in general of what equipment would be used along with the microscope."
1,Teacher,400,"We're talking about the equipment. So you did name where we found it, but the question is more focused on the equipment."
1,Teacher,400,"The question though it did ask us, it said what equipment did scientists use and you're talking to me about astronauts."
1,Teacher,400,"I'm concerned that the question is asking for what was used to discover water, right, and we've only mentioned the tool that's used to see it once you have discovered it."
1,Teacher,400,"The question is not based on the videos that you watched or the YouTube videos you watch, it's about what you read."
1,Teacher,400,"There are all different types of tools, like equipment, gear, all those other things, but for right now, the question is asking for the ones that will help us find the water."
1,Teacher,400,"But yes, STUDENT, you are correct,that those are all different types of equipment that astronauts use. But for this particular question, it was the equipment that they used to discover water."
1,Teacher,400,"But i'm just concerned that you are understanding the full question itself, because the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,"The question is actually asking what did they use to discover water on the moon, and while they use so much equipment up on the moon, we need to focus on what was used to discover water specifically."
1,Teacher,400,"They weren't really thinking about what they use to actually get to space. So yes, you're right, they did use the oxygen tanks and things like that, because there is no oxygen in space, but they were focusing more on the water piece versus what they use to get to space."
1,Teacher,400,"STUDENT, I'm not sure that maybe you understood the question correctly. You put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Well, you do need a microscope to look really closely, but this question is, we're looking for the name of the piece of equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,"But right now, we're looking for the actual piece of equipment that was used to discover water on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,"Right. And again, like he said you know that's one way to look at it, but the question is actually specifically pointing toward what's the potential value."
1,Teacher,400,"You read it as, is water on the moon valuable right now, but the question actually says, could it be valuable at some point in the future."
1,Teacher,400,"A concern that I have with you guys, is that we want to make sure that we're really focusing on the equipment that is used by scientists to find water on the moon."
2,Teacher,400,"Yeah that is correct, but that's what they wear. We're looking at what they used to find the water."
2,Teacher,400,"I am concerned, though, that the question is asking why you would want water on the moon."
2,Teacher,400,Really what we're looking for is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
2,Teacher,400,"I'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically about water"
2,Teacher,400,"So you're definitely right about how NASA uses so much equipment to do so many different things, but the question is only asking for one specific machine or equipment that they used to find the water."
2,Teacher,400,"That is true and it's basically just what I told STUDENT, that the scientists do use a lot of equipment, so much equipment for so many different things. But the question is only asking for one specific piece of equipment that was used to find the water."
2,Teacher,400,"But when we look back at the question it's only asking specifically what machine they used to find the water, not all the other machines."
2,Teacher,400,"But when we look back at the question it's only asking specifically what machine they used to find the water, not all the other machines."
2,Teacher,400,"So Farrah with your question, you tell me about a tool which was great. You told me about a tool that's used to look at the water but we're not looking at the water really closely, we are trying to find the water."
2,Teacher,400,"Okay, you need to be more specific in your answer. What small machine? What was it called?"
2,Teacher,400,"Okay and in your answer you said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. And yeah, you would need a microscope to look really closely closely, but does your answer tell what discovered the water?"
2,Teacher,400,"You should be able to pull your answer right from the text. So a small machine is great, but there's more specific information in there that could give a more specific answer."
2,Teacher,400,So all those facts are right that you guys had but they're wanting a little more specific answer okay.
2,Teacher,400,"So I think the one that stands out to me the most is going to be you Oliver, I noticed that your response didn't tell me anything about what went on in the text."
2,Teacher,400,But for this one answer wasn't quite there is because we needed to focus more on that equipment than what the equipment was finding.
2,Teacher,400,But it's still wrong and it doesn't really tell us what the question is trying to get at. We want to know about this equipment. So we have to make sure we talk about the equipment specifically.
2,Teacher,400,"Yes, yes, they do. They absolutely do. But I think that answer might leave out some important parts of the story."
2,Teacher,400,"Something that's right on the cusp of being just what I'm looking for. In this case, Jazmin was a little too vague."
2,Teacher,400,But I think it was wanting to be a little bit more specific and getting a little bit more detail from the reading about the microscope and lunar orbiter. So you're on the correct track Jazmin. We just need to push it a little bit more into detail.
2,Teacher,400,"Jazmin, you said that NASA sent a small machine, right. They did send a small machine. But what I'm looking for is what is also the name of that small machine."
2,Teacher,400,"Mr Chris, did you consider that those machines were not mentioned in our text?"
2,Teacher,400,"However, when we're given a text, we do have to look at what it talks about in the text. I know that you answered, saying that they used equipment like oxygen tanks, but that was not mentioned in the text."
2,Teacher,400,Your answer is about how the kind of water that they found was microscopic but it doesn't really say how they got the water.
2,Teacher,400,What Luis and Chris described is how they got to the moon and not what they used to discover water on the moon.
2,Teacher,400,"Well, I'm glad you know all about space, but we're looking for specific information from the text that we have."
2,Teacher,400,"All right, well then, if you think you're good let's look at your response. First, let's see, our water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. That is very true, but I'm concerned that you're not giving me a reason to as why it could be valuable on the moon."
2,Teacher,400,They did send a small machine to discover water on the moon. But what was the name? We're looking for more detail. What was the name of the small machine?
2,Teacher,400,"Right. NASA sent a small machine, but you need more detail. Yes, they did send a small machine. But what was the name of this small machine?"
2,Teacher,400,"The thing that troubles me with your answer is that you said the same as Farrah, which shows me that you're either looking at Farrah's paper or you didn't have your own idea. "
2,Teacher,400,"Wow, that's very possible and Chris, you did find some good information because water can be very heavy. That is true. But we're looking for convincing evidence that it could be valuable."
2,Teacher,400,"So they do use a lot of things, but you didn't look for the specific equipment that the scientists used to discover the water. "
2,Teacher,400,"Yeah, so I mean you do have a point there that they used other things too. But I was just looking for a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon."
2,Teacher,400,"But I'm a little confused on how the oxygen tank helped them discover the water on the moon. Because to me, they needed the oxygen tanks to get to space and to be able to survive in space. I don't see how oxygen tanks discovered the water."
2,Teacher,400,The point of the oxygen tank is to supply oxygen to the astronauts. I don't think the intention is for it to discover water.
2,Teacher,400,So I would say that your answer was just a little bit incomplete. It was lacking just a small detail on what specific machine they sent.
2,Teacher,400,"Luis over there said oxygen tanks. Now that is equipment and it did help them, you know, get to the moon to discover the water, but he needed to be a little bit more specific on the actual equipment that discovered the water."
2,Teacher,400,And your answer said they sent a small machine which is true. It's a little bit more detailed than Luis's. We just need that extra bit of I guess what specific machine.
2,Teacher,400,"So, back to you studentand Oliver, the microscope helps them look closer at the water, but the microscope itself didn't actually discover the water. "
2,Teacher,400,"Well, so even though you know a lot about space and you know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and microscopes and things like that. It's really cool. But you have kind of missed the answer about what equipment we need to discover the water on the moon."
2,Teacher,400,Your answer doesn't really encompass how water on the moon might be valuable.
2,Teacher,400,My concern is that you want it to be right now and you're not thinking about the future.
2,Teacher,400,"Because if you just put Lunar Orbiter, we're not going to know what question you are answering."
2,Teacher,400,Because if we just put down Lunar Orbiter they're not going to know what we're talking about.
2,Teacher,400,"Well, that wasn't an answer, because in our text it didn't talk about that."
2,Teacher,400,"But your answer is, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. It doesn't answer the question exactly about what equipment the scientists used to discover water on the moon."
2,Teacher,400,So although it's really great that you have a lot of background knowledge we have to look at the the paragraph to answer our question.
2,Teacher,400,"Your answer is pretty solid as far as a comprehension of space but as far as discovering water, oxygen tanks don't really have anything to do with that."
2,Teacher,400,I'm concerned because oxygen tanks did not help the scientists find water.
2,Teacher,400,"Okay, you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. That is a tool that they use but the question asked about discovering water on the moon. "
2,Teacher,400,"But since they sent a small machine, I don't know that we would have needed the equipment for actual people like oxygen things to check that out."
1,Teacher,400,"I definitely think that those pieces of equipment could be important, but I think that we're looking for a little bit more specific piece of equipment that helped us discover water."
1,Teacher,400,"Mr. Luis talks about how they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in our texts but It doesn't say anything about oxygen tanks. Do they do use them? Yes, but not in this text."
1,Teacher,400,But the microscope cannot exactly go up to an object and find something. You have to put the object you want to look at under the microscope.
1,Teacher,400,But your answer doesn't reflect on our text and the main point here is that we're trying to find in the text what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
1,Teacher,400,You didn't mention what type of machine. You just wrote a small machine and that's not very specific.
1,Teacher,400,"And, as I talked to Farrah she said microscope, which was mentioned in the passage. But for you, my concern is that you didn't have really your own answer you just said that yours was the same as Farrah."
1,Teacher,400,One part you were missing though is what they were looking at.
1,Teacher,400,"But just some common mistakes, I think, are that some people just didn't use specific words from the text."
1,Teacher,400,But I want to hear more specific answers like what kind of small machine that they sent. We need to be able to understand what small machine it was because it tells you what small machine it is in the reading. 
1,Teacher,400,"Oliver, I want you to be able to come up with your own answer in your own words."
1,Teacher,400,I didn't really see that you understood the reading well because your answer was I circled the same as Farrah.
1,Teacher,400,But you didn't take that extra step to look for the small machine's name.
1,Teacher,400,"I love how you worked together with her, and I think it's great to work with your classmates in class but, for your answer, I want to hear what you have to say."
1,Teacher,400,"And I don't think that that answer was based on evidence from the text, but I think it was based on your background knowledge, which is great to use when answering questions, but not for this specific question."
1,Teacher,400,The water is heavy and it does take up room on the spaceship but you didn't relate it back to the question of how that would be valuable.
1,Teacher,400,"Okay yeah let's go back into your answer you had said that NASA send a small machine, this is not incorrect, they did send a small machine, however, in the text it provided the actual name of what that machine was so I'd like to see a bit more specific detail to know exactly what that small machine was."
1,Teacher,400,But we need to highlight the equipment that they used.
1,Teacher,400,We need to be able to know the equipment that we use to find the water first before we analyze it .
1,Teacher,400,"That is a really good answer. So remember, our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. And so you said you need a microscope to look really closely, but one thing that your answer is missing is kind of a connection to that question. "
1,Teacher,400,"But you just one concern that I have is that if I was just reading your response and I had no other context, I would say, well, what can't we do for a long time?"
1,Teacher,400,So one concern I have about your response is that I was just reading your response and I wouldn't necessarily know what the question was asking from your answer.
1,Teacher,400,"And similar to the feedback I was just giving Luis, I just don't get how your answer realtes to the question. Right like, how does your answer show why it's valuable to get water from the moon?"
1,Teacher,400,Your answer wasn't necessarily answering what the question was asking.
1,Teacher,400,"I just wanted to see where you found it. I wanted to have like specific textual evidence in your answer. I know you found it in the text, but I wanted you to point it out in your answer so the rest of the class knows where to look."
1,Teacher,400,"And then Chris, your response says that they found craters full of water. But you didn't really answer the question of what equipment they use to find the craters."
1,Teacher,400,"Okay, so Luis your answer didn't really say whether or not you agreed that there is enough evidence. You just stated evidence."
1,Teacher,400,"Your answer could have gone either way. You could have said no, water splits into this and it wouldn't be a good resource or yes, because it does split this and that. If you do read on your answer is leaning more towards the positive, so I assumed that you were agreeing, but I don't want to have to assume."
1,Teacher,400,"Just like Luis he didn't really state if it would be a good thing, so I had to assume that the answer was a positive that you did agree."
1,Teacher,400,"Perfect. Perfect. That's great. And then so Oliver, you said you circled the same as Farrah, but I think we want to go deeper into that, and I want you to have your own answer."
1,Teacher,400,But someone who didn't read this text might not know what a small machine is.
1,Teacher,400,"I'm concerned about the way that you worded your answer, Farrah. So the way that you worded your answer didn't really restate the question."
1,Teacher,400,I am concerned because you didn't really rephrase anything. You just said I circled the same as student's. That doesn't help me know if you understand the question or the answer.
1,Teacher,400,So I'm a little bit concerned that you didn't use a lot of detail.
1,Teacher,400,My concern is you didn't include any equipment in your answer.
1,Teacher,400,"Yes and so equipment is an important word in the question, but you didn't include any equipment in your answer."
1,Teacher,400,"Right, so you need a microscope to look at the microscopic particles, because it's so small, but that wasn't necessarily the tool that they used to send to the moon."
1,Teacher,400,"Right, so you have the answer, small machine. My concern is, is that there's a name for that small machine that you didn't mention."
1,Teacher,400,"If you provided that information that you just told me, Chris, which is great background knowledge, the person who's reading this won't know where you got that information from because it doesn't apply to this question. "
1,Teacher,400,When we provide information from our own background knowledge the issue is that we don't really have concrete evidence of where you got that information.
1,Teacher,400,"So even though I might know that you visited NASA, if somebody else was reading your response and they didn't know that, they might wonder where you got that information from."
1,Teacher,400,The person who's reading your response won't know where you got that information.
1,Teacher,400,"For example, I know that you went to NASA, because you've talked about it. However, maybe Oliver doesn't know that. So if he was reading your response he may question where you got that evidence and if it's truly valid."
1,Teacher,400,"Absolutely. That is correct. If there were astronauts there, they would need oxygen. But the oxygen tanks wouldn't be a tool to discover the water."
1,Teacher,400,But the text doesn't say that they sent any astronauts to the moon to find the water. 
1,Teacher,400,Jazmin NASA did send a small machine but you if you read on in that sentence there's a name for that small machine that you didn't use in your answer.
1,Teacher,400,So you identify why water is valuable. But one thing that I'm concerned about is that your answer isn't specific to just the moon and we're really thinking about why is it such a big deal that water's on the moon.
1,Teacher,400,"What equipment, did they use to discover water on the moon. You guys found the equipment that they would use to look at what they discovered right but it feels like we skipped the discover step somewhere in there. "
1,Teacher,400,yeah I'm worried that the response doesn't actually answer the question.
1,Teacher,400,But right now we're focusing on what we found in the text.
1,Teacher,400,"I do not see any paragraph related to the oxygen tanks. So even though that's really interesting, we need to find our answer in the text. "
1,Teacher,400,"You did you're so close. You told me what the machine is and you actually circled the evidence correctly and you gave me the answer, however, you didn't tell me the name of the machine."
1,Teacher,400,"You actually did an excellent job catching that NASA sent a small machine. However, you just didn't identify what the small machine was called."
1,Teacher,400,But you didn't go back to the reading and tell me what the actual machine was called.
1,Teacher,400,But we wanted to use the text and not our background knowledge.
1,Teacher,400,"They do, but this is asking us specifically from our reading, not from what we know from other places."
1,Teacher,400,I'm concerned that your response doesn't include all of the benefits that water could provide to the astronauts.
1,Teacher,400,But my concern is that we still don't know the machine's name and how it assisted in the discovery.
1,Teacher,400,"Because we're gonna make sure our answer touches not only discover, water and moon, but also equipment. And my concern is your answer might not including the equipment component."
1,Teacher,400,"I'm concerned you looked at Farrah's answer and I don't think that's the case, but I want to make sure you're doing your own thinking."
1,Teacher,400,"So you're totally right about that, but I want to just go back to the question because I'm concerned that your answer doesn't totally answer the question."
1,Teacher,400,And one thing that I'm concerned about is that maybe your response doesn't exactly answer the question.
1,Teacher,400,"And I'm concerned that the responses that you guys chose, which is a microscope, isn't necessarily used to discover water on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,"Now you talked in your response about scientists finding craters on the moon, which is absolutely correct, but I am concerned that your answer doesn't completely align with what the question is asking."
1,Teacher,400,"But our answer has to use evidence from the text. Sure they might use that other equipment, but in the text it didn't have anything about that."
1,Teacher,400,"Right, you need to be a little more specific so that they understand what you're talking about, because I was looking at it and you said small machine and I might think you're talking about the microscope because the microscope isn't big it's small."
1,Teacher,400,But you didn't specify exactly what that machine was called.
1,Teacher,400,"So I'm concerned Chris that you took your answer only from the first paragraph, but there's more information about how much water there is on the moon later in the article."
1,Teacher,400,"I think you're raising a good point that they might have needed to use something like a microscope but we don't know for sure, because it doesn't say that the scientists definitely used a microscope."
1,Teacher,400,"And with that, STUDENT. Let's look at STUDENT. STUDENT you mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but like we just talked about with STUDENT that oxygen tanks weren't exactly in our story. So I'm concerned why you're talking about things not in our story."
1,Teacher,400,"Well, like we just talked about with STUDENT. There's not a lot of water on the moon. So I'm a little concerned that you're saying that astronauts don't need to take it on their ships anymore. Do you think they may still need to take some water with them?"
1,Teacher,400,They would have to use a combination of all those things. But this article is mainly about the lunar orbiter that they use and what we can do with the water once they found it.
1,Teacher,400,But they didn't say full of water. You didn't really read and do your underlining and highlighting.
1,Teacher,400,"A piece of equipment, but in the text, it didn't really mention that the microscope helped discover water on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,"But specifically this paragraph addresses just a small part of that process and that is actually investigating the craters on the moon. So, that is right, STUDENT, they do need a lot of equipment to get there. You know, a lot of equiWe're looking for what's actually mentioned in the text, like the microscope or the lunar orbiter.pment to land and they need equipment to examine the craters. But this article that we have here is examining just one little part of that whole process."
1,Teacher,400,"But in your answer, I also would have liked to see you mention the lunar orbiter because that was the big idea of the text that we read, and that was the most important piece for specifically finding water on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,"You said that scientists use a lot of equipment which is good. You, you talked about how they use equipment. But you said that they use oxygen tanks and oxygen tanks were not mentioned in the text."
1,Teacher,400,"And STUDENT, you said that the scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks. So oxygen tanks weren't mentioned in the passage."
1,Teacher,400,"But the question is what small machine discovered the water, so if we look back at the reading the microscope is what they use to view the water, not what found it."
1,Teacher,400,But the microscope was to look at the water that was already discovered.
1,Teacher,400,You use those. But I don't think they use those to necessarily find the water.
1,Teacher,400,"They did use that because we can not breathe the air on the moon. So we did use that, STUDENT. You're totally right about that one. However, they needed to use a specific equipment to really, really find water because it was very, very hard to find."
1,Teacher,400,"The text said the water was microscopic, but they never said they need to use a microscope."
1,Teacher,400,"Okay, so let's start with you, STUDENT. So you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks on the moon. So I in the article I don't recall them saying that they use oxygen tanks, however I know that astronauts do use oxygen tanks."
1,Teacher,400,"This phrase in general, what you wrote was not used. They didn't talk about that in the, in the passage."
1,Teacher,400,"Lunar orbiter is a really great piece of equipment that you mentioned, however, I also want to make sure that we know that glass is not so much equipment, as it is just something that's mentioned as an object."
1,Teacher,400,But if we look at the article right it doesn't mention oxygen tanks.
1,Teacher,400,"So even though we know that they use things like oxygen tanks, that's not specifically in the reading."
1,Teacher,400,"I see that you understand a little about what a microscope is but I'm a little concerned that while the microscope is a tool, it didn't really discover the water on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,You know there's actually very little water really on the moon.
1,Teacher,400,I'm wondering if there might be some equipment that we missed in that text.
1,Teacher,400,"But my concern, though, is is that maybe the way the form that the water is in on the moon is a little different than the way that we see perhaps a lake full of water here on Earth."
1,Teacher,400,"I don't think the text said they found a big amount of just water, but they found various little small things that you cannot even see with the human eye."
1,Teacher,400,"That means that it was really really small, that you would need a microscope to see it. It doesn't really tell us, that specific line, what the tool was called that discovered the water."
1,Teacher,400,"That particular tool, though, is not what found that microscopic water."
1,Teacher,400,"So hearing what you wrote, I think you you got the words microscopic and lunar orbiter mixed up from the text."
1,Teacher,400,"You know I I'm glad you caught the tool component, but I'm a little bit concerned that you think they would have the microscope with them. I think they're saying they wouldn't need it."
1,Teacher,400,"That there's water on the moon, but he only found very miniscule amounts of water and they did you're right they did find that in the craters. On the dark side of the moon, the part of the moon that doesn't see the sun, right, but it wasn't lots of water it wasn't like the kind of water you go swimming in it, would it would be something that you view with a microscope."
1,Teacher,400,But one thing that i'm concerned about a bit is that I don't remember oxygen tanks being talked about in the passage.
1,Teacher,400,"Okay i'm gonna have to look further after but i'm in the paragraph. it doesn't say was filled. it just said that it was found in the craters. So just to make sure you understand, it wasn't like filled to the top, it was just at the bottom they found some water and some of them so that's how they found out there, that there was water on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,"I'm concerned, though, that there is evidence in paragraph four."
1,Teacher,400,"One of the, a concern that I have is when you're reading nonfiction often they'll give you a little bit of information in the beginning, and then they'll keep elaborating on it later in the article that will give you a fuller picture of what they're talking about."
1,Teacher,400,"So, by saying the name of the machine instead of saying a small machine you allow whoever reads that response to know exactly what you're talking about. So, please add in the name of the machine to your response."
1,Teacher,400,"As far as what type of equipment scientists used to discover the water on the moon, it has a specific name. So, it's always very important to read everything in the question and text before answering the question."
1,Teacher,400,"A question relates to the passage. So, when it says equipment in the question, what we want to do is to find the equipment that was mentioned in the passage."
1,Teacher,400,So next time. How about we try. We'll start with either a strong either yes or no and then like you did just now will back it up with some evidence. Does that sound good?
1,Teacher,400,So the next time you're answering your question. What's something you can do when you're answering besides just saying no.
1,Teacher,400,"Okay Okay, so when you're answering so next time when we have questions, make sure you're answering all parts of the question and as much detail as you can."
1,Teacher,400,"You explained to me that it was a piece of equipment and what it does, but I wanted you to tell me how it was used to find water on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,Try to add a little more background knowledge to your answer. So you could say why the water on the moon is important and how it can help.
1,Teacher,400,So yeah just maybe next time just try think of a reason why the thing that they found is important.
1,Teacher,400,"I mean, I, as I said last time, adding an extra sentence to it can only help it sometimes and never make it worse."
1,Teacher,400,"It was right, but I wish you had a little bit more information like what was the small machine that they used."
1,Teacher,400,"It was right, but I wish you had a little bit more information like what was the small machine that they used."
1,Teacher,400,I wish your answers had a little bit more detail. 
1,Teacher,400,"But I also think maybe next time and your responses you could give us a little bit more of a personalized approach to your response. So maybe what you found from the text, along with what you thought about it. Does that sound good?"
1,Teacher,400,"But like I said to her, maybe personalize it a little bit, add your own views. Sound good?"
1,Teacher,400,"Thank you. So, Jazmin, like we were saying, I think you had a really good response just maybe go the next step, read a little bit further and then add to your answer before you respond. Okay?"
1,Teacher,400,"Your answer is not necessarily wrong I just think we could expand on it further, so if you could look back in the text and see exactly where you have your answer so in paragraph two, is there any more knowledge that you can add to your answer now?"
1,Teacher,400,"Adding more information would make your answer a little bit more, what's the word I'm looking for? Specific. And a little bit more on task. "
1,Teacher,400,You just needed to go a little further to name the machine they use or the equipment they use.
1,Teacher,400,"You just needed to go a little further to name the machine they use. But so far, so good."
1,Teacher,400,"Oliver. You realized that Farrah had a good answer and you agreed with her, but next time I would like you to either add on to something she says, based on the text, or you can make up your own answer. So you're adding on to the discussion or adding your own opinion to it."
1,Teacher,400,"For next time I would just like you to add on. So you see how she said they use a microscope to look closer at the water? You could have added on to say if you saw another equipment in the text. Or, if you disagree or anything, just add on to the discussion so we're not all saying the same things."
1,Teacher,400,"My suggestion would be to look at the passage the paragraph before it, where it stated the the equipment they use to find the water in the first place. Before they could even look into it with the microscope they use something else to find the water. So my suggestion would be to add that and then revise your response."
1,Teacher,400,"It actually wasn't wrong, and I see where you answered your question, I just wanted you to be a little more specific of what the equipment was called. So you had a good start, and you were almost there, you just needed to name the equipment. So you you were on the right track."
1,Teacher,400,"Yes, that is correct, so you just needed, you were on the right track, you just needed to name the object. So for next time when you're given a response, make sure you're as specific as possible. But you had a great start."
1,Teacher,400,I just want you to look into it and find the evidence to support your answer.
1,Teacher,400,"Exactly great observation. And another thing is, if anything, you can always use direct evidence from the text to answer your question as long as you use the quotation mark for the evidence. But good job yeah exactly."
1,Teacher,400,"Okay, so one thing is we need to make sure that we are answering the question fully. So the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon. So what you want to say in your response is you want to say scientists discovered water on the moon by using blank equipment."
1,Teacher,400,We want to be using that good language and good vocabulary that we're learning from the text. 
1,Teacher,400,"You want to make sure that - it's all about being specific. You want to use good examples from the text. So I want you to go back and reread and be more specific, because we want specific answers."
1,Teacher,400,"So I would love if you go back, reread the question and then go to the passage and come up with your own answer because I want to know your own ideas and thoughts for the answer."
1,Teacher,400,"So going back to what Luis said again, Luis, if you want to try to finish your statement because you're on the right track that the lunar orbiter is a small machine. But what does it do? To answer the question in context. "
1,Teacher,400,"Just make sure when you're writing answers like this, you need to be very clear about the what and the why. So you had part of the what you just needed the second piece."
1,Teacher,400,"It's just we need more specifics right. So when we're answering questions like this, you need to have the specifics. You don't necessarily have to take the whole paragraph you read."
1,Teacher,400,But we need to be a little more detailed
1,Teacher,400,So do you guys see anything that could support your answers from the text?
1,Teacher,400,"We want to really reference, the text, just so that we show that we found our evidence in the text, you know."
1,Teacher,400,"I think it's important that, when you say something you know you have evidence to back it up so in case somebody asked Oh, how do you know that, how do you know this is true, you can say Oh, I found it in this source or you can say, you can quote the text."
1,Teacher,400,so would anybody maybe like to revise their answer? and maybe just include a piece of evidence in there or a specific word?
1,Teacher,400,So now that we now that we know that that that the expectation is maybe using more specific language Jazmin would you maybe like to revise your answer using one of the words that we just discussed or one of the phrases that we just discussed?
1,Teacher,400,"But what we want to do is we want to make sure that that you're using terms that are in the reading like just, just like the ones that we just talked about, like microscope, like Orbiter, things like that. So we want to make sure you're using the most strong vocabulary you can from the reading."
1,Teacher,400,"So I'm going to show you my example sentence right here, this is how, if it were me, I would start this sentence. But keep in mind there's a million ways to start the sentence. I would say ""to discover water on the moon, the scientist used blank."""
1,Teacher,400,"And you look, you can find at least two more tools that you can pull out and use in your response. You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope. you'd also need blank and you'd also need blank."
1,Teacher,400,"Now I'm sure you did circle the same as Farrah, but I want you to come up with your own words and your own answers."
1,Teacher,400,"What types of equipment did you see in the reading? So again, the example sentence might help you."
1,Teacher,400,Perfect now can you add that to your whole sentence and make a whole new sentence for me?
1,Teacher,400,"You said that NASA sent a small machine that's perfect NASA did send a small machine, but I want you to add more. I want you to build on that now. You went back and you highlighted the Lunar orbiter as one did you highlight a second one?"
1,Teacher,400,Perfect can you rebuild your sentence for me in a way that explains both of them?
1,Teacher,400,"my only suggestion for you like, your answer was almost perfect is just to put the name of the small machine. That's it. That's my only issue. Otherwise your answer is perfect."
1,Teacher,400,"Well I'm so glad that you worked with your classmates and I think it's really important to work with your classmates, but when answering your question on your own paper, I really would love, if you could explain your answer, rather than say you didn't listen to someone else."
1,Teacher,400,"And the only only recommendation I have, for your answer, because it's almost there is to just name the small machine that they used. That's it to make your answer perfect."
1,Teacher,400,"Okay, great. So next time when you're doing this, maybe explain what the microscope was used for."
1,Teacher,400,And maybe add what the machine was called.
1,Teacher,400,"To answer the question fully, you would need to describe the exact small machine that found the water."
1,Teacher,400,I think you should be looking at the text and pulling evidence for a specific sentence that relates to explaining why water is valuable.
1,Teacher,400,You said it would be too heavy to carry the water but then your response should have something about why the water not being carried would be a good thing. So just elaborate a little bit off of that.
1,Teacher,400,So make sure to relate our answer back to the question that's being asked.
1,Teacher,400,But maybe we could elaborate on why they use this tool. What does this tool help them with?
1,Teacher,400,"So referring to the water on the moon text, can you kind of elaborate on that response? Can you tell me why you need a microscope?"
1,Teacher,400,"Chris and Luis, I'd like to hear more concrete examples of what kind of equipment they use."
1,Teacher,400,"Sure. So, that that is a correct answer, a small machine. I guess I'm just looking for you to be more specific. "
1,Teacher,400,"OK. So sometimes if we just include the quote, we also want to include our own thoughts to make the quote expand our thoughts with the quote. So it's kind of two pieces you need is your own thoughts and the author's thoughts or the writer's thoughts."
1,Teacher,400,So the more details we add can make our answer better.
1,Teacher,400,"So maybe you already knew that piece of information, but you can find another piece of information from the text. So right now we're focusing on stuff you can find from the text, and we always want to do that first. And if you have more information to add, that's great. You can add that later. But we really want to focus on what we're reading."
1,Teacher,400,"So what you did was you answered the question, but we need more tools too. Maybe think further on our answers."
1,Teacher,400,"But maybe we can use another tool like rereading through all of the text, right? And then, if we reread through the text, we can find a little bit more details and maybe even more of the tools that came up within the article."
1,Teacher,400,"So that would have helped out your answer and made it a little bit more specific. So you're not wrong, it is a small machine, but just to add a little bit more detail and clarification, so it's nice and clear."
1,Teacher,400,"So even though you do have your background knowledge that we activated and even though you know that they use a lot of different tools, maybe we could just look through the article to find what they specifically used."
1,Teacher,400,"To answer the actual question, which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, we just need to go in a little bit more detail and make sure that we're rereading the text to answer the question."
1,Teacher,400,But we just need to beef up your answer a little bit and use a little bit more academic vocabulary.
1,Teacher,400,"You might want to add that into your answer as well, to be very concrete and make sure you're using all your resources from the passage."
1,Teacher,400,Great. So incorporating that information in your answer really shows me that you understand the reading. So I think that would be a great detail to add in your answers.
1,Teacher,400,But if you can put that sentence into your own words that shows me that you understand. 
1,Teacher,400,"It's really small. So, saying that in your answer shows me that you understand what a microscope is and that you know that the water on the moon is really small and that you got all that information from reading the passage."
1,Teacher,400,Exactly. Put it in your own words to show that you understand. That's perfect. 
1,Teacher,400,"So, so basically the words that your classmates have been using and what you already know from going to NASA. Those are some of the words I want to hear in your answer. "
1,Teacher,400,"so next time when we're giving our answers to these questions, we want to make sure that we're including details like the name of the small machine that NASA sent but you're absolutely right."
1,Teacher,400,"So, like, I told for Jazmin when you're giving answers you want to make sure you have your evidence to back up your statement as well."
1,Teacher,400,I think that we can add more details to your answer. So let's do a sentence spring.
1,Teacher,400,But what we want to do is add more supporting details to give yourself a stronger answer.
1,Teacher,400,Yeah you could add those two equipments. Maybe you could start a new sentence with them. Just add in that those were two equipments that they used to discover water on the moon.
1,Teacher,400,"A way that I could see you making a response even better, is kind of adding the question into the response. So you could say ""one way that the water is valuable is you can split it into hydrogen and oxygen."""
1,Teacher,400,"Keep the first part of your answer, and then go back and try and find a little bit of evidence in the text as to why you think the answer is correct."
1,Teacher,400,So I would look back to your answer and add some more evidence from the reading. Good job
1,Teacher,400,"yeah I think that's a really good answer, I think you could go a little bit further by just maybe quoting the text, just so that you're really getting your information from the text."
1,Teacher,400,Is there a way that you can add some words to that that would strengthen your response and make it connect to the question a little more?
1,Teacher,400,"You're right. Exactly. So you had all of the right information. It's the one thing. Like, if I were to answer your question I'd use your exact words and say something like, ""to discover water on the moon you need a specific scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Right? So if you just add that little sentence that helps give your answer some context. So if I look at it without the question I still know what you're talking about."
1,Teacher,400,"Right, so NASA did send a small machine, but can you add some details like what was that machine called? Do you remember?"
1,Teacher,400,So when we're gonna fix some of our answers we want to add some specific details from the text and we will so that we can show that we have a really deep understanding of the text.
1,Teacher,400,"So, is there information from that sentence that you can add to your response to just make it a little stronger?"
1,Teacher,400,"Right, so one suggestion that I have for you is maybe being a little bit more specific with your words and even including the evidence that you had ready to tell me in your response."
1,Teacher,400,"So I think one suggestion I have for you, like the suggestion I had for Farrah, would just to be to add a few more specific details, so that I and your peers can understand better."
1,Teacher,400,"Oxygen is needed for astronauts to breathe. And so, if you added that to your response, it would help me and any of your friends reading the response understand why the water on the moon is valuable to us."
1,Teacher,400,"Yes, please restate the question in your response."
1,Teacher,400,"We could develop that a little bit more. You can say, you know, what kind of small machine did they use? Or different things like that. Just develop your thought process a little bit more than you already have. "
1,Teacher,400,"and we want to make sure we're going to, we want to make sure that we're using the text to support our answers."
1,Teacher,400,"I will say the one part of improvement or one area of improvement that I think that you could work on would be looking at all of the tools that they referenced because yes, they did use telescopes but sometimes they also use, there are other tools that they utilize as well."
1,Teacher,400,So I just want to make sure you that you're going back and referencing the reading that we have in the assignment to make sure that you're getting all of the points possible.
1,Teacher,400,So we just want to make sure that when we are answering our questions that we're being as clear as possible.
1,Teacher,400,"yeah so what I, so what I meant by that, basically, is just you want to make sure that you're stating the information that's written in the text."
1,Teacher,400,"It's not always about having more words, you just want to make sure that you're using the text and you're able to reference the text in your reading."
1,Teacher,400,"So the only part that I would, the only suggestion I have for you, and this suggestion is for everybody, not just Jazmin, is that in your answers, I would like you to state where you found your evidence next time."
1,Teacher,400,"A suggestion I would say, is adding, ""I know this because, in paragraph four, it states."""
1,Teacher,400,But can you tell me what the machine is? Can you be a little bit more specific about that?
1,Teacher,400,"Yeah. That's perfect. So when we're saying our answers, we want to be as specific as possible to the text because that's really important to give evidence to what we have instead of just the general. So if you have a specific thing from the text, definitely include that always in your response because that gives me an idea of how much you can understand what's going on."
1,Teacher,400,"So when we're looking at our answers, I want you to be able to maybe explain just why they needed this equipment as well."
1,Teacher,400,"So when we answer, we want to be very specific. So like in the text, what small machine are they talking about? Did they say what kind of small machine?"
1,Teacher,400,"Yep. So that's what you want to specify that the equipment that use was the lunar orbiter, which is a small machine. So, you are correct. But we just want to make sure we're super specific about it."
1,Teacher,400,"We can go deeper into the text and get more evidence and details for the response, and that would be great."
1,Teacher,400,"Just make sure that we're going deeper into the text and reading it one more time, so we can find even more information."
1,Teacher,400,But if we want to look deeper and find more evidence that would be amazing.
1,Teacher,400,So I would look definitely more closely and find some more tools or more evidence from the text that we can use to support your answer to the question.
1,Teacher,400,"Make sure you use evidence from the text to support that. Scientist sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is what it states, so you want to word that and make sure that the understanding of where it came from and what it is, is incorporated into your answer."
1,Teacher,400,"So one thing you can do to add to your answer is in the text where did you find that answer, so you can say in paragraph two."
1,Teacher,400,"So all of you, in your responses, can add where you found your answers in the text into your response. So we can all say like in this paragraph I found my answer."
1,Teacher,400,"But what I want you to work on is just being a little bit more specific with your response. you know what I mean? Just try to pick out details from the text. You know, earlier we did our lesson on comparing and contrasting using context and background information, so make sure with that we look for specific details in the text."
1,Teacher,400,You can focus on really building that answer out by identifying the scientific equipment.
1,Teacher,400,"And then explain how that equipment was used to discover water on the moon, and then, once you've gotten that you can add that to your answer."
1,Teacher,400,"How can we work in the text, can we find something that's going to give you even more specific information about that small machine?"
1,Teacher,400,"You mentioned the small machine, but a better answer would tell me what the machine does."
1,Teacher,400,Can you be more specific and look back in paragraph 2 to see if you can find the rest of the or the more detailed part of the answer?
1,Teacher,400,Would you like to go ahead and start looking back through the passage to see if you can use the word discover?
1,Teacher,400,"Did you hear how they gave it a little bit more of a specific name? So instead of just saying a small machine, they called it a microscope."
1,Teacher,400,"Looking into and finding it for the first time. That's how I would change your answer, just a little bit to make it a little bit more clear now."
1,Teacher,400,"So if we were able to come to that same sort of answer, but give more details, you might be able to better inform your reader, who's me the teacher."
1,Teacher,400,"I think we can be a little more specific in your response. So you said oxygen tanks and yeah, absolutely. They're gonna use oxygen tanks there. Could you tell me maybe another piece of equipment that NASA used in this article to help discover water on the moon?"
1,Teacher,400,"A lot of words can seem tough, but making sure that your reader knows exactly what you are saying can go a long way. That way you don't get any confusion, so they know you're just as smart as I know you are."
1,Teacher,400,"Right, we kind of want to let our readers know that we're talking about the scientist specifically. So you could say, NASA. Or you could say scientist used if you want to do either one of those. I think would convey your meeting."
1,Teacher,400,"So maybe next time when you're doing that you could you could be more specific, you said NASA sent a small machine."
1,Teacher,400,"But you could clarify your statement a little bit more. Right. Well, that'd be a good strategy."
1,Teacher,400,"However, we also have to use specific text evidence and just like STUDENT learned I can't just stop at NASA said a small machine, right?"
1,Teacher,400,"Keep reading what small machine get very specific with your answer. And be sure to answer every single part of the question using evidence from the text, STUDENT."
1,Teacher,400,Is there a place in the text that that mentions what hydrogen and oxygen can be used for?
1,Teacher,400,"Exactly, exactly, the more detail you have, the better off your answer is."
1,Teacher,400,"Lunar orbiter, right, so if you add it in that NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter, you think that could have clarified your answer?"
1,Teacher,400,Let's take our little answer and make it a great big answer to make it make more sense to make it concrete.
1,Teacher,400,So how about let's restate the question to form our answer.
1,Teacher,400,"See how that answer grows? Yeah, this is really short one word answer we created a whole sentence where anybody reading our answer can identify what we are talking about what we're learning about."
1,Teacher,400,So just write down the questions and then use them. The words on your paper or on your iPad. You can just rearrange them to restate the question.
1,Teacher,400,But when we're answering questions we probably should refer back to our the reading that we were given to find out answers that we need.
1,Teacher,400,"How would you use that answer to convince me that water is valuable, or could be valuable on the moon?"
1,Teacher,400,"Perhaps you could have worded it by saying, water is valuable, or could be valuable."
1,Teacher,400,"STUDENT, you wrote that NASA sent a small machine. That's very good. So maybe we need to investigate, look a little further to see what is that machine called."
1,Teacher,400,"So one strategy we could use let's let's work together with STUDENT. Let's help her her figure out what we could add to this. Okay, so what is a strategy that we can use to look back at the text and to know where to look in the text?"
1,Teacher,400,"Good, so you're right, it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen. Now let's go a little bit further with that answer. And can you also see if you can find what you can use the broken down oxygen and hydrogen for and that can go along with your evidence?"
1,Teacher,400,"But looking more specifically, you want to see if you can find the exact name of that machine and kind of be able to explain what that machine does. So your answer was right on it, you just wanted to add some more detail to it."
1,Teacher,400,So when I'm looking for my answer you want to look for details that will tell you how the water is going to be valuable.
1,Teacher,400,But we want to say give like a yes or no question. If you think that it is valuable and all of your details put together does say yes it is valuable because they can use it for surviving.
1,Teacher,400,"Maybe, but you can also use the passage. Remember too you can use your reading passage to help you figure out how it would be valuable."
1,Teacher,400,"Yeah, and that's what STUDENT said. He said it could be useful because it can be broken down. Now he could have extended his answer a little bit more and said what is valuable about breaking it down."
1,Teacher,400,Why is it important to make sure to read all of the information before we try to answer the question?
1,Teacher,400,"So it's really important when we are answering questions, even though you found part of the question stem and your answer, you've got to look around it to make sure that's the total."
1,Teacher,400,"Yeah, sometimes that works. But sometimes we have to look around too. So yes, it is a small machine and the small machine may answer a question, because we have to also ask a small machine that did what?"
1,Teacher,400,So we always have to look back to our text and refer to that when we're trying to find our answers.
1,Teacher,400,We need to restate that question in our answers.
1,Teacher,400,"When you restate the question, you kind of take some some some words from the question and put it in your answer."
1,Teacher,400,"The equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon was a lunar orbiter. It gives our reader more information and they can, if they know nothing about the topic that helps them learn more about it, doesn't it?"
1,Teacher,400,"So whenever we're looking at passages, we really want to focus on textual evidence. Now textual evidence is when you have a question and you refer back to your passage to find the exact answer, or as close as possible."
1,Teacher,400,You always want to prove your answer so that you always know that it's right.
1,Teacher,400,So we want to be as detailed as possible when we answer our questions so that we have all the information that we need in our response.
1,Teacher,400,So when I talked about how you could break it down into hydrogen and oxygen that talked about a way that makes your water valuable.
1,Teacher,400,"Correct, you got to make sure that you answer the question. And when you answer your question, you got to make sure you add all of your details."
1,Teacher,400,So you should be looking for something more specific. What the small machine was called would be a more solid answer than just the small machine. So when you're reading and it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon? You should name that machine.
1,Teacher,400,In the correct response like just just if you were having a conversation with someone and like as if you are super excited about the moon and they asked you what kind of machine do they use discover water on them and then your answer should be more specific to answer them. If you're having a conversation like you would name the machine and tell them how they used it. So that's kind of the answer you should be looking for in answering these.
1,Teacher,400,"You know you've, you found the piece of equipment that they used, but we have to be a little bit more specific here."
1,Teacher,400,"So next time when we are asked a question, instead of saying, I answered it like STUDENT, or a neighbor, make sure you write an answer out instead of saying I found the same thing as my friend. I want to hear what you found."
1,Teacher,400,"Well, it's always good to add detail to our answers. And so the more detail we can provide with our answer, the better or the stronger answer can be."
1,Teacher,400,How do you think that we could have wrote our answer differently to include the question?
1,Teacher,400,"Not that your answer is incorrect because I see in the third paragraph that it states exactly what you said, but maybe adding exactly what they're looking for can also help your other friends. Maybe if you're working in partners of two."
1,Teacher,400,"So that's the only thing I would add to yours. What you put was correct, but your teacher may want you to be a little more specific. So you could just name the actual machine, and it was called the Lunar Orbiter. So you're not very far off just a little bit more specific."
1,Teacher,400,"Yeah, we want that specific evidence from the reading that we want to pull that straight out that shows we found the answer to that question. STUDENT. That is one thing I think that will help you if you really try to pull that answer out of what you're reading."
1,Teacher,400,"Instead of just agreeing with STUDENT, maybe think about why do I agree with STUDENT. What is it that she picked that I agree with? So you could still say I agree with STUDENT, but then tell me that reason why you agree with her."
1,Teacher,400,"And if you need help getting started, you could say the equipment and the scientists used to discover water was the what? And then write out your response."
1,Teacher,400,"So what I'm sort of wondering, could you be a little bit more specific, perhaps, in identifying what that small machine could possibly be? So to be a little bit more specific you would then, you know, want to choose perhaps the Lunar Orbiter."
1,Teacher,400,I think if we go back into the text and we look for any mention of equipment that scientists have used and we underline that that we could then build on your answer. We'd have a complete full answer to that question.
1,Teacher,400,Usually it's best when we answer a question if we just stick to that question and we can save the extra information for discussions like when we're having right now.
1,Teacher,400,"How do you think we could be a little bit more specific in our response, because there are lots of small machines in the world, right?"
1,Teacher,400,"If we go back into the text, we can see the type of small machine that they sent and so we can give that a name. So that when we respond to the question we're being specific with our answer."
1,Teacher,400,"And so your answer. You said NASA sent a small machine. So I would like for you to tell a little bit more about the small machine. So looking in the text, what could we add to expand and give more details what top of small machine was it?"
1,Teacher,400,"Alright, so talk about what you found. Not what STUDENT found, so just go in and maybe read it and just, again, we're looking for what equipment the scientists use to find water. And talk about yourself, not another student. That way, if I had no clue if I've never read the text, I'll read your question. I know exactly what you're talking about when we answer."
1,Teacher,400,"Yeah, tell me something about it. And what else, what identifies that machine?"
1,Teacher,400,"Yes, so what you'll do is, for example, you are going to restate the question. So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable."
1,Teacher,400,"I would say that you do need more evidence, your evidence does say that bringing water on the moon is hard, but I would also talk about how the water on the moon would be good."
1,Teacher,400,So the best place to start is the key words in the question and then going back to those headings to try and see if we can look underneath that heading for an answer.
1,Teacher,400,"That is correct. But if you want it to be more specific in a good answer, you could have said NASA sent a small machine and it is called a lunar orbiter. So STUDENT, you were on the right track."
1,Teacher,400,"And then, to be more specific in our answer we could have put the name, and what is that machine called?"
1,Teacher,400,So STUDENT you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. How could you be more specific to the passage?
1,Teacher,400,We just want to dig a little bit deeper into the text and maybe help your fellow students figure out some more details about what NASA did to find water on the moon.
1,Teacher,400,I want you to help each other understand the text. And so now that we know the key words that everybody thinks I want you guys to reconstruct your answer to give us a little bit more detail about the equipment that specifically helped us discover water.
1,Teacher,400,"One thing that may help you in the future is to answer the question, as if you were teaching about the question. So if somebody was new to reading this passage, just like you guys were, how would you best explain it to them so that they would get a full picture of what you guys are reading?"
1,Teacher,400,"Sure, so you can also remind them if you were teaching or even from your perspective as a student, if you can answer the question, and then give us a little bit more detail as to why that your answer that will help you with a with a more concrete answer."
1,Teacher,400,"But that detail you just added is critical. That's why it's valuable. The fact that when I break it down the oxygen, hydrogen astronauts can breathe the oxygen. And they can use the oxygen and hydrogen as fuel. So that second part that you just gave me. That's why it's valuable. So that's a great answer."
1,Teacher,400,So I just want you to go a little further in your explanation and use some evidence from what you read about.
1,Teacher,400,So I just want your answer to be a little more specific and sometimes that does mean writing more stuff.
1,Teacher,400,"But when you're answering the discussion questions for the text that we read, just try and incorporate something specifically from the text. So the text mentions the Lunar Orbiter. So that would have been a good thing to include in your response in addition to what you said about finding craters of water and they're like suits masks and oxygen tanks."
1,Teacher,400,"Yeah so that is a really good answer and you're definitely correct, but I want you to elaborate a little bit more so, yes NASA sent a small machine, but what was that small machine called?"
1,Teacher,400,"Right, so when we use the term lunar orbiter we're using evidence to support our response and so that's something you want to make sure you're doing, because it shows that."
1,Teacher,400,But you also want to make sure that when you're answering the question you're specifically using evidence and examples that the text gives you.
1,Teacher,400,"So it's awesome to make connections with your background knowledge, but in order to answer a question you want to make sure that it comes from the text."
1,Teacher,400,"However, again when you look at that question, it asks what equipment found those craters of water, so that would be similar to STUDENT where you just want to make sure that you're using a specific piece of evidence to support what you said when you said that there's craters of water."
1,Teacher,400,"And what you could do with that so in your response you could have added something like in another article I read, it said that there could be a base on the moon, and then connect to the article we're reading now, so do you have any idea of how you could do that?"
1,Teacher,400,"Pretty good I would maybe just add a little bit about how like you said they're not carrying the water on the ships anymore, because they're keeping it at the base that they're going to build on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,"So, by saying the name of the machine instead of saying a small machine you allow whoever reads that response to know exactly what you're talking about. So, please add in the name of the machine to your response. "
1,Teacher,400,"As far as what type of equipment scientists used to discover the water on the moon, it has a specific name. So, it's always very important to read everything in the question and text before answering the question."
1,Teacher,400,"A question relates to the passage. So, when it says equipment in the question, what we want to do is to find the equipment that was mentioned in the passage."
1,Teacher,400,So next time. How about we try. We'll start with either a strong either yes or no and then like you did just now will back it up with some evidence. Does that sound good?
1,Teacher,400,So the next time you're answering your question. What's something you can do when you're answering besides just saying no.
1,Teacher,400,"Jazmin, your answer is not wrong. We just want to work to be a little more specific and then we want to work to explain how we know what we know."
1,Teacher,400,"So instead of saying small machine, we know that the small machine was called a lunar orbiter, so we want to try to be a little bit more specific. Instead of saying small machine we want to say lunar orbiter."
1,Teacher,400,"All right, Oliver, your response was really great. I love that you kind of collaborated off of Farrah's idea, but what I want to see from you is to articulate something that you found interesting that someone else didn't necessarily say. I know you have so many great thoughts."
1,Teacher,400,"I want you to try to, when you're answering questions about text, I want you to try to look for specific things. And even if you share the same ideas as your classmate, try to articulate it in a new way and try to explain your thinking."
1,Teacher,400,"Not necessarily. For example, if Farrah has the answer, then you can say the same answer, but just work to kind of say it in your own words and describe what you thought about it."
1,Teacher,400,"No, evidence. We can add some evidence into our answer?"
1,Teacher,400,"I want you to look back into the reading to circle the evidence, where it talks about what you want to answer. You need to have specific evidence from the reading."
1,Teacher,400,"That's perfect, beautiful. I love that. Does it make more sense that you have to make sure you're answering the full question when they say equipment. You have to remember their equipment, and then you can add in those details you have. Those are awesome as well."
1,Teacher,400,"Good. So what do you think you could add to your sentence,to your answer to make it even more detailed and more specific to the question?"
1,Teacher,400,"Yeah, just that was kind of from your prior knowledge. Yep. So now we know to look, you can use your prior knowledge and use what's in the article to answer those specific questions. Yes, Deb, you have a hand up."
1,Teacher,400,"We're going to use writing right from the text to make sure we support our answers. So if we say no, there's something in the text that will support a no answer. And if we say yes, there will be something in the texts for a yes answer. Does anybody want to talk about their response first?"
1,Teacher,400,So there you go. Luis So we'll just add that little part to your response to make sure it's nice and clear on why it's important that the water can be broken down into those two parts. Thank you for sharing.
1,Teacher,400,"And that it would take a lot of money and investment to even use what water there is on the moon. So I when I tell you to go back and finish up your work, please use that evidence to support your answer. "
1,Teacher,400,"So this sentence starter says the scientists used, and then there's a line blank. So this is where you would put the equipment that they used to discover that water is on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,"I found my answer in paragraph blank. And this is where you're going to put the number. There's a number at the side of the paragraphs and I want to know exactly where you found your answer. Okay, does that make sense?"
1,Teacher,400,"Yes. Okay. So, well, I start with Farrah. I want my friends, I want you to start thinking about changing the wording of your answer. Okay, just try your best. That's all that matters."
1,Teacher,400, you can do it on your own. Okay. And I want you to start working on the sentence starter. Okay. Do you need me to read that to you?
1,Teacher,400,Great. I'm glad I'm so glad. So if you could fill out this sentence starter for me.
1,Teacher,400,So your answer is right. But I think that we should add a little bit more detail and describe. Is there maybe an adjective or a name of that small machine that we could use?
1,Teacher,400,"Love it. So, Jazmin, if you could rewrite your answer and maybe use that name. That would be super helpful."
1,Teacher,400,"I was wondering, can you describe the machine at all? Are there any adjectives in the texts that describe the machine?"
1,Teacher,400,"Oh my goodness. Jazmin, you just answered my next question. My next question was going to be. What does the machine do, could you add a little bit more detail into your answer?"
1,Teacher,400,I'm wondering if you can push your thinking further and ask why having more space on a spaceship is good?
1,Teacher,400,Yes. So you guys just need to be a little more specific. What kind of machine was used to discover water?
1,Teacher,400,"Yes. So, how will you revise your answer to include the equipment?"
1,Teacher,400,"Right, so I would like to see you use some context from the story to be able to answer that question. Does that make sense?"
1,Teacher,400,"However, when we're writing answers to comprehension questions about a text that was given to us, we need to be sure that we're just providing information from the text."
1,Teacher,400,To use evidence from the text in front of us.
1,Teacher,400,So it's just a matter of combining your two answers.
1,Teacher,400,"So those are all pieces of equipment. Absolutely. However, when we're answering a question to a text that we've read, we need to be just using evidence from the text. If we use background information."
1,Teacher,400,"But what I want you to do is, I want you to look back at the reading that we did and try and find something from the reading that answers the question about what equipment the scientists use to discover water on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,"Right. So your answer isn't wrong they did send a small machine, but I want to see more detail. I know that you could pull more detail from this. What was the small machine called. Do you remember?"
1,Teacher,400,But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text and add more details to your answer. What was this small machine called and what was it there to do?
1,Teacher,400,So now that you see where we got our answer. Let's see what we can add to it to make it more complete
1,Teacher,400,So go ahead and look into the reading and see what you might add to the answer to make it from a partial answer to a complete answer and then I'll come right back to you.
1,Teacher,400,So I'm going to suggest that your group keeps looking through and looking at each other's answer and seeing what you could add to each one individually.
1,Teacher,400,"You were on to the right path of getting to the answer that NASA sent a small machine they did. But can you tell me more about the machine? Can you be more specific, while using evidence from the text, something to support your answer? What type of machine was it?"
1,Teacher,400,"Yes, we have to read what's in the story when we answer the question of support and that we use what we read in this story to support our answer."
1,Teacher,400,"That's very true what you said. But as I said earlier, we really want to be sure that we're answering what's being asked. We don't want to talk about things that are not in the text or what they're not really asking us because that can be a little confusing. Yes. Chris."
1,Teacher,400,"So my suggestion would be to find some reasons why, even in that long future that you identified why could it be important to have in the future?"
1,Teacher,400,"So my suggestion would be to keep what you have, but now make a connection to why it's important that water is there on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,To explain what benefit can the astronauts or can NASA have that they don't have to carry this water anymore. So what other benefit does that provide? See if you can expand your answer a little.
1,Teacher,400,"I was wondering if we could look a little bit deeper into the first, excuse me, the second paragraph and find out if there's a more specific tool that you can use as evidence for this answer?"
1,Teacher,400,"So for you, I would say, read that part and see if you can add another detail on to it."
1,Teacher,400,"Maybe think about the equipment's looking for water. Maybe where's the water or maybe something to that effect, we can really make a more detailed answer."
1,Teacher,400,I wonder sometimes if we could even use those words to help us look even deeper. So what if we turn those words into the beginning of a statement and figure out if the rest of the information is in the text.
1,Teacher,400,So I suggest you go back to the text underline what answer you just gave me and then I want you to circle something else that links with that to help further your answer. Can you do that for me?
1,Teacher,400,"So I want you to underline what you did answer, which was NASA sent a small machine. So underlined small machine. Okay. And then I want you to just circle more detail with that that would further your answer. A little bit more."
1,Teacher,400,i'm wondering if you also can get a little bit more specific. So what were they sending the small machines for?
1,Teacher,400,So i'm wondering if you can make your answer a little bit more specific. So we're looking for the equipment that they use to discover water on the moon.
1,Teacher,400,I'm wondering if you guys wouldn't mind going back and rereading the text and seeing if we can find a more specific answer.
1,Teacher,400,Luis i'm going to have you look at the text for a second and try to come up with an answer that's a little bit more detailed
1,Teacher,400,When we have a question that tells us to use the text.
1,Teacher,400,can we think of what the specific name of that small machine is? I want us to get as specific as possible when we're thinking about this specific equipment.
1,Teacher,400,But i'm wondering if we could make sure we circle back right to that passage. What information in the passage might help you build a stronger answer to the equipment scientists needed for this specific mission?
1,Teacher,400,so let's go back through reread and really try to find an idea that's connected to the text.
1,Teacher,400,"Very good. Alright Jazmin your answer was almost there and you've got just half of it. I want you to be a little more specific, so you told me that NASA sent a small machine which is absolutely true, can you tell me what that small machine was called?"
1,Teacher,400,yeah my suggestion is that we just use evidence from this story.
1,Teacher,400,yeah so maybe just add that to response and then do you think you could also talk about what you were just telling me about being an environmentalist and.
1,Teacher,400,yeah So how do you think you could describe some of the equipment they use to get to the moon?
1,Teacher,400,"I think you could also talk about your own experience, going to NASA."
1,Teacher,400,"Well, if you can try and find a way to connect it to what you read in the text. So you have this experience with NASA and learning about the equipment."
1,Teacher,400,"So, now that we you've described what the equipment looks like do you think you could tell me a little bit more about why they were a gathering all this equipment and going to the moon, to look for water in the first place?"
1,Teacher,400,Yeah so you can include that and then maybe also talk about why we would need to look for water on the moon.
1,Teacher,400,So I think we can be a little bit more specific about that small machine.
1,Teacher,400,"it would be helpful to elaborate and add more details to your response. But it was a great start, good job Jazmin."
1,Teacher,400,"and give me the actual word with the citing source, then you will get the answer okay okay."
1,Teacher,400,"On the machine. O,h that's okay. Next time, can you please give us a specific name for the machine that's all."
1,Teacher,400,So maybe you could add to your answer a bit about how it would be helpful to have it there on the moon ready to go since astronauts need to drink it.
1,Teacher,400,"To use context clues, you look at the text around a word or phrase to understand what that word or phrase means. [Action step and strategy]"
1,Teacher,400,"Okay, studentI would like you to look back over the passage, and I would like for you to underline where the word scientists appear and what they're using to find the water."
1,Teacher,400,"So, let's take a step back and see what sort of equipment we see mentioned specifically in paragraph two. [Action step]
"
1,Teacher,400,"Look at paragraph two, to see if there was a special machine that they brought to investigate the water on the moon."
1,Teacher,400,Now let's let's go a little further back on our texts and see if we can maybe go a little deeper into how they originally discovered it. Okay. Would you like to maybe give it another go. 
1,Teacher,400,Can you and Oliver work together to go back to the text and figure out what that machine was called?
1,Teacher,400,"I am wondering if you can pull out some information from the text that we used so, can you find a specific piece of equipment mentioned in this text Luis."
1,Teacher,400,"So, can you look at the text Jazmin and see what the machine does?"
1,Teacher,400,"Awesome. So Chris, I want you to go back to the text, and I want you to find me a piece of equipment that the scientists use okay."
1,Teacher,400,"Awesome, well Luis I have a job for you. I want you to look at this text and find me a piece of equipment that the text mentions, okay Luis?"
1,Teacher,400,I want you all to circle a word or two from the text about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon.
1,Teacher,400,"So for saying what equipment did scientist use discover water on the moon, maybe you can look for keywords like like the name of the equipment."
1,Teacher,400,Who remembers when Oliver asked what equipment was and Oliver said that it's like a tool right? So you can look for key words like that?
1,Teacher,400,"So I want everybody to look in your text at paragraph two, and look for any keywords that may help to identify the equipment that was used to specifically discover water."
1,Teacher,400,"Look in paragraph two of the passage to see if you might find another machine. Reread, paragraph two of the passage. Okay."
1,Teacher,400,"And remember your two key words, equipment and discover, and look back to see if you can find a paragraph and the passage that uses the words discover and equipment."
1,Teacher,400,So now that we know the two key words that we need to look for in our reading passage is evidence and valuable. Can everybody look back at the reading passage and underline what you think a good answer would be?
1,Teacher,400,"So, Chris I want you to take a moment and look back at paragraph four, where we see the word valuable, because we're looking for evidence that water is valuable. It's important."
1,Teacher,400,"So let's look look back at paragraph four, and see how, in the future, water would be valuable. Can you do that?"
1,Teacher,400,"Maybe be a little more specific with that question right, so looking for a specific piece of equipment which one which piece of equipment helps them search for water? Okay."
1,Teacher,400,"Okay, Chris, I would like you to go back when you get a chance, and look back over the passage, and I would like for you to underline where the scientists work and what they're using to help them find the water."
1,Teacher,400,"Chris, why don't you go back and look at the text and maybe reread it and highlight some keywords or helpful passages. Then see if you can come to that answer yourself."
1,Teacher,400,"And as you're reading the passage, you know, might be good to take a highlighter and highlight key words. So when you go back, you can look at what you highlighted to help you find the answers."
1,Teacher,400,"So what we want to do now is to go back to the passage take a closer look at the passage and see if you can identify where the words equipment and discover are, as it relates to finding the water."
1,Teacher,400,"Okay, so I want you to go back in the groups that you were take a closer look at the passage and see if you can find out where machine was mentioned where water was mentioned and where the word discover was mentioned."
1,Teacher,400,"So,the sections are labeled 1,2,3,4,5 and six. Let's take a look at section three and see if you can find an example of the equipment they used to find water on the moon. "
1,Teacher,400,So look back through your texts and see if you can look for that keyword equipment and then see if you can find the answer to the question.
1,Teacher,400,But again you want to use context clues to find the exact name of that small machine.
1,Teacher,400,"You read the question first, maybe look at some key words. So for example, in this question you see equipment. So, all right, now I know I'm looking for equipment when I go to read."
1,Teacher,400,"And then I'm going to read the passage and maybe highlight or circle any equipment that I see as I am reading, and then go back to the question and read it again."
1,Teacher,400,What I want you to do is go back and underline at least one thing that they said was useful. And if you want to amaze me. I want you to underline two things and raise your hand once you're done.
1,Teacher,400,"Chris, I want you to look through the text and find equipment that helps them find water. Okay?"
1,Teacher,400,"Did you find that in the text? I want you to find where it tells me what the lunar orbiter does. So circle, a word that tells you what the lunar orbiter does."
1,Teacher,400,Now let's look at some supporting details that prove why it's a valuable resource.
1,Teacher,400,"Okay, so you're when you're reading the informative text, you should be looking for words that jump out to you about the question being asked."
1,Teacher,400,"You should be looking for keywords like, tool, equipment, or maybe machine to help you find what they used to discover the water. "
1,Teacher,400,So look back on your article and look for that word valuable. Do you see it anywhere in there? Maybe look for the word in one of the headings or sub headings.
1,Teacher,400,"Good, so we could underline that sentence to support this discussion question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Right, because investigate is something you do to discover something, right?"
1,Teacher,400,"Okay, so how about we go back in the text and look a little bit more closely, so that we can learn more information about space. Okay?"
1,Teacher,400,"But if you were to look through the sort of the article, a little bit more, you know, sort of try to pick out some key words."
1,Teacher,400,So I would like for you to read the third paragraph and see if we can expand upon Luis's answer that he gave us.
1,Teacher,400,"Sometimes we have to realize that when we're looking for answers, just because it's in the paragraph that doesn't mean the information is needed to answer this question."
1,Teacher,400,So maybe you should go back and just read it and look for some specifics on how scientists or what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon.
1,Teacher,400,So if you'll just go back in the text and try to find some specifics on what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon.
1,Teacher,400,"So you're looking for what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. So just go back and find that, and I'm going to help another student."
1,Teacher,400,A tool. Absolutely. That is perfect. So if you guys could take a second to look back in the texts and find different equipment or tools. What equipment or tools do you see mentioned in the text?
1,Teacher,400,I want you guys to first think about equipment or like Oliver said tools that would be used. And then let's think about how they would be linked to discovering water on the moon. So once you to narrow down tools that would be used to discover water on the moon. 
1,Teacher,400,"Helmets and all the other equipment are absolutely things that would be used to go to the moon. But let's link equipment and or tools to discover water on the moon. Do you see any tools that could be used to discover water on the moon? Let's look back in the text and see if we see any tools. Oh, we've already get some ideas. Jazmin, what do you see what do you think?"
1,Teacher,400,"Be able to better answer text and another thing rereading the text, maybe will help get a deeper understanding of the text."
1,Teacher,400,"All right, stop right there for me, Luis. Excellent job. Thank you. I want everyone to take a moment and circle the most important word that they found in that paragraph."
1,Teacher,400,"Okay, so if we are looking in paragraph number three, look and reread that real quick. And remember, we are looking for the words equipment and discover. Let me know if you find either of those words in that paragraph."
1,Teacher,400,Why don't the three of you get back together and underline in the text important things that water can be used for by the astronauts.
1,Teacher,400,"So look back in your passage and see if you want to change your answer from the beginning, using those keywords that you circled look back in the passage. I'll give you about two minutes."
1,Teacher,400,"I want you to think about what equipment was used, and if you see any equipment mentioned, if you can use your pencil and underline it. Okay, so I'm going to give you a few seconds to do that."
1,Teacher,400,"Now the next step. I'd like for us to go through is which of these three paragraphs actually addresses the question? All right. Take a moment, look through and see just which one actually addresses the question."
1,Teacher,400,"And while each of you had really good thought processes, I want you to take another look at the article, and I want you to either underline or circle words that are similar to the question or words that you think would be really important."
1,Teacher,400,"So, Luis, if you would, right now go to the text and find some equipment that is specifically mentioned in the text and see if your answer is there. If you see oxygen tanks mentioned, and if you don't, what is mentioned?"
1,Teacher,400,So I want you to look for that. Farrah look to see if there's a piece of equipment that was on the moon.
1,Teacher,400,See all these are good points because this allows us to go back into this paragraph and look at the clues that they have left in this article to help us find an answer to this discussion to this discussion question.
1,Teacher,400,So you can talk about your background knowledge. Just make sure you add a little bit of what is in the text that way I know that you understand what we're talking about.
1,Teacher,400,"But in this particular text, we're learning about one specific thing. So maybe next time if we can look back into the text and pull something directly from there along with your personal opinion, we'd have a stronger response. Is that okay?"
1,Teacher,400,"Maybe we could look for some harder words in the text, like spacecraft, and reflect on that to find the answers. Do you think you can do that for me?"
1,Teacher,400,"So if you can reflect on your texts for me and find some bigger words, harder words that maybe you didn't understand and we can go over them."
1,Teacher,400,So that was good but next time I want you to dive deeper into story and think about what they used to discover the water.
1,Teacher,400,Next time I just want you to get a closer look into the text and think deeper about the question.
1,Teacher,400,"For your response Chris, I would just like to ask you to look a little closer into second paragraph."
1,Teacher,400,"So if you guys are having trouble thinking of an answer, you know that you can go back to the text and look at the text."
1,Teacher,400,"So for the three of you Farrah, Jazmin, and Luis when you go back and read, I want you to go back and reread the passage with the question in mind."
1,Teacher,400,"But I just want you to go back and look for more specific evidence, because there is more stuff where you can be super super specific. So reread the question and go back into the passage to find more specific evidence."
1,Teacher,400,"So we're going to look at the reading and the first part, and I want you to circle again independently equipment that you see listed in the reading."
1,Teacher,400,And I want you to circle any important equipment that you see in the reading.
1,Teacher,400,Try and highlight or underline some of the types of equipment that they use and then maybe we can try and adjust your answer again okay.
1,Teacher,400,"Alright Farrah will Jazmin you keep looking and try and find an answer for you read it again, if you have to and highlight and underline keywords or examples you find."
1,Teacher,400,That would be a good start. So again my suggestion is to think about the question in your head and then go back in the reading and try and underline all of the types of equipment that you can find in the reading.
1,Teacher,400,"I want you all to take 35 seconds, and I want you to reread the reading, but I want you, while you're doing that to underline or highlight at least two types of equipment mentioned in the reading."
1,Teacher,400,I want you to underline at least two types of equipment that was used in discovering water on the moon okay.
1,Teacher,400,"In this text, it did not specifically state that a microscope or oxygen tanks were being used, so why don't we look back in the text and see if you can see, specific equipment that was used to find the water on the moon and circle that answer?"
1,Teacher,400,So let's all look back at the reading and see if we can find any important context clues that might tell us right away what the answer is.
1,Teacher,400,it's not always going to be super easy to find the same word in the text. Sometimes you're going to have to think what synonyms are in the text. What other things might mean something similar to investigate or discover?
1,Teacher,400,"Alright, so i'm going to have us do the same activities before i'm going to give you guys each a highlighter and you are going to read the section, highlighting keywords and phrases to help answer the uuestion."
1,Teacher,400,"Reread the second section paragraphs three, through six of the text, and then I want you to highlight two specific examples of how water on the moon could be valuable."
1,Teacher,400,And then i'm going to give you another minute after to highlight those two examples and then we'll come together and share. Does anybody have any questions before we start.
1,Teacher,400,"So now I'm giving you highlighters, and I want you to go through those sections that you just read and I want you to highlight at least two examples of how water could be a valuable resource on the moon. "
1,Teacher,400,"You want to make sure that when you're reading a text, you're trying to take in as many details that are specific to the question as possible."
1,Teacher,400,"I want you to look, and I want you to circle any equipment that is mentioned in the passage. I'll give you guys a minute to do that."
1,Teacher,400,All right now that you guys circled all the acquit equipment mentioned why don't we look again at all the words you circled and I want you to circle double circle all the words that involve equipment and finding water mentioned.
1,Teacher,400,Can you find the sentence that Jazmin just talked about when it talks specifically about the Lunar Orbiter and please underline it or highlight it in your tablet that goes for all of you.
1,Teacher,400,"If you're not sure what to do, you can always go back in the text to where you found that piece of information and see if maybe they use a specific name."
1,Teacher,400,"Now you can use the words you circled, like ""equipment"", and go back to the middle of the passage and see what specific equipment is listed there. Okay?"
1,Teacher,400,"Okay, so I want you right now to reread the text or the article. And I want you to circle any word that you might think is equipment. Is that clear?"
1,Teacher,400,"So sometimes when we're answering a question, even if we think that there's only one part, we just need to be sure that we're reading through the text fully to make sure we don't miss any bit. So why don't we try to combine those two answers."
1,Teacher,400,Let's revisit our text and figure out what specific equipment or scientific tool the scientists use in order to complete this mission.
1,Teacher,400,"Yeah, we're talking about the scientists right so it's great to make connections with our past experiences, but also pay attention to what the question is asking, and the context of the text."
1,Teacher,400,But what I want you to do is go back to the text and look for a different machine that will allow the scientists to discover water on the moon.
1,Teacher,400,What I want you to do now is go back to the text and look for a specific piece of equipment that the scientist used to discover this water on the moon.
1,Teacher,400,"Discovering water on the moon and the machine that they use to discover it because if you go back and you read that part, you'll actually find that there's a different machine that they use. So I want you to go back and try and find that machine."
1,Teacher,400,"So, that's awesome. But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text reread it and look for equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon. Okay."
1,Teacher,400,"And then what we're going to do is we're going to read through what we read before, but this time we're going to do some close reading. And we're going to make some annotations on our work."
1,Teacher,400,"So today, what would I want you to is underline where your partner found their answer and something that you think you could add to their answer to make it a more complete answer."
1,Teacher,400,"Yeah, so go ahead and keep reading and see if you can find what details are in the reading that might answer this question."
1,Teacher,400,"Now that you've been able to add to your answer, I'm going to suggest that you look again at where you found your first answer."
1,Teacher,400,"For you Farrah, what I want you to do is try looking at paragraph two, and see what they're talking about when they're talking about the cup and maybe why they mentioned that."
1,Teacher,400,So I think it would also be helpful for you to go back into the text and look and see if you can find any more details about that small machine that they named in our text.
1,Teacher,400,Why don't you take a quick minute and think about that. You can go back in the text. And let's see if we see anything that says that oxygen tanks were an equipment used to discover the water.
1,Teacher,400,"When we read an article, I want to make sure that you read through the whole thing and try to pull out pieces from the article for that discussion question."
1,Teacher,400,"Student, you successfully identified a type of equipment from the passage, but your answer does not match one of the key words in the question which is 'discover.' By looking for words in the text similar to discover, such as 'investigate,' you could find a better answer that suits the whole question instead of just part of it."
1,Teacher,400,"I am concerned that the question is asking - �What equipment� -so, I would expect to hear the name of the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon in your response. I would recommend rereading the text looking for the specific name of the equipment used to discover or find the water. Can you tell me what you heard was my concern with your current response and suggestion for your next step?"
1,Teacher,400,"You were on the right track with the word equipment and looking for keywords that related, but we need to make sure that it it fully answers the question. So another suggestion is, once you have found the keywords, reread the question to see if these keywords answer the question. "
1,Teacher,400,Your answer isn't addressing what equipment the scientists used to discover water. So first let's maybe dissect the question a bit to really understand the question.
1,Teacher,400,"So you didn't quite answer the question there. You did say a fair point. But the question really was, what type of equipment did they use to see the water. What type of machines did they use. So if you take a look back in paragraph two and three to tell you what they use."
1,Teacher,400,The question asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Right. And you've told me where on the moon the water was discovered. Use more evidence from the text about the equipment to make your response stronger.
1,Teacher,400,"Yes, there are a lot of advantages, but except for equipment. Please read the question again. Do you have other key words like the action words in a sentence?"
1,Teacher,400,"All right, it's not that your answer is wrong, particularly. It's not what the question is asking, right, it's asking what equipment specifically. So let's try to use the text and see what the name of that tool is."
1,Teacher,400,"We were looking for the machine that they used really to get after to analyze the soil in the first place, so can you look back at the text to identify this machine, and then answer what that piece of equipment was?"
1,Teacher,400,"What was the equipment that they use to find the water? So this answers the question the fact where they found the water, not what they use to find the water, so I just suggest kind of going back into the text, and looking at what equipment was used to find the water."
1,Teacher,400,"The question was actually what equipment were the scientists using, so I think next time STUDENT what you can do you can actually circle the question statements."
1,Teacher,400,"My concern is that you didn't read the question correctly, because the question is that I want you to identify the object we're looking for, and I want you to do so by circling equipment."
1,Teacher,400,Exactly similar to Jazmin you've told us why it's really helpful we just want to add a little bit about why it's helpful to have it on the moon.
1,Teacher,500,"Can somebody tell me, and I want to see your hands raised, what does it mean to find evidence?"
1,Teacher,500,"When we're talking about evidence, we're thinking about what words do I see in this text or reading that help me answer this question."
1,Teacher,500,"We might look for cue words or leading words, like called, like you notice how called is before that, so that's a great example of a word that we might that we might use."
1,Teacher,500,"Alright, STUDENT, can you explain to me what evidence is?"
1,Teacher,500,"When we're looking for evidence, we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help us."
1,Teacher,500,You want to look in the story for where you can find these answers.
1,Teacher,500,"The next time you're reading a tough question, it can help you to look for the action words in the question because that's going to help you know specifically what you're looking for."
1,Teacher,500,"When you read something, it's a three step process when you're trying to answer a question."
1,Teacher,500,"Then you go look at your question and you look at what it's really asking you, and then you read it again."
1,Teacher,500,"If you want to be good at something, you keep doing it over and over and over."
1,Teacher,500,Remember when we looked at our question? We found a keyword.
1,Teacher,500,Keyword to help us and to answer the question.
1,Teacher,500,She used the passage that we provided to find her answer. She didn't just use her background knowledge. She made sure to go back and find something in the text.
1,Teacher,500,You highlight important words in your question. So you can go back and you can try to find that in the passage.
1,Teacher,500,So you see how if you did remember that it was a small machine and I like how you went back and reread your text to figure out what that machine was actually called.
1,Teacher,500,"Sometimes we can read things, but not quite absorb everything. So it's always a good idea to go back and reread your text, underline important information and details that can help you answer questions about it afterwards, and keep that knowledge with you."
1,Teacher,500,Now one of the strategies that we were going to use today is to look at some key words that we have in our question.
1,Teacher,500,"For restating a question you listen carefully for the words being used, such as in our question."
1,Teacher,500,To answer the question using the race method you restate the question.
1,Teacher,500,We look really closely at those key words in our question.
1,Teacher,500,"Remember when we are reading our question we have to look really closely at those key words, those words that we need to look for in our text."
1,Teacher,500,Remember when we are looking at our question we always have to look for those important words.
1,Teacher,500,Then we have to look in our text for the same words so that we can try to find our answer.
1,Teacher,500,Often when we read it will tell us a sequence. It will tell us what happened first and then what happens next. So it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story.
1,Teacher,500,"We don't want to just say we agree. It's good to agree with people, but it's also good to know why we we think something."
1,Teacher,500,"When we're given questions we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are, the more sense that they make later on."
1,Teacher,500,I think we've all kind of learned a lesson when we're reading the information we have to pay attention to it and not just assume.
1,Teacher,500,"Does that make sense? We know we all know, different things about space, but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being given."
1,Teacher,500,We looked very closely at our text. We looked for those key words.
1,Teacher,500,"But what we need to do is definitely go through your passage and then highlight important details. You always want to highlight your headings, or your sub headings."
1,Teacher,500,"Because those are a lot of key details in there that could give you some really good text evidence. So that's what you need to do, you want to find details that go along with your question and could possibly support your answer."
1,Teacher,500,Maybe like a chronological timeline of events in a text. So if you broke down the text and circled like what happened first and then what happened. And then what happened. You might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question.
1,Teacher,500,"You built off your answer. I appreciate how you build your answer. We got more specific. We narrowed down to that core of knowledge, we're looking for. And then we said, Okay, this is, this is what that machine was. And this is what it was doing."
1,Teacher,500,"Okay, again, so. And much like with STUDENT earlier, we're just, we're trying to look at that question. And we're specifically boiling it down to just its core components."
1,Teacher,500,"Sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together. And it's called summarizing, so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer."
1,Teacher,500,"So I really like to do is the race format. So we're going to restate the question, we're going to answer the question, we're going to cite evidence, and then we're going to explain that evidence."
1,Teacher,500,"So for example, when I read, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. I try to think to myself, I try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking."
1,Teacher,500,"So for example, I might say, the equipment that the scientist used to discover on the moon would be and then leave that answer blank. And then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment."
1,Teacher,500,But I think next time we need to use the strategy of looking at keywords and be really specific.
1,Teacher,500,"So, that is why it's very important to highlight those keywords. So you can give the best answer."
1,Teacher,500,"See, sometimes it's okay to go back and reread to find the answer."
1,Teacher,500,"Yes, that is exactly what I would like. And that goes for everyone, not just STUDENT. So when you're answering these questions, try to use what you already know, as well as specific information from what we're reading."
1,Teacher,500,"Great job, that's a good strategy finding those key clues and keywords to help you find your answer."
1,Teacher,500,"You told me before that what you did was you read, you noticed that the word water was in the question, so you scanned through and you looked for things that related with water."
1,Teacher,500,"Great. So I really liked that response because you explained yourself really well. You said that you read the question, you saw what the question was asking for, and then you found it and explained why. So that was a really great response."
1,Teacher,500,"Definitely use your imagination, I really like how you visualize the situation before giving your answer. That's a really good strategy to answering questions."
1,Teacher,500,"Yes, that was a perfect response you used direct language from the text, used specific vocab, and you provided reasoning. It was very specific. That was a perfect response. Good job."
1,Teacher,500,"So to find evidence. We need to use those quotes from the text and I like that. STUDENT quoted. And she said, paragraph three, so we could all look at our texts and find where she was reading."
1,Teacher,500,"I like that you're connecting your background knowledge to help you. It's great that you're using your notes to help you further understand this text, that's an excellent strategy that good readers use."
1,Teacher,500,Then you provided reasoning which is you can't survive without water. It's very important to backup your answers with reasoning.
1,Teacher,500,I'm hearing that you read the text for details and evidence to help support your thinking.
1,Teacher,500,You're connecting the details to another part of the text to explain how it could be valuable.
1,Teacher,500,"STUDENT, you are using your background knowledge of a definition of orbiter to be able to apply your answer."
1,Teacher,500,So you think about the thinking and thinking strategy that you use when you are reading a text and answering a question.
1,Teacher,500,"So, why did you change your answer to what STUDENT also wrote? What were you thinking?"
1,Teacher,500,She's going back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used to discover water on the moon.
1,Teacher,500,"So this is a really good thing that you were just able to do so when you were rereading, you're able to see where you found your answer. And you were able to find another part that you could add to it."
1,Teacher,500,"That's an excellent strategy, to be looking at the text and pulling out those keywords."
1,Teacher,500,And I think that that's an excellent strategy for anyone to think about when we're reading a text is to think.
1,Teacher,500,When you're trying to answer this question just to try to locate these key words in the paragraph.
1,Teacher,500,"When we read, we want to make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text."
1,Teacher,500,"So that's great that's a great segue. So what I wanted to ask you guys, next because you just gave specific evidence of what the question said. And you analyze that and picked an answer, based off that specifically. So that's a great process."
1,Teacher,500,So when we're not drawing on our prior knowledge these things can be complex and reviewing them a couple times is important.
1,Teacher,500,"It's important for you to look back at the passage to try and determine what the best answer to the question is, it's always helpful to circle key words in the question."
1,Teacher,500,"I mean you're 100% right and using that background knowledge, but when we answer questions, especially questions about a text, we always want to make sure that our answers on have evidence that are found directly from the text."
1,Teacher,500,"What i'm going to suggest to all of you, is when you start, the first thing you do before you start reading is to actually look closely at the question."
1,Teacher,500,So I guess the other strategy that you're going to want to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking and then you're trying to make some connections between the concepts that you're reading.
1,Teacher,500,"That can help you make some inferences. you want to read a little bit more closely, for the meaning of the the material before it."
1,Teacher,500,"Yeah, so this is a really important skill for scientists. We need to be able to look at a text and use quotes or information from the text to support our answers."
1,Teacher,500,Okay so looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a great strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely.
1,Teacher,500,"So we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies, the next time we come across a question like this."
1,Teacher,500,I love that you are looking for keywords that's a really strong reading technique.
1,Teacher,500,I think that a little bit of specificity and putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times.
1,Teacher,500,"I sort of noticed that, through talking with STUDENT, I mean, that you also added some specificity to your answer, do you think that helped you get a more full response?"
1,Teacher,500,"I think that's totally a great strategy for you, I think, if you see the question provide your answer just look over your answer one more time and then make sure it answers matches the question and you'll be good to go."
1,Teacher,500,"Fantastic, so I really appreciate something STUDENT just did, he took little parts of the world to lunar orbit to draw a conclusion from that so we're really looking for small details here."
1,Teacher,500,"The question when we're looking for an answer it's important to think about those keywords and it can also be helpful to create our sentence, but I wouldn't say that it necessarily has to be in your response."
1,Teacher,500,"I think it's nice, though, when we read a text, if we can scan the text for specific pieces of equipment, then that way when we write our answers out if I ever asked you can you tell me what paragraph you found that in, you'd be able to point to that exact part of the text."
1,Teacher,500,"So I think STUDENT you did just that, when you just re read that beginning of paragraph two."
1,Teacher,500,"Yeah, exactly. You could specify the small machine and that's a strategy you can use in response questions."
1,Teacher,500,"Well, in this case, adding a name would be sufficient, but I i'm talking more about a strategy of specifying your responses, instead of just like adding a name into it."
1,Teacher,500,"But your strategy is absolutely right, you locate the keywords in the question and you find them in the text."
1,Teacher,500," well, I'm looking at it and I think it says, like okay, NASA sent this whole machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar creator. These ice deposits are very small."
1,Teacher,500," yeah. So,unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we went to lunch. I just wanted to thank you for working with us. Like sometimes"
1,Teacher,500," well, you asked us to look closely for the equipment. Right. And like look at what was using to discover the thing"
1,Teacher,500,Do you feel like you could try this strategy next time you encounter a tricky question like this?
1,Teacher,500,"Next time you have a similar question, what would you do first?"
1,Teacher,500,If you are not sure what the question is asking or if you want to check your understanding of the question - then what can you do?
1,Teacher,500,To make sure that you understand a text - what can you do?
1,Teacher,500,"So, next time you have to answer a question that requires information from the text, please remember to make sure you understand the question first before you start trying to find an answer."
1,Teacher,500,"Thank you. Okay, so Jazmin do you feel like you've changed your your process for working through text and questions?"
1,Teacher,500,"Whatever you think it's okay, if your response hasn't changed. It's okay if it has changed. I'm just curious what you all are thinking. So take a moment, before our conversation I thought this and after our conversation I thought this."
1,Teacher,500,I think what we all need to take away is that when we're answering reading comprehension questions we really need to focus on going back and reading the article in detail and maybe highlighting the text or annotating the text so that we can really understand in detail what we're learning and why we're learning it.
1,Teacher,500,"Okay, so from reading the text today and using our tools by going back and rereading the text and circling important information, how can this broaden your understanding in the future of any topic that we discuss whether it's space or farming?"
1,Teacher,500,How can you use your knowledge of restating the question in our next lesson?
1,Teacher,500,"So when we're answering questions like this again, what's something that we need to make sure we do when we're answering the question?"
1,Teacher,500,"So next time you have a question, you can underline your keywords to help you be more specific."
1,Teacher,500,"So now that you've figured out the full answer, what will you do next time when you're looking back in the text?"
1,Teacher,500,"So next time you are answering a question like this, how do you think you can make your answer better?"
1,Teacher,500,"And how you will apply what you learned in your next task? So I'm gonna give you guys a couple minutes to think about it, and then we will go around in the circle answering."
1,Teacher,500,"So we can start with Farrah and just to repeat, I want you to state how you started out thinking, how the strategy you used changed based on the feedback I gave, and what you will do next time to make sure you are fully answering the question."
1,Teacher,500,"We're just going to go around. Jazmin, what do you think first? You're going to say what strategy you used, and how you will build on to it for your next assignment or task."
1,Teacher,500,"And last but not least, Farrah. What about you? What do you think? What strategy did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future?"
1,Teacher,500,"Right so next time you get a question on a text, are you going to use your background knowledge and not read the text at all or are you going to read the text and then use your background knowledge?"
1,Teacher,500,"Right, so what are a few things we can do next time when you're not quite sure if your answers are all the way there yet?"
1,Teacher,500,"Right, so you went back and read. So what do you want to do next time a teacher asks you for a little bit more information?"
1,Teacher,500,I'm wondering what you'll do next time you get a question like this to arrive at an answer like this? What's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this?
1,Teacher,500,And I'm hearing that you have an idea of how you can repeat this answer in the future. I think it might be great if you write down this process in a notebook.
1,Teacher,500,"That's right. That's excellent. So now when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions, you can use student's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use all of the evidence from the text."
1,Teacher,500,"Okay, so next time that you see a question like this that's asking about a text, what are you going to do?"
1,Teacher,500,"Next time you see this kind of question, please be as specific as you can to answer the question, okay?"
1,Teacher,500,"So every single time that we're using information from a text in order to answer a discussion question, we want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text, even though we might know a lot about the subject reading already."
1,Teacher,500,"Or even thinking beyond today, what are some tools that we can use for future texts like these?"
1,Teacher,500,"Yes, so when we're thinking about answering questions like these later in the future, I think that what you said about details is very important."
1,Teacher,500,So what do you think you would do next time you get a question like this?
1,Teacher,500,What do you think will stick with you for the next time you're answering a similar question?
1,Teacher,500,"How, what did you learn right? What did you take away from this process of making inferences and making connections? What did you learn about that you might be able to apply the next time you encounter a question like this?"
1,Teacher,500,"So next time you see a question asking about a text, what will you do?"
1,Teacher,500,"so I suggest that the next time you have a question like this, you read through the text and look for those key specific words that might help you have a more rounded out answer."
1,Teacher,500,"Now that we figured out the full answer, what could you do next time so that you don't have to do so much revising?"
1,Teacher,500,"Okay, what could you do next time you get a question like this?"
1,Teacher,500,What do you think you could do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking?
1,Teacher,500,"Hi! Welcome back from lunch. So we'll just pick up from where we left it. Jazmin, as we talked about earlier in the day, maybe in the future you can use specifying techniques in your responses."
1,Teacher,500,"So the next time when you're answering these kinds of questions, be sure to look for your information, or your answer, in the text."
1,Teacher,500,What do you know now that you did not know when we started talking together?
1,Teacher,500,"Ethan, what's something new that you've learned today about how to answer a text-based question like this one?"
1,Teacher,500,How could you sum-up three actions that you took to improve your response?
1,Teacher,500,What are the qualities of a high quality response to a question that is specifically asking about information that is in a text?
1,Teacher,500,Does anyone else want to share maybe they're thinking on what they thought that was the right answer...But now what they know is the right answer?
1,Teacher,500,"Great job everyone, so how has your thinking changed?"
1,Teacher,500,I want you to write in your reflection journal how has your thinking changed from when we started this activity.
1,Teacher,500,"Alright, so can somebody tell me how maybe they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation."
1,Teacher,500,Exactly. Luis So how's your thinking changed since the very beginning.
1,Teacher,500,So how can we approach that question a little differently now that you've looked at it?
1,Teacher,500,About our keyword discover and you were thinking about how that was changing your thinking. Can you go back to that?
1,Teacher,500,How is that keyword discover changing what you were originally thinking?
1,Teacher,500,And how did you find that instead of small machine it was the Lunar Orbiter. What did you do to make that change?
1,Teacher,500,"Okay, so who can tell me what they did to correct their answer? So how did you go about correcting your answer?"
1,Teacher,500,"So now that we have talked about this, how has this changed your thinking?"
2,Teacher,500,"How did your thinking change there, what did you do differently?"
2,Teacher,500,"OK, so now that I have given you guys some feedback, I want you to think about how you started out thinking. Then, how that changed."
2,Teacher,500,So why did you need to add more to your answer for to describe with lunar orbiter did?
2,Teacher,500,So can you tell me how your answer changed from the beginning?
2,Teacher,500,"So what would you with our discussion today, what would you say your answer would be, and how would it change?"
2,Teacher,500,Do you see any ways that your mind is kind of changing? Are you thinking differently now that you're hearing from your other friends and your group?
2,Teacher,500,"Alright, so for example, you can start by saying, ""I started out thinking"" and then you would say your prior response. Then you can say ""and now I think this way because"" and you can explain how your thinking has changed. "
2,Teacher,500,So we're gonna take a minute to turn around to your partner next to you and you're going to talk about what are your takeaway from the revision process.
2,Teacher,500,"So you can say something like, I started out thinking that we needed a microscope microscope was my answer for the question right now. I think it's the lunar orbiter because blank."
2,Teacher,500,Does anyone else want to share maybe they're thinking on what they thought that was the right answer? But now what they know is the right answer?
2,Teacher,500,Great. Does anyone else want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed?
2,Teacher,500,Does anyone else want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading?
2,Teacher,500,"Okay so when you're thinking about your original answer and your new answer, what do you think the difference is between those answers?"
2,Teacher,500,"Yes, so that use the Lunar orbiter so Luis what on what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer that you have?"
2,Teacher,500,i'm wondering how do you feel like that compares to your first answer? what was different about those two?
2,Teacher,500,"Okay, so what was different about that answer versus your first response?"
2,Teacher,500,Farrah. what about you? how did your answer change when you were able to revise it?
2,Teacher,500,mm hmm so let's just think about as a team. like What did we do together? what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called? Oliver.
2,Teacher,500,"So, as we proceed with this discussion, I would want you to observe how you're thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay."
2,Teacher,500,OK so Luis do you want to share your new thinking? What has changed in your thinking?
2,Teacher,500,Great so Luis now that you're participating already. Would you mind telling me what you're thinking was when you went back to try to revise your response?
2,Teacher,500,Is there anything else? Did anyone do anything different when they were revising their answer?
2,Teacher,500,"First you're going to answer ""I started out thinking blank"" then you're going to answer, ""and now I think blank because blank"". Go ahead and take 30 seconds to answer those questions."
2,Teacher,500,What made you change your thinking on that?
2,Teacher,500,"And then, after you're finished i'm curious if you could share, about how you're thinking has changed from your original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote?"
2,Teacher,500,What was different about your first answer and your second you said?
2,Teacher,500,So how can I ask you a question? How did you get from your first answer to your second answer? How did your thinking change?
2,Teacher,500,What was what was different and how other than just writing more?
2,Teacher,500,What do you think your thought process was in shifting your answer?
2,Teacher,500,"Thank you. Okay, so Jazmin do you feel like you've changed your your process for working through text and questions?"
2,Teacher,500,"Before our conversation I thought that the answer was This or I didn't know the answer, or I was still confused, or just before our conversation, this is what I thought, and then, after the conversation that we just had now, I think."
2,Teacher,500,"Whatever you think it's okay, if your response hasn't changed. It's okay if it has changed. I'm just curious what you all are thinking. So take a moment, before our conversation I thought this and after our conversation I thought this."
