150.1,Chris,,"Oh, so it has to be from the story"
150.1,Chris,,So I have to find the equipment in the story
150.1,Chris,,"I mean, I know stuff about speaks to like Luis I went to NASA"
150.1,Chris,," So I know that our scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks in suits, but I just don't know which equipment they use to, to, to find the water or, I guess, discover water on the moon"
150.1,Chris,,"Um, so I said that scientists found craters full of water"
150.1,Chris,,Okay
150.1,Chris,,"Yeah, I think that's a little clearer"
150.1,Chris,, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
150.1,Chris,,I went to NASA
150.1,Chris,,"Okay, I guess it's not a question"
150.1,Chris,, They don't have to carry it on the ships anymore
150.1,Chris,,"Um, yeah"
150.1,Chris,, So it's good
150.1,Chris,, So I said that water is heavy
150.1,Chris,,Okay
150.1,Chris,," Well, I went to NASA"
150.1,Chris,, And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
150.1,Chris,,Okay
150.1,Chris,,So I was saying basically that there were craters like full of water on all this water
150.1,Chris,, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
150.1,Chris,, Okay
150.1,Chris,," Teacher, I went to NASA"
150.1,Chris,,Better
150.1,Chris,, Okay
150.1,Chris,,I want to NASA
150.1,Chris,, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to
150.1,Chris,," I do remember, um, I thought that there was like a bunch of water in the craters"
150.1,Chris,," Um, but I did have a quick question"
150.1,Chris,,"No, I do"
150.1,Chris,,"Yeah, like why that's not like the answer"
150.1,Chris,,"Oh yeah it's Chris, I don't really have a question about the microscope, but I have another question"
150.1,Chris,," Um, should I save it?"
150.1,Chris,,"Yeah, it does"
150.1,Chris,," I know a lot about equipment, but I didn't see that part"
150.1,Chris,,I went to NASA
150.1,Chris,, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks in suits to
150.1,Chris,,yeah yeah yeah yeah I think
150.1,Chris,,"It's not so much confused, but I went to NASA"
150.1,Chris,, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
150.1,Chris,,"Yeah, so I went to NASA"
150.1,Chris,, So I know that it is used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
150.1,Chris,,harvard
150.1,Chris,,edu: I think it was what you had said before about wanting us to to just add more add more
150.1,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Chris,,"Yeah, because a machine is equipment"
150.1,Chris,," So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots, um, lots and lots of different equipment"
150.1,Chris,,"Oh, I, I went to NASA"
150.1,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Chris,,harvard
150.1,Chris,,"edu: Well, I need a two on underline just equipment right"
150.1,Chris,,Um so it is correct that they found craters full of water on the moon
150.1,Chris,,"Oh so it's like a like maybe they weren't astronauts up there, like Maybe it was a like a NASA they call it an unmanned pro"
150.1,Chris,," Okay, I'm gonna read it and see"
150.1,Chris,,Okay
150.1,Chris,,Ok so I found a small machine
150.1,Chris,,"Um, saying more about why it would be valuable"
150.1,Chris,,yeah that makes a lot
150.1,Chris,,"So I kind of was just well Okay, so I was thinking about that I went to NASA so I, like you were saying, I know that scientists use a lot of equipment"
150.1,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Chris,,edu: I worked at NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
150.1,Chris,,harvard
150.1,Chris,,"Well, I guess the thing that I was thinking was kind of what Luis was saying before, I still have a question about it because I went to NASA with my dad"
150.1,Chris,,"yeah yeah it did okay I bought my answer, I did all pull some information from the text"
150.1,Chris,,"Okay, this one isn't a question, but now i'm just all thinking about my answer"
150.1,Chris,, OK
150.1,Chris,, Yeah
150.1,Chris,,OK
150.1,Chris,,OK
150.1,Chris,, I think I got it
150.1,Chris,," Because I went to NASA with my dad, so I do know about the Mars Rover and other things, too"
150.1,Chris,,"Yeah, yeah"
150.1,Chris,,"It's not so much a question, but remember how I was telling you about how I went to NASA with my dad? So yeah, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, too"
150.1,Chris,,"Okay, yeah, I'll look for all look for some new stuff"
150.1,Chris,,"Well, I'm sure because because I went to NASA"
150.1,Chris,, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
150.1,Chris,,"Yeah, I can"
150.1,Chris,, The phone craters are full of water on the moon
150.1,Chris,,"Well, it was about how they found water"
150.1,Chris,,I think we're ready
150.1,Chris,,"Okay, yeah"
150.1,Chris,, So I know that scientists do use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and masks and suits
150.1,Chris,,"Yeah, so actually I went to NASA"
150.1,Chris,,"Yeah, so I guess I was picturing like all this water but really it was just like, like a little, little ice deposits"
150.1,Chris,,"He looked at Luis's answer, and he was talking about the oxygen tanks and stuff, but it sounds like that's not really the right answer"
150.1,Chris,,"Okay, okay"
150.1,Chris,,"Okay, so in the second paragraph, I saw that on them the equipment that Jazmin just said, the Lunar orbiter"
150.1,Chris,,"I think, so let me look back at"
150.1,Chris,,Here this is Chris
150.1,Chris,," I thought it was really cool that scientists, they found craters full of water on the moon"
150.1,Chris,,edu: yeah yeah I guess
150.1,Chris,,harvard
150.1,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Chris,,yeah yeah That would be good
150.1,Chris,,"Okay i've said that scientists found craters, full of water on the moon"
150.1,Chris,,Ah um yeah I can see that
150.1,Chris,,Agile Teacher Lab: Oh yeah well I sort of like Farrah it really blew my mind that there was all this water on the moon like these craters full of water oh it's so cool to picture and I really want to go and see it one day
150.1,Chris,,yeah I I thought it was so amazing how how the scientists they found craters full of water on the moon
150.1,Chris,,"I can, I can I"
150.1,Chris,,yeah yeah yeah that's sounds exciting oh yeah i'll add that right now
150.1,Chris,,So can I add something too about equipment?
150.1,Chris,,"it's not that question, but I was just thinking about some of the other equipment on the moon, and so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
150.1,Chris,,yeah yeah yeah to kind of think more
150.1,Chris,,Okay okay
150.1,Chris,,"Well, craters craters are really big"
150.1,Chris,,yeah
150.1,Chris,, yeah so basically
140.1,Chris,, It was the coolest ever
140.1,Chris,,"Yeah, oh yeah, me and my dad we when we saw like all of these different space shuttles and all of these like different astronauts suits"
140.1,Chris,,"Yes, yes"
140.1,Chris,," My dad, me and my dad went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment, like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to--"
140.1,Chris,, The atmosphere on the space shuttle and on the moon isn't the same as the atmosphere here
140.1,Chris,,Because they can't breathe
140.1,Chris,," Yes, we've got lots of phones"
140.1,Chris,,"Oh wow, yes"
140.1,Chris,,"Oh, man"
140.1,Chris,," No, no"
140.1,Chris,," When me and my dad went to NASA, we saw about that the whole controversy about when Pluto was a planet, and then it wasn't a planet, and then it was a planet, but I didn't know anything about Saturn"
140.1,Chris,,"Okay, okay, I think"
140.1,Chris,,RER: You're a really good teacher
140.1,Chris,, Kennedy center
140.1,Chris,,The John F
140.1,Chris,," We got to see a lot of space shuttles, and astronaut, space chutes, and all of the different ways that they can breathe upon in space"
140.1,Chris,,It was a lot of fun
140.1,Chris,, Well that's a good question
140.1,Chris,, Oh
140.1,Chris,," But I was gonna say first, just real quick because I went to NASA"
140.1,Chris,,Oh
140.1,Chris,,"Um, so, I saw a microscope, like in science class"
140.1,Chris,," Um like, I've seen it in a couple places, but I think we've all seen it in science class"
140.1,Chris,," And also we've like, you know, we've seen it in movies and stuff like that"
140.1,Chris,,"Yeah, it's really cool there"
140.1,Chris,, I had a great time with my dad
140.1,Chris,,I'm not really like that wasn't really what was in the exhibit that was that was from like reading
140.1,Chris,, I didn't know that before today
140.1,Chris,,"Oh, some some article in a magazine"
140.1,Chris,,We wouldn't run out of gas
140.1,Chris,,"Oh yeah, So they use on a breathe because, while the oxygen tanks are to breathe because there isn't any oxygen up there in space and then the suits because it's so cool that if if the air touch their skins, they would they would freeze to death and then shattered pieces"
140.1,Chris,,"me and my dad had been reading this book about aviation and then we went to NASA so there was this whole exhibit about the traveling to the moon, and then what their plans are in the future"
140.1,Chris,,I do know that I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
140.1,Chris,, So I saw that they use like these are core to keep them like attached to the ship
140.1,Chris,,"Oh yeah, absolutely"
140.1,Chris,," If they had to do, like, you know what I mean, like a spot"
140.1,Chris,,"Yeah, with my dad"
140.1,Chris,, I went to NASA
140.1,Chris,, So I do know that scientists use a lot of equipment like
140.1,Chris,,So they're full of water at the bottom?
140.1,Chris,,yeah yeah
140.1,Chris,, Yeah
140.1,Chris,,That would be pretty cool
140.1,Chris,,"Oh well, I actually went to NASA and well I didn't know there was water on the moon, but I thought it was really cool"
140.1,Chris,,yeah yeah
140.1,Chris,,"yeah Oh, it was so cool I would love to put on that space suit and grab my microscope and look at the little pieces of water on the moon"
140.1,Chris,,"yeah well, I have a question sort of about the story so were there actually any astronauts on the moon looking for the water?"
140.1,Chris,,"it's amazing, you can see, all of these different space shuttles that have gone to into space for like the past 30 and 40 years"
140.1,Chris,,"Oh, well I thought it was just amazing how the scientists found craters full of water on the moon"
140.1,Chris,,Well
140.1,Chris,,"Well, or if there's water on the moon"
140.1,Chris,,yeah yes three years away
140.1,Chris,,We got to see a lot of things like we got to see the whole space suit and I really wanted to try it on but
140.1,Chris,,It looks pretty disgusting really
140.1,Chris,,"Oh yeah my dad took so many pictures, it was actually kind of embarrassing"
140.1,Chris,,I think they said the really dark
140.1,Chris,,it's so cool
130.3,Chris,, So I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too
130.3,Chris,,I went to NASA
130.3,Chris,,"Okay, gotcha"
130.3,Chris,,So how did they find the water
130.3,Chris,," Luis Like, that's the thing to remember, like they didn't do that"
130.3,Chris,,Okay
130.3,Chris,," Is that right,"
130.3,Chris,, Yeah
130.3,Chris,," Okay, so they weren't actually there"
130.3,Chris,, So they didn't need to use masks and suits and stuff like that
130.3,Chris,, Teacher?
130.3,Chris,,Mr
130.3,Chris,,Okay
130.3,Chris,,Okay
130.3,Chris,, Yeah
130.3,Chris,,Yeah
130.3,Chris,,Gotcha
130.3,Chris,," Okay, so, so was like, like they may be need that stuff, but they didn't like use it necessarily this time"
130.3,Chris,,harvard
130.3,Chris,,edu: I don't think the astronauts are bringing stuffed animals they're like grown ups and scientists and stuff
130.3,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.3,Chris,,And I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like
130.3,Chris,, So they didn't need that stuff
130.3,Chris,,"Oh, I was just wondering because I've been to NASA with my dad, and we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff"
130.3,Chris,, So I also know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too
130.3,Chris,,I just wanted to say that I went to NASA
130.3,Chris,,"Yeah, OK"
130.3,Chris,,"Right yeah because you said, well, that the craters you said they're not full of water, like, I thought right because the water is so small"
130.3,Chris,,okay
130.3,Chris,,Well they need them to breathe on the moon
130.3,Chris,,Oh
130.3,Chris,,yeah that wasn't the story
130.3,Chris,,Oh
130.2,Chris,," Um, but then I remembered that you told Farrah that finding isn't the same thing as discovering so now I'm not really sure, you know"
130.2,Chris,,"Okay, so I saw in the first paragraph, where they're talking about the water and the water was found deep within the moon's polar craters"
130.2,Chris,,I picked out equipment and discover too
130.2,Chris,,"Yeah, for, for me, that's why I was I was confused because I was looking for water in the story"
130.2,Chris,," And so I didn't see the pardon about paragraph two, about the ice cuz I was looking for the word water"
130.2,Chris,, I think that Oliver's guess is pretty good
130.2,Chris,,"Um, so I guess like I kind of know a lot about NASA and I know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and like you know like masks and suits and stuff so I don't know"
130.2,Chris,," Like you could look and say, like the microscopes on like like what if you attached it to the hand of the spacesuit?"
130.2,Chris,,Okay
130.2,Chris,, And I know that scientists have to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to go into space
130.2,Chris,,"Um, yeah, I think it could be, um, I just feel like also like for me"
130.2,Chris,," Like, I went to NASA"
130.2,Chris,,"Okay, it's me, Chris, I talked about the water to I said I'm water is heavy"
130.2,Chris,, So it's good
130.2,Chris,, They don't have to carry it in the ships anymore
130.2,Chris,, What was I gonna say
130.2,Chris,," I was gonna say that, well, I guess what I found was that water can be broken down into two parts"
130.2,Chris,, So hydrogen and oxygen
130.2,Chris,,"Um, yeah, I guess I was thinking like, Well, let's see"
130.2,Chris,," So I guess I was going to say that, like, yeah, that's stuff that also is useful"
130.2,Chris,,"Oh, I'm kind of had a different idea"
130.2,Chris,, So I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like masks and oxygen tanks and suits
130.2,Chris,," I was just thinking like you, I went to NASA"
130.2,Chris,,Yeah okay so small machine um
130.2,Chris,,"Yeah, so I could do that"
130.2,Chris,, But I like first
130.2,Chris,," I just wanted to ask, like, um,"
130.2,Chris,,"I wasn't in my answer, but I went to NASA"
130.2,Chris,, And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks
130.2,Chris,,Um yeah I I thought water was the important word
130.2,Chris,,"The machine, the microscope?"
130.2,Chris,, And when we went to NASA
130.2,Chris,, I basically like my dad took me to NASA
130.2,Chris,," We went and saw like all of this, like, um like all of these like space suits and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff that like Luis was talking about"
130.2,Chris,,"Okay, so I'm like, here's the thing"
130.2,Chris,,"I wasn't really answering the question, so I ok so my answer now would be like that scientists are found craters full of water on the moon by using the lunar orbiter"
130.2,Chris,,"Okay, so, so I was talking about the meeting debrief and you said that to Luis And you're talking about them needing to drink on"
130.2,Chris,,"Yes, had to be from the craters, the craters for the water"
130.2,Chris,,"yeah, I guess, so I I think like I read that there could be a base on the moon by maybe 20 or that made me think that you know, like I don't know like It made me think that this is something that could make that possible"
130.2,Chris,,"In that paragraph two, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter"
130.2,Chris,,I'm not sure
130.2,Chris,,"On not not about this, no, I was gonna say that I was gonna say I asked my new answer is ok"
130.2,Chris,, But you said craters wasn't equipment
130.2,Chris,, I know that they said there's a lot of water deep in the moon's craters
130.2,Chris,, So I would think a lot of water
130.2,Chris,,I answered craters full of water
130.2,Chris,,"Yeah, so I went to NASA"
130.2,Chris,," And I saw that the scientists, they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all sorts of stuff like that"
130.2,Chris,, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
130.2,Chris,,"Well, I went to NASA"
130.2,Chris,, Maybe both
130.2,Chris,,"Well, maybe"
130.2,Chris,,"I think, oh,"
130.2,Chris,, And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
130.2,Chris,,"Yeah, I would have to say, I went to NASA"
130.2,Chris,,"Oh,"
130.2,Chris,,Yeah
130.2,Chris,,"Well, actually, I thought that it was water"
130.2,Chris,, What equipment to find water on the moon
130.2,Chris,,they didn't?
130.2,Chris,,"Well, I know I didn't have equipment in my answer, so I had to add that, um but for Farrah's answer I guess she is saying the equipments"
130.2,Chris,,Okay um I think I didn't even think about that second paragraph because of I was looking for water
130.2,Chris,,Oh yeah well so i'm in terms of equipment actually I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
130.2,Chris,,"Okay, can I try"
130.2,Chris,,"Agile Teacher Lab: um well i'm not sure I think my first answer is right, but um I know it doesn't say equipment, but I don't really know what the equipment is I just listened to Jazmin"
130.2,Chris,,"Oh well, the craters they're dark"
130.2,Chris,,Oh yeah oh those words mean pretty much the same thing
130.2,Chris,,Oh sure yeah I could do that
130.2,Chris,,uh huh
130.2,Chris,,"Oh, oh circle evidence in the text"
130.2,Chris,,yeah I do
130.2,Chris,,"Well, I was just going to add since we're talking about all the equipment that I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
130.2,Chris,,wow hmm maybe they need something to collect the water
130.2,Chris,,Oh well
130.2,Chris,,edu: I think so um let me see
130.2,Chris,,harvard
130.2,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.2,Chris,,"Well, so for my answer, I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, but it doesn't new equipment and my answer, but that's how I answered the question"
130.2,Chris,,My answer was
130.1,Chris,, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
130.1,Chris,,"You know, I went to NASA"
130.1,Chris,," Um, so yeah, it makes sense that they would need other equipment too"
130.1,Chris,," Well, no, I looked at the craters and they said how the craters had water"
130.1,Chris,,So basically what I looked at what's up
130.1,Chris,," Well, actually, I guess I didn't really circle"
130.1,Chris,,OK
130.1,Chris,,"Okay, that makes sense"
130.1,Chris,,"Okay, okay, um,"
130.1,Chris,, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks shoots
130.1,Chris,,I don't know
130.1,Chris,," You know, I went to NASA"
130.1,Chris,,"Well, they're they're yeah they're designed so you can you can breathe in space"
130.1,Chris,,um I
130.1,Chris,,"Okay, yeah, yeah"
130.1,Chris,,harvard
130.1,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.1,Chris,,edu: will be super microscope and Jazmin set the Lunar orbiter
130.1,Chris,,Ok ok so
130.1,Chris,,"Yeah, yeah, I remember reading, paragraph three, but I didn't think that um that that was it"
130.1,Chris,," Because, because they said that they were talking about finding the water and I had seen that there was like a lot of water in the craters"
130.1,Chris,,"Oh well, I just wanted to say, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
130.1,Chris,,yeah well sort of about that I went to NASA so I know that scientists date to really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
120.4,Chris,,"Oh man oh I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch. But I wanted to say thank you so much for coming in and bringing so much energy and helping us learn in such a fun way I didn't know that this was going to be so fun looking at this article, and I just wanted to say thank you for listening and explaining but also making it fun"
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, well, I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon"
120.4,Chris,,Um yeah i guess i well i went to NASA
120.4,Chris,, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like
120.4,Chris,, So I said that pre scientists found craters full of water on the moon
120.4,Chris,,"Yeah, okay"
120.4,Chris,,Yes that was me
120.4,Chris,,"Yeah, well, I know that all that"
120.4,Chris,, And so I know that our scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
120.4,Chris,, And I know that
120.4,Chris,," Well, I went to NASA with my dad"
120.4,Chris,,"Oh, I did as well"
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, so what I circled up"
120.4,Chris,," All right, what I was looking at was, I was thinking like that water can be broken down into two parts, and that was where was that, oh yeah, in paragraph by water can be broken down two parts hydrogen and oxygen"
120.4,Chris,,On y'all because I was just thinking that because I went to NASA
120.4,Chris,," And I just know that scientists use like lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots, and that wasn't in the reading"
120.4,Chris,,"Well, I think it was informative because I realized that there was all this water in all these craters on the moon like it sounds like there's overflowing water"
120.4,Chris,, So I was wondering if they use that for this too
120.4,Chris,, So one thing that I noticed is I been to NASA with my dad and I love space and I noticed that the astronauts use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that
120.4,Chris,, You know what I mean
120.4,Chris,,"Well, okay"
120.4,Chris,,"Well, I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, I also kind of like Luis I definitely feel like I knocked it out the park this time because"
120.4,Chris,," OK, so here we go"
120.4,Chris,,OK
120.4,Chris,, So it's good
120.4,Chris,, They don't have to
120.4,Chris,," Um, water is heavy"
120.4,Chris,," And so I i know that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and suit, and I guess I'm wondering, like why that wasn't right"
120.4,Chris,,I guess like I went to NASA
120.4,Chris,,I'm yeah i mean
120.4,Chris,,So I said that you could wait
120.4,Chris,," Okay, um, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen, which is a big deal"
120.4,Chris,,The Lunar Orbiter?
120.4,Chris,,"Well, okay, so I tried to focus on the equipment"
120.4,Chris,," But I know that they use, you know,"
120.4,Chris,,"Well yeah, I was gonna say, I went to NASA with my dad and I know that scientists lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and that's not in the reading"
120.4,Chris,,"Yeah, okay"
120.4,Chris,, And it says that
120.4,Chris,, So one thing is that water can be broken down into two parts into hydrogen and oxygen
120.4,Chris,,"Excuse me, Mr"
120.4,Chris,, I just thought about something from the story
120.4,Chris,, Teacher
120.4,Chris,,Water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
120.4,Chris,,"Well, so here's the thing, like I kind of thought that, like, um, well I've been to NASA with my dad and like we really"
120.4,Chris,, So I think like discover is like how you you find something or you kind of like um like you
120.4,Chris,,"Yeah, okay"
120.4,Chris,, You like find something
120.4,Chris,,Okay
120.4,Chris,," So I was just wondering, like, okay, so I went to NASA with my dad and we went and looked at, like all the spacesuits"
120.4,Chris,, And like all this stuff
120.4,Chris,, So I know that like scientists use up like equipment like masks and suits like stuff like even said so
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, I have been to NASA with my dad"
120.4,Chris,, I think the most important word is water
120.4,Chris,,"Yeah okay, I'm Chris"
120.4,Chris,,"Yeah, so I was just say, um, let's see, I think it was talking about like the before lunch"
120.4,Chris,," Well, so my answer was that the craters were full of water on the moon, and that that was like you know what I mean, like, they found all this water"
120.4,Chris,, I was talking about like craters
120.4,Chris,,"Um, yeah"
120.4,Chris,, They don't have to carry it in the ships
120.4,Chris,," So I would say, water is heavy"
120.4,Chris,, So it's good
120.4,Chris,,yeah I was just I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks
120.4,Chris,," So I said, or something different"
120.4,Chris,, I said umm
120.4,Chris,,Uh huh
120.4,Chris,, Okay
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, so I said that they found a lot of water in the craters"
120.4,Chris,,yeah I said that scientists found crators full of water on the moon
120.4,Chris,,"So I would change my answer what I would say, as I would say, like um, so I said initially scientists craters on the water"
120.4,Chris,,"um I think for me like what I noticed is like kind of similar to like I I bring a lot of my like background knowledge, because I know all about this stuff"
120.4,Chris,,Valuable means like has a lot of value?
120.4,Chris,,Here that on the phone craters full of water on the moon
120.4,Chris,,I went to NASA
120.4,Chris,,harvard
120.4,Chris,,edu: I went to NASA so
120.4,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Chris,,Well yeah I had a completely different answer than them
120.4,Chris,, I said let me look at what I wrote down
120.4,Chris,,yeah
120.4,Chris,," I mean, it's about science, though"
120.4,Chris,," But I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
120.4,Chris,, It's not about the story
120.4,Chris,,Yeah
120.4,Chris,,"Yeah, sure, I said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon"
120.4,Chris,,"Oh, that's a really, that's an interesting question"
120.4,Chris,," Um,"
120.4,Chris,," And so, I noticed that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks, but it sounds like you're telling us that the lunar orbiter went without any astronaut"
120.4,Chris,,"Um, well, I was gonna say that"
120.4,Chris,, So like with my dad
120.4,Chris,, I went to NASA
120.4,Chris,, Is that right
120.4,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Chris,,edu: I wrote scientist on craters full of water on the moon
120.4,Chris,,harvard
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, so what I said was initially that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, and then I realized that"
120.4,Chris,, So I said that scientists found craters that were just full of water
120.4,Chris,,"Um, yeah"
120.4,Chris,,Um
120.4,Chris,, Equipment?
120.4,Chris,,  That one was in my answer
120.4,Chris,,In the craters
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, well, I okay So what about mine, because I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter"
120.4,Chris,,It was something about how it was talking about water can be broken down into two parts
120.4,Chris,,"Well, I think the main point of part one is that it tells us that scientists actually found craters full of water on the moon"
120.4,Chris,,"Yeah, okay"
120.4,Chris,," So I said, water is heavy"
120.4,Chris,, So it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore
120.4,Chris,,"Okay yeah Well, my answer is scientists found careers, full of water on the moon"
120.4,Chris,, There wasn't any but now they know because they found it
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, so I think the main idea is that they have found water on the moon, and they used to think"
120.4,Chris,," So I said, water because my answer was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon, and the whole story is about water"
120.4,Chris,,On
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, yeah"
120.4,Chris,," So my answer to the question was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon"
120.4,Chris,,"Well, I said that the key word was water because my answer was about the craters full of water on the moon"
120.4,Chris,, I guess because there's the small machine on the
120.4,Chris,," So, well, we found the same to that Oliver and Farrah"
120.4,Chris,,"Oh, yeah, yeah"
120.4,Chris,, Okay
120.4,Chris,, Definitely
120.4,Chris,,RER: Can I go?
120.4,Chris,," Okay, so my new answer is the water, the scientists found on the moon was microscopic"
120.4,Chris,,"Oh, okay"
120.4,Chris,," Well, I want to know if my new answers"
120.4,Chris,,"Yeah, I went to NASA"
120.4,Chris,, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
120.4,Chris,,Can I go
120.4,Chris,, Can I go
120.4,Chris,,Or you went to NASA
120.4,Chris,, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff
120.4,Chris,,Sure
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, so"
120.4,Chris,,"Oh no, but we were just talking about the equipment"
120.4,Chris,," And I thought, probably, they would have to use those things too"
120.4,Chris,, Don't you think
120.4,Chris,, And so that made me think of that
120.4,Chris,,"So I heard, I read on Facebook by uncle posts a lot of stuff"
120.4,Chris,,Water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
120.4,Chris,, So I went to NASA
120.4,Chris,, And I know that scientists use all sorts of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks
120.4,Chris,,"Oh, yeah"
120.4,Chris,,"Well, so well, my first answer was scientists found craters full of water on the moon"
120.4,Chris,,yeah well actually I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
120.4,Chris,,"yeah absolutely so, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you and I in particular, I really wanted to thank you for working with us"
120.4,Chris,,yeah I said i'm scientists found craters full of water on the moon
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, so my answer is um scientists found craters full of water on the moon"
120.4,Chris,,um I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon
120.4,Chris,,"Um, I found mine in paragraph one"
120.4,Chris,,um you know I went to NASA so I know that scientists use of lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
120.4,Chris,,yeah she
120.4,Chris,,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, so um well I circled equipment, because well, so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits so I picked equipment"
120.4,Chris,,"I was, I actually found my information in the first paragraph, because that's where they were talking more about the water on the moon"
120.4,Chris,,"Oh, I said that they found craters full of water on the moon"
120.4,Chris,,"um I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, you know I went to NASA so I know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
120.4,Chris,,"Well, I wanted to add on it's really about the Lunar orbiter but it's that on I went to NASA actually so I know that the scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
120.4,Chris,,"Agile Teacher Lab: mm hmm so my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon, but when I talked to Jazmin and Luis they were both talking about equipment so on i'm not really sure what the right equipment is"
120.4,Chris,,I can go first
120.4,Chris,,Oh
120.4,Chris,,um that they found craters for water on the moon
120.4,Chris,,I went to NASA and I know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
120.4,Chris,,Well i'm i'm thinking that so actually I went to NASA so I know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
120.4,Chris,,"Well, so um so in there, it talks about that lunar orbiter but I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
120.4,Chris,,And you know okay so up I said scientists found critters full of water on the moon
120.4,Chris,,"And I think the answer is all, let me see what"
120.4,Chris,,yeah so
120.4,Chris,,"yeah, so I think is when something sort of goes around something else"
120.4,Chris,,Oh
120.4,Chris,,I said waters heavy so it's good they don't have to carry the ships anymore
120.4,Chris,,yeah definitely um yeah because then they wouldn't have to carry it all the way up there in the space shuttle they could just get it on the moon
120.4,Chris,,"yeah okay so uhm Jazmin pointed out that it says, actually, that the ice deposits are really small so, even though I was picturing like these big lakes and pools of water, it sounds like it's not really like that"
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, well, I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
120.4,Chris,,"yeah well just listening to what you said to Luis I see how all the cool stuff at NASA it helps the scientists, but it does it do the finding of the water"
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, so well I looked through the word machine"
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, well, I said um scientists found craters for water on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter"
120.4,Chris,,"Yes, I can"
120.4,Chris,,"Oh well, the scientists, the found these craters full of water"
120.4,Chris,,yeah oh so I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon
120.4,Chris,, Look around for something in particular are sort of like a detective might investigate a certain place for like clues and stuff
120.4,Chris,,So investigate is when you sort of
120.4,Chris,,"Oh, oh okay well at first I didn't say any equipment what it sounds like that's really important because it's a it's a key word like you said so now, I said on my answer is the small machine called a lunar orbiter"
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, so I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon"
120.4,Chris,,Okay well um so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
120.4,Chris,,"Well, first, I was wondering, is my new answer okay"
120.4,Chris,,I can share my oh answer was scientists phone craters full of water on the moon
120.4,Chris,,"Before the issue, the response I was just thinking about um the other kinds of equipment that we're talking about with even because I went to NASA into I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
120.4,Chris,,"yeah Okay, well, I said that scientists found creators, full of water on the moon"
120.4,Chris,,"Okay well so two things one for my answer, I said well that scientists be found creators, full of water on the moon, and so actually I went to NASA and I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
120.4,Chris,,yeah okay um so I wrote down that all
120.4,Chris,,yeah sure I said um scientists found craters full of water on the moon
120.4,Chris,,"um so they're looking for water right, and then they find water deep in these craters so like they found a whole bunch of craters with a whole lot of water"
120.4,Chris,,"Well, so I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
120.4,Chris,,"yeah so um well Actually, I know that scientists they actually use a lot of equipment on like oxygen tanks and masks and suits because I went to NASA so I know they use a lot of equipment"
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, well, I was just telling Farrah and of how I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
120.4,Chris,,"Okay, so I said that scientists found craters, full of water on the moon"
120.4,Chris,,"yeah I said that scientists found creators, full of water on the moon"
120.4,Chris,,"So I thought, when we were discussing up like I think Jazmin as a really good theory and I I could see how it could be the Lunar orbiter I can I can see that now"
120.3,Chris,,"Oh yeah it says, or what equipment at times is used to discover water on the moon"
120.3,Chris,,Just the first one
120.3,Chris,,Very small
120.3,Chris,,"Yeah, sure"
120.3,Chris,, Paragraph one
120.3,Chris,,I found my answer
120.3,Chris,,Uh huh
120.3,Chris,, What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
120.3,Chris,,Yeah
120.3,Chris,,"Yeah, sure"
120.3,Chris,,To read aloud
120.3,Chris,, That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
120.3,Chris,,"Yeah, sure"
120.3,Chris,," OK, paragraph 3"
120.3,Chris,," That means the moon is still drier than the rest of-- oh, sorry"
120.3,Chris,," The water they found is microscopic, meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it"
120.3,Chris,, You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.3,Chris,, OK
120.3,Chris,, I'd like to read it
120.3,Chris,,Yeah
120.3,Chris,, But also I wanted to say that I went to NASA and so I know that I use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit and stuff
120.3,Chris,,"Yeah, you're welcome"
120.3,Chris,, It says what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon
120.3,Chris,,Uh huh
120.3,Chris,,Yeah
120.3,Chris,,NASA send a small machine on the lunar orbiter to investigate
120.3,Chris,,Um yeah okay so
120.3,Chris,, What equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon
120.3,Chris,,Yeah okay
120.3,Chris,,"Oh, yeah, yeah"
120.3,Chris,," For example, future astronauts drink this water"
120.3,Chris,, Water is heavy
120.3,Chris,, It takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft
120.3,Chris,,"Want me to read, read, where I got my answer from or you want me to read where Jazmin got her answer from?"
120.3,Chris,,"So in part three, it says"
120.3,Chris,, You need a scientific
120.3,Chris,,Gotcha
120.3,Chris,,"Yeah, but my answer is in paragraph one, it's not in paragraph three"
120.3,Chris,,Microscopic's kind of like really small
120.3,Chris,, Scientists have known for a long time that the moon is it desert because it has no opposite like we have
120.3,Chris,,"Yeah, okay"
120.3,Chris,, I guess it's not
120.3,Chris,,"Um, no"
120.3,Chris,, Definitely
120.3,Chris,," Um, it says, let's see, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and lock her ice deposits and a large polar crater"
120.3,Chris,,"Yeah, I can do that"
120.3,Chris,," Yeah, okay, these ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water"
120.3,Chris,,Mm hmm
120.3,Chris,,"Yeah, I'll read it"
120.3,Chris,,"Oh yeah Okay, it says, this means the room is still drier than the driest desert on earth"
120.3,Chris,, You said the first sentence
120.3,Chris,, Okay
120.3,Chris,, It says that means the moon is still drier than the dryest desert on Earth
120.3,Chris,," Oh, part three"
120.3,Chris,,Okay
120.3,Chris,,On yeah I can do that okay
120.3,Chris,,"Yeah, ok"
120.3,Chris,," It says Okay, water on the moon is a desert"
120.3,Chris,,"yeah yeah cuz it kind of goes with what Luis said because I went to NASA actually, and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and also masks and suits"
120.3,Chris,,"yeah yeah I can do that right before it says Okay, the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it"
120.3,Chris,,"yeah well Actually, I have a comment it's that I, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
120.3,Chris,,yeah it was on one equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon
120.3,Chris,,Okay
120.3,Chris,,"Okay, all the water they found is microscopic meaning wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it okay"
120.3,Chris,,"circle, the evidence in the text we can use to answer this question"
120.3,Chris,,"I forgot to put the discovering water part, but I did put the equipment in my answer"
120.3,Chris,,I can read it
120.2,Chris,,"Well, since we're talking about equipment, I wanted to say, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
120.2,Chris,,I went to NASA
120.2,Chris,," So I know a lot of equipment, but the question is asking about the equipment that we use to find a water"
120.2,Chris,,"Yeah, I think you're saying like that"
120.2,Chris,, Yeah
120.2,Chris,, So I was just talking about equipment but not equipment to find the water
120.2,Chris,, The question is what equipment did scientistis use to discover water on the moon? Oh
120.2,Chris,,"Yeah, sure"
120.2,Chris,,"Like, okay, so like I went to NASA, like with my dad and like I like know already that like you have to use spacesuits and oxygen tanks and like kind of like what Luis was saying like I saw it in the exhibits like I i just already knew that that you have to use all that stuff"
120.2,Chris,," I thought, Farrah said they use like a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate"
120.2,Chris,,"Yeah, yeah"
120.2,Chris,,"Well, I had said that they could do it with the craters"
120.2,Chris,, I said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon
120.2,Chris,,Orbiter
120.2,Chris,,"Um, well, I guess I'm not sure"
120.2,Chris,,What Farrah said?
120.2,Chris,,"Oh, okay, yeah, I guess not"
120.2,Chris,,What equipment did they use
120.2,Chris,,"Hey, I'm sorry"
120.2,Chris,," No, I will wait"
120.2,Chris,, Go ahead
120.2,Chris,, Ok
120.2,Chris,,Ok
120.2,Chris,,"Okay, scientists found craters full of water on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter"
120.2,Chris,,I'll say mine
120.2,Chris,,well
120.2,Chris,,"Agile Teacher Lab: Oh well, so this isn't what I said for number one, but now I realized number one is talking about equipment"
120.2,Chris,,"Agile Teacher Lab: mm hmm okay so well, first, I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon and that's still true, but when I talked to Jazmin and Luis they both were talking about equipment on so since you said Jazmin had the right answer I think it's a lunar orbiter"
120.2,Chris,,well I guess it's a lunar orbiter um
120.2,Chris,,"Oh, oh yeah um so"
120.2,Chris,,Oh
120.2,Chris,,um well I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
120.2,Chris,,"First Okay, I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon"
120.2,Chris,,All okay oh wow
120.2,Chris,,"When you were talking about the future, I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024"
120.2,Chris,,"Well hi this is Chris, I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
120.1,Chris,,Yeah yeah discover
120.1,Chris,,"Yeah, about the water?"
120.1,Chris,," Like, I guess, I guess no cuz like I guess the lunar orbiter landed in one of the craters that was full of water"
120.1,Chris,,"Um, well"
120.1,Chris,, I'll see what I can find
120.1,Chris,,"RER: Yeah, I'll try"
120.1,Chris,, Okay
120.1,Chris,,"Um, yeah"
120.1,Chris,, So I actually was kind of agreeing with Luis Like my dad took me to NASA
120.1,Chris,," And we went like all over the place and like looked at different stuff and like saw that like astronauts had to have, like, um,"
120.1,Chris,,harvard
120.1,Chris,,"edu: teacher, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
120.1,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.1,Chris,,"Well, I guess that they found lots of water like they found a whole bunch of water in these craters that was kind of, you know what I mean"
120.1,Chris,,You told Jazmin that she was close because she said on the small machine and then you asked her what it was called and she said the lunar orbiter so I think you told her that that was the answer right?
120.1,Chris,,"Yeah, I guess so"
120.1,Chris,," Um, but I do know, like a lot"
120.1,Chris,, And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
120.1,Chris,, I went to NASA
120.1,Chris,,"Yeah, oh look, oh look in the story again"
120.1,Chris,,I guess your I can try again
120.1,Chris,," Because if I have to pick one from the story, I would say"
120.1,Chris,,"So, so"
120.1,Chris,,"Okay, I'll read it"
120.1,Chris,,Okay yeah um so it's a small machine called a lunar orbiter
120.1,Chris,,"Okay yeah yeah that math example that really make sense, all look again"
120.1,Chris,,You know I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024
120.1,Chris,,harvard
120.1,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.1,Chris,,edu: and find those words in the answer and then um
120.1,Chris,,"I guess I was I was picturing the really big craters and um like pools or lakes of water, because craters are really big, right?"
110.4,Chris,,"Um, yeah, I was just kind of wondering like, so I went to NASA with my dad and we had a chance to like look at all the displays all the rockets and stuff"
110.4,Chris,,"Well, I actually have a question"
110.4,Chris,,"Well for me, I was thinking about water seem to be an important word in the question"
110.4,Chris,,"So, I mean, that feels like that could be like some tools that they would use to somebody equipment, you know,"
110.4,Chris,,"Yeah, I also know, like you said that water splits into oxygen and hydrogen"
110.4,Chris,,"I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, and masks, and suits"
110.4,Chris,, Yeah
110.4,Chris,,I have
110.4,Chris,," So like I guess I'm wondering, like, is that I guess that's not the answer, but didn't they have to use that stuff to find the water?"
110.4,Chris,,"Okay, so basically, I was gonna say, kind of like, I guess, kind of like what Luis said before, like I went to NASA with my dad and like I know that scientists have to use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and all that kind of stuff"
110.4,Chris,,"Okay, okay"
110.4,Chris,,"Okay, so"
110.4,Chris,,Okay well in the part that i've read it said that they found the water deep in the moon's polar craters and when I go swimming in the deep part of the pool there's more water in the deep part of the pool than in the shallow part of the pool
110.3,Chris,,It's really cool
110.3,Chris,,"Oh no, I was just"
110.3,Chris,,"Yeah, I went with my dad and we saw the rocket ships and we saw with all kinds of cool stuff"
110.3,Chris,, Cool
110.3,Chris,," Yeah, I can tell you, all, all about how the space ships take off and like how you know it's a little bit hard"
110.3,Chris,,Okay
110.3,Chris,, Okay
110.3,Chris,,Yeah
110.3,Chris,,Me and my dad went
110.3,Chris,,"Okay, yeah, that sounds great"
110.3,Chris,,"So yeah, I think I might have seen that at NASA, I just realized that, cool"
110.3,Chris,,harvard
110.3,Chris,,"edu: Right it's all so maybe they if they have a base, then they could have water there"
110.3,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.3,Chris,,"Yo, yeah"
110.3,Chris,," Yeah, I love space"
110.3,Chris,," Like, all kinds of stuff about that and I LIKE I REALLY KNOW ABOUT"
110.3,Chris,,"Oh yeah, I know"
110.3,Chris,,"OK, OK"
110.3,Chris,, That sounds really cool
110.3,Chris,,harvard
110.3,Chris,,edu: um well you didn't you didn't say anything about my answer is my answer right
110.3,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.3,Chris,,"Yeah, me and my dad went"
110.3,Chris,,"Yeah, well, they had to like you had to use the suits to get off the spaceship and go walk around and look for water"
110.3,Chris,, Yeah
110.3,Chris,,OK
110.3,Chris,,Yeah
110.3,Chris,,yeah geology is like the study of rocks
110.3,Chris,,"Oh yeah I could definitely add that, to my answer"
110.3,Chris,,"yeah it was an amazing trip, we got to see so many different things there"
110.3,Chris,,"So, could we put that in our answer too"
110.3,Chris,,So I could put that for my answer
110.3,Chris,,yeah it was so cool they had so many things like machines and tools and space suits yeah it was amazing to watch
110.2,Chris,,"Yes, they do"
110.2,Chris,,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
110.2,Chris,,Yeah
110.2,Chris,, And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit stuff
110.2,Chris,," Well, I went to NASA"
110.2,Chris,,"Okay, so I'm reading it now"
110.2,Chris,," So how can that be the right one, because they don't have discover in this one"
110.2,Chris,, And the other thing I guess is that I don't see them talking about water in the paragraph about the Lunar Orbiter
110.2,Chris,," Oh, I do see look for ice"
110.2,Chris,,Yes
110.2,Chris,," So I was kind of thinking like, um, I was thinking that well, I went to NASA and I know that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and maybe they use know that when they were finding like all that water in the craters"
110.2,Chris,,"What I say yes it's valuable cause it's heavy, and they don't have to carry it in ships"
110.2,Chris,,Yeah
110.2,Chris,, I didn't write the name of the equipment
110.2,Chris,," Oh, yeah"
110.2,Chris,,"Like you said to Jazmin, the name of the equipment, The name of the equipment that they used"
110.2,Chris,," Yeah, I didn't actually so I didn't really see anything in here but I kind of, I did have a question that came up from reading and it was like"
110.2,Chris,,You
110.2,Chris,,harvard
110.2,Chris,,edu: I don't have to change mine either?
110.2,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.2,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.2,Chris,,edu: You know I I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024
110.2,Chris,,harvard
110.2,Chris,,"Use to like breathe or walk or you know, to protect themselves from from the elements because it's really cool"
110.2,Chris,,yeah yeah
110.2,Chris,,You put it doesn't
110.2,Chris,, I don't know how
110.2,Chris,, I don't know
110.2,Chris,," So I, I noticed that"
110.2,Chris,,Actually yeah I was gonna ask
110.2,Chris,, So I'm figuring that's the right answer
110.2,Chris,,"Um, well Jazmin just said the Lunar Orbiter and the microscope and you told her that was right"
110.2,Chris,,Cool
110.2,Chris,," And that's, that's like different from"
110.2,Chris,,RER: We actually have to go to lunch
110.2,Chris,, So I guess no
110.2,Chris,,No
110.2,Chris,, Craters aren't equipment
110.2,Chris,," Well, it kind of goes along with my"
110.2,Chris,,"Well, okay"
110.2,Chris,,"Oh well, okay"
110.2,Chris,," So in part one, they talk about"
110.2,Chris,,yeah
110.2,Chris,,Oh whoo so we so my answer could be on that the scientists to use the masks and the oxygen tanks and this be suits and the Lunar orbiter and the microscope
110.1,Chris,,"Okay, well, so I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
110.1,Chris,,"Okay um I learned that if it says evidence, you have to say something in the story"
110.1,Chris,, And so I was connecting to everything
110.1,Chris,,"Yeah, I think for me, what was most interesting was looking at, like, was I think the fact that I've not been to NASA, a couple of times with my dad"
110.1,Chris,," They were saying on because I I had kind of known some of it, but not everything"
110.1,Chris,," So I guess that's a like you don't use a suit to discover, you'd have to use something else"
110.1,Chris,,"You could use all of the equipment, but like, specifically, you said to discover"
110.1,Chris,, Right
110.1,Chris,,"Um, yeah"
110.1,Chris,," So I guess I wish to keep kind of the same thing that basically there's lots of equipment you, you could use"
110.1,Chris,, So like you don't the microscope isn't necessarily the quick
110.1,Chris,, It could be other things
110.1,Chris,, You know what I mean like it could be sensors
110.1,Chris,,Yeah yeah
110.1,Chris,," So like, that was my answer"
110.1,Chris,," It was like, Okay"
110.1,Chris,, So the scientists found found water in the crater
110.1,Chris,,Yeah yeah
110.1,Chris,, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and mask and suits
110.1,Chris,,I went to NASA
110.1,Chris,,Yeah
110.1,Chris,, I didn't know anything about the water
110.1,Chris,," Um, but I didn't"
110.1,Chris,,"I don't know, is it not a good answer?"
110.1,Chris,,Yeah
110.1,Chris,,"Yeah, I'm feeling good"
110.1,Chris,, I know a lot about this stuff
110.1,Chris,,"Oh,"
110.1,Chris,,I said water again this time because I think that's what the whole thing is about
110.1,Chris,,Okay
110.1,Chris,,"Sorry Teacher I just, I just thought of one more thing"
110.1,Chris,, So I think I know the words pretty well
110.1,Chris,,Not like I really love space and my dad has taken me to NASA before
110.1,Chris,, Right
110.1,Chris,,I also said microscope
110.1,Chris,, Yeah
110.1,Chris,," So like I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that kind of stuff, like I already know about all that stuff"
110.1,Chris,,"So, I went to NASA"
110.1,Chris,,"Um, so I was just gonna say like that basically I can understand so like the lunar orbiter is the machine that like went up there like Jazmin said, did they have astronauts in it? Did they need all that stuff?"
110.1,Chris,,"Yeah, no problem"
110.1,Chris,," Like, I went to NASA with my dad and like we basically like went and studied all the exhibits and stuff so like I just know like outside of the reading that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that stuff"
110.1,Chris,,"Well, I guess I was just wondering, kind of, I mean, kind of like Luis like I don't know"
110.1,Chris,,"Oh, I was just gonna say the same thing"
110.1,Chris,, So I know that the scientists use like a lot of equipment that wasn't in the reading
110.1,Chris,, But oxygen tanks and masks and suits and things like that
110.1,Chris,,"Yeah, I, I kind of had that like because I went to NASA"
110.1,Chris,, But before we go to lunch
110.1,Chris,, I just wanted to thank you for really thoughtfully work with us because you help me to understand like
110.1,Chris,, We go to lunch
110.1,Chris,,"I, I am"
110.1,Chris,,"Um, well, I was just gonna say like I i only underlined"
110.1,Chris,,"Yeah, okay"
110.1,Chris,,"On yeah I guess I just wanted to say this, like water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and they both are important"
110.1,Chris,, I went to NASA
110.1,Chris,, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment my oxygen tanks and masks answer
110.1,Chris,,"Yeah, yeah"
110.1,Chris,,Yeah
110.1,Chris,,"Yeah, yeah"
110.1,Chris,,"Agile Teacher Lab: You yeah yeah it's valuable, I think, having more money, the spacecraft's definitely valuable"
110.1,Chris,," Yeah, I can get that"
110.1,Chris,,"Okay, okay"
110.1,Chris,,We so
110.1,Chris,, So I know that's high does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks
110.1,Chris,,I went to NASA
110.1,Chris,,Uh huh
110.1,Chris,,yeah that could be pretty cool
110.1,Chris,,edu: You know what I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks
110.1,Chris,,harvard
110.1,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.1,Chris,,I kind of was thinking about what Farrah and Oliver were saying
110.1,Chris,," And I was thinking that the deposits are small so maybe like it's you know what I mean, like, maybe you need a microscope to see"
110.1,Chris,, I was wondering like why that's not in the reading
110.1,Chris,,"It makes me think I guess my question is, like, I've been to NASA with my dad and we saw that like there was like masks and suits and stuff that astronauts or"
110.1,Chris,,um I could say
110.1,Chris,,"Um, well"
110.1,Chris,, That's what I said that the scientists found craters full of water
110.1,Chris,,Was my answer
110.1,Chris,,And my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon
110.1,Chris,,Okay
110.1,Chris,,"So I, I went to NASA"
110.1,Chris,, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
110.1,Chris,,"Okay, so that's the answer"
110.1,Chris,,"Yeah, I thought that was so cool"
110.1,Chris,,edu: Let me see
110.1,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.1,Chris,,harvard
110.1,Chris,, It investigated
110.1,Chris,,I thought about
110.1,Chris,,yeah well actually Farrah I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like will like oxygen tanks like Luis said but also masks and suits
110.1,Chris,,harvard
110.1,Chris,,"edu: I thought it was pretty cool you know, like the idea of finding water on the moon, and then maybe people you know if we if we use all the water on our planet, you know, then, then we could go to the moon, and we could have people drink water and astronauts could have water there so yeah"
110.1,Chris,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.1,Chris,,"Well, I just wanted to share I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
110.1,Chris,,yeah i was gonna say find
110.1,Chris,,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah I found my answer in the first paragraph
110.1,Chris,,"yeah well actually I went to NASA, so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
110.1,Chris,,My answer is that i'm okay it's
110.1,Chris,,"My answer, my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon, is that OK"
110.1,Chris,,Ya so It says that in the first paragraph up top scientists have evidence that water can be deep within the moon's
150.1,Farrah,,"Okay, well, so my question is, is it Okay, if I just say the microscope or do I have to less like all of the equipment, like the microscope and the orbiter and the oxygen tanks and masks and things"
150.1,Farrah,,"Oh, I don't understand why my answer is still wrong"
150.1,Farrah,," I mean, I guess"
150.1,Farrah,,"Um, well"
150.1,Farrah,," Okay, so my answer was, you need a scientific tool calle a microscope to look really closely"
150.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, sure"
150.1,Farrah,,"So we did look through paragraph two,"
150.1,Farrah,, Um
150.1,Farrah,," Because I don't have a job and so like, so I don't really get, like, you know, for grownups and and how much money they have"
150.1,Farrah,,"I mean, I guess so"
150.1,Farrah,, Like they sent I sent this Lunar Orbiter
150.1,Farrah,, You did tell me like I hear what you're saying
150.1,Farrah,," Um, but what--"
150.1,Farrah,,"Um, I mean, I guess"
150.1,Farrah,," I mean, I guess, cuz you're you"
150.1,Farrah,,I'm thinking about
150.1,Farrah,," Okay, so what you're saying is that they sent the Lunar Orbiter and then they found the water and then they use the microscope to"
150.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, I still don't understand why my answers wrong"
150.1,Farrah,," OK, so I said--"
150.1,Farrah,,"Oh, OK"
150.1,Farrah,," Oh, yes"
150.1,Farrah,, So then my one about-- let me see
150.1,Farrah,, What did I-- I know I circled a part of the story
150.1,Farrah,,OK
150.1,Farrah,, OK
150.1,Farrah,,"Oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense"
150.1,Farrah,,NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
150.1,Farrah,,With you up me
150.1,Farrah,," So, um, I guess"
150.1,Farrah,," I don't know why my answers wrong, too"
150.1,Farrah,,"Well, um, I mean, I think that I had the right answer"
150.1,Farrah,,So they're using their background knowledge so me and Oliver get it because we don't know as much about space as then
150.1,Farrah,," So I feel like, oh yeah cuz discover is different from look at"
150.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, I guess, I guess"
150.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, thank you"
150.1,Farrah,," So like my answer wasn't quite right, but it was like that they they have to use something else to discover the water"
150.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, I think so"
150.1,Farrah,,"I just I just was wondering like, I didn't"
150.1,Farrah,, I wasn't quite sure why my answer was wrong
150.1,Farrah,,"Oh,"
150.1,Farrah,, And I think that we all feel really confident now that you said that
150.1,Farrah,,"Oh yeah, that sounds great"
150.1,Farrah,, Thank you so much
150.1,Farrah,, Alright
150.1,Farrah,,"I said, you need a scientific microscope to look really closely"
150.1,Farrah,," Well, I mean, it says that they look at the water with a microscope"
150.1,Farrah,," Um, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon"
150.1,Farrah,," That's equipment, um,"
150.1,Farrah,,"Oh no, I can see it"
150.1,Farrah,,How it's used to find water
150.1,Farrah,,"Yes, we enjoyed it and we're ready to share our answers"
150.1,Farrah,,"So, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go I really wanted to thank you for a couple things"
150.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, we talked about, we use a microscope in science class"
150.1,Farrah,,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah
150.1,Farrah,,Is the answer to the Lunar orbiter
150.1,Farrah,,yeah I can see make sense
150.1,Farrah,,Oh
150.1,Farrah,,Oh yeah I guess
150.1,Farrah,,RER: yeah yeah yeah that does make sense okay
150.1,Farrah,,"Oh yeah, I see it"
150.1,Farrah,,"Oh, I don't think I know I don't understand why I'm why it's not the microscope"
150.1,Farrah,,"I think so, um, you know what I just realized it's it's time for us to go to lunch, but I did want to say"
150.1,Farrah,,Mm hmm
150.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, yeah"
150.1,Farrah,, I understand it better now
150.1,Farrah,,"Yes, we did"
150.1,Farrah,,"Um, well, I also sent them microscope like Oliver and I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
150.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, we've all read it already"
150.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, that sounds great"
150.1,Farrah,, And so it said the name of the machine
150.1,Farrah,,"Um, yeah, he he read the whole sentence"
150.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, yeah"
150.1,Farrah,, That's what it says in the text
150.1,Farrah,,That's correct
150.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, can I try again"
150.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, we all, we all took some time and we read it again"
150.1,Farrah,,"Oh, it was so cool"
150.1,Farrah,,About about water on the moon
150.1,Farrah,, I think we're ready to go
150.1,Farrah,,I think we're ready
150.1,Farrah,,"Yes, I did"
150.1,Farrah,,"Well, I didn't work with a partner, yet I just rewrote it and I found that they talked about a machine"
150.1,Farrah,,Hi I'm Farrah well
150.1,Farrah,, So should we just talk to each other or
150.1,Farrah,,Okay
150.1,Farrah,, Okay
150.1,Farrah,, Thank you
150.1,Farrah,, Yeah
150.1,Farrah,,Yeah
150.1,Farrah,, Yeah
150.1,Farrah,,Yeah
150.1,Farrah,,Agile Teacher Lab: um I have a question
150.1,Farrah,,Oh
150.1,Farrah,,I don't
150.1,Farrah,,yeah I think we're ready to go
150.1,Farrah,,So the answer is just both
150.1,Farrah,,"yeah yeah I was gonna say that does make more sense than it did before, but also, I just looked at the clock and"
150.1,Farrah,, Is that right?
150.1,Farrah,,So I guess it just it looks in the craters
150.1,Farrah,,I can go
150.1,Farrah,,"yeah excuse me, I have all those, so I don't understand why my answers wrong"
150.1,Farrah,,"On yes, we do um do you wanna do you want to hear them"
150.1,Farrah,,"yeah yeah I wrote a lot more um I mean I wrote a lot more like not words but you know, like from my from my brain i'm in the second answer than because the first answer was from the story"
150.1,Farrah,,So specificity
150.1,Farrah,,yeah yeah that does
150.1,Farrah,,"um, how can, how can you find something that's too small to see don't need a microscope"
150.1,Farrah,,"Okay, so a microscope it's something you look through, and when you look through it, it makes really tiny things on So you can see that"
150.1,Farrah,,"Okay, so"
150.1,Farrah,,i'm i'm still kind of confused
150.1,Farrah,,yeah that sounds like an interesting like ranking all of the equipment  I think just i'm still a little about why my answer is wrong
140.1,Farrah,,"Okay, how about how about the wildcats because that's our that's our school team"
140.1,Farrah,,"Um, well, I go to the bank with my mom sometimes, and she'll deposit her paycheck, but I don't know if it's like a lot of money or like a small amount of money"
140.1,Farrah,, But I don't I still don't understand why my answer is wrong
140.1,Farrah,,"Um, I guess so"
140.1,Farrah,,But I'm just wanting you to look at it and different views
140.1,Farrah,, But when you look at it over a whole month that's only a partial of the money
140.1,Farrah,, So in one week that might be a lot of money
140.1,Farrah,,We plant cells in science class
140.1,Farrah,," So they didn't go into space, but they traveled through space and time"
140.1,Farrah,,"Well, I read-- I read this book, A Wrinkle in Time, which is about going to different universes"
140.1,Farrah,,LAUGHS
140.1,Farrah,, We are able to do a lot of things
140.1,Farrah,," But if you look back in the older books from the past, a lot of stuff has come out that people thought was just science fiction and would not happen, and with science, we have brought it about"
140.1,Farrah,,That is pretty cool fiction
140.1,Farrah,, Like back in the 1930s-- is that a long time ago?
140.1,Farrah,,Really?
140.1,Farrah,,"You know, I think we did"
140.1,Farrah,,Um like different than a microscope?
140.1,Farrah,,So I just would surely we have to go to lunch
140.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, yeah, just like an aunt or something like that"
140.1,Farrah,,I'm walking
140.1,Farrah,, Yeah
140.1,Farrah,, Yeah
140.1,Farrah,," Um, oh, I don't remember the names of it, but we look at things that are like little bitty teeny, teeny thing"
140.1,Farrah,," Like in science class, we look at like these little bitty"
140.1,Farrah,,"Like, well we use it in like science class"
140.1,Farrah,,It's just a few of us
140.1,Farrah,,"Um, so, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch"
140.1,Farrah,, But before we go to lunch
140.1,Farrah,," I just really wanted to thank you for working with us, and in particular"
140.1,Farrah,,"Oh yeah, definitely"
140.1,Farrah,," I thought it was just, I don't know, dry up there"
140.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, I never thought there would be water on the moon"
140.1,Farrah,,it's something we can like lune
140.1,Farrah,,"Agile Teacher Lab: Well um I just found it surprising that there was water on the moon, I never thought about that, before, so I was very surprised"
140.1,Farrah,,Agile Teacher Lab: in science
140.1,Farrah,,"Well, actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch now"
140.1,Farrah,,"Oh well, i'm actually I was gonna say I looked at the clock on and it's it's time for us to go to lunch"
130.3,Farrah,,"Oh, what do you do you"
130.3,Farrah,,But the microscope is a machine
130.3,Farrah,,That's interesting
130.3,Farrah,, So they didn't use the micrsoscope to find it
130.3,Farrah,, I see
130.3,Farrah,,"Oh, OK"
130.3,Farrah,," Okay, gotcha"
130.3,Farrah,," Okay, interesting way"
130.3,Farrah,,"Oh, interesting"
130.3,Farrah,, So like you would say both
130.3,Farrah,," Okay, that, that, that makes a little more sense"
130.3,Farrah,," Um,"
130.3,Farrah,,Gotcha
130.3,Farrah,," I think, I think that makes sense"
130.3,Farrah,,"Yeah, I think so"
130.3,Farrah,,"Oh, but I guess"
130.3,Farrah,, So how do you figure that out
130.3,Farrah,," Is it just because you're the teacher, you know, you know,"
130.3,Farrah,,"Oh, so like they like found it using the Lunar Orbiter and then they used the microscope like like to see it"
130.3,Farrah,,Yeah
130.3,Farrah,,"I did, yeah"
130.3,Farrah,,"Oh yeah, that doesn't make sense"
130.3,Farrah,, So they didn't actually have a microscope on the moon?
130.3,Farrah,,"Okay, so you just needed to see"
130.3,Farrah,,"Yes, they use the Lunar Orbiter to discover it"
130.3,Farrah,," And then they use the microscope to study, I think, is that right"
130.3,Farrah,,okay okay so we're both right
130.3,Farrah,,"Well actually it's it's time for us to go right now, but I wanted to say thank you for reminding us that we have to go back and read the whole thing to make sure that we didn't just pick part of the answer, but we actually find the whole answer"
130.3,Farrah,, So it's both
130.3,Farrah,,"Oh, OK"
130.3,Farrah,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.3,Farrah,,edu: I still don't understand why my answer is wrong
130.3,Farrah,,harvard
130.3,Farrah,,Oh OK OK
130.3,Farrah,,"Oh, but, but I did I had all the keywords I had equipment discover water on the moon"
130.3,Farrah,,"Although they also do say microscope in the lessons and the last sentence of paragraph three, how come that's not the equipment"
130.3,Farrah,,"Oh well, I had a different piece of equipment, I said the microscope and"
130.3,Farrah,,"Agile Teacher Lab: um okay so yeah it said that the orbiter looks for the deposits, but the microscope you need to look at the deposits"
130.3,Farrah,,edu: yeah I saw that one
130.3,Farrah,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.3,Farrah,,harvard
130.3,Farrah,,Well um I I guess the Lunar orbiter is the right answer but I don't really understand why because
130.3,Farrah,,"Oh well, the microscope"
130.2,Farrah,,"And so I found my answer and part three, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and that's evidence from the text also"
130.2,Farrah,, So investigates like when you're a detective and you're like getting clues and finding out the truth
130.2,Farrah,,Yes
130.2,Farrah,,"I'm still kind of, you know, like I i saw the parts that they were saying where they were like,"
130.2,Farrah,, And that's what the question is asking
130.2,Farrah,, Because they were looking at the water
130.2,Farrah,, I had circle too Oliver
130.2,Farrah,,Yeah yeah cuz that that was the same
130.2,Farrah,, I had circled like you know you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
130.2,Farrah,,Okay
130.2,Farrah,,"Oh, yeah"
130.2,Farrah,, So I think that he's right about equipment
130.2,Farrah,," But I don't think that like I don't think he was I don't think he was reading, ma'am"
130.2,Farrah,," I think she was just saying stuff like that he knew, like I looked at it and I said like I think it's a microscope"
130.2,Farrah,,"Okay, so, you know, initially, that's what I thought, too"
130.2,Farrah,, So I was thinking about what word is like
130.2,Farrah,,So I basically
130.2,Farrah,,"Oh, OK"
130.2,Farrah,, OK
130.2,Farrah,,So I think that they they use the microscope to discover the water like that's how they they found it
130.2,Farrah,," So I'm not really sure like why is my answer, like um not right"
130.2,Farrah,,I actually have a question
130.2,Farrah,, I still don't quite understand why my answer was wrong
130.2,Farrah,,"Um, he said the waters heavy if it's on the space of the spaceship"
130.2,Farrah,," We said that you know the Microsoft the microscope is his equipment and then we said that we also saw in paragraph four, they were talking about a spacecraft and we said that that was equipment to"
130.2,Farrah,,"Well, me and depth kind of set the same stuff"
130.2,Farrah,, I just wanted to share with you how awesome it was to have you with us today
130.2,Farrah,,"So unfortunately, we have to go to our next class, we go to our next class"
130.2,Farrah,," Um, I actually was thinking that the microscope is is probably the the tool that they use to discover water on the moon, but it seems like that answers not right"
130.2,Farrah,,Um sure
130.2,Farrah,, I'm a little confused about why
130.2,Farrah,,I think the equipment was a microscope
130.2,Farrah,,"So I believe they use the microscope because you, you said that we should look at the text"
130.2,Farrah,, It's like saying that the waters microscopic so like I think that's it
130.2,Farrah,," So why I believe that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to see, and then the text"
130.2,Farrah,,edu: I had microscope
130.2,Farrah,,harvard
130.2,Farrah,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.2,Farrah,,um yeah well now that I understand um yeah uh yeah I do
130.2,Farrah,, So I guess I figured they can spend a lot of money because they have a lot of money
130.2,Farrah,, I don't know if-- I think NASA has a lot of money
130.2,Farrah,, But I don't know if it's worth it
130.2,Farrah,,I guess I don't know
130.2,Farrah,,It means to go around
130.2,Farrah,,"Yeah, so I picked a different piece of equipment and Jazmin picked"
130.2,Farrah,,"Okay, so this paragraph, it tells us"
130.2,Farrah,,"Some of them, yeah"
130.2,Farrah,,"yeah Okay, so I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
130.2,Farrah,,"Oh, my mind was going to be different, I was just gonna add on to mine that NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter"
130.2,Farrah,,Okay equipment for discovering water
130.2,Farrah,,um no she didn't have the WHO and
130.2,Farrah,,So you're saying you're saying it's the Lunar orbiter and not the microscope
130.2,Farrah,,harvard
130.2,Farrah,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.2,Farrah,,edu: I circle just over two because the same thing same class in our English teacher told us about looking for the action word in the in the question
130.2,Farrah,,"um yes, I I thought, something different, so I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
130.2,Farrah,,Reach Every reader: Oh I just got the same thing
130.1,Farrah,," So, okay, I should actually, I had a question, because I circled"
130.1,Farrah,,"Oh, yeah"
130.1,Farrah,,They're looking for the water
130.1,Farrah,,OK
130.1,Farrah,,"Oh, so okay so they had to use this small machine to like find it in the first place"
130.1,Farrah,, Well I guess
130.1,Farrah,," Yeah, I thought about discover just like Oliver I circled equipment and water"
130.1,Farrah,,I'm I'm mostly focused
130.1,Farrah,,Okay yeah so so microscope and lunar orbiter?
130.1,Farrah,,Gotcha
130.1,Farrah,,Teacher
130.1,Farrah,, I don't understand why my answers wrong
130.1,Farrah,,Okay
130.1,Farrah,,harvard
130.1,Farrah,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.1,Farrah,,"edu: yeah I saw in paragraph two, there was a small machine called a lunar orbiter"
130.1,Farrah,,Okay
130.1,Farrah,,"Okay, you want to have reread it"
130.1,Farrah,,Yeah
130.1,Farrah,," Okay, that makes more sense"
130.1,Farrah,, Okay
130.1,Farrah,,"Okay, so you're saying"
130.1,Farrah,,Oh yeah but I mean also Jazmin because she said something different
120.4,Farrah,,"Yes, Okay, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,"So no, not for a long time"
120.4,Farrah,, I don't think that the evidence is
120.4,Farrah,,"Yeah, I found the equipment, but it wasn't an aircraft to I found the equipment in paragraph three because yeah"
120.4,Farrah,,Oh my circle two words right
120.4,Farrah,,"So, okay, be what I was looking at"
120.4,Farrah,,"Yeah, so I think one thing that I thought was really interesting was when I was looking for the for the equipment, but to see like how much equipment they have to use it"
120.4,Farrah,, There's a lot of it
120.4,Farrah,, I don't remember what I put
120.4,Farrah,,I'm I'm trying to remember
120.4,Farrah,, Because I circled it on my tablet oh yeah I circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.4,Farrah,, Let me just see
120.4,Farrah,," It's meet Farrah here, I just want to say that I don't understand why my answer's wrong"
120.4,Farrah,,"Well, I"
120.4,Farrah,,I did and I already corrected my answer too
120.4,Farrah,,"Yeah, I learned about how you use microscopes different ways, I think that the thing I want you to the question I have is like why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Farrah,,"Oh, so I think it's the microscope"
120.4,Farrah,,Okay
120.4,Farrah,," So I said,"
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay well i i thought that it was kind of similar to deaths, where it was like, not for a long time because it said, making this plan will take a lot of time and money"
120.4,Farrah,,"so I said microscope, but I'm not quite sure"
120.4,Farrah,, Like why is my answer wrong
120.4,Farrah,," So basically, my answer was just that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,, Yes
120.4,Farrah,,Oh
120.4,Farrah,,"Yeah, sure"
120.4,Farrah,," Okay, so my answer is also know and that I guess I feel a little different from Oliver is like, it wouldn't be useful for a long time"
120.4,Farrah,,"Um, so basically I thought that"
120.4,Farrah,,On
120.4,Farrah,," I was just wondering, because I guess I'm still not sure why my answer's wrong"
120.4,Farrah,,"Yeah, so my answer was basically that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close"
120.4,Farrah,,"Yeah, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close"
120.4,Farrah,, But I don't understand why mine has a partial response
120.4,Farrah,,"I'd say-- I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,, But the teacher said that we were all over here because we had partial responses to the question
120.4,Farrah,, I said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.4,Farrah,,Yeah
120.4,Farrah,, Sure
120.4,Farrah,,Yeah um I circled the last sentence
120.4,Farrah,, It's in the in the story where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's at the end of paragraph three
120.4,Farrah,,"Um, okay"
120.4,Farrah,," So, so I looked, I looked, because I was also I was listening to what you are seeing a Jazmin"
120.4,Farrah,, Yes
120.4,Farrah,, Okay
120.4,Farrah,," So I said, that a scientist, would need to use a microscope"
120.4,Farrah,,Oh yeah
120.4,Farrah,,Yeah
120.4,Farrah,," OK, so my answer was basically"
120.4,Farrah,, So my answer was basically that you need a scientific microscope to look really close and
120.4,Farrah,,Okay
120.4,Farrah,," So, all right"
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay, so actually I guess it was really about looking like discover"
120.4,Farrah,, Like it doesn't say discovery to we're supposed to match up
120.4,Farrah,,"Yeah, so that basically like when you look at it, the third paragraph"
120.4,Farrah,,"Yeah, so I was just going to ask like,"
120.4,Farrah,," It says you need a microscope, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,"Um, so I think that the um the equipment was the microscope, like in the reading"
120.4,Farrah,,"Well, I was just, I was thinking that you know if I'm, if, if, if the astronauts got, like, you know, thirsty or something, then they could just like drill a hole in the moon, maybe, and then they could drink the water like that maybe"
120.4,Farrah,," And so, do you mind to share with us what your response was,"
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay, Farrah"
120.4,Farrah,,So my answer was that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.4,Farrah,,"They found lots of um, well they found water, they found amounts of water"
120.4,Farrah,," And so he was talking about how like in like rocket launches how like the, like, um like, it looks like smoke but it's actually steam comes out of the rocket when it flies up, which is pretty cool"
120.4,Farrah,,So Pearson was talking about how he went to NASA
120.4,Farrah,, And he like got to go and visit with his dad
120.4,Farrah,," My answer was, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,Sure
120.4,Farrah,,A microscope
120.4,Farrah,,"Um, yeah"
120.4,Farrah,, I just wanted to thank you for working with us
120.4,Farrah,, So I just unfortunately we have to go to lunch
120.4,Farrah,, But before we went to lunch
120.4,Farrah,, I think Luis has his hand raised
120.4,Farrah,,I'm sure I can
120.4,Farrah,,"Well, I guess we were listening to, as you were saying this stuff with with Jazmin"
120.4,Farrah,," So I guess the, the difference is like what's the best answer"
120.4,Farrah,,"Well, I don't really know very much about like"
120.4,Farrah,,"So with that, I circled was ice, ice deposits"
120.4,Farrah,,Okay
120.4,Farrah,, I think the most important word is equipment
120.4,Farrah,,"Yeah, sure"
120.4,Farrah,," Okay, like in the third paragraph, they were talking about finding the water and it said the water they found is microscopic"
120.4,Farrah,,"OK, so my answer was basically no like I don't think it's very convincing"
120.4,Farrah,,"Yeah, I don't think it's actually, I guess, I guess I don't really have a question, because I understand why it's the lunar orbiter because it's not"
120.4,Farrah,," So basically, you just need a scientific a tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,"Oh yeah, okay"
120.4,Farrah,," Um, okay, so I said, you need a microscope to do the water"
120.4,Farrah,,"Sure, we can do that"
120.4,Farrah,,"I mean, this is me, Farrah"
120.4,Farrah,, I looked at over and I don't understand why why the microscope is raw
120.4,Farrah,,harvard
120.4,Farrah,,"edu: I said no, not for a long time"
120.4,Farrah,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Farrah,,"Oh well, I don't understand why my answers wrong"
120.4,Farrah,,"Oh, my answer was that um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,"Yes, so it seems like for me okay so originally I said that"
120.4,Farrah,,Sounds good
120.4,Farrah,," Okay, you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really close"
120.4,Farrah,,I circled equipment and water
120.4,Farrah,,Ice is frozen water
120.4,Farrah,,"Agile Teacher Lab: yeah My answer is, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,harvard
120.4,Farrah,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Farrah,,edu: um scientists used a tool called a microscope to look really closely and a lunar orbiter to investigate
120.4,Farrah,,yeah
120.4,Farrah,,yeah
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay, so I highlighted two things first I highlighted the microscope because I thought that was something that you really mean like would be important"
120.4,Farrah,,"Oh, I think I was going to answer the question before, but actually we have to"
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay, so, basically, I said that initially you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely and then I said"
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay, so I said that no i'm like it like would not be valuable not like, for a long time"
120.4,Farrah,,"Yeah, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay yeah so I said no, not for a long time"
120.4,Farrah,,I said um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.4,Farrah,,harvard
120.4,Farrah,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Farrah,,"edu: yeah sure I said i'm that you'd need, let me look, I think I say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,I'll start
120.4,Farrah,, So I said that  In terms of what it meant it
120.4,Farrah,, Scientists us to discover water
120.4,Farrah,,So we had a disagreement
120.4,Farrah,,yeah
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay, well, I put the Lunar orbiter and then I added that to what I said about the microscope So then, I have two names of equipment and I have looking really closely, which is from the story and evidence is just from the story right"
120.4,Farrah,,I could
120.4,Farrah,,"Well, so this is so fun and interesting but we have to go to lunch"
120.4,Farrah,," I'm really sorry, but thank you so much for letting all of us express our ideas on this question"
120.4,Farrah,,"Well, I don't, I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Farrah,,"yeah Okay, I can go"
120.4,Farrah,,Can I go first
120.4,Farrah,,I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.4,Farrah,,So I thought the key word
120.4,Farrah,," The most important word was equipment, because that Word tells you that you're looking for, like, a tool for your answer"
120.4,Farrah,,"Um, so I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Farrah,,I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.4,Farrah,,The small pieces of ice
120.4,Farrah,,"Oh yeah, sure"
120.4,Farrah,," Okay, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,," Originally, so our, our"
120.4,Farrah,," Okay, so, um, well, we had the same answer"
120.4,Farrah,,"Yeah, yeah"
120.4,Farrah,, We'd love to go first
120.4,Farrah,,"Oh, we can go first"
120.4,Farrah,,"I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay Oliver said, Well, we actually had the same answer, which was that it was the microscope that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope"
120.4,Farrah,, Yeah
120.4,Farrah,,"Yeah, we found those two pieces of equipment"
120.4,Farrah,," The Lunar Orbiter and the microscope, and it also talked about a cup like measuring the water"
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay, so I'm"
120.4,Farrah,,"No, I was done"
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay, so um I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Farrah,,"Um, I said that she would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,harvard
120.4,Farrah,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Farrah,,"edu: Yeah, yeah, in the in the second paragraph, it talks about how NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter"
120.4,Farrah,,"So my my answer was that I thought that they use, they would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so I believe that they use the microscope to find the water"
120.4,Farrah,,Oh yeah absolutely so what I said in the first one was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close
120.4,Farrah,,"Oh yeah sure, so my revised response was that students use the orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water on the moon"
120.4,Farrah,,"yeah Okay, I said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and and I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Farrah,,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, well, I circled two is that okay"
120.4,Farrah,,um yeah so um
120.4,Farrah,,Agile Teacher Lab: Okay yeah I circled you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.4,Farrah,,Oh
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay, so um i'm beginning to think that maybe instead of the microscope it's it's the machine i'm that Jazmin was talking about"
120.4,Farrah,,Well i'm i'm a little confused because I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope in order to look really closely for my answer and I don't understand why my answer is wrong
120.4,Farrah,,Okay yeah um so my answer was that all you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.4,Farrah,,"um yeah well, so my answer is, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,"I said that all scientists know I said, you need a scientific to hold a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay, because I said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Farrah,,"um so I I told Chris, but um you hey we need the microscope total closely because there's not a lot of water it's a very little part of it, because it says microscopic"
120.4,Farrah,,"On Okay, I mean it's kind of like what Oliver said Oh, but cuz at the end, it says like they need to come up with a plan, and it will take a lot of time and a lot of money, do you think you will be a good investment so i'm like Well, no, because it'll take a long time"
120.4,Farrah,,"yeah so um I read that Okay, the water is microscopic and so for the equipment, I said I said, you need a microscope to look at it really closely, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Farrah,,"Well yeah and this goes back to the question that you asked me before Luis interrupted um so well I picked the microscope because they said, the water um it's really small and you can't discover something if it's too small to see you need a microscope"
120.4,Farrah,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Farrah,,harvard
120.4,Farrah,,edu: Is it like on like inference our teacher does say talk about inferences
120.4,Farrah,, to look really closely
120.4,Farrah,,yeah so I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay, so I thought, a word that meant the same thing as equipment with the tool"
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay, mine has the equipment, but not the second part"
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay, so I said that you'd need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,Okay microscope um because they say the water is microscopic and they can't see it without the microscope
120.4,Farrah,,yeah yeah I want to go is that okay
120.4,Farrah,,"yeah so now i'm a little confused because I guess well, I thought it was the microscope but it sounds like maybe Jazmin is correct, so is she right or am I right"
120.4,Farrah,,i'll go
120.4,Farrah,,still kind of confused
120.4,Farrah,,"Okay um so Oh, let me see"
120.4,Farrah,,um yeah my first one was about that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely because I got that one right out of the story
120.4,Farrah,,edu: Ya so I said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.4,Farrah,,harvard
120.4,Farrah,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Farrah,,yeah okay so um I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.4,Farrah,,"Well, I was talking about"
120.4,Farrah,,"um well I guess yeah that's that's similar for me, because I was looking for equipment and I saw the microscope and arm and I was looking for kind of the water on the moon part of it, and I saw that in um in that paragraph three"
120.4,Farrah,,yeah I said microscope was the equipment
120.4,Farrah,,"yeah yeah Okay, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,yeah so basically what I said was that you need a scientific to have a microscope to look really close
120.3,Farrah,,Okay it's what equipment that scientists to use to discover water on the moon
120.3,Farrah,,Oh yeah yeah okay so
120.3,Farrah,,"Oh yeah, sure"
120.3,Farrah,, Okay
120.3,Farrah,, Scientists have found evidence that water can be foudn deep within
120.3,Farrah,, Sorry
120.3,Farrah,, Yes
120.3,Farrah,, Okay
120.3,Farrah,,Oh yeah
120.3,Farrah,, Okay
120.3,Farrah,, Yeah
120.3,Farrah,," Oh, cuz this is where my answer came from"
120.3,Farrah,," Um, okay, we're still in number three"
120.3,Farrah,,"Yeah, sure, sure, sure"
120.3,Farrah,, Okay
120.3,Farrah,,Yeah
120.3,Farrah,," The question is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon"
120.3,Farrah,,That's just a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
120.3,Farrah,,"Oh yeah, I can do that"
120.3,Farrah,,"Um, okay"
120.3,Farrah,, So should I should do the part that I circled
120.3,Farrah,,Is me Farrah
120.3,Farrah,," It says, having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things"
120.3,Farrah,, So is that the right answer
120.3,Farrah,, I see the last sentence kind of after Jazmin and Chris's
120.3,Farrah,,"Okay, so to investigate that was the lunar orbiter right"
120.3,Farrah,,Yeah
120.3,Farrah,," It says, That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth"
120.3,Farrah,,It says that it's really dry
120.3,Farrah,,Oh
120.3,Farrah,, I'll read
120.3,Farrah,, Can I read?
120.3,Farrah,, Scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on earth
120.3,Farrah,,OK
120.3,Farrah,, I see
120.3,Farrah,, OK
120.3,Farrah,,Let me see
120.3,Farrah,,I'm
120.3,Farrah,,We can read super fast
120.3,Farrah,, So we're done
120.3,Farrah,,"So, um, when I read it, I read the thing where it talked about the microscope, because I thought microscope was a tool just like Jazmin"
120.3,Farrah,,"I don't, I don't see what you're seeing"
120.3,Farrah,,"Okay, yeah, yeah"
120.3,Farrah,," Oh, I see that I see"
120.3,Farrah,,Okay
120.3,Farrah,,The question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
120.3,Farrah,,"Yeah, we all have it on our tablets"
120.3,Farrah,,Lunar Orbiter will land at the South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar
120.3,Farrah,,"Um, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon"
120.3,Farrah,,[Reads text to herself quickly]
120.3,Farrah,, NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate
120.3,Farrah,,Okay
120.3,Farrah,," Um, let's see"
120.3,Farrah,, I'm NASA to small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate lunar orbiter south pole for look for ice deposits
120.3,Farrah,,And I repeat it
120.3,Farrah,,NASA sent a small machine to the moon to investigate
120.3,Farrah,,Agile Teacher Lab: um yeah so I sent a microscope That was my answer um so I don't understand why my answer is wrong
120.3,Farrah,,"Okay, I'm"
120.3,Farrah,,Thank you
120.3,Farrah,,Huh
120.3,Farrah,," Yes, it's um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon"
120.3,Farrah,,"Yeah, out loud"
120.3,Farrah,,Yes
120.3,Farrah,," So, so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon"
120.3,Farrah,,"Okay, so the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon"
120.3,Farrah,,Okay
120.3,Farrah,," Um, so the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.3,Farrah,,They I guess they use the Lunar orbiter to discover it
120.3,Farrah,,"yeah it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.3,Farrah,,"yeah Okay, so it says what equipment did scientists use to discover"
120.3,Farrah,,Okay um what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
120.3,Farrah,,I circled it and everything
120.3,Farrah,,"Oh i'm so sorry I really I really want to keep going, but we have to go to lunch now"
120.3,Farrah,,"yeah Okay, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.3,Farrah,,"Can I read it Okay, the second sentence"
120.3,Farrah,,"Okay, it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon"
120.2,Farrah,,"Oh well, I guess, if something is so small that you can't even see it, how can you discover it don't you need to see it"
120.2,Farrah,,Uh huh
120.2,Farrah,,Oh yeah
120.2,Farrah,," Um, so I circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.2,Farrah,,"Well, I don't understand why my answers wrong"
120.2,Farrah,,They said that you need a tool
120.2,Farrah,," Well, this was my answer"
120.2,Farrah,,"Um, yeah, I mean like like Jazmin said out people need to be able to drink water"
120.2,Farrah,, Um so yeah that's valuable
120.2,Farrah,,"Oh, it means that like"
120.2,Farrah,, But before we go to lunch
120.2,Farrah,, I just really wanted to thank you for
120.2,Farrah,," But unfortunately, we do have to go to watch"
120.2,Farrah,,I'm so I'm so sorry
120.2,Farrah,,"Yes, we do"
120.2,Farrah,," OK, so my answer was, you need to see typical color microscope to look really close"
120.2,Farrah,,"Sure, no problem"
120.2,Farrah,,We can go one at a time and give you our answers again
120.2,Farrah,,Have I said that they use the microscope
120.2,Farrah,,"Whoa, I guess I kind of like, Um, no, I just saw the microscope"
120.2,Farrah,,I got my answer
120.2,Farrah,,I said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.2,Farrah,,"yeah yeah so I I thought it was a microscope because I read this part where it says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.2,Farrah,,Okay
120.2,Farrah,,"OK, so the stuff about investigate that makes sense"
120.2,Farrah,,"Agile Teacher Lab: On well, I would still say the same sentence, I said before, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look directly at it"
120.1,Farrah,," Okay, so I had said that you know like you need this microscope in order to look really closely, you know, like at the water"
120.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, sure"
120.1,Farrah,,water
120.1,Farrah,,"Oh, the question says what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon"
120.1,Farrah,,The microscope
120.1,Farrah,,"Oh,"
120.1,Farrah,,"Um, so my answer was, I guess no, that it wasn't very convincing, because kind of like what Oliver said like, we wouldn't be able to use it for space for a long time, you know,"
120.1,Farrah,,Where the water is?
120.1,Farrah,,Valuable means like something that's really important
120.1,Farrah,," Like, um, um, yeah, something that's important"
120.1,Farrah,,And
120.1,Farrah,," Okay, so we should look for I should look for more equipment?"
120.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, because we could"
120.1,Farrah,,I underlined it
120.1,Farrah,," Is it, you know what I mean is it an answer too?"
120.1,Farrah,,Still confused because i i i guess why the microscope
120.1,Farrah,,"Well, I thought that was the correct tool"
120.1,Farrah,,"Oh well i i i had some equipment, but I don't understand why my answers wrong"
120.1,Farrah,,I'll try
120.1,Farrah,, OK
120.1,Farrah,, So the lunar orbiter sends-- the lunar orbiter--
120.1,Farrah,,The water
120.1,Farrah,," So I guess if I was doing this again, maybe I would do what you had to have just do and look back in the question for an action word"
120.1,Farrah,,"Okay, so we used to think it was the microscope, and now we think it's the lunar orbiter because that's the equipment they used to discover"
120.1,Farrah,,I think we're all ready
120.1,Farrah,,um
120.1,Farrah,,Oh um
120.1,Farrah,,Okay
110.4,Farrah,,I just was wondering because it seems like okay so we said equipment
110.4,Farrah,," I was just wondering like why my answer was, was wrong"
110.4,Farrah,, Because I like I feel like microscope is equipment
110.4,Farrah,,"Okay, um, okay, y'all I so I get it because you you you told Oliver what it is, but, I guess I, I don't know like how how you got there"
110.4,Farrah,," Like, I know I can say it, but I don't know how, how um"
110.4,Farrah,,"Um, so what I'm confused though is, is my answer wrong, or is Jazmin's answer wrong? I said the microscope and Jazmin said the lunar orbiter"
110.4,Farrah,,"Um,"
110.4,Farrah,,"Um yeah I wondering like, I think I'm still confused"
110.4,Farrah,, Like why my answer is wrong
110.4,Farrah,, So did they use the microscope
110.4,Farrah,, Okay
110.4,Farrah,, Yeah
110.4,Farrah,," I'm like, it sounds like they used it"
110.4,Farrah,," Yeah, that makes sense"
110.4,Farrah,,Okay
110.4,Farrah,, So I guess
110.4,Farrah,, Did they say they had to do something else before they used the microscope
110.4,Farrah,,"Um, so, unfortunately, unfortunately, we, we have to go to our next class"
110.4,Farrah,," But before we go, I really wanted to thank you"
110.4,Farrah,,I think I already put evidence in my answer too
110.4,Farrah,,To look at the water on the moon?
110.4,Farrah,,"Agile Teacher Lab: Ya there's a sentence It says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's where I found it"
110.4,Farrah,,Okay okay so um I guess i'm still just not sure how the microscope and the Lunar orbiter like how they fit together in the same answer?
110.4,Farrah,,I think equipments an important word
110.4,Farrah,,"um I mean, I guess, we could still use what Luis said Oh well, she said NASA sent a small machine for me, she could say um"
110.4,Farrah,,"yeah well um I said, I said that the answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answers wrong"
110.4,Farrah,,RER: Yeah well I'm still kind of confused
110.3,Farrah,,"Um, so my answer was that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look closely"
110.3,Farrah,,"Um, yeah"
110.3,Farrah,, So I said no
110.3,Farrah,, Okay
110.3,Farrah,,That's great
110.3,Farrah,, Thank you
110.3,Farrah,,"yeah Okay, I only do what you were saying about Jazmin's answer because she didn't say the name of the machine but"
110.2,Farrah,,"Well, it's not wrong"
110.2,Farrah,,But the teacher said that we're all here because we we needed to have a more complete response to the text and have a deeper understanding
110.2,Farrah,, So that's equipment
110.2,Farrah,,"Yeah yeah cuz a microscope is a tool, a scientific tool"
110.2,Farrah,,"Oh, okay, great"
110.2,Farrah,,"Okay, that makes sense"
110.2,Farrah,,Yeah yeah
110.2,Farrah,,"Oh, okay, okay"
110.2,Farrah,,"Um, what equipment did telling us to discover water on the moon"
110.2,Farrah,,I don't remember
110.2,Farrah,," The other thing it was the thing that you said Jazmin it's it's it if you if you can get water up there, then you don't have to take it with you, I guess"
110.2,Farrah,,"Um, I think I began to see, but I'm still kind of confused because so if they use the Lunar Orbiter to to find it, they couldn't see it without the microscope, like they had to go out and look at the crystals, right?"
110.2,Farrah,," So, in paragraph three, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
110.2,Farrah,, Okay
110.2,Farrah,,Oh yeah
110.2,Farrah,, You can't see it without microscope
110.2,Farrah,, So you have to see it
110.2,Farrah,,"Um, well okay so I I'm not really sure why my answer might be wrong, because I think the answer is that the microscope is what they use to to find the water you know what I mean? Tey had to look at the water to see it"
110.2,Farrah,, I think I know what you mean
110.2,Farrah,,"Yeah, definitely"
110.2,Farrah,," So, in paragraph, paragraph three"
110.2,Farrah,,"Yeah, absolutely"
110.2,Farrah,," Um, okay"
110.2,Farrah,, I need them
110.2,Farrah,,"I think so, like, do I need to"
110.2,Farrah,, They need the microscope to see the water or can they see it in another way
110.2,Farrah,, It's just that some answers are
110.2,Farrah,,So no one's answer is wrong
110.2,Farrah,,"I'm wondering, though, because we had to work on it together, is my answer is my answer wrong?"
110.2,Farrah,,"Oh, okay, great"
110.2,Farrah,,But I know that we're here in the group to sort of help with our answers
110.2,Farrah,, But I am not really sure why my answer is wrong
110.2,Farrah,, It seems it is the microscope
110.2,Farrah,,You yeah to look at really small thing
110.2,Farrah,,"Okay, well, I added like a longer answer than Jazmin's one and I, and I said, the name of the equipment in mind so So why is mine wrong"
110.2,Farrah,,Sounds good
110.2,Farrah,,Yeah
110.2,Farrah,,"Okay, I'll work on that"
110.2,Farrah,,Okay
110.2,Farrah,,"Well, I don't know because I thought it was the microscope, because how can you find something if it's too small to see"
110.2,Farrah,,"Oh well, I mean, I guess, I thought they did on"
110.1,Farrah,,"As well Okay, you said, what do they use before the microscope and I guess, I guess, I don't really know I don't understand why my answer is wrong."
110.1,Farrah,,"It would be, you know, like it would take a long time"
110.1,Farrah,," Like, I don't get why is that a wrong answer"
110.1,Farrah,," Let me see, what did I circle okay I circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
110.1,Farrah,,"But, but I actually, I was talking about, like, my answer to the question because cuz I I wrote that"
110.1,Farrah,,"Like, not a lot of it, maybe"
110.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, I think microscope as well"
110.1,Farrah,, And it sounds like yeah i think i and i can prove it from the reading
110.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, because you need it"
110.1,Farrah,, Look really closely
110.1,Farrah,,Yeah
110.1,Farrah,," Well, so I'm still kind of"
110.1,Farrah,,"Um, I actually, I was thinking, based on what you said, I was thinking maybe it was discovered"
110.1,Farrah,,"Okay, gotcha"
110.1,Farrah,," Okay, that makes sense"
110.1,Farrah,," So I guess like I think that Jazmin and I are, so are both of our interest correct or is one of us were correct"
110.1,Farrah,,The microscope
110.1,Farrah,,"Well, I had said-- I answered no"
110.1,Farrah,,I have a question
110.1,Farrah,,"Okay, so, um, I circled the part where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
110.1,Farrah,,Oh yeah I had the same answer as Oliver
110.1,Farrah,,"Okay, so I thought that it's the microscope that discovered the water but um I I don't understand why my answer is wrong because I thought the microscope discovered it, and also the yeah I thought the microscope discovered the water"
110.1,Farrah,," Unfortunately, we have to go to our next class"
110.1,Farrah,, But we wanted to thank you so much for working with us
110.1,Farrah,,And I'm so sorry
110.1,Farrah,, Thank you
110.1,Farrah,, It was really fun to work with
110.1,Farrah,, No
110.1,Farrah,,No
110.1,Farrah,, It was in paragraph 3
110.1,Farrah,, Paragraph 3
110.1,Farrah,,"Okay, the question was, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable"
110.1,Farrah,," So I know that you have to use them, and it says microscopic in the reading, it says that things are really small, so you'd have to use a microscope"
110.1,Farrah,,Yeah
110.1,Farrah,," Um, so when I was looking at, like, when I was looking at the beginning I was thinking like what equipment, the scientists use right and microscope jumped out as, like, I know what I use microscopes in class"
110.1,Farrah,,"Well, that was, I'm sorry"
110.1,Farrah,, This was Farrah
110.1,Farrah,, That was my answer from the beginning
110.1,Farrah,,rocket fuel
110.1,Farrah,,"Oh,"
110.1,Farrah,,Yeah
110.1,Farrah,,I said the same thing like small machine and lunar orbit just in paragraph two
110.1,Farrah,,It was the only equipment in paragraph two
110.1,Farrah,,"Um, yeah, I guess I'm still wondering like, cuz you know we're in the small group to try to help our answers like I guess I'm wondering like why my answer's wrong"
110.1,Farrah,,Go ahead
110.1,Farrah,, I was just gonna Oliver and I have the same answer
110.1,Farrah,, I think that we were still little bit about why he was wrong
110.1,Farrah,,"So I was I'm still I'm still a little confused about why my answer is wrong, but I can't tell you what I was thinking"
110.1,Farrah,," So basically, when I looked at the text like I saw"
110.1,Farrah,,I have a quick question
110.1,Farrah,,"Oh, I don't know"
110.1,Farrah,,"Okay, so it said i'm in the third paragraph the water they found is microscopic you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
110.1,Farrah,,"I circle microscope too, so I don't understand why my answer's wrong"
110.1,Farrah,,harvard
110.1,Farrah,,edu: I don't understand why my answers wrong
110.1,Farrah,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.1,Farrah,,Basically I had to think
110.1,Farrah,, The story said it's so small you can't see it
110.1,Farrah,,"Well, the water on the moon"
110.1,Farrah,," Oh, I remember one thing I remember"
110.1,Farrah,, Because in the text
110.1,Farrah,,And so that's why I thought it was the answer
110.1,Farrah,,Okay
110.1,Farrah,,"Um, well, my, my full answer is you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
110.1,Farrah,,"Yeah, exactly"
110.1,Farrah,, So it says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money
110.1,Farrah,," And it's still from the text, there's still evidence"
110.1,Farrah,, So I was thinking something a little different
110.1,Farrah,,"Oh, okay"
110.1,Farrah,, So I think that
110.1,Farrah,,"um, well Okay, so it sounds like the Lunar orbiter can find really small things"
110.1,Farrah,,i'm still confused
110.1,Farrah,,"Oh, I said that you need well I kind of cuz I thought that maybe my answer itself was Okay, so I just scratched out the microscope and put in the Lunar orbiter you need a scientific tool, called the Lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon"
110.1,Farrah,,um
110.1,Farrah,,I said discover
110.1,Farrah,,yeah actually I circled of equipment
110.1,Farrah,,"Oh Oh, I thought you could only have one answer"
110.1,Farrah,,i'm like something something you use to do something
110.1,Farrah,,yeah yeah that's what I said
110.1,Farrah,,"um I don't understand why our answer is wrong, why is microscope wrong"
110.1,Farrah,,"yeah Thank you so, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch I just want to say that I know that our time was really short"
150.1,h,, Right
150.1,h,,"Um, yeah, you said that I was right on when I was talking about the water, but I didn't talk about the equipment"
150.1,Jazmin,,um yeah but I did that
150.1,Jazmin,," Um the first part, the first sentence in paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine"
150.1,Jazmin,,"Well, um, I"
150.1,Jazmin,, It's me Jazmin
150.1,Jazmin,, I said that they used a small machine that was my answer
150.1,Jazmin,,"Um, I mean, I guess so"
150.1,Jazmin,, I guess
150.1,Jazmin,, And I think that we just wanted to share
150.1,Jazmin,, But before we go to lunch
150.1,Jazmin,, So we have to go to lunch
150.1,Jazmin,,I know I think that we all understand
150.1,Jazmin,,"I watch sometimes umthis cartoon with a police dog, and he's always investigating crimes"
150.1,Jazmin,,Orbiter
150.1,Jazmin,,"Excuse me, but I still don't understand why my answer is wrong"
150.1,Jazmin,,"Yeah, so I just have to add the name of it"
150.1,Jazmin,, And then my answers fine?
150.1,Jazmin,,"Jazmin, do you know how scientists discovered water on the moon?"
150.1,Jazmin,, Ever since you were
150.1,Jazmin,," We were talking, I was just wonder, like, I guess"
150.1,Jazmin,,I guess
150.1,Jazmin,," Still not sure like my, my answer"
150.1,Jazmin,,Can you say it again
150.1,Jazmin,,And the Lunar Orbiter?
150.1,Jazmin,,I just have to add called lunar orbiter?
150.1,Jazmin,,"Well, I think it means something really small"
150.1,Jazmin,,I think so
150.1,Jazmin,,It says in the reading that you need NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
150.1,Jazmin,, So the lunar orbiter must be this small machine
150.1,Jazmin,, So thank you so much for working with us
150.1,Jazmin,,It's time for the next group
150.1,Jazmin,,Okay
150.1,Jazmin,,"Yeah, yeah, I think I got it"
150.1,Jazmin,,"Well, I guess"
150.1,Jazmin,,"Well, I don't understand why my answers wrong, um, cuz I pull mine from the text to"
150.1,Jazmin,,Okay
150.1,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Jazmin,,"edu: Oh, I thought we were here cuz our our answers weren't weren't right"
150.1,Jazmin,,harvard
150.1,Jazmin,,Okay
150.1,Jazmin,, I think
150.1,Jazmin,,I think so
150.1,Jazmin,,"I have to, I have to write more stuff in my answer"
150.1,Jazmin,,yeah it makes sense to use that I have to use it okay
150.1,Jazmin,,"Well Okay, I think I did what what Oliver and Farrah didn't do is I answered the question I said yes, and then I also did the thing, where I I I pulled the evidence from the text, so I guess I don't know why mine is wrong"
150.1,Jazmin,,"Um,"
150.1,Jazmin,,"No, that makes sense"
150.1,Jazmin,," So like I should just say like in detail, like what it was"
150.1,Jazmin,,harvard
150.1,Jazmin,,edu: So NASA to smell machine
150.1,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Jazmin,,"edu: Well cuz, you said that So the answer was a good answer, but my answer was completely different and and no offense but she like only wrote a few words and I wrote like a lot of words, because you told us to expand our answers but they're different"
150.1,Jazmin,,harvard
150.1,Jazmin,, Thank you
150.1,Jazmin,,"Oh yeah, I think that makes a lot more sense"
150.1,Jazmin,,yeah
150.1,Jazmin,,"So after, I have to write more stuff"
150.1,Jazmin,,"I don't understand why my, my answers wrong"
150.1,Jazmin,,"Okay, let me look again so"
150.1,Jazmin,,yeah I think so
150.1,Jazmin,,"Yeah, I guess that's a few less words"
150.1,Jazmin,, Okay
150.1,Jazmin,, Because I added more words
150.1,Jazmin,,I'm good
150.1,Jazmin,," Yeah, the microscope"
150.1,Jazmin,,You need a - oh the miscroscope
150.1,Jazmin,,Still kind of confused
150.1,Jazmin,,"yeah yeah it does so, so, then I, my answer is right, I just"
150.1,Jazmin,," Wait actually what was wrong with my answer, because you, you said that I did good because I answered the question and I said yes"
150.1,Jazmin,,harvard
150.1,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Jazmin,,edu: i'm still kind of confused
150.1,Jazmin,,"I got my part in paragraph two, I just didn't say the name of the machine, but I had it"
150.1,Jazmin,,"Oh no, not really"
150.1,Jazmin,, I just added more details
150.1,Jazmin,,"Chris Chris, and he said, scientists found craters full of water on the moon"
150.1,Jazmin,,Like in an English class
150.1,Jazmin,,"Yes, we do"
150.1,Jazmin,,yeah
150.1,Jazmin,,Great
150.1,Jazmin,,yeah yeah I think it makes my answer more complete yeah just like you said
150.1,Jazmin,,"um yeah so I picked I picked something different from Farrah so i'm wondering, because I said NASA send a small machine and I thought that the small machine seemed really important"
150.1,Jazmin,,Agile Teacher Lab: I can read it
150.1,Jazmin,,"Oh, the small machine"
150.1,Jazmin,,harvard
150.1,Jazmin,,edu: Okay
150.1,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Jazmin,,"Oh well, cuz you told me that at the name of it, so I just added the name of it, I didn't add anymore after that"
140.1,Jazmin,,"No no, he goes around and he looks for clues and then he talks to people"
140.1,Jazmin,," Um, yeah, to kind of find it out"
140.1,Jazmin,, And so we might have to live on Mars or something if they keep destroying our Earth
140.1,Jazmin,,"Well, I don't know a lot about space, but I know that our environment is really bad"
140.1,Jazmin,," Oh, wow"
140.1,Jazmin,,Huh
140.1,Jazmin,, That's pretty cool
140.1,Jazmin,,"No, I meant on the story"
140.1,Jazmin,, But I told her that I think that I have the right answer
140.1,Jazmin,," My teacher said that we all had to come and work with you in a small group, because we needed more help with our answers"
140.1,Jazmin,,I guess they'd have to bring the plants with them to plant on the moon
140.1,Jazmin,,I like that movie
140.1,Jazmin,," You can't survive without water, having water on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft, water is heavy"
140.1,Jazmin,, So I can say I should ask and drink the water
140.1,Jazmin,,"Um, okay"
140.1,Jazmin,,"OK, I see it says that NASA scientists small machine called a lunar orbiter"
140.1,Jazmin,, We'll just get more gas
140.1,Jazmin,,No
140.1,Jazmin,,"Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but"
140.1,Jazmin,,"Yes, I love to garden and I love to be in nature"
140.1,Jazmin,,"Yes, I would say I would say I was surprised"
140.1,Jazmin,,"Yes, I can share"
140.1,Jazmin,,I mean i'd like to live on the moon
140.1,Jazmin,,"um okay I don't know exactly, but I think that the moon doesn't have like an atmosphere that you know, like"
140.1,Jazmin,,You mean like spacesuits?
140.1,Jazmin,,"um well, I mean, I guess, I wouldn't die, but I wouldn't want to like you know, like live in a space suit, like all the time, that would be like really uncomfortable"
140.1,Jazmin,,"Yes, I do"
140.1,Jazmin,,and Spanish word for me is Luna
140.1,Jazmin,,"Yes, yes"
140.1,Jazmin,,I don't know it's kind of amazing to think about
140.1,Jazmin,,detectives
140.1,Jazmin,,"Yes, yes, we have"
140.1,Jazmin,,"And since there's water on the moon, maybe because you use equipment like gardening equipment and they could make a moon garden, so that we could grow food"
140.1,Jazmin,,I would rather stay here on earth and focus on protecting the earth
140.1,Jazmin,,"yeah well, we need to plant more trees to save the forests and we need to protect our oceans, by not dumping trash and by making sure that we recycle"
130.3,Jazmin,,"Um, but, okay, well, I don't understand what, why [my answer] is wrong"
130.3,Jazmin,,"Oh, okay, well, okay, now I know the answer"
130.3,Jazmin,, Ice is just frozen water right?
130.3,Jazmin,,"I don't understand because it says, Oh, what did they use to discover the water"
130.3,Jazmin,," And so, in paragraph two, they talk all about like looking for the ice deposits, and we we learned in science class that ice and water, are the same thing"
130.3,Jazmin,,"Okay, let me see"
130.3,Jazmin,,"Okay, okay"
130.3,Jazmin,,Reach Every ReadeR: So my answer---
130.3,Jazmin,,So is my answer wrong or is it like sort of right?
130.3,Jazmin,, Okay
130.3,Jazmin,,Okay
130.3,Jazmin,, That makes sense
130.3,Jazmin,,Orbiter
130.3,Jazmin,,So I would say yes it's valuable because you need water to drink
130.3,Jazmin,,"Yeah, that's a good point"
130.3,Jazmin,, I didn't think of how the heck
130.3,Jazmin,,So we have to go to our next class that is so much for working with us
130.3,Jazmin,,"So, is that just what I was missing was just the name of it?"
130.3,Jazmin,," I said that NASA since the small machine, but I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
130.3,Jazmin,,That's close to my idea cuz I said in my answer
130.3,Jazmin,," See, I said that, yes, that the water would be valuable"
130.3,Jazmin,, So astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water
130.3,Jazmin,,Yes
130.3,Jazmin,, And the reason that I said that
130.3,Jazmin,, Okay
130.3,Jazmin,," And so what I was looking at, basically, I wasn't a paragraph four, and they were saying that"
130.3,Jazmin,," Yeah, OK, I see that"
130.3,Jazmin,,Oh Yeah
130.3,Jazmin,," OK, I see that one right there"
130.3,Jazmin,,"yeah Okay, I see that right there"
130.3,Jazmin,,RER: I have to write more words?
130.3,Jazmin,,"Oh OK OK, I understand okay"
130.3,Jazmin,,"Oh, wow, ok"
130.3,Jazmin,,Oh so just have to add the name in there too
130.3,Jazmin,,Oh okay
130.3,Jazmin,,And so I just had to say lunar orbiter?
130.2,Jazmin,,I just need to write something down
130.2,Jazmin,,Is it the one that I said that we were just talking about the Lunar Orbiter
130.2,Jazmin,,I don't know either if the moon is wet or dry
130.2,Jazmin,,"Um, well, I think, yeah, like he knows a lot about space and she knows a lot about stuff"
130.2,Jazmin,," So Luis, then you should just like even I mean you should just share with us what you think like your background"
130.2,Jazmin,,"What I said was, it, it was a small machine"
130.2,Jazmin,,"well, we can't quiet do the thumbs, but we could do raised hands if we agree and then no raise hands if we disagree, is that okay?"
130.2,Jazmin,, OK
130.2,Jazmin,,OK
130.2,Jazmin,,"Yes, I see"
130.2,Jazmin,,"For example, future astronauts could drink this water"
130.2,Jazmin,,"  You can drink it and do other stuff, right?"
130.2,Jazmin,, That's the small machine
130.2,Jazmin,,"Okay, let me look"
130.2,Jazmin,, It's the lunar orbiter Chris
130.2,Jazmin,, I don't remember
130.2,Jazmin,, That's a small machine called a lunar orbiter
130.2,Jazmin,,We also use it in science class to
130.2,Jazmin,, I think that it's the machine
130.2,Jazmin,,"Okay, so like I don't really think that it's the microscope"
130.2,Jazmin,," And the reason that I think that is that it, it talks about like using that to investigate and that sounds like the like the thing that the question, like discover, what it does"
130.2,Jazmin,, The Lunar Orbiter
130.2,Jazmin,," I circled equipment, and then discover, then I looked at the text, I also circled, in paragraph two, investigate"
130.2,Jazmin,,"I was trying to figure out why my answer was wrong, and when I looked at it"
130.2,Jazmin,, So the word that I circled I circled keywords in the question
130.2,Jazmin,,"I said  the small machine, but I'm not quite sure why my answer is wrong"
130.2,Jazmin,,"Basically, what I thought is its a small machine"
130.2,Jazmin,, I circled small machine and Lunar Orbiter
130.2,Jazmin,,I circled two
130.2,Jazmin,,Okay um So the first one that I see is the small machine
130.2,Jazmin,,"Ok, all, what do you see"
130.2,Jazmin,,Agile Teacher Lab: They sent the small machine
130.2,Jazmin,, I don't know why my answer is wrong
130.2,Jazmin,,"Well, I put in my answer that NASA sent a small machine"
130.2,Jazmin,,It was lunar orbiter
130.2,Jazmin,,They said that NASA sent a small machine
130.2,Jazmin,,"I mean, I think it might be cool to go to space"
130.2,Jazmin,," And that'll make it too easy for everybody on earth to just, you know, like"
130.2,Jazmin,, But I feel like if we make it too easy to go to space
130.2,Jazmin,,harvard
130.2,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.2,Jazmin,,edu: Still don't understand why my answers wrong
130.2,Jazmin,,edu: said yes actually that's can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water
130.2,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.2,Jazmin,,harvard
130.2,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.2,Jazmin,,"edu: I wrote about curing it, but I guess you can't that's not what it's used for"
130.2,Jazmin,,harvard
130.2,Jazmin,,harvard
130.2,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.2,Jazmin,,edu: I don't understand I don't understand why my answer is wrong
130.2,Jazmin,,"um well when I was reading the story, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate"
130.2,Jazmin,, The Lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so the Lunar orbiter it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
130.2,Jazmin,,"Well, to find the water NASA send a small machine"
130.2,Jazmin,,Yes
130.2,Jazmin,,"Yes, Chris"
130.2,Jazmin,,"Um, well, I think it looks for the for the water"
130.2,Jazmin,,Maybe
130.2,Jazmin,,"I said that that's the scientists NASA center small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
130.2,Jazmin,,Discover
130.2,Jazmin,,"Okay, well, I said NASA send a small machine, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
130.2,Jazmin,,"um yeah and then you told me to to add more specific stuff to my answer, so I found a little more, and I would add that the machine is called a lunar orbiter and they use it to investigate"
130.2,Jazmin,,yeah um my answer is NASA sent a small machine
130.2,Jazmin,,"Oh well, Okay, I said that NASA sent a small machine"
130.2,Jazmin,,"um yeah so my answer was that NASA Center small machine head, so I don't understand why my answers room"
130.2,Jazmin,,"Yes, yes"
130.2,Jazmin,,"Yes, can I try and"
130.2,Jazmin,,harvard
130.2,Jazmin,,"edu: I have a different answer, but I think that they they did use it to look closely at the water"
130.2,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.2,Jazmin,,harvard
130.2,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.2,Jazmin,,"edu: Well Okay, so I do think it's used to look at the water on the moon, but I guess, I had a different answer so i'm not sure either um"
130.2,Jazmin,,"edu: It looks for, um I was gonna say the same thing, it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater um"
130.2,Jazmin,,harvard
130.2,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.2,Jazmin,,"Yes, I had a different answer"
130.2,Jazmin,,yeah
130.2,Jazmin,,Well it's kind of wondering that because I don't understand why my answer is wrong
130.1,Jazmin,," Okay, so the answer is, is it's called a lunar orbiter?"
130.1,Jazmin,,Um
130.1,Jazmin,,Okay
130.1,Jazmin,,A better word?
130.1,Jazmin,,"Okay, gotcha"
130.1,Jazmin,,But I can do that
130.1,Jazmin,,Yeah
130.1,Jazmin,,"Okay, so I just have to add more at the name and stuff to it"
130.1,Jazmin,,So I was gonna say us with the machine was and I was gonna say the machine is the Lunar Orbiter
130.1,Jazmin,,"Oh, yeah"
130.1,Jazmin,,Oh OK
130.1,Jazmin,,"Yeah, I think my answer is right, so I don't know why my answer is wrong"
130.1,Jazmin,," So, um,"
130.1,Jazmin,,"Um, yes"
130.1,Jazmin,,ya it's on my tablet
130.1,Jazmin,,"um yeah well i'm still not totally sure, because I know me and Farrah we were thinking about the microscope because if the ice is so small, how are you going to find it if you can't even see ya"
130.1,Jazmin,,"yeah well that was that was gonna be my question because I mean I picked the small machine and and I understand also microscope is in there, but I don't think I would have thought to put oxygen tanks because it's not really in the story so am I wrong if I don't say that?"
130.1,Jazmin,,yeah that makes sense
120.4,Jazmin,,"Okay, well, I said that NASA send a small machine"
120.4,Jazmin,,"So, so I just need to circle, then maybe I just need to circle lunar orbiter?"
120.4,Jazmin,,NASA sent a small machine
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yes, in the way that I underlined was well action like two words"
120.4,Jazmin,, Equipment and discover
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yeah, I said the lunar orbiter because it says, and NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yeah, I guess, the thing that I had was that I was kind of confused about why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Jazmin,,Then I don't know why my answer is wrong
120.4,Jazmin,, Because I said a small machine and they asked about equipment
120.4,Jazmin,, So I couldn't have said a small machine to discover water on the moon
120.4,Jazmin,,I guess put more of the question in my answer
120.4,Jazmin,,I don't understand why is my answer is wrong
120.4,Jazmin,,I am convinced that they used the lunar orbiter
120.4,Jazmin,," And I think that that's like, because that's the small machine that they set and unfortunately"
120.4,Jazmin,,What I said was that scientists is used a small machine
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yeah, I thought it was a small machine"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Okay, so I said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated"
120.4,Jazmin,, You can't survive without water
120.4,Jazmin,,"So basically we said like, what was that we talked about the different machines that people would say, okay, people would use"
120.4,Jazmin,,To be connected with that they use a small machine
120.4,Jazmin,," And then when I was reading, I said NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter"
120.4,Jazmin,,So I said that NASA sent a small machine
120.4,Jazmin,, You can't survive without water
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yeah, so my answer was that yes there's convincing evidence because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated"
120.4,Jazmin,," Is it the answer to the question, or like, why are you"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Um, to basically we"
120.4,Jazmin,," Also, you could use the order that they have and you could grow a garden all over the moon"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Oh yeah, I think it would be really because astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Um,"
120.4,Jazmin,,Yeah so i said NASA sent a small machine
120.4,Jazmin,, I saw that in paragraph two NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yeah, okay I think so, when we were rereading"
120.4,Jazmin,, I think I had the right answer
120.4,Jazmin,,Good
120.4,Jazmin,, So why am I in this group
120.4,Jazmin,, I said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated
120.4,Jazmin,, You can't survive without water and and that's true and they talk about in the first paragraph that astronauts could drink the water
120.4,Jazmin,,"Well I was thinking that you could use water to grow things, so that we could have like a garden, can you imagine how beautiful it woud be?"
120.4,Jazmin,," Um, my answer was that NASA send to small machine"
120.4,Jazmin,,"says we can't lift up our tablets off the desk, but we can meet them"
120.4,Jazmin,,Yeah
120.4,Jazmin,," Um, so this is"
120.4,Jazmin,, It's just that I found the rest of the sentence
120.4,Jazmin,,"Oh, it wasn't a question"
120.4,Jazmin,," And that was what was like, what found all the water"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Basically, NASA sent this small machine"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yes, i was going to say investigate"
120.4,Jazmin,,I said that I used to small machine
120.4,Jazmin,,"Well, I just, I mean, I do think there's convincing evidence because like they could drink the water and they could stay hydrated and you need water"
120.4,Jazmin,, So that seems to be convincing the have water
120.4,Jazmin,,I said they could drink it
120.4,Jazmin,, So basically what I said was that that NASA used a small machine
120.4,Jazmin,,Sure
120.4,Jazmin,, And that's like the machine that they sent to the moon
120.4,Jazmin,,So they used the lunar orbiter to investigate
120.4,Jazmin,, And so we have to go in just a moment
120.4,Jazmin,," But before we went, I just wanted to thank you for"
120.4,Jazmin,,So they used the Lunar Orbiter to discover water
120.4,Jazmin,,So I think they sent a small machine
120.4,Jazmin,, And it's called a lunar orbiter
120.4,Jazmin,,I think they use the small machine machine
120.4,Jazmin,, I think that's what they used to discover the water
120.4,Jazmin,,It's called a lunar orbiter
120.4,Jazmin,,"Number two, which is, which one do you mean number"
120.4,Jazmin,,"No, I'm ready to answer"
120.4,Jazmin,,"I circled the same thing, small machine"
120.4,Jazmin,,It said that
120.4,Jazmin,, I think that the most important word is discover because like finding it
120.4,Jazmin,,"Okay, yes"
120.4,Jazmin,,Teacher
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yeah, I was this, I said yes"
120.4,Jazmin,,Well I guess
120.4,Jazmin,,"Basically, I wasn't quite sure about microscopic"
120.4,Jazmin,," I think I know what it means, but I wasn't totally sure"
120.4,Jazmin,,Who would you like to go?
120.4,Jazmin,,"Okay, so basically, the first thing I was gonna say is that I'm still a little bit confused"
120.4,Jazmin,, And I think what I'm confused about is how Like how we can make sure that our answers are complete
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yeah, we have to go to lunch"
120.4,Jazmin,,I said yes
120.4,Jazmin,, You can't survive without water
120.4,Jazmin,," And I said, the astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated"
120.4,Jazmin,, You can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon
120.4,Jazmin,,"Well, I was thinking about the water can use"
120.4,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Jazmin,,harvard
120.4,Jazmin,,"edu: Hmm okay let's see, I wrote, Yes, I astronauts should stay and drink the water and stay hydrated oh like how you said you can't survive without water"
120.4,Jazmin,,Do you want to hear mine?
120.4,Jazmin,,You want me to share now
120.4,Jazmin,,"Um,"
120.4,Jazmin,,yeah so I said
120.4,Jazmin,,So actually fortunately it's time for us to
120.4,Jazmin,,Can I ask a quick question?
120.4,Jazmin,,Agile Teacher Lab: I said NASA centers small machine
120.4,Jazmin,,"And oh gosh, I don't even remember what the question was now"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yeah, I said that NASA found a small machine"
120.4,Jazmin,, And that's the same thing
120.4,Jazmin,, Farrah just said
120.4,Jazmin,,yeah yeah
120.4,Jazmin,,"yeah what I said was that, yes, it's it is"
120.4,Jazmin,,yeah I said I said to small machine and I don't understand why my answers wrong
120.4,Jazmin,,I was just when
120.4,Jazmin,,"yeah, so basically my response was that water is valuble because astronauts keep drinking water,"
120.4,Jazmin,,"and see what I said was asking I say yes, that is valuable because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated"
120.4,Jazmin,,Excuse me teacher i'm still confused
120.4,Jazmin,,"Okay, so I said NASA send a small machine"
120.4,Jazmin,,edu: I said NASA sent a small machine
120.4,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Jazmin,,harvard
120.4,Jazmin,,The lunar orbiter
120.4,Jazmin,,Okay
120.4,Jazmin,,i'm still kind of confused
120.4,Jazmin,,I guess I don't know which evidence i'm supposed to be looking for
120.4,Jazmin,,That NASA sent a small machine
120.4,Jazmin,,"Um, so I was thinking you could use water to grow things and we can have a moon garden a garden on the moon"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Scientists used a small machine to discover the water and I found the answer in paragraph two,"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Okay, so, um, Chris, I agree, partly like yes, it's definitely about water on the moon, but I think it's also about how there's not a lot of water on the moon"
120.4,Jazmin,," Like, it's only on these really small little bits"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yeah, actually, maybe I can help Chris, because my word that I picked was discover"
120.4,Jazmin,, I'm going to read too
120.4,Jazmin,,"Oh no, no question"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Well, I think that it's"
120.4,Jazmin,,So I said that NASA send a small machine
120.4,Jazmin,, So I listened to the facts and I still don't understand why my answer is wrong
120.4,Jazmin,, I said that NASA scientists small machine
120.4,Jazmin,,Here
120.4,Jazmin,, Yeah
120.4,Jazmin,,"I'm ready, I'm ready to go"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yeah, I can share"
120.4,Jazmin,," And I found more details in part two, which is where my answer came from"
120.4,Jazmin,,"So, you told me to look again and see if I can add more details to my answer"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Okay, so you said, I have to look for more detail"
120.4,Jazmin,, So first it said that it was called the Lunar Orbiter and then also it said it looked for the ice deposits and the craters
120.4,Jazmin,," And so I found about this machine, a few things"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Okay, my answer is that NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Well, I have a few things to say"
120.4,Jazmin,," So my first answer was, it was"
120.4,Jazmin,,Well I can share
120.4,Jazmin,,Oh yeah we did ciz we took a look and say we
120.4,Jazmin,,Farrah
120.4,Jazmin,," I know you said equipment, and I think that's important"
120.4,Jazmin,," But actually, I think the more important word is actually discover"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yes, I said that necessity"
120.4,Jazmin,," A small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Okay, so I think the most important part of the question is evidence"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Well, I think you can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Okay, well, I said that, yes, I sent a small machine and don't understand why my answers wrong"
120.4,Jazmin,,Yes
120.4,Jazmin,,just to ask um Farrah What was your revised answer
120.4,Jazmin,,And it's it's asking us to find an equipment
120.4,Jazmin,,I said that NASA send a small machine
120.4,Jazmin,,I said NASA sent a small machine
120.4,Jazmin,,but the teacher didn't say that you had the right answer Oliver
120.4,Jazmin,,um
120.4,Jazmin,,um
120.4,Jazmin,,That NASA sent a small machine
120.4,Jazmin,,"I would use the small machine that NASA sent, and I would use it to get the samples that you need to find the water"
120.4,Jazmin,,yeah I said masses into small machine
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yes, I said NASA send a small machine"
120.4,Jazmin,,"I would say that's a kind of medium because well my answer was the small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong, why am I in this group"
120.4,Jazmin,,Okay it's called a lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposits
120.4,Jazmin,,"If there's water on the moon,"
120.4,Jazmin,,"I was thinking, maybe discover"
120.4,Jazmin,,um okay i'll go cuz I don't understand why my answer is wrong
120.4,Jazmin,,"Okay, I said NASA send a small machine and I think that's right"
120.4,Jazmin,,um NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
120.4,Jazmin,," Okay, so the astronauts went to the moon"
120.4,Jazmin,,ym yeah I can try and put this all together
120.4,Jazmin,,"Okay, I said NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Jazmin,,Agile Teacher Lab: okay
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yes, and I said NASA sent a small machine"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Okay, so I said, my answer was NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Jazmin,,"I said equipment, I said equipment to"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Okay, so I said yes, I said NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Jazmin,,I say
120.4,Jazmin,,I don't understand why my answers wrong
120.4,Jazmin,,yeah I said NASA send a small machine
120.4,Jazmin,,um yeah I don't understand why why my answers wrong
120.4,Jazmin,,yeah I said scientists sent a small machine out NASA sent a small machine
120.4,Jazmin,,"Okay um so he said, NASA"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Oh yeah the water scientists found on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter was microscopic"
120.4,Jazmin,,"And so I circled small machine, my answer is NASA Center small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Jazmin,,"Yes, well, I said NASA send a small machine"
120.4,Jazmin,,edu: yeah okay um
120.4,Jazmin,,harvard
120.4,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Jazmin,,edu: yeah
120.4,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Jazmin,,harvard
120.4,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Jazmin,,"edu: I said before, a conversation I said NASA send a small machine, but now I see that"
120.4,Jazmin,,harvard
120.4,Jazmin,,"OK, so my answer is NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.4,Jazmin,,But I guess I don't understand why my answers wrong
120.3,Jazmin,,"yeah, I would like to because this is where I found my answer it says"
120.3,Jazmin,,"Okay, okay, but didn't I--"
120.3,Jazmin,,Yeah
120.3,Jazmin,," Um, okay"
120.3,Jazmin,," will, in total 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day"
120.3,Jazmin,, The Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater nice ice deposits are very small st to set that one top of the top layer of the surface
120.3,Jazmin,,"Yeah, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar to investigate"
120.3,Jazmin,,Okay
120.3,Jazmin,,It says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
120.3,Jazmin,,Yeah sure
120.3,Jazmin,, These ice deposits are very small
120.3,Jazmin,,Jazmin: That's where I got my answer from
120.3,Jazmin,, It takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things
120.3,Jazmin,,"Okay, I'm water is heavy"
120.3,Jazmin,, This lunar orbiter will land at the South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
120.3,Jazmin,, Should I keep reading
120.3,Jazmin,, NASA sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate
120.3,Jazmin,,Sure
120.3,Jazmin,, Okay
120.3,Jazmin,," I said, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated"
120.3,Jazmin,, Okay
120.3,Jazmin,,Cuz my answer
120.3,Jazmin,, You can't survive without water
120.3,Jazmin,, And then in the paragraph number four
120.3,Jazmin,, It says future astronauts could drink this water
120.3,Jazmin,, NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Obriter to investigate
120.3,Jazmin,,Let's see
120.3,Jazmin,, I can read paragraph 2
120.3,Jazmin,,Yeah
120.3,Jazmin,,My answer came from paragraph two
120.3,Jazmin,, I still don't understand why my answers wrong
120.3,Jazmin,,"Okay, so in paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate"
120.3,Jazmin,,"Reach Every Reader:Okay, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon"
120.3,Jazmin,, Number three
120.3,Jazmin,,Sure
120.3,Jazmin,, Okay
120.3,Jazmin,,"Okay, well I got my answer from paragraph to I don't know what's wrong with mine"
120.3,Jazmin,,"Okay, it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon"
120.3,Jazmin,,"Well, I was just when you say I wasn't sure why"
120.3,Jazmin,, This is that a good answer
120.3,Jazmin,,"I will, I will just be about, like, I was wondering if this was maybe the answer is NASA use a small machine to get to the water"
120.3,Jazmin,," The water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific to call the microscope to look really closely"
120.3,Jazmin,, That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
120.3,Jazmin,,"So, let's see paragraph three"
120.3,Jazmin,,"The lunar orbiter, in paragraph twol"
120.3,Jazmin,,Um
120.3,Jazmin,,NASA small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
120.3,Jazmin,,yeah
120.3,Jazmin,,"Yes, out loud"
120.3,Jazmin,,"Okay, the second sentence on this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit handle large polar crater"
120.3,Jazmin,,NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate
120.3,Jazmin,,yeah it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter line at the south Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater
120.3,Jazmin,,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
120.3,Jazmin,,"Yes, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate"
120.3,Jazmin,,go right ahead
120.3,Jazmin,,harvard
120.3,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.3,Jazmin,,edu: I understand why my answer is wrong
120.3,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.3,Jazmin,,harvard
120.3,Jazmin,,edu: Oh yeah I could I could write the whole sentence nasa's into small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate that is that right
120.3,Jazmin,,edu: What equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
120.3,Jazmin,,harvard
120.3,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.3,Jazmin,,RER: NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
120.3,Jazmin,,It says NASA such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
120.3,Jazmin,,Is lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
120.2,Jazmin,,"Yes, I think it was a small machine"
120.2,Jazmin,, And what is valuable because you need it to drink
120.2,Jazmin,,"Well, um, it says that there's water on the moon"
120.2,Jazmin,,"Yeah, I think so"
120.2,Jazmin,,A scientist sent the orbiter to discover water on the moon
120.2,Jazmin,,"Yes, we did, we all, yeah"
120.2,Jazmin,,A small machine
120.2,Jazmin,,Excuse me
120.2,Jazmin,,Yeah
120.2,Jazmin,,"Okay Luis It says, NASA send the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate"
120.2,Jazmin,,i'm
120.2,Jazmin,,To find water on the moon?
120.2,Jazmin,,I don't understand why my answer is wrong
120.2,Jazmin,,"Agile Teacher Lab: yeah and so i'm just wondering, because I know that's the question and my answer was NASA send a small machine and X equipment and I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.2,Jazmin,,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, I got NASA sent a small machine and I found my evidence at the beginning of paragraph two"
120.2,Jazmin,,"and wait I just so with with my answer about the machine, why what- I still don't get why I was wrong"
120.2,Jazmin,, I said NASA sent a small machine
120.2,Jazmin,,I forgot again oh man hold on
120.2,Jazmin,,get them on
120.2,Jazmin,,yeah I said NASA sent a small machine
120.1,Jazmin,,"Oh, oh, I didn't even I didn't actually say that they said, I just said that they sent a small machine"
120.1,Jazmin,,Me? What do I think?
120.1,Jazmin,, Okay
120.1,Jazmin,, I'm not really sure
120.1,Jazmin,,Number three
120.1,Jazmin,,I wasn't sure
120.1,Jazmin,," Like, why my answer was wrong"
120.1,Jazmin,,"Like, what is the machine?"
120.1,Jazmin,,Small machine is it's called a lunar orbiter
120.1,Jazmin,,"Well, I was wondering"
120.1,Jazmin,,"Ah I'm sorry, Mr"
120.1,Jazmin,," I don't understand why my answers wrong, too"
120.1,Jazmin,, Teacher
120.1,Jazmin,,Because it would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things
120.1,Jazmin,,Yet so basically so and Luis was sharing his answer about how water can be split into two parts into oxygen and hydrogen
120.1,Jazmin,,The principal doesn't like us to do thumbs up
120.1,Jazmin,,Excuse me
120.1,Jazmin,,Water is a valuable resource
120.1,Jazmin,,"Yeah, I think that we would need the small machine that they sent up into space and I think, I guess I'm confused, like why is my answer wrong?"
120.1,Jazmin,,"Well, I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
120.1,Jazmin,,I circled equipment
120.1,Jazmin,,"How did you know that we should put the microscopic part in the answer remember when I was saying, like i'm trying to figure out"
120.1,Jazmin,,What?
120.1,Jazmin,,well
110.4,Jazmin,,RER: It is a lunar orbiter
110.4,Jazmin,,Yeah
110.4,Jazmin,,Fortunate we have to go to our next class
110.4,Jazmin,, It was really fun to work with
110.4,Jazmin,, Thank you
110.4,Jazmin,," But before we go, I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us"
110.4,Jazmin,, This was really interesting
110.4,Jazmin,," like, why my answer is wrong"
110.4,Jazmin,,I'm still looking
110.4,Jazmin,,"Well,"
110.4,Jazmin,,"And I just, I'm still kind of confused about how to how to structure the answer so that it's a better answer"
110.4,Jazmin,,I was thinking discover
110.4,Jazmin,,Great
110.4,Jazmin,,Okay
110.4,Jazmin,, So I think that's what they said discovered the water
110.4,Jazmin,,"That's what, that's what I think cuz is like investigate's like discover"
110.4,Jazmin,,Which unfortunately we have to go to our next class
110.4,Jazmin,, Thank you so much
110.4,Jazmin,," But before we go, I just wanted to thank you for working with us a lot of fun"
110.4,Jazmin,,"Um, that future astronauts could drink the water"
110.4,Jazmin,,"Well, I guess, I'm not sure, I guess think about it"
110.4,Jazmin,,Ice deposits
110.4,Jazmin,,Good split it in two parts
110.4,Jazmin,,"Oh, OK"
110.4,Jazmin,,"That I guess I still don't know how come I'm in the group kiss my answer was right, I got it from the right place"
110.4,Jazmin,,harvard
110.4,Jazmin,,"edu: Ok, um NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter"
110.4,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.4,Jazmin,,Oh that's it?
110.4,Jazmin,,"Okay, that makes sense because"
110.4,Jazmin,," It was NASA send a small machine, but I was like why why is my answer wrong"
110.4,Jazmin,,so my answer with this
110.4,Jazmin,,"OK, so that's what I should say? NASA sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon?"
110.4,Jazmin,,Okay
110.4,Jazmin,, And then the microscopic word?
110.4,Jazmin,,Lunar Orbiter
110.4,Jazmin,,"Oh, so I just had to say the name"
110.4,Jazmin,,"So, how did they use that machine, though, because they talked about that too didn't they use that to investigate"
110.4,Jazmin,,Okay
110.4,Jazmin,,"Agile Teacher Lab: And yes, I was going to say the same thing is also that I, I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
110.4,Jazmin,,"Oh wait, I have to add that part to this to discover water"
110.2,Jazmin,,But then why is my answer wrong?
110.2,Jazmin,,"That was Farrah's answer, mine was about the small machine"
110.2,Jazmin,, I thought that that was be the right answer
110.2,Jazmin,,"Well, I guess if I look at it, like, it says like the lunar orbiter, right, that they sent up in space"
110.2,Jazmin,,"So, am I like more right because I was saying about the Orbiter and like Farrah is like sort of right? But you know, I'm like wondering"
110.2,Jazmin,, Like if my answers wrong
110.2,Jazmin,,"I guess my question is, like, so if Farrah's answer is right like is my answer wrong, just like the small machine like is that not like is that not the thing that like you used to discover the water like I'm confused"
110.2,Jazmin,,"So did they send the astronauts with the machine or did they just send the machine, Chris?"
110.2,Jazmin,,RER: The lunar orbiter?
110.2,Jazmin,,I said that it definitely would be useful because the scientists can drink water and and people can't survive without water
110.2,Jazmin,, But before we go to lunch
110.2,Jazmin,,"Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch"
110.2,Jazmin,, I just wanted to take a moment and I wanted to thank you for working with us today
110.2,Jazmin,, I saw that
110.2,Jazmin,," Okay, so when I was reading"
110.2,Jazmin,,"So yeah, so well"
110.2,Jazmin,, I thought we were all here because all of our answers are wrong
110.2,Jazmin,,"Yeah, yeah"
110.2,Jazmin,,Yeah yeah
110.2,Jazmin,,"So yeah, I think it was a small machine"
110.2,Jazmin,," And then I guess it lands on the moon, and then it would discover the water, I think"
110.2,Jazmin,, The lunar orbiter is what they sent because it was sent up and then they would like fly around the moon
110.2,Jazmin,,"Yeah, that's really cool"
110.2,Jazmin,,You can stay hydrated
110.2,Jazmin,," So if there was water, you could make a garden you could grow it using the water"
110.2,Jazmin,,Yes
110.2,Jazmin,,"Yeah, cuz I said that, yes, that there's convincing evidence and I said astronaut drink the water and stay hydrated and that you can't survive without water"
110.2,Jazmin,,"Oh, okay"
110.2,Jazmin,,"I guess not, I guess they must have used all of them like different, like the microscop and the lunar orbiter"
110.2,Jazmin,,"So, so how come I'm in this group"
110.2,Jazmin,,The question asked what equipment that they used to discover water on the moon
110.2,Jazmin,, And that's why I said I'm the small machine I that's why I picked the one from paragraph to because
110.2,Jazmin,,I can read the question
110.2,Jazmin,,"Yeah, I can say was just wondering, since I was thinking like that"
110.2,Jazmin,," It seemed like the Lunar Orbiter, we see that they use to discover the water"
110.2,Jazmin,, So is it both the microscope and the lunar orbiter is it just one?
110.2,Jazmin,,"Um, well, I mean, I just, I, I feel like I i put words down from from story and"
110.2,Jazmin,,harvard
110.2,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.2,Jazmin,,edu: So it is right
110.2,Jazmin,,I don't understand why my answer is wrong
110.2,Jazmin,,Thank you
110.2,Jazmin,," Yeah, I don't understand why my answers wrong"
110.2,Jazmin,," So, just add some more to my answer"
110.2,Jazmin,,"Oh, oh, okay"
110.2,Jazmin,,Since we're all in this small group
110.2,Jazmin,,"Oh Okay, so if I just put NASA sent a small machine then i'm right"
110.2,Jazmin,,"And I can, I can tell you where I found it, I found it in part to the beginning of Part two"
110.2,Jazmin,,Oh no I just circled small machine
110.2,Jazmin,,Oh
110.1,Jazmin,,Um I learned to make sure that I read the whole sentence or or that my answer is really clear
110.1,Jazmin,,He said that I support my answer right
110.1,Jazmin,,Uh huh
110.1,Jazmin,," Okay, um,"
110.1,Jazmin,,"I'm sorry, what's the answer"
110.1,Jazmin,," And I was like, I basically was looking at like the small and I just want like I still don't understand why my answers"
110.1,Jazmin,,That the first sentence or two
110.1,Jazmin,," Lawrence, but I didn't understand why my answer is wrong"
110.1,Jazmin,,Mr
110.1,Jazmin,, Yes
110.1,Jazmin,,Yes
110.1,Jazmin,, Yes
110.1,Jazmin,," And so yes, that's what I was thinking"
110.1,Jazmin,,"We take a bath here, and we drink water a lot"
110.1,Jazmin,, And I was remembering what Luis and Chris were talking about
110.1,Jazmin,," And yes, you need water to live"
110.1,Jazmin,, Okay
110.1,Jazmin,,That
110.1,Jazmin,, So I think that it's this small machine
110.1,Jazmin,, You just told Farrah that was the right answer
110.1,Jazmin,,Yeah
110.1,Jazmin,,I actually feel like I knew what each of the words meant
110.1,Jazmin,,So I said that NASA used like a small machine
110.1,Jazmin,,So it's the lunar orbiter?
110.1,Jazmin,,"Well, what I read was in paragraph two and it said in the first paragraph that NASA sent a small machine"
110.1,Jazmin,,"Um, so I was really interested in, like, I got like really about how be thinking, how cool it would be if you could grow this garden, that would be so pretty"
110.1,Jazmin,,"Well, I guess I still think my answer is right, that NASA used a small machine to get to the water"
110.1,Jazmin,," Okay, it's in the beginning, it says future astronauts could drink this water"
110.1,Jazmin,,"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I see it"
110.1,Jazmin,,"I said that NASA sent a small machine and but I was wondering like why my answer was wrong, because it seems like the right answer"
110.1,Jazmin,,"Yeah, so to me with the question means is it's asking like to testing our opinion and we have to say like yes or no, the answer is the asking is the evidence convincing and and so I said that, yes, the evidence is convincing, and that's because astronauts wanna"
110.1,Jazmin,,Thank you
110.1,Jazmin,,"Okay, so when I look and small machine"
110.1,Jazmin,, She basically I was looking in paragraph two and I was in the first sentence
110.1,Jazmin,," And I was thinking, basically what you could do"
110.1,Jazmin,," Is you could use the water to grow things, you could have a garden on the moon, in the craters"
110.1,Jazmin,,I think it would be valuable because astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and like you can't survive without water
110.1,Jazmin,,Okay
110.1,Jazmin,,"i'm sorry teacher, but how can it be right and my answer be great because we have two different answers"
110.1,Jazmin,, I said the equipment was a small machine from paragraph two
110.1,Jazmin,,"Oh, but, Miss Teacher I didn't have the microscope"
110.1,Jazmin,,Jazmin: Okay
110.1,Jazmin,, Go me
110.1,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.1,Jazmin,,harvard
110.1,Jazmin,,edu: I don't understand why my answer is wrong
110.1,Jazmin,,harvard
110.1,Jazmin,,edu: yeah i'm still kind of confused
110.1,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.1,Jazmin,,Excuse me teacher
110.1,Jazmin,,OK
110.1,Jazmin,,Thanks
110.1,Jazmin,,I got a different answer
110.1,Jazmin,,Yes
110.1,Jazmin,,It was right?
110.1,Jazmin,,and see me a little bit is still in display skin my
110.1,Jazmin,,Okay
110.1,Jazmin,,"Oh, thank you"
110.1,Jazmin,,"edu: And what it is, is a small machine called an orbiter"
110.1,Jazmin,,harvard
110.1,Jazmin,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.1,Jazmin,,Uh-huh
110.1,Jazmin,,I think equipment
110.1,Jazmin,,I don't understand why my answer is wrong
110.1,Jazmin,, They could drink the water
110.1,Jazmin,,I have to look again
110.1,Jazmin,, Water could be useful in lots of ways
110.1,Jazmin,,"Yeah, I can add this is Jazmin"
110.1,Jazmin,,"Okay, I said NASA sent a small machine"
110.1,Jazmin,,So that's not answer right just the small machine
110.1,Jazmin,,"Well,"
110.1,Jazmin,,"Okay, thank you for that Jazmin i'm i'm glad that you were able to revise your answer as well um so I Jazmin really quick, I just wanted to go back to Farrah for a little bit"
110.1,Jazmin,,Jazmin
110.1,Jazmin,,Agile Teacher Lab: Thank you
110.1,Jazmin,,I said NASA sent a small machine
110.1,Jazmin,,um well I kept the part I put about NASA cuz that's in the story too so
110.1,Jazmin,,yeah
110.1,Jazmin,,Okay
110.1,Jazmin,,I said that NASA sent a small machine
110.1,Jazmin,,"Yes, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
110.1,Jazmin,,that's what I was gonna say too
110.1,Jazmin,,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah that's what it says in the story
110.1,Jazmin,,I chose discover
110.1,Jazmin,,Yes
110.1,Jazmin,,OK
110.1,Jazmin,,"Okay, well, I circled discover"
110.1,Jazmin,,"I said NASA sent a small machine, and so I don't understand why my answers wrong"
110.1,Jazmin,,"Okay i got it, can I go"
110.1,Jazmin,,um yeah well I I changed my answer to
110.1,Jazmin,,Good yeah I don't know why my answers wrong too
110.1,Jazmin,,I said that
150.1,Luis,,yeah okay i'll i'll stick around
150.1,Luis,,Okay
150.1,Luis,," Um, I shouldn't be ni this group"
150.1,Luis,,"Um, excuse me"
150.1,Luis,, I already know all there is to know about space
150.1,Luis,,"Okay, yeah"
150.1,Luis,,Um no I didn't take a look yet
150.1,Luis,,"I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,Okay
150.1,Luis,,"Excuse me, maam"
150.1,Luis,,"Um, oh, I guess, okay"
150.1,Luis,,I'm sorry
150.1,Luis,, I looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch
150.1,Luis,,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already corrected my answer"
150.1,Luis,,"Yeah, I'm not sure"
150.1,Luis,, It's just that I didn't say enough?
150.1,Luis,,"Um, yeah, so I I think I need to be in this group, because I know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,"Um, yeah"
150.1,Luis,, So I don't think I really even the be in this group
150.1,Luis,," So I've kind of already like, I know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,I guess I'll
150.1,Luis,,OK
150.1,Luis,," I have to think about it, then"
150.1,Luis,, I know a lot about space
150.1,Luis,,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group teacher"
150.1,Luis,,"Excuse me, I'm a teacher, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,, I have a question
150.1,Luis,, Yeah
150.1,Luis,, Luis is
150.1,Luis,,"I do, I do, I do"
150.1,Luis,," I think I understand, like, why that's that might be a better answer"
150.1,Luis,," So yeah, I think that I see"
150.1,Luis,,"Yeah, I didn't really read it the first time"
150.1,Luis,," I have a quick question, though"
150.1,Luis,,"Ah, yeah, I see it"
150.1,Luis,,Yeah okay yeah that sounds cool
150.1,Luis,,"Yeah, yeah, okay, I can stick around for that"
150.1,Luis,," Um, so yeah"
150.1,Luis,,Okay
150.1,Luis,," Um, so, in paragraph two, they talk about the Lunar Orbiter and then paragraph three, they talk about the microscope so"
150.1,Luis,," Um, there's a bunch of there's two different things where they're talking about equipment in here"
150.1,Luis,,"Yeah, I guess, you know, how do you find them?"
150.1,Luis,,Okay
150.1,Luis,,"I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be on this group, I am already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,All okay
150.1,Luis,,"Okay, yeah, I can do that"
150.1,Luis,,"Excuse me, a teacher"
150.1,Luis,," I hadn't been on this group, I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,"Okay, yeah, I can do that"
150.1,Luis,,"Yeah, I could do that"
150.1,Luis,,Okay
150.1,Luis,,"Yeah, I can't"
150.1,Luis,,Okay
150.1,Luis,,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in that spot"
150.1,Luis,, I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,,OK
150.1,Luis,,"Yeah, I guess so"
150.1,Luis,, Did you want me to give the answer
150.1,Luis,,"Um, yeah, I'm looking right now"
150.1,Luis,,"Yeah, I could do that"
150.1,Luis,, That sounds cool
150.1,Luis,,Yeah
150.1,Luis,,Excuse me teacher
150.1,Luis,,"Okay, yeah, I can stick around"
150.1,Luis,,I think the most important equipment was the microscope
150.1,Luis,,Uh-huh yeah I have it on my tablet right here
150.1,Luis,, And so I know that um scientists and astronauts like they have to use oxygen tanks to go to go to the moon
150.1,Luis,,"Okay, well, I don't know why mine was wrong, because, I mean, I know, I know a lot about space"
150.1,Luis,, They can't breathe
150.1,Luis,,"Um, cuz yeah well I mean yeah cuz well when you said okay, you don't need the oxygen tank to find water you need oxygen tank to breathe"
150.1,Luis,, Okay
150.1,Luis,," So, yeah, yeah"
150.1,Luis,, So I don't think I really need to be in this
150.1,Luis,," Um, so basically I was just saying that like I kind of know like all about space"
150.1,Luis,,"Yeah, no problem"
150.1,Luis,,"Well, I can stick around"
150.1,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Luis,,harvard
150.1,Luis,,edu: Sorry
150.1,Luis,,Okay
150.1,Luis,,"No, not yet, but I will"
150.1,Luis,,"Oh well, I just was off, I was gonna say that, like, I think I got everything figured out now, so I think i'm all good to go"
150.1,Luis,,Excuse me
150.1,Luis,,"Yes, excuse me"
150.1,Luis,,Okay
150.1,Luis,,I guess
150.1,Luis,,"Um, maybe I think"
150.1,Luis,,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah sounds good
150.1,Luis,, Okay
150.1,Luis,,All right
150.1,Luis,,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,yeah the Lunar orbiter
150.1,Luis,,Okay
150.1,Luis,, So I'm not even sure why why we're in this group
150.1,Luis,,"Um, yeah, and I want you answered our questions"
150.1,Luis,," Um, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,Excuse me
150.1,Luis,,harvard
150.1,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Luis,,edu: I mean ask me anything I know I know everything that I need to know
150.1,Luis,,harvard
150.1,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Luis,,edu: I mean well I know a lot about space
150.1,Luis,,harvard
150.1,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Luis,,edu: I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,,harvard
150.1,Luis,,edu: I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Luis,,harvard
150.1,Luis,,edu: OK
150.1,Luis,,yeah but didn't they use like oxygen takes to walk around and see the water?
150.1,Luis,,"yeah, I can do that"
150.1,Luis,,"that's cool, I guess, I can stick around"
150.1,Luis,,"Okay, I got it"
150.1,Luis,,"Yeah, it's me, Luis"
150.1,Luis,, I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,," Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group"
150.1,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Luis,,edu: I think I got this all figured out now so i'm all good
150.1,Luis,,harvard
150.1,Luis,,"Oh, OK"
150.1,Luis,,Okay
150.1,Luis,,"Okay, I can do that"
150.1,Luis,, Yeah
150.1,Luis,,Oh
150.1,Luis,,"I gotta say if if I think it's a valuable or not, I think"
150.1,Luis,,OK
150.1,Luis,,"edu: Okay, all right, paragraph two, it says lunar orbit our land at the south Pole and"
150.1,Luis,,harvard
150.1,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Luis,,"Oh, oh, OK"
150.1,Luis,,"Okay, I guess, I can stick our out"
150.1,Luis,,OK
150.1,Luis,,"Guys, excuse me"
150.1,Luis,, That was pretty good
150.1,Luis,,"I mean, that sounds like a pretty good answer"
150.1,Luis,," I mean, with all the oxygen tanks and stuff"
150.1,Luis,," I mean, I think also Chris's answer"
150.1,Luis,,"Um, well, actually, our story"
150.1,Luis,," It's on our tablet right in front of us, so we can see it there"
150.1,Luis,,"Yeah, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,"Um, I just want to remind do my dad as actually an astronaut"
150.1,Luis,,Excuse me
150.1,Luis,,"Um, yeah, okay"
150.1,Luis,,"Yeah, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,Yeah
150.1,Luis,,And protective caps on here we go
150.1,Luis,,"Okay, yeah"
150.1,Luis,, Good for him
150.1,Luis,, We read it already
150.1,Luis,,We read it
150.1,Luis,,"So you're saying like, because it's, um, it's not in the story"
150.1,Luis,, OK
150.1,Luis,,OK
150.1,Luis,,"I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,, That's what I thought
150.1,Luis,, The lunar orbiter
150.1,Luis,,"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
150.1,Luis,, That's kind of what I thought our first place that it was was most like that
150.1,Luis,,"Okay, okay"
150.1,Luis,,Okay I love talking about space
150.1,Luis,,"Yeah, I think so"
150.1,Luis,, So we're talking and sharing and then rereading to find our partners answers
150.1,Luis,,"Um, yeah, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,Sweet
150.1,Luis,,Oh ok ok ok that makes sense
150.1,Luis,,um yeah I you know I really got this figured out I think I'm all good
150.1,Luis,,Excuse me
150.1,Luis,,We read it already
150.1,Luis,,"Okay, yeah, sounds good to me"
150.1,Luis,,"Excuse me, I don't, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,That sounds okay
150.1,Luis,,"Yeah, we read that"
150.1,Luis,,"yeah so like I should make sure that I, I guess, like look closely at the reading is, that is, that is, that right?"
150.1,Luis,,Okay okay
150.1,Luis,,um yeah okay
150.1,Luis,,yeah um I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,,um yeah okay yeah
150.1,Luis,,um yeah Teacher I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,,Nah but I'm ok
150.1,Luis,,Okay
150.1,Luis,,Oh yeah oh OK that's fine
150.1,Luis,,"yeah um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this room, I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,yeah well actually I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,,um yeah
150.1,Luis,,"i'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,"um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group"
150.1,Luis,, I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,,yeah yeah it's right here
150.1,Luis,,"um yeah excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,By
150.1,Luis,,um yeah I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Luis,,harvard
150.1,Luis,,edu: Okay
150.1,Luis,,Okay okay okay
150.1,Luis,,um excuse me
150.1,Luis,, I I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,,yeah
150.1,Luis,, I can see why the orbiter is a better answer yeah than the oxygen tanks
150.1,Luis,,yeah I got it now
150.1,Luis,,"um yeah excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,"um oh okay yeah there are this circle, the evidence and the text where Oh, that we can use to answer this question"
150.1,Luis,,"yeah um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,um yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,,"i'm excuse me, I shut me in this group I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,yeah well i'm I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,Okay
150.1,Luis,,That sounds great yeah let's do it
150.1,Luis,,um yeah yeah okay
150.1,Luis,,"Um yeah we all read it, but I I don't think I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,um yeah
150.1,Luis,,um well I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,,yeah okay
150.1,Luis,,"Excuse me teacher, I don't think I should be in this group biology know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,"It does, I mean I just like don't like to write, you know I mean I feel like when I get the answer I got it and that's good"
150.1,Luis,,Okay that's fine great
150.1,Luis,,"i'm now, I think I was probably just thinking about my own space and watching videos on YouTube"
150.1,Luis,,uh huh okay
150.1,Luis,,yeah okay
150.1,Luis,,that's a good plan yeah
150.1,Luis,,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,Okay
150.1,Luis,,"teacher Okay, I think I got this all figured out now so i'm all good"
150.1,Luis,,"Excuse me teacher, but I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,"yeah I had that equipment, I said on oxygen tanks, in my answer"
150.1,Luis,,um yeah this is Luis I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,,um yeah Mr see I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,,Excuse me
150.1,Luis,,Sure do
150.1,Luis,,"um yeah so we read it, we read about the water on the moon and i'm thinking I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
150.1,Luis,,"yeah so about the equipment, I was thinking that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
150.1,Luis,,um yeah so I shouldn't be and that's group I already know all about space
150.1,Luis,,Okay yeah
140.1,Luis,,"Yeah, he, he talks about it all the time"
140.1,Luis,," And like, that's how come I know so much about space"
140.1,Luis,,"Um, um, yeah, like on a car"
140.1,Luis,,"Oh, yeah, I know a lot about that equipment"
140.1,Luis,," I mean, that is pretty cool stuff"
140.1,Luis,,No
140.1,Luis,," That's like, wow"
140.1,Luis,," I didn't know anything about the Saturn stuff and the moons and, like, teeny-weeny aliens"
140.1,Luis,, I didn't know that
140.1,Luis,,"OK, cool"
140.1,Luis,," I mean there isn't gravity in space, but they're also isn't any oxygen and trees and carbon dioxide"
140.1,Luis,," So the site, so the astronauts have to wear these oxygen tanks in order to breathe when they're up in space, so they have, they have a whole a whole space suit"
140.1,Luis,,"Okay, because there isn't any gravity"
140.1,Luis,," Um, I already kind of know like all about space and like I kind of like know like all this stuff"
140.1,Luis,,"Um, so I just wanted to say"
140.1,Luis,, So I don't think I need to be in this group
140.1,Luis,,Yeah
140.1,Luis,,I yeah he works at that that's Dennis Space Center
140.1,Luis,," I'm in Mississippi, and he kind of like commute, so we don't get to see him as often as you know we like"
140.1,Luis,,Yeah yeah we talk on Skype all the time
140.1,Luis,," Like, all that kind of stuff"
140.1,Luis,,"Um, well, there's like, I know all about like rocket launches and I know about like you have to where spacesuits and oxygen tanks and like you know like I know that like space is a vacuum"
140.1,Luis,,"Oh man, I know all sorts of stuff"
140.1,Luis,, It's a vacuum
140.1,Luis,, So you have to use oxygen tanks at masks and I know that like
140.1,Luis,, I know that space is like like huge and like unimaginably huge and like it has stars and like when you go into space
140.1,Luis,,"Okay, well,"
140.1,Luis,,Mhmm
140.1,Luis,,"Well, I didn't go to NASA, but I did, um, I've seen that in box"
140.1,Luis,, Yeah
140.1,Luis,,Yeah
140.1,Luis,, So I look at a lot of stuff on the internet like videos and learning about astronauts and watching launches of rocket
140.1,Luis,," Oh, it's so cool"
140.1,Luis,,"Oh well, I like to watch a lot of videos like on YouTube"
140.1,Luis,,"Yeah, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
140.1,Luis,,"Yeah, yeah"
140.1,Luis,, There was stuff in there
140.1,Luis,,"yeah I thought it was a really interesting because I didn't actually know that there was water on the moon, before I read this and I thought it was so cool how they sent that lunar orbiter"
140.1,Luis,,"Oh man well what just be such a cool experience to feel like zero gravity up there, I can't wait, I really want to go to space camp, because you get to kind of try it out like almost before you get to be an astronaut, and I want to discover new planets and galaxies too"
140.1,Luis,,"um not Really, about the moon, no"
140.1,Luis,,"Oh, my oh wow oh that's really hard um I think my favorite thing about space as how um Pluto used to be a planet and then they said it was a dwarf planet"
140.1,Luis,,"Okay, I know that astronauts use space suits so that they don't like freeze to death in space, and I know that there's no gravity up there, so if they're walking around they have to wear like gravity boots so that they can walk on the moon, and a bunch of other stuff too"
140.1,Luis,,Well i'm a little bit I can try
140.1,Luis,,Oh yeah oh big time I watch all these videos about space on YouTube and and I really want to go to space camp and go into the zero gravity Chamber oh yeah I really like space
140.1,Luis,,That that's one small step for man one giant leap for mankind
140.1,Luis,,"Agile Teacher Lab: yeah Okay, I know they just landed the MARS Rover"
140.1,Luis,,"Okay, I love watching like the"
140.1,Luis,,"Okay, well, I know a lot about space, I know all about the different planets and I know stuff about uhm stars that Milky Way the sun kind of all the all the big ones"
140.1,Luis,,"Oh well, my favorite um fact about space is that there used to be nine planets but then they kicked Pluto out of the planet club because he was too small"
140.1,Luis,,yeah me too
140.1,Luis,,"um yeah well I I shouldn't be in this room, because I already know all about space"
140.1,Luis,,"Oh well, okay um I want to look at Jupiter because it's so big and it has that red spot that's like a storm as giant giant hurricane, and I really want to look at that"
140.1,Luis,,"Well, I watch YouTube and I watched Nova sometime so yeah you know about equipment that scientists use of space"
140.1,Luis,, We just know we have our planet and we have the Milky Way but the world could be the universe could be enormous and there could even be life out there
140.1,Luis,,"Oh well, space is so cool because it's so mysterious like how big is the universe? we don't even know"
140.1,Luis,,I definitely want to live on the moon
140.1,Luis,,"yeah okay i'll tell you three things first accidents have to wear spacesuits because it's really cold and they'll like freeze to death, second, they have to wear oxygen tanks, because you can't breathe them space and third there's no gravity there, so they got to wear gravity boots"
140.1,Luis,,yep yep oxygen tanks are my answer to that one Chris
140.1,Luis,,"Oh yeah I lot of space and I really want to be an astronaut, when I grow up"
140.1,Luis,,"Oh, I watch a lot of videos on YouTube and sometimes I read articles, like in magazines and I have this book with all these pictures of space Oh, I really like space"
130.3,Luis,, All right
130.3,Luis,,Okay
130.3,Luis,, Now I should say like scientists used a lot of ox used equipment like oxygen tanks and um and others equipment like I guess I could what Jazmin said and and the small machine to investigate to call it a lunar orbiter
130.3,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.3,Luis,,edu: yeah that makes sense that's okay so then that's that would be helpful
130.3,Luis,,harvard
130.3,Luis,,interesting
130.3,Luis,,So yeah
130.2,Luis,,"Um, yeah"
130.2,Luis,, You can detect water using other tools
130.2,Luis,," Just like on the question that you're asking is, like, you use lots of equipment and you don't need a microscope to to detect it"
130.2,Luis,, So what I was thinking
130.2,Luis,," I know, I know a lot about space like and I know a lot about the moon"
130.2,Luis,," Like, I know that the astronauts like to go to the moon and"
130.2,Luis,,Well
130.2,Luis,,I said equipment discover and water
130.2,Luis,,"While I was just gonna say like, I know that like scientists use a lot of, you know, equipment, so like I said oxygen tanks and stuff like that"
130.2,Luis,,"Well, I guess I didn't really read that part because I didn't think I had to read the part cuz I already know man"
130.2,Luis,,It sounds like that could be used as rocket fuel
130.2,Luis,," Yeah, that'd be great because you know if I have to carry water might my arms and be tired"
130.2,Luis,,"Um, yeah"
130.2,Luis,,"Yeah, um"
130.2,Luis,,"Yeah, that's what I was gonna say that was, that was the answer that I sent for the question"
130.2,Luis,,"Okay, well, so I know a lot about like what astronauts wear and what they use, and I know that there isn't gravity, but I actually never heard of a lunar orbiter before, so this is news to me"
130.2,Luis,, Absolutely
130.2,Luis,, Like I said equipment too
130.2,Luis,, So I basically um yeah so what I was looking at when I was looking at the reading was I basically was saying
130.2,Luis,, I always like to talk
130.2,Luis,," And then I said, like"
130.2,Luis,,"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
130.2,Luis,,Um okay so
130.2,Luis,,So I feel like the answer is lunar orbiter
130.2,Luis,," Well, I guess I gotta look in paragraph two"
130.2,Luis,,Okay
130.2,Luis,,um yeah I mean I kind of noticed a couple things so one of the things that I noticed was that
130.2,Luis,,I'm
130.2,Luis,, I don't know what that one is
130.2,Luis,,um no actually okay I don't know that one
130.2,Luis,,"Yeah, I do"
130.2,Luis,,"Oh yeah definitely well, the thing is scientists can use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks too"
130.2,Luis,,Yeah
130.2,Luis,, I can do it
130.2,Luis,, I'm
130.2,Luis,,"Um, I can do it"
130.2,Luis,,I have a question
130.2,Luis,,"I'm sorry, that was Luis, I should have raised my hand"
130.2,Luis,," He couldn't he has to better words, I think"
130.2,Luis,,"Yeah, I mean, it's like, close enough"
130.2,Luis,," But yeah, he got the idea"
130.2,Luis,,"Yeah, I just want to remind you, my dad is actually an astronaut"
130.2,Luis,, It must be Farrah
130.2,Luis,,"Oh, it must be"
130.2,Luis,,"Oh, so it's Chris and so I don't know"
130.2,Luis,,"Um, now I mean, maybe they used it, but it sounded more like it was kind of like after after they found the water than they had to like study it"
130.2,Luis,," But, um, I think that that oxygen tanks are probably more important"
130.2,Luis,, Okay
130.2,Luis,,"Yeah, I'm Chris, you just need to read the next sentence extra right thing or access oxygen and a high to use as a rocket fuel"
130.2,Luis,, It's called
130.2,Luis,,"Yeah, I got this"
130.2,Luis,,"um I I I didn't oh okay well i'm My answer is oxygen tanks, I said oxygen tanks"
130.2,Luis,,"Um well, I mean it helps to know a lot about space, like me and I guess Chris he kind of knows a lot about space too"
130.2,Luis,,"Agile Teacher Lab: um yeah well, I just wanted to say um I think I got this all figured out so I'm good"
130.2,Luis,,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay i'm Chris, you need equipment and your answer, so I said oxygen tanks, because that is definitely equipment that scientists use on the moon"
130.2,Luis,, 
130.2,Luis,,"Oh, we know this, I know this"
130.2,Luis,,"out while i'm and not so much about the moon base, but I was thinking about what Farrah was saying about it being the microscope and then you were saying Jazmin to answer was right, the Lunar orbiter"
130.2,Luis,,"um yeah okay so um lunar you guys lunar means moon so anytime you see lunar it means about the moon, an orbiter is like an orbit it's like it goes around something and it says so, the orbiter at looks for the ice, I think, by going around the moon somehow"
130.2,Luis,,"Okay, so Oliver the machine is called a lunar orbiter, and so the orbiter it i'm excited to where the water is because a microscope a microscope is really small like depth, can you picture astronaut walking around the big giant mode like a tiny little less that would take"
130.2,Luis,,"wow the rocket ships landing gear if they're going to go on the moon, they need landing gear um suits and masks, Chris already said that, food, really gross food for them to eat on the trip um"
130.1,Luis,,"Um, you know, I think it's pretty convincing because those two things are so important in space and like for space travel , that I think it's convincing that they have, like, you know what they talk about with whay you can do, yeah I think it's convincing"
130.1,Luis,, Yeah
130.1,Luis,,"Okay, okay"
130.1,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.1,Luis,,"edu: Okay Okay, I can add a couple more names of equipment"
130.1,Luis,,harvard
130.1,Luis,,"um so well, I guess, I would change my answer to"
130.1,Luis,,Oh okay
130.1,Luis,,Right yeah the orbiter
120.4,Luis,,i'm the same thing that they found that the Lunar orbiter
120.4,Luis,,"yeah yeah before we do that, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
120.4,Luis,,yeah okay well i'm scientists they use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks
120.4,Luis,,"Um, let me see"
120.4,Luis,," I said, that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
120.4,Luis,, I already know that equipment that they use
120.4,Luis,," Um, well, like when they were on Earth, you know, because that's how you can look from Earth on"
120.4,Luis,,"Well, I think that because they they really like to have to travel around a lot that they probably use their like their their their like telescopes to look at the water"
120.4,Luis,,"So I looked at, paragraph two, and what we see and like what I was listening to everybody"
120.4,Luis,, I'm
120.4,Luis,,"Yeah, sure"
120.4,Luis,, So basically what what I said was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that
120.4,Luis,," Yeah, I was really cool and I think for me, like the thing that was so interesting is like seeing that like you know how they use the equipment"
120.4,Luis,,Hi
120.4,Luis,," They have this equipment and then they have to use all these different pieces in order to like find the water and study it, that's really cool"
120.4,Luis,," I already submitted it, I don't remember what I wrote down, um, let me see if it's on my slide"
120.4,Luis,,"Um, well, I didn't"
120.4,Luis,, I know all about speed
120.4,Luis,,Excuse me
120.4,Luis,, I shouldn't be in this group
120.4,Luis,,"Um, yeah, like there's a few things that I should are that I've learned from like I learned that, like, Well, like you have to use all this equipment and stuff like that"
120.4,Luis,,Yeah
120.4,Luis,,The Lunar Orbiter
120.4,Luis,,rocket fuel all
120.4,Luis,,"Um, so basically what I was saying was that scientists found ice using a small machine"
120.4,Luis,,"Yeah, I talked about equipment in my answer"
120.4,Luis,,Said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
120.4,Luis,,"So I said, like they need like all the oxygen tanks and they like you know they need, like, all that stuff that like astronauts used to like go fly around in space"
120.4,Luis,,"Um, yeah"
120.4,Luis,," So I guess I was wondering, like, I think I know the words, but I was wondering about like discover"
120.4,Luis,,"Um, so I basically when I went in"
120.4,Luis,, I circle
120.4,Luis,,"Well, I was saying that the scientists would have to use like I'm like spacesuits and that they would need like rocket fuel and they would need oxygen and like all that stuff that I already know before like ever doing the reading"
120.4,Luis,, I don't think I should be in this group
120.4,Luis,, I don't really think I need any help
120.4,Luis,," So, um, here's what I was thinking"
120.4,Luis,," Um, I know like a lot about space like practically everything that you can know about space"
120.4,Luis,,I do have a question
120.4,Luis,, I don't think I need to be in this group
120.4,Luis,,"Um, well, I was just gonna say that I kind of know like all about space"
120.4,Luis,,"So okay, so my response was that water can be split into two parts at the hydrogen and oxygen"
120.4,Luis,," So, um, I just wanted to say that, like, I don't think I need to be in this group because I already know"
120.4,Luis,,"Um, yeah"
120.4,Luis,, Like all about space
120.4,Luis,,"Um, yeah"
120.4,Luis,," So basically what I said was, um, Let's see, what did I say I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
120.4,Luis,,"Um, well, I just kind of kept looking around and look what I was like I i looked in paragraph three"
120.4,Luis,," Um, well, they need like oxygen tanks and spacesuits in order to roll up to the moon"
120.4,Luis,,"Oh yeah, sure"
120.4,Luis,,Uh huh
120.4,Luis,,"Well I, I wanted"
120.4,Luis,, I'm sorry
120.4,Luis,," I just wanted to say I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
120.4,Luis,, I think I got this all figured out
120.4,Luis,," Well, it's kind of more of like a thought, I guess"
120.4,Luis,, So I think I'm all good
120.4,Luis,,"Um, yeah"
120.4,Luis,,"Um, I forgot"
120.4,Luis,," Yeah, I just want to remind you that my dad is an astronaut"
120.4,Luis,,Teacher? Yes
120.4,Luis,,To breathe?
120.4,Luis,,"Oh, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
120.4,Luis,, Now that I've seen a picture of it
120.4,Luis,,"Hmm, okay"
120.4,Luis,," Um, I feel like maybe maybe the camera just kind of look for it"
120.4,Luis,, And if they see some puddles of water and then that's how they find it
120.4,Luis,," Um, I think that, let's see, how would they detect the water"
120.4,Luis,,"Um, well, I think that they use like oxygen tanks and that they use like space suits and stuff like that"
120.4,Luis,,"Okay, so I think that they probably had to use stuff like oxygen tanks and masks and spacesuits and and like, stuff like that, you know,"
120.4,Luis,," Okay, so, um, we were reading that up first"
120.4,Luis,,"Yeah, yeah"
120.4,Luis,,"Um, yeah, this is Luis"
120.4,Luis,, So I don't think I need any help
120.4,Luis,, I don't think I need to be in this
120.4,Luis,," Well, I was gonna say like I already kind of know all about ease"
120.4,Luis,,"Um, yeah"
120.4,Luis,,Yeah
120.4,Luis,,I yeah okay so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
120.4,Luis,,Excuse me
120.4,Luis,,And I see
120.4,Luis,,"Well, I guess, like I'm kind of thinking"
120.4,Luis,,So I said that scientists use a lot of it like oxygen tanks and stuff like that
120.4,Luis,,"I said on water can be split into two parts, oxygen and hydrogen"
120.4,Luis,," I just want to remind you, my dad is an astronaut"
120.4,Luis,, But I did want you to
120.4,Luis,,"Um, let me see"
120.4,Luis,,"Well, I said that, um, you know, that they could use"
120.4,Luis,," Um, maybe that's uh"
120.4,Luis,,"edu: yeah okay, So um I said"
120.4,Luis,,harvard
120.4,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Luis,," Because that equipment and the question as our equipment, and so I said, you know the equipment that scientists use on them owner oxygen tank"
120.4,Luis,,"Actually, I wrote about the oxygen tanks too"
120.4,Luis,,yeah yeah sure
120.4,Luis,,"Um, yeah, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
120.4,Luis,," I said, ah, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
120.4,Luis,,"Yeah, okay"
120.4,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Luis,,edu: The story says that they can put them together oxygen and hydrogen can be used as rocket fuel
120.4,Luis,,harvard
120.4,Luis,,"And um so actually for me, I was just gonna say that I think that i've got everything all figured out now, so I was gonna say I think about good can I go back to my desk"
120.4,Luis,,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, you want me to say it now"
120.4,Luis,,"Oh, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
120.4,Luis,,yeah so I said that scientists use a lot of equip like oxygen tanks and stuff like that
120.4,Luis,, Great
120.4,Luis,, I already know all about space
120.4,Luis,,"Excuse me, teacher, I shouldn't be"
120.4,Luis,, Ms
120.4,Luis,,"Well, I was just going to say, I kind of know all about space already"
120.4,Luis,, So I don't even think I should be in this group
120.4,Luis,,"Yeah, so my answer to the question was that scientists use lots of equipment, like oxygen tanks and stuff like that"
120.4,Luis,, So I was I was saying that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and and stuff like that
120.4,Luis,,"Well, yeah"
120.4,Luis,,"um so I was just gonna say that this has been really fun and I think that i've got it all figured out, so I"
120.4,Luis,,"um yeah OK, so my initial answer, I was saying that scientists like use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that which I knew, because I already knew that and then um"
120.4,Luis,,"Oh yeah Okay, so I can, I can tell you that, basically, I was saying that yeah that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen"
120.4,Luis,,Sorry to interrupt
120.4,Luis,," I'm sorry but I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
120.4,Luis,,"Yes, I, like my turn, thank you"
120.4,Luis,,"Yeah, I can do that"
120.4,Luis,,"yeah Okay, so I said i'm scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
120.4,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Luis,,"edu: Okay, but I also just want to say"
120.4,Luis,,harvard
120.4,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Luis,,"edu: yeah Okay, so I said i'm"
120.4,Luis,,harvard
120.4,Luis,," So yeah, based on the article, I would say, yeah, water on the moon is valuable"
120.4,Luis,,Water is valuable
120.4,Luis,, We've got to drink it all the time
120.4,Luis,,I yeah that is what I had also said yes
120.4,Luis,,"Um, yeah, yeah, I can talk about my answer"
120.4,Luis,," Um, so my answer is I'm water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen"
120.4,Luis,,"Yep, sure can"
120.4,Luis,," Okay, water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen"
120.4,Luis,,"Um, it said it was a lunar orbiter NASA sent a small machine called lunar orbit are to investigate"
120.4,Luis,,Well I also said equipment
120.4,Luis,,"Ah, I said you need a scientist need oxygen tanks"
120.4,Luis,,Yeah okay um my answer did not really change like i guess i get i get how you say it has to be in the story and yeah okay they use a lunar orbiter
120.4,Luis,, Who knows but if there were astronauts there have to be oxygen tanks
120.4,Luis,, Maybe they use a microscope
120.4,Luis,, It was ice
120.4,Luis,,If ice
120.4,Luis,," And that's, I just wanted to remind you, and also you do that"
120.4,Luis,, My dad is actually an astronaut
120.4,Luis,,"Yeah, I just have something to say"
120.4,Luis,,"Well, I was just saying I shouldn't be in this group because I already know all about space"
120.4,Luis,,"Um, I said I'm that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
120.4,Luis,,"Okay, it was, um, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
120.4,Luis,,"Yeah, the microscope"
120.4,Luis,, Excuse me
120.4,Luis,, This is Luis
120.4,Luis,, Excuse me
120.4,Luis,,I'm
120.4,Luis,,"My example as water can be broken down into two parts, oxygen and hydrogen"
120.4,Luis,,"Yeah, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
120.4,Luis,,"yeah so you can take water, and you can split it into two parts, you can make oxygen and hydrogen"
120.4,Luis,,yeah okay so um I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen
120.4,Luis,," I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
120.4,Luis,,"Yeah, I do"
120.4,Luis,,"I still have to say I just want to remind you, my dad is actually an astronaut"
120.4,Luis,,"Yeah, so I know you could drink it"
120.4,Luis,," Well, it doesn't sound like there's a lot"
120.4,Luis,, So we were reading water on the moon
120.4,Luis,," And I just want to remind you, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
120.4,Luis,,"Um, yeah"
120.4,Luis,,"edu: Well, I mean OK, so now, I know that there's like"
120.4,Luis,,harvard
120.4,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Luis,,"yeah Okay, so I would say that my revised answer is a scientist found ice using a lunar orbiter"
120.4,Luis,,"yeah okay Chris, so the water on the moon it's not like water like a pool or like an ocean um it's like this tiny, tiny little tiny little pieces of water tiny little pieces of ice you can't even see them"
120.4,Luis,,um well I sat at scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
120.4,Luis,,"yeah so I said water can be split up into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen"
120.4,Luis,,"Okay um Okay, so I think i'll say"
120.4,Luis,,"Oh yeah well, I was just gonna say that about the Lunar orbiter so What it does is it looks for where the ice a little a little small it looks for where it is on the moon"
120.4,Luis,,"Okay, I heard you telling Jazmin and Chris and Farrah that they can add some of their background knowledge into their answer so i'm just going to do that, and so I think I can go back to my desk"
120.4,Luis,,yeah so I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
120.4,Luis,,yeah
120.4,Luis,,"yeah excuse me i'm Okay, I think I got this all figured out so i'm all good"
120.4,Luis,,"yeah Okay, so I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
120.4,Luis,,um yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
120.4,Luis,,"edu: Oh, in the article I was going to tell you more equipment that I know"
120.4,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Luis,,harvard
120.4,Luis,,"Hmm what equipment, ok we had equipment, did scientists use to discover water well I guess really the only good word left is moon"
120.4,Luis,,I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen thing
120.4,Luis,, My answer was Scientists use lots of equipment Like oxygen tanks
120.4,Luis,,um
120.4,Luis,,"Oh yeah well, I said that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
120.4,Luis,,"Agile Teacher Lab: um yeah well, I think I thought that's all figured out now so i'm good"
120.4,Luis,,i'm i'm okay at work really well but um I just I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch right now
120.4,Luis,,"yeah um well, I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
120.4,Luis,,"i'm Okay, I guess, I have that first part two, because I got equipment, but I don't have anything about the water in the Mon"
120.4,Luis,,"um well, I mean you said that okay equipment as like a lots of things, because they said equipment not piece of equipment, so I figured you could say everything like lunar orbiter microscope oxygen tanks yep"
120.4,Luis,,"Well, paragraph two that's where they talk about the Lunar orbiter"
120.4,Luis,,"yeah sure Okay, I said what did I see I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
120.4,Luis,,"wow excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, because I already corrected my answer so i'm good"
120.4,Luis,,"yeah, so I think she should just add the name I think she should just say um"
120.4,Luis,,"Okay, go ahead Oliver"
120.4,Luis,,"Rocket ships, rocket ships"
120.4,Luis,,Oh yeah well um I said that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks
120.4,Luis,,harvard
120.4,Luis,," Okay, so we're talking about equipment and discover and water and so Farrah was like well you know how come it's not mine because microscope is equipment and I think that Farrah's right"
120.4,Luis,,edu: yeah yeah
120.4,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Luis,,"yeah I am so my answer, I said well if kind of like Kara since actually cuz I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
120.4,Luis,,yeah yeah so an important piece of equipment as an oxygen tank like they need those so they can breathe
120.4,Luis,,"I said that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen"
120.4,Luis,,um so
120.4,Luis,,"yeah absolutely Okay, so my answer is that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen"
120.3,Luis,,"excuse me, I have my hand up"
120.3,Luis,,"yeah you got it Okay, that means that the moon Estelle drier than the driest desert on earth water they found as a microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.3,Luis,, I'll read it
120.3,Luis,,"Yeah, sure"
120.3,Luis,," Um, me Luis, I'll read it but but I do want to say, I don't think I'm supposed to be in this group, cuz I already know a lot about space"
120.3,Luis,,"Um, I can read it"
120.3,Luis,,Um yeah okay um what scientists used to discover water on the moon
120.3,Luis,,Sure
120.3,Luis,," Um, what scientists used to discover water on the moon"
120.3,Luis,,"Um, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon"
120.3,Luis,," Um, let's see"
120.3,Luis,,Okay
120.3,Luis,,Yeah
120.3,Luis,," Um, okay, so what equipment Did scientists use discover water on the moon"
120.3,Luis,,"Okay, it says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable"
120.3,Luis,,"Okay, I'll do that"
120.3,Luis,,"Wow, like, okay, so they use, like all kinds of equipment like they had to use like space suits and they had to use like, you know, all the stuff that astronauts have to use right"
120.3,Luis,,NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter
120.3,Luis,,  Okay
120.3,Luis,,"Okay, so, um, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate"
120.3,Luis,, Water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
120.3,Luis,,"Oh yeah, absolutely"
120.3,Luis,, Okay so paragraph five moon water could be useful in other ways
120.3,Luis,,"Um, well, it says that like get astronauts could read the oxygen and then oxygen and hydrogen"
120.3,Luis,," Oh, they use both for rocket fuel"
120.3,Luis,," So I know all this stuff, you know"
120.3,Luis,,"Wow, I was just thinking like my dad is an astronaut"
120.3,Luis,,Okay
120.3,Luis,,"Oh, um,"
120.3,Luis,,I'm sure
120.3,Luis,," Okay, this loan or what, oh well land damone South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater"
120.3,Luis,,"Okay, um, the discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon"
120.3,Luis,, So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to invest
120.3,Luis,,"Yeah, okay"
120.3,Luis,," Um, let's see"
120.3,Luis,,Yeah
120.3,Luis,," Um, is there convincing evidence that"
120.3,Luis,,"Yeah, okay"
120.3,Luis,, Okay
120.3,Luis,," It says, oh, what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon"
120.3,Luis,,Sure
120.3,Luis,,"Okay, um paragraph two"
120.3,Luis,,Excuse me
120.3,Luis,,Okay
120.3,Luis,, Ok
120.3,Luis,, This lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
120.3,Luis,, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
120.3,Luis,,I'll read it
120.3,Luis,, I'll read it
120.3,Luis,,Agile Teacher Lab: um excuse me
120.3,Luis,,Okay
120.3,Luis,,"yeah I would love to read that sounds great okay i'm in paragraph five, is that right"
120.3,Luis,,"yeah Okay, it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable"
120.3,Luis,,Not I sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large bore crater these ice deposits are very small
120.3,Luis,,Yeah okay um the question as what equipment at scientists to is to discover water on the moon
120.3,Luis,," So um we answered the question about the equipment and the water on the moon, but I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
120.3,Luis,,"Okay, yeah"
120.3,Luis,, What equipment did scientists to us to discover water on the moon
120.3,Luis,,Yeah
120.3,Luis,,question asked what he did scientists to us to discover water on the moon
120.3,Luis,,yeah
120.3,Luis,,"Okay, I heard this one, and so it can like help spacecrafts to move like fuel"
120.3,Luis,,"yeah yeah Okay, I guess, I can do that"
120.3,Luis,,I don't see anything
120.3,Luis,, I already know all about space
120.3,Luis,,um yeah well I I shouldn't be in this group
120.3,Luis,,yeah I do!
120.3,Luis,,"Okay, it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moons polar craters and these craters are dark places where the sun never shines"
120.3,Luis,,"um it says okay circle circle, the evidence and the text that we can use to answer this question"
120.3,Luis,,um yeah it is it's right here it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
120.3,Luis,,Okay okay NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
120.3,Luis,,Up yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
120.3,Luis,,You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.3,Luis,,um yeah excuse me
120.3,Luis,,"Oh yeah I can but I just wanted to say before I read anything that I don't think I need to be in this group, because I already know, like everything there is to know about space"
120.3,Luis,,"um Okay, so the question was um what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon"
120.2,Luis,,What did they use to discover water on the moon?
120.2,Luis,, I don't think I should be in this group
120.2,Luis,,"Well, I was just gonna say like I already know like so much about space and like I don't really think I need any help"
120.2,Luis,,"Um, yeah"
120.2,Luis,," So I kind of know all about space already like, I don't think I need to even in this"
120.2,Luis,,"Well, so my answer was, like, they had to use like oxygen tanks and spacesuits"
120.2,Luis,, And like all the stuff that astronaut would need if they were going up in space
120.2,Luis,, That makes a lot of sense
120.2,Luis,,Gotcha
120.2,Luis,, Okay
120.2,Luis,," Because, remember, my dad's an astronaut"
120.2,Luis,," So I said that water could be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen"
120.2,Luis,,OK
120.2,Luis,, LAUGHS
120.2,Luis,,"Um, so I think that the what they used was oxygen tanks and um space suits and all that kind of stuff, because otherwise they wouldn't be able to be on the moon and like run around"
120.2,Luis,,I just wanted to remind you that my dad is actually an astronaut
120.2,Luis,," So here's what I know is like probably they had to use like I'm like spacesuits and oxygen tanks and they had to use, like, stuff like that"
120.2,Luis,,"Well, okay"
120.2,Luis,, Like gloves and like helmets and things
120.2,Luis,, I think that's what they had to use
120.2,Luis,,A lunar Orbiter
120.2,Luis,,"Okay, I think I got this all figured out"
120.2,Luis,, So now I'm all good
120.2,Luis,,"Um,"
120.2,Luis,,"Yeah, definitely"
120.2,Luis,, Because they can't breathe on the moon without the oxygen tanks
120.2,Luis,," Really, I was just gonna say like, I don't think I have to be on this group, cuz like I kind of already know all about space"
120.2,Luis,,"Oh no, that's okay"
120.2,Luis,, I was more of a comment
120.2,Luis,,"Um, well, I was just"
120.2,Luis,," I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
120.2,Luis,, excuse me
120.2,Luis,,"Agile Teacher Lab: i'm excuse me, I should be and best group I already know all about space"
120.2,Luis,,Agile Teacher Lab: lunar orbiter
120.2,Luis,,"Agile Teacher Lab: i'm sorry yeah I mean they use the orbiter and they use a microscope, but I also know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for water and definitely using oxygen tanks, so I think Chris's right"
120.2,Luis,, Like all the stuff about space
120.2,Luis,," So, like, I don't really think I even need to be in this group"
120.2,Luis,, I know
120.2,Luis,,"Um, well, I was just gonna say that"
120.2,Luis,,"Well, I know that we're supposed to do that every time we answer a question"
120.2,Luis,,"I guess, I was just gonna say that I, I I don't think that I need to be in that group, because I don't think I need any help because I already don't our space"
120.2,Luis,,I think I got this all figured out so i'm all good
120.2,Luis,," You know, when they have to wear their space, shoot"
120.2,Luis,," Well, I had said that, um, I think they need to use like oxygen tanks in order to go to the moon"
120.2,Luis,,"Um, well"
120.2,Luis,," So, and that's equipment tools because they can't breathe on the moon"
120.2,Luis,,"I just wanted to remind you, my dad's actually an astronaut"
120.2,Luis,,"Um, yeah, I should be in this group, I already know all about space"
120.2,Luis,," I don't think I should be in this group, I already know all about space"
120.2,Luis,,Excuse me
120.2,Luis,,"Well, said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
120.2,Luis,,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
120.2,Luis,, Okay
120.2,Luis,,Oh
120.2,Luis,,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
120.2,Luis,," Um, I shouldn't be, and this group, I already know all about space"
120.2,Luis,, This is Luis
120.2,Luis,,"Excuse me, excuse me"
120.2,Luis,,um yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
120.2,Luis,,"yeah okay um excuse me teacher, yes, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
120.2,Luis,,"um well um okay well um I guess it's um I didn't circle anything in the reading um, but I just know that after scientists are astronauts on the moon, I know they need oxygen tanks 100%"
120.2,Luis,,I guess I skipped that part
120.2,Luis,,"Agile Teacher Lab: Well, I know, after our astronauts up on the mound looking for water they definitely are using oxygen tanks"
120.2,Luis,,um yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
120.2,Luis,,edu: Okay yeah I think I got this all figured out so i'm all good
120.2,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.2,Luis,,harvard
120.2,Luis,,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this room, I already know all about space"
120.2,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.2,Luis,,harvard
120.2,Luis,,"edu: Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I alreadyknow all about space"
120.2,Luis,,um yeah I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
120.1,Luis,,I'm not really sure
120.1,Luis,, I was gonna say the same thing that Jazmin said like when you're asked me to look for equipment
120.1,Luis,, I found two pieces of equipment
120.1,Luis,,"Oh no, I read the whole thing"
120.1,Luis,,"Okay, so I found the answer"
120.1,Luis,,"Yeah, so I guess like well do the astronauts need those tanks, like when they're looking at the water on the moon"
120.1,Luis,,"Then, then that means that they had to go there in order to find it"
120.1,Luis,,"Um, okay"
120.1,Luis,," Um, so the scientists sent, what the name of the thing"
120.1,Luis,,Um well for me I dont know
120.1,Luis,,Excuse me
120.1,Luis,,Um
120.1,Luis,, Is it the microscope? I'm not sure
120.1,Luis,,"I think the same stuff, like they use oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that"
120.1,Luis,, I think they used the same thing
120.1,Luis,,Okay okay
120.1,Luis,,"Um, ah, You mean nothing like that what you told Jazmin about?"
120.1,Luis,,Okay
120.1,Luis,,A new answer?
120.1,Luis,,"Oh there's tons of equipment well, they have the oxygen tanks and while they have to have a rocket ship if they're going to make it to space they use all sorts of things in that rocket ship, they have to have on the gross astronauts astronaut food there's so much stuff that they use"
120.1,Luis,,um
120.1,Luis,,Ah
110.4,Luis,,"Yeah, right I see that too, I see that too"
110.4,Luis,,Ok ok so scientists sent the Lunar Orbiter to the moon
110.4,Luis,,Crater
110.4,Luis,,I'm okay
110.4,Luis,," It's like when you got a space, you know and and or when you're looking for the telescope and then you see a new a new planet or no star, and you're like, oh wow you know like I discovered her new star, I discovered a new planet like that"
110.4,Luis,,And Ice deposits are frozen water
110.4,Luis,,"Oh, yeah, yeah"
110.4,Luis,,"Yeah,  they need to breathe when they're out there looking for the water"
110.4,Luis,,Says that they they used it to investigate and it looks for ice deposits and a large polar crater
110.4,Luis,,"Oh, OK, I see that make sense"
110.3,Luis,,Reacher Every Reader: possible
110.3,Luis,,Okay
110.3,Luis,,"Oh yeah, okay"
110.3,Luis,," Cool, yeah"
110.3,Luis,,That's cool
110.3,Luis,,"Yeah, I can"
110.3,Luis,,"Oh yeah, yeah, I think I'd be great to help on this question"
110.3,Luis,,Yeah
110.3,Luis,,"How, okay"
110.3,Luis,, And then they have to wait for a window in order to come back to Earth
110.3,Luis,,"I know that astronauts have to wear spacesuits, cause they can't breathe on the moon and in space"
110.3,Luis,, And I know that they have boosters that get them up into space
110.3,Luis,," And then they also wear gravity boots, so that they can walk on the moon"
110.3,Luis,,Okay
110.3,Luis,,Maybe I can teach you guys some stuff
110.3,Luis,, Yeah
110.3,Luis,,Okay
110.3,Luis,,I can do that
110.3,Luis,,"Okay, I can do that"
110.3,Luis,,"Oh yeah, yeah, sure"
110.3,Luis,, I'll tell y'all what I know
110.3,Luis,, So I was thinking that maybe Farrah needs to watch more more science videos
110.3,Luis,,"Well, I was thinking that you know how I learned a lot about science is by I'm watching YouTube videos and and and watching the show on on on Nova show on PBS"
110.3,Luis,,"Oh,"
110.3,Luis,,That sounds good
110.3,Luis,,"Yeah, I can do that"
110.3,Luis,,Okay
110.3,Luis,,OK
110.3,Luis,,All
110.3,Luis,,Yeah
110.3,Luis,," Okay, I can do that"
110.3,Luis,,"Okay, that sounds good"
110.3,Luis,,Okay
110.3,Luis,," Okay, so what I I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
110.3,Luis,, Yeah
110.3,Luis,,"Yeah, that sounds like fun"
110.3,Luis,, Okay
110.3,Luis,,Off
110.3,Luis,,I said oxygen tanks too and spacesuit
110.3,Luis,,Awesome
110.3,Luis,,Yeah
110.3,Luis,," Yeah, true, very true"
110.3,Luis,, Very good
110.3,Luis,,"Yeah, that sounds pretty good"
110.3,Luis,,All right
110.3,Luis,,"Yeah, awesome"
110.3,Luis,,"That's a good point, okay I'll stick around"
110.3,Luis,,"So, okay, yeah"
110.3,Luis,,Uh huh
110.3,Luis,,"Yeah, I can do that"
110.3,Luis,,Yeah
110.3,Luis,,Yeah
110.3,Luis,,"Okay, yeah, I can do that"
110.3,Luis,,Okay
110.3,Luis,,"Okay, yeah, I can do that"
110.3,Luis,,Yeah I know all about it
110.3,Luis,, My dad's an astronaut
110.3,Luis,,"Agile Teacher Lab: So, we could say, like all of the equipment for the answer"
110.3,Luis,,Okay
110.3,Luis,,"yeah yeah Okay, I can do that"
110.3,Luis,,yeah I get I can stick around for that yeah for sure
110.3,Luis,,"OK, I'll do that"
110.3,Luis,,"Yeah, sounds really cool"
110.3,Luis,,OK
110.3,Luis,,awesome yeah that sounds great i'm super into that
110.3,Luis,,Yeah
110.3,Luis,," Yeah, yeah, I can do that"
110.3,Luis,,Cool
110.3,Luis,, So thank you very much
110.3,Luis,,OK
110.3,Luis,," So now I know that I should explain my ideas or say them in my own words, even if they're the same as what somebody else said"
110.3,Luis,," Dallas, thank you so much for explaining what each of us needs to specifically work on"
110.3,Luis,," OK, well it looks like it is time for us to go to lunch, but I did want to say, Mr"
110.3,Luis,," And then I also heard you tell Jazmin what she should work on, too"
110.3,Luis,, OK
110.3,Luis,,"Yeah, cuz I mean, I read a lot about space"
110.3,Luis,,Yeah okay perfect spot
110.3,Luis,, That's my answer
110.3,Luis,,"Yeah, I, I'm kind of space expert on which is why I picked oxygen tanks"
110.3,Luis,, Okay
110.3,Luis,,"Yeah, yeah"
110.3,Luis,,Okay yeah that sounds great i'd love to do that
110.3,Luis,,Oh yeah I know everything about space I watch all the videos on YouTube all about space I pretty much know everything there is to know
110.3,Luis,,"Yeah, that sounds great"
110.3,Luis,,"Oh yeah, that sounds awesome"
110.3,Luis,,"Yeah, sounds great"
110.3,Luis,,I do
110.3,Luis,,"Oh, I know a lot about space because I watch all sorts of YouTube videos about rockets and all of the planets and stuff"
110.3,Luis,,"Yeah, I can do that"
110.3,Luis,,"Okay, yeah, that sounds great"
110.3,Luis,,"Oh, yeah"
110.3,Luis,,I thought so that's why I had to say it
110.3,Luis,,Okay that sounds good
110.3,Luis,,okay okay
110.3,Luis,,yeah okay
110.3,Luis,,"Okay um that there's no gravity in space, you know so like if you go there, you can kind of almost like fly like a superhero"
110.3,Luis,,Oh yeah I can definitely help out
110.3,Luis,,Oh okay okay well i'll be your teacher today guys
110.3,Luis,,um yeah I can do that sure
110.3,Luis,,"um yeah Okay, well, we we sent a machine into space and we needed all sorts of equipment and we needed oxygen tanks and we needed a microscope all we needed all sorts of things and they they sent the rocket and it smashed into the moon, and they found little pieces of ice"
110.3,Luis,,yeah um I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
110.3,Luis,,Oh yeah that's right here um what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
110.3,Luis,,"um well I guess we'll kind of what I was thinking, because a question was about the equipment"
110.3,Luis,,Oh wow I know scientists think it was a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
110.3,Luis,,That sounds awesome
110.3,Luis,,That would be pretty cool
110.3,Luis,,um okay well so i'm in the article
110.3,Luis,,"yeah Okay, I can do that"
110.3,Luis,,I sure did
110.3,Luis,,Oh yeah I can definitely do that
110.3,Luis,,I can tell you anything you want to know
110.3,Luis,,"Oh yeah, of course"
110.3,Luis,,"Okay, that sounds okay okay"
110.3,Luis,,"edu: Ya Sure ok, I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
110.3,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.3,Luis,,harvard
110.3,Luis,,What
110.3,Luis,,"Oh Oh yes, I do okay my favorite thing about space is how Pluto it used to be a planet and then, then they like kicked it out of being a planet because it was too small it's like poor pluto too small company"
110.3,Luis,,I guess so
110.3,Luis,,  Ok guys I'll be the reporter
110.3,Luis,,"Specialist okay Okay, I guess, I could do that"
110.3,Luis,,yeah yeah i'd love to hear that
110.3,Luis,,awesome
110.3,Luis,,"yeah, I guess, I can I can do that"
110.2,Luis,, Scientists can't breathe the astronauts can't breathe out oxygen tank
110.2,Luis,,Yeah
110.2,Luis,," Like, I know all about space, like, I don't think I should be in this group, because I don't really get answers about space like wrong"
110.2,Luis,,"Um, yeah, I guess this is kind of a question"
110.2,Luis,," Um, so here's the thing"
110.2,Luis,,"I didn't really read it so I can read it, I guess"
110.2,Luis,," But, um, so I guess no"
110.2,Luis,,"Well, I guess I didn't really like do the reading exactly"
110.2,Luis,, I kind of just like had my knowledge
110.2,Luis,," And I was thinking about, like, you know that they have other equipment that they use"
110.2,Luis,, That's not necessarily in the reading but but I know we're supposed to focus on the so yeah
110.2,Luis,, So I think for me like I was really interested in seeing like what kind of equipment they could use
110.2,Luis,,"Um, yeah"
110.2,Luis,,"Um,"
110.2,Luis,,Because we can while we can drink it and we can take a bath and I'm
110.2,Luis,,"Um, yeah"
110.2,Luis,," So imperative to, well, I underline the same thing like small machine"
110.2,Luis,,"Um, yeah, like water can be split into two parts"
110.2,Luis,," It can be, you know, hydrogen and oxygen"
110.2,Luis,,"Yeah, I, I also know that because I know a lot about space"
110.2,Luis,, So I know that they have to use oxygen tanks to yeah I know that
110.2,Luis,,"Yeah, I actually, I do because I know but the word orbit means like vehicles around something"
110.2,Luis,," So like if there weren't even astronauts, they wouldn't really need a microscope"
110.2,Luis,, And so I'm thinking maybe that that there weren't asked astronaut spec has it doesn't even say the word astronaut anywhere in the story
110.2,Luis,,yeah okay well my answer was actually that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
110.1,Luis,,Okay
110.1,Luis,,"Well, well, I was gonna say like they use it for"
110.1,Luis,,"Yeah, I could do that"
110.1,Luis,,Um no I corrected that let me see
110.1,Luis,, I'm looking to see if I can find it
110.1,Luis,,"Oh, yeah sure"
110.1,Luis,,Yeah
110.1,Luis,,Yeah I know all about it
110.1,Luis,,No problem
110.1,Luis,, So that's pretty
110.1,Luis,,"Well, I was gonna remind everybody that my dad is actually an astronaut"
110.1,Luis,,Yeah
110.1,Luis,,Okay
110.1,Luis,,okay
110.1,Luis,,"Nevermind, I'll wait"
110.1,Luis,,"Um, yeah"
110.1,Luis,, So I said that water can be split into two parts into hydrogen and oxygen
110.1,Luis,,Yeah
110.1,Luis,,I know a lot about space
110.1,Luis,,"Um, so yeah"
110.1,Luis,, If you're going to go up into space and like you're out
110.1,Luis,," Okay, so what I know from my like understanding and like my reading and everything I know about space is that you have to have like an oxygen tank and you have to have a space suits and like all that stuff"
110.1,Luis,,"Um, I'll me let me look down, um, water on the moon"
110.1,Luis,," Yeah, water on the moon"
110.1,Luis,,"Um, well I guess I mostly was thinking like about what I already do, so I guess I didn't read it that closely"
110.1,Luis,," I did read it, I just I just kept thinking about all those like spacesuits and all that, you know"
110.1,Luis,,"I did, I did read it"
110.1,Luis,,Okay
110.1,Luis,,I didn't really read very closely
110.1,Luis,,"I beat them and I say, ah, you can't do it as well as me and then I play the game and I get the most points and and I say you're a loser"
110.1,Luis,," So actually, um, so what I was thinking is that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and, you know, stuff like that"
110.1,Luis,," Um, and then also, like, you know, water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen"
110.1,Luis,,"Um, yeah"
110.1,Luis,,Asked about because that's what it says on a story
110.1,Luis,,Microscopic ice on the MOon
110.1,Luis,,I think I got it this time
110.1,Luis,,"Oh yeah, I totally well"
110.1,Luis,," I said that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and the part where I got that from was, let's see, where did I oh oh okay, in paragraph five, purify water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen"
110.1,Luis,," So for me, basically what I said"
110.1,Luis,,"Um, yeah, okay"
110.1,Luis,," Um, I think I should be in this group, because I know like all this stuff about space, like I practically know everything about space"
110.1,Luis,,"Um, wow, it's kind of more of a statement"
110.1,Luis,,Yeah
110.1,Luis,,"Oh, okay"
110.1,Luis,,"Excuse me, teacher, I don't think I should be in this group,I already know all about space"
110.1,Luis,,"So i'm right too, it could be oxygen tanks, or microscopes, or lunar orbiter?"
110.1,Luis,,A hack
110.1,Luis,,"For you fuel, which is what the as on Chris said that in 2024 they could have a gas station so being able to split up the hydrogen and oxygen efficiently would be very important, so you can have the breathing room and then the gas station"
110.1,Luis,,harvard
110.1,Luis,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.1,Luis,,edu: that's cool down for that
110.1,Luis,," So I was just gonna say like, I, I kind of already know"
110.1,Luis,,"Um, yeah"
110.1,Luis,, Like all about space and I don't really feel like I even need to be in this group
110.1,Luis,,Oh yeah
110.1,Luis,,Ok
110.1,Luis,,"Agile Teacher Lab: um yeah I, I also think it's valuable because if you split the water like I said i'm"
110.1,Luis,,"i'm sorry teacher, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
110.1,Luis,,"yeah yeah I would love to so Okay, my answer and I actually this way, but I also saw in the reading because I did look at the reading this time teacher um I did look at it, and I saw that the water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen"
110.1,Luis,, Kelsey?
110.1,Luis,,"Excuse me, Ms"
110.1,Luis,,I was gonna say I took it from the text
110.1,Luis,,Yeah yeah like I know a lot of a lot of equipment stuff
110.1,Luis,,"Yeah, yeah"
110.1,Luis,, Okay
110.1,Luis,,Okay
110.1,Luis,,Yes
110.1,Luis,,yeah yeah okay
110.1,Luis,,"um yeah I mean, so my answer was kind of like what Chris just pass I said, scientists, he has a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
110.1,Luis,,"um yeah well, excuse me um I I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
110.1,Luis,,Okay okay
110.1,Luis,,yeah yeah can I go
110.1,Luis,,"um excuse me, I I have something to say"
110.1,Luis,,yeah sure do
110.1,Luis,,Oh yeah okay
110.1,Luis,,I just use Jazmin's machine that NASA centers small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the water on the moon
110.1,Luis,,"um yeah Okay, so it asked what equipment did scients use to discover water on the moon"
110.1,Luis,,um yeah I shouldn't be in this group I already corrected my answer
110.1,Luis,,That was me that was me I also had that same idea
110.1,Luis,,Okay
110.1,Luis,,"Okay, my answer as that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks"
110.1,Luis,,yep definitely true
110.1,Luis,,"Oh um mine was kind of like what Chris just said, I said, scientists, they use oxygen tanks"
150.1,Oliver,,"Oh well, actually I I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now"
150.1,Oliver,," They use the Lunar Orbiter to um, they use the Lunar Orbiter to find the water and then I use the microscope to look at the water"
150.1,Oliver,,Okay
150.1,Oliver,, I know it was really really short
150.1,Oliver,,"I'm, I'm, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to a lunch"
150.1,Oliver,," And we just met, but I really appreciate how you really took the time to like listen to all of us and really try to help us take our time to find the answer, right everybody?"
150.1,Oliver,,"Guys, you know, I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch"
150.1,Oliver,, Okay
150.1,Oliver,," I said, Man, I was like, okay, a scientific tool is equipment on the water"
150.1,Oliver,, It's not the same as discovering okay
150.1,Oliver,,Well okay so yeah cuz I I I kind of had the same thinking
150.1,Oliver,," But yeah, I see what you're saying about looking"
150.1,Oliver,," Lawrence, I just looked at the clock, and it's time for the next group, so we'll have to see you later"
150.1,Oliver,,OK
150.1,Oliver,, Mr
150.1,Oliver,," Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch"
150.1,Oliver,, But thank you so much for working with us
150.1,Oliver,,"Um, yeah, I think that we are getting more comfortable"
150.1,Oliver,,"Um, yeah, I think that that makes sense because yeah okay that actually makes a lot of sense"
150.1,Oliver,," So like Farrah, you're saying that like basically like that, you know, if you use like a microscope to see the water after you find it"
150.1,Oliver,, First is that right
150.1,Oliver,, You have to find it
150.1,Oliver,,"Um, I guess, like what I was wondering, like, Um, okay, so like a small machine"
150.1,Oliver,," Well, okay, so I think that I'm beginning to understand, but can you help me understand just like super clearly like how the ok so the microscopes like not quite the right answer and I got the same answer as Farrah"
150.1,Oliver,,Yeah
150.1,Oliver,, I think I'm still not sure about because I have the same answer as Farrah
150.1,Oliver,,"Um, I'm not"
150.1,Oliver,,Reach Every Reader:It's me Oliver
150.1,Oliver,, So like they use something else to find the water and then they studied the water using the microscope
150.1,Oliver,,"Um, yeah, that makes sense"
150.1,Oliver,,"Um, well,I guess I didn't know because you had"
150.1,Oliver,," Um, so they, it was the, they sent like a microscope and something else?"
150.1,Oliver,,"Um, yeah"
150.1,Oliver,,Okay
150.1,Oliver,," Um, yeah, it's cause it's cards"
150.1,Oliver,, It comes first in the story
150.1,Oliver,,"Um, yeah, I have a quick question"
150.1,Oliver,," Um, so we were we were just discussing the text and looking at the question, how did scientists, or what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon"
150.1,Oliver,,That sounds great
150.1,Oliver,,um yeah
150.1,Oliver,,"Well it's time for us to go to lunch, but I do want to say, I appreciate um how are you kind of explain what each of us needs to work on and how we can improve our answers"
150.1,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Oliver,,harvard
150.1,Oliver,,"edu: Well, we want to thank you teacher for asking us questions cuz I I like how you you"
150.1,Oliver,,"So I I read that they weren't going to try to build a moon base on the moon by like 2024, and it was just making me think like"
150.1,Oliver,, It does
150.1,Oliver,, It was just that it was exactly the same because she circled the last sentence and I circled the last sentence too
150.1,Oliver,,Okay
150.1,Oliver,,Okay
150.1,Oliver,, You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
150.1,Oliver,, So I circle the last sentence in the text
150.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, sure, OK"
150.1,Oliver,,"Oh,"
150.1,Oliver,, We're so small they have to use a microscope to see it
150.1,Oliver,,By water
150.1,Oliver,,uh huh because
150.1,Oliver,,"yeah I think so, so we just have to say, both of the names of the equipment in our answer"
150.1,Oliver,,That she's gotta say stuff in her own words
150.1,Oliver,, She can't just pull the quote from the story
150.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, okay"
150.1,Oliver,, So when I was reading the
150.1,Oliver,,Well basically I wrote the same thing as Farrah
150.1,Oliver,,harvard
150.1,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Oliver,,edu: A small question
150.1,Oliver,,"So you're saying if Farrah has the same answer as me, then I should try to find a different answer?"
150.1,Oliver,," But I was just looking at the clock, and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch"
150.1,Oliver,,It's not a question
150.1,Oliver,," Maybe they used both, but I don't really see why it's not the microscope"
150.1,Oliver,,"Honestly, not totally like I got back"
150.1,Oliver,,All yeah I sure can she said that on the
150.1,Oliver,,"Well, actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch"
150.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, okay"
150.1,Oliver,, So in the part about where they actually find the water are talking about the small machine
150.1,Oliver,,"Well, some of us are right and some of us are wrong?"
150.1,Oliver,,"No, I think that sounds good"
150.1,Oliver,," I mean, I know what the microscope is a tool"
150.1,Oliver,,Not yet i'm i right now
150.1,Oliver,,"I'm still a little confused, actually"
150.1,Oliver,,"Oh yeah, well, I was thinking, like, how could you find something if you couldn't see it but i i got that maybe you have to find it first and then you can observe it"
150.1,Oliver,,I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch
150.1,Oliver,," Actually, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for coming today and for helping us understand why I'm the lunar orbiter was the best to answer for the question"
150.1,Oliver,," Um, so thank you so much"
150.1,Oliver,, So I was thinking it's not valuable because it takes too much money
150.1,Oliver,,"Well, I was thinking about another meaning of the word value like I'm like money and it talks about money and it says it would take a lot of money"
150.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, yeah, I do"
150.1,Oliver,,yeah so that's kind of like they use First they use the Lunar orbiter and then I use a microscope
150.1,Oliver,,Okay yeah sure
150.1,Oliver,,"Um Actually teacher Oh, something that is super exciting is that it's time for lunch"
150.1,Oliver,,"Oh, I think so um but I guess um I don't know how I would have picked that I think I think I still I still would have picked the microscope um until you told me to look at paragraph two"
150.1,Oliver,,"Agile Teacher Lab: On yeah i'm confused too because, while we both said microscope and there's evidence and the text but there's also the machine and I don't know what the right answer is"
150.1,Oliver,,"Well, actually I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch"
150.1,Oliver,, I think I would still pick the microscope
150.1,Oliver,, I said the microscope um and so i'm still a little unsure why it's the Lunar orbiter that's the right answer and how I would how I would have picked that on my own
150.1,Oliver,,i'm still a little confused cuz I said the same as Farrah
150.1,Oliver,,harvard
150.1,Oliver,,"edu: Yes, me i'm sorry to interrupt"
150.1,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
150.1,Oliver,,um yeah I I could see that yeah I could see that because maybe they don't they don't have it yet
150.1,Oliver,,Okay
150.1,Oliver,,yeah so what they did use a microscope at some point right
150.1,Oliver,,are so um yeah i'm still wondering about when they use it
150.1,Oliver,,"yeah well, we definitely will but right now we have to go to lunch"
150.1,Oliver,,Oh yeah I circled the same thing that Farrah did you
150.1,Oliver,,"I see that it's almost time for us to go, but I am thinking now okay so like it's not ready yet, but i'm like Chris said, like maybe by 2024 if they build a base on the moon, then they could"
140.1,Oliver,,"I'm not really into space, so--"
140.1,Oliver,,"I mean, I think aliens are kind of cool"
140.1,Oliver,," So yes, I'd be down to learn about that"
140.1,Oliver,,"Um, it's at the top and the bottom"
140.1,Oliver,,"Um, yeah, I sort of knew"
140.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, so, um, one on are playing a video game when I use my Xbox controller and that's equipment about are you so that's like a tool"
140.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, like an amoeba also have an hour with a cold amoeba"
140.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt you, Miss I burnt"
140.1,Oliver,, So thanks for working with us
140.1,Oliver,, I think I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch
140.1,Oliver,,Thank you
140.1,Oliver,," I wasn't really, I never really thought about it, I guess"
140.1,Oliver,,"Oh well, I don't think I never really thought about that before, like maybe there is water on the moon, maybe around the moon"
140.1,Oliver,,"i'm i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us see both the big picture and the sort of specifics of the equipment um That was a really helpful way, to put it Thank you so much"
140.1,Oliver,,"um yeah I mean that'd be pretty cool you know, and then I could just kind of look down at earth and I can be like hey everybody down there i'm just chilling up here, even though they probably couldn't hear me but it's a pretty cool thing to do"
140.1,Oliver,,"Oh, all sorts of things lots of teeny tiny little brains and everything was so much smaller than I thought it was"
140.1,Oliver,,"On i'm so sorry to interrupt, but I just looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch, right now, but I wanted to say"
140.1,Oliver,,"Okay yeah I think we learned this, I think we learned this in science, because we learned that water as an H two O, and I know that all is oxygen and the h is hydrogen"
140.1,Oliver,,"Well, I just locked up o'clock now and we have to go to lunch now"
140.1,Oliver,,Oh yeah and i'm not a scientist i'm i'm just a student
130.3,Oliver,,And that's how we discover discover
130.3,Oliver,,Oh
130.3,Oliver,,"Um, I had the same answer as Farrah"
130.3,Oliver,,So they use the Lunar Orbiter to like discover it and then microscope to like study it
130.3,Oliver,, So scientists to the question is like how what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
130.3,Oliver,," Oh, okay, yeah"
130.3,Oliver,,Scientists use the Lunar Orbiter
130.3,Oliver,," And you say, like right back scientists use the Lunar Orbiter to discover water on the moon"
130.3,Oliver,, which is the lunar orbiter
130.3,Oliver,,They use the equipment
130.3,Oliver,," Oliver, what's up?"
130.3,Oliver,,orbiter was arm
130.3,Oliver,, Thank you
130.3,Oliver,, We really enjoyed working with
130.3,Oliver,, But thank you so much for working with us
130.3,Oliver,, And I'm unfortunately we have to go to our next class
130.3,Oliver,,"Um, so I think that I understand that the equipment like the answer to the question is the Lunar Orbiter, but I think I'm still not quite sure why"
130.3,Oliver,,"No, no, and I, I was, I just want to say aw thanks teacher, it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch"
130.3,Oliver,,Can I just say it like how you said? A lunar orbiter was used to discover water on the moon
130.3,Oliver,,Okay
130.3,Oliver,, Can I do another answer
130.3,Oliver,," Um, can I try again"
130.3,Oliver,,um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch
130.3,Oliver,,"Teacher and I don't mean to interrupt you, but it's time for us to go to lunch"
130.3,Oliver,,"On I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say"
130.2,Oliver,,um yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense it's like they use one then they use the other
130.2,Oliver,,"Um yeah. I can do that because I had the same answer Farrah about the microscope and so, in terms of discovering the water The water so small that you can't discover something you can't see, so I would need a microscope to see it to discover it"
130.2,Oliver,,"Well, I mean that's The only other equipment that they have in the story is the Lunar orbiter"
130.2,Oliver,,Okay
130.2,Oliver,,Yeah I circled the same one
130.2,Oliver,,"Yeah, in paragraph three, the last one, it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
130.2,Oliver,, The question was whatequipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
130.2,Oliver,, Okay
130.2,Oliver,,"Yeah, sure"
130.2,Oliver,,"Was um was a microscope attached to, like, to the astronaut?"
130.2,Oliver,,"I mean, I guess it would be fine to grow stuff on the moon, you know, I guess"
130.2,Oliver,," I mean, I'd probably want to have video games or something up there, I think"
130.2,Oliver,,"Yeah, I actually did get a different answer because I was still kind of thinking that it was the microscope"
130.2,Oliver,," I feel like you know, like, that was really the equipment that they use to find the water"
130.2,Oliver,," So basically, um, I think that, well, it sounds like the microscope like"
130.2,Oliver,,Yeah
130.2,Oliver,,"So yeah, I wasn't sure how to make my answer better"
130.2,Oliver,,"Um, yeah"
130.2,Oliver,," No, I agree, and I think that makes sense to me"
130.2,Oliver,," If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a my first go to look really closely"
130.2,Oliver,, So the paragraph
130.2,Oliver,," Let's see, they say in the last paragraph, paragraph three, and they say that the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it"
130.2,Oliver,,"Um, yeah"
130.2,Oliver,, OK
130.2,Oliver,," So basically, my thinking"
130.2,Oliver,,"Um, okay"
130.2,Oliver,,Your said to Luis that he has to restate the question and an answer the question
130.2,Oliver,,"Well, I agree with Farrah"
130.2,Oliver,," I'm because I'm not really sure, like, well, Farrah had a question about it"
130.2,Oliver,,"Okay, we can do that"
130.2,Oliver,,"Okay, so, so it sounds that water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and and that it says that I should not breathe oxygen"
130.2,Oliver,, And that's important
130.2,Oliver,, Is that right?
130.2,Oliver,,"Um, yeah"
130.2,Oliver,, So I guess they used the microscope and the Lunar Orbiter
130.2,Oliver,," So I don't think I'm wrong, either"
130.2,Oliver,,"Well, I mean, in paragraph one it does say that there's the the the waters deep in the craters"
130.2,Oliver,, What's the microscope
130.2,Oliver,,Well i mean i i support
130.2,Oliver,, Cause my there's a tool as equipment and they're talking about looking at water and in that part of a story
130.2,Oliver,,"edu: I was pretty good, let me see you're sad you're sad the hydrogen oxygen is that rocket fuel, you said breathing"
130.2,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.2,Oliver,,harvard
130.2,Oliver,," I know it was a really short time, but I do appreciate how you helped us really look for the evidence in the story to put in our answer"
130.2,Oliver,,"Well, I'm sorry to interrupt, I was just saying that it's actually time for us to go to lunch"
130.2,Oliver,, I thought that I thought the same thing I Farrah
130.2,Oliver,,"Yeah, I am"
130.2,Oliver,," So I, I was thinking the same thing that that the microscope was the tool because you had to use it to see the the water"
130.2,Oliver,," But before we go, I just wanted to say thank you for encouraging us to add more detail and to really listen to and build on each other's answers"
130.2,Oliver,,"Yeah, well, actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch"
130.2,Oliver,, So I think part of part of the question was having an opinion
130.2,Oliver,,"Um, well, okay, I'm Jazmin, she said about how she read it and she she thought about it and look for evidence"
130.2,Oliver,," And I think I did something similar, but I actually came up with a different opinion"
130.2,Oliver,,"Um, yeah"
130.2,Oliver,, So
130.2,Oliver,,"Oh yeah, I had also picked equipment, actually"
130.2,Oliver,,"Oh yeah I agree, but i'm also um I don't really know how I would have figured that out if Chris hadn't told us about the suits and things, how would I have figured that out just on my own"
130.2,Oliver,,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay um my answer didn't change, it's still microscope and I circled the word microscope because it is in the third paragraph"
130.2,Oliver,,"edu: yeah cuz in paragraph six, they talk about how it'll take a lot of time and a lot of money and so that means that they don't have the time or the money yet so it's it's clearly not ready yet"
130.2,Oliver,,harvard
130.2,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.2,Oliver,,"um, yeah that makes sense, but it didn't really say that in the story, so I don't think I would have known that if Luis didn't tell me"
130.2,Oliver,,So
130.2,Oliver,,"that's that's really good answer, I agree with Chris about that, but I just I just looked at the clock and i'm so sorry but we we actually have to go to lunch, right now, but I really wanted to say, we really appreciate how you really took your time and"
130.2,Oliver,,edu: Um I circled equipment too
130.2,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.2,Oliver,,harvard
130.2,Oliver,,harvard
130.2,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.2,Oliver,,edu: Oh yeah I saw that one
130.2,Oliver,,So i'm Farrah do you want to talk first
130.1,Oliver,,I can read the question if you want me to
130.1,Oliver,,I agree what Farrah
130.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, because then you can like take a bath on your card arm drink it"
130.1,Oliver,," Like, like what"
130.1,Oliver,,"Um, yeah, I could try to see like"
130.1,Oliver,,"edu: yeah well well thanks teacher it's time for us to call, but I wanted to say, thanks for asking asking everybody about our thinking thinking that lead our answer so it it felt good to take some time to explain my idea, so you know I felt valued"
130.1,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.1,Oliver,,harvard
130.1,Oliver,," And in particular, I wanted to thank you for especially encouraging us to draw on our background knowledge"
130.1,Oliver,, Thank you for letting us share
130.1,Oliver,," But before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you for working with us"
130.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, I just was going to say unfortunately, we have to go to lunch"
130.1,Oliver,, That was really cool to be able to talk about the stuff that we already INAUDIBLE]
130.1,Oliver,,Oh that's all
130.1,Oliver,,"Oh OK OK, I guess I mean what I like I read the whole thing and I looked for all the key words and I found I found that sentence with the key words in it"
130.1,Oliver,,"Oh, okay, I need to look for that because I thought a microscope and that's pretty important"
130.1,Oliver,, And the question was about the word discover because that helped us well at least that helped me really understand what the best to answer was
130.1,Oliver,,"I'm, I'm really sorry, but we have to go"
130.1,Oliver,," I wanted to say before we go, thank you for really helping us understand the question"
130.1,Oliver,,"Okay, I feel like I didn't see the word discovery"
130.1,Oliver,,um I also read that there could be a base on the moon by
130.1,Oliver,,Oh um that could be it
130.1,Oliver,,"um this is Oliver um I just I just looked at the clock and unfortunately it's it's time for us to go to lunch, right now, but thank you so much for really helping us use evidence from the text and our answers that's going to be really helpful next time"
120.4,Oliver,,yeah i'm I circled the same as Farrah
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, that they use the microscope to look closely at the water"
120.4,Oliver,, But before we go to lunch
120.4,Oliver,," I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and, like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you"
120.4,Oliver,,"So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch"
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, yeah, I think what was really interesting to me about this one was like the fact that there was just like, you know, the fact that there's so little water like it's all spread across the surface, but they were still able to find it using the microscope"
120.4,Oliver,, What I circled the same thing
120.4,Oliver,," Um, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Oliver,,"On well I circled the same thing as Farrah on the bottom of the page we I didn't like circle it because she circled it, but we had, we had the same answer"
120.4,Oliver,,"Oh, I couldn't figure out what was wrong because I thought the microscope was right"
120.4,Oliver,, I think what was interesting was mostly the fact that I'm like well
120.4,Oliver,,"Well, that's a great question"
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, yeah, so I thought the equipment"
120.4,Oliver,," I think that the microscope, I agree with Farrah"
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, so my answer was basically that I had I you know I circled the same thing as as Farrah"
120.4,Oliver,, And I think the same thing that the microscope was was what they used to discover
120.4,Oliver,, Do you need assigned a tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.4,Oliver,,"Well, I mean, I had that same as Farrah, because I circled the last what she thought was the last sentence and I I circled the last sentence"
120.4,Oliver,, So I don't know
120.4,Oliver,,I mean was different from there
120.4,Oliver,," They said, Yeah, but I said no"
120.4,Oliver,, It's not ready yet
120.4,Oliver,, I said no
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, yeah, we found some stuff"
120.4,Oliver,," She said that it was, um, the Lunar Orbiter"
120.4,Oliver,, I think
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, so I saw I listened to Jazmin's answer"
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, okay"
120.4,Oliver,, So I was thinking that no and mostly because it's not it's not ready
120.4,Oliver,,I'm gonna say convincing
120.4,Oliver,, So I said that
120.4,Oliver,," Um, no, like, I didn't think the evidence was very convincing because it's not ready yet"
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, yeah"
120.4,Oliver,," So basically, my response was, I circled the same thing as survey"
120.4,Oliver,,Yeah
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, well, I found the same thing"
120.4,Oliver,," Um, but I thought one is talking about"
120.4,Oliver,," Not even was saying, but they have also have a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter"
120.4,Oliver,," I spend only in paragraph one paragraph three, or they're really talking about the water"
120.4,Oliver,," I'm sorry to interrupt, but I was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch"
120.4,Oliver,," Um, but I did want to say thank you so much for"
120.4,Oliver,,"Me, My family"
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, I guess I saw the same thing cuz I I just kept seeing microscope, and I kept thinking about microscopes for some reason"
120.4,Oliver,, I don't quite understand
120.4,Oliver,,"No, I was gonna say the same thing as Farrah, but I'm still kind of wondering why our answer is wrong like why the two of us is our answer is wrong"
120.4,Oliver,,"Well, I had read the same thing that Farrah was talking about in the last paragraph"
120.4,Oliver,,"Well, I was just looking at the clock and I i see about it's time for us to go to lunch"
120.4,Oliver,, So I just wanted to let you know before we call
120.4,Oliver,," So my answer was no, you know, I'm because I don't think it's ready yet"
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, OK"
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, so I circled the part that says very small kind of for the same reason, but like the fact that you have to use a microscope to look at the ice deposits"
120.4,Oliver,,"Well,"
120.4,Oliver,,"I said, equipment and discover"
120.4,Oliver,,"Um,"
120.4,Oliver,," So it looks like um Farrah and I circled at the beginning, we circled the microscope, because that seemed like the equipment that was probably used to see the water that was so small, but um"
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, yeah"
120.4,Oliver,,"Oh yeah, um, well actually, at the end, maybe I'm thinking a little differently um like, I was thinking, so you'll have to use all the things to discover the water, is that the idea?"
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, yeah"
120.4,Oliver,, So I was thinking when you said like more detailed like that we need to use like
120.4,Oliver,,"So my answer was, I said no because it's not ready yet"
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, I"
120.4,Oliver,," You know what I mean like that we can't, we can't just use the water because it's all ice, you know"
120.4,Oliver,,"Yeah, I kind of had a similar thought that basically no it's not ready yet"
120.4,Oliver,, If we're right then what's wrong with with my answer?
120.4,Oliver,,"Well, I mean, I, I circled the same thing as Farrah"
120.4,Oliver,," Um, so I guess I mean I don't know why I'm in this group"
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, okay, well i i had the same answer as Farrah cuz I I said the thing, the same thing about how they went um, so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely um cuz"
120.4,Oliver,,um okay so basically what I said okay so initially what I had said was that I circled the same as Farrah Farrah
120.4,Oliver,,"i'm so actually I understood a lot, so I was thinking about it, and then, when you were talking to Luis and Jasper, it really made me think that like"
120.4,Oliver,,I circled ah microscope
120.4,Oliver,,That
120.4,Oliver,,"edu: The same ones, I guess, everybody else because also the only two that I saw"
120.4,Oliver,,harvard
120.4,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Oliver,,yeah um well I took all the same thing
120.4,Oliver,,"Well, I was looking at my answer when you told us to all look for where we found everything, but I circled the last sentence, just like Farrah"
120.4,Oliver,," So I was just trying to think if what you told Farrah, I guess, is the same for me"
120.4,Oliver,,"um yeah, I guess, for me, I, so I read that they weren't going to put a moon base on the moon, maybe by 2024 That was the goal, and I was wondering like"
120.4,Oliver,,"um so yeah I thought that Farrah was right and I, I found that evidence myself what I noticed was that"
120.4,Oliver,,"Well, so I actually have my opinion is that water um yeah I can see that it's valuable like it's not that it's not valuable"
120.4,Oliver,,"yeah so I said i'm like Farrah I said no, because it's not ready yet"
120.4,Oliver,,Same thing
120.4,Oliver,,I have that same answer us Farrah
120.4,Oliver,,"i'm sorry teacher, but I was just looking at the clock and it's time for the next group so we'll have to see you later"
120.4,Oliver,, So I don't think there is another answer
120.4,Oliver,,"Well, I mean, it was this-- I think that's the right answer though because it talked about the equipment and what it does, and it's looking at the water"
120.4,Oliver,,"edu: Okay, well, I I had a circle, the same thing I Farrah because mine came from the third paragraph to it says um"
120.4,Oliver,,harvard
120.4,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Oliver,,"Oh, I'm so sorry but I just looked at the clock and actually it's time for us to go to lunch"
120.4,Oliver,,"Okay, it's on scientists to use a microscope to discover water on the moon, and I found my answer in paragraph three"
120.4,Oliver,,"Yeah, well,"
120.4,Oliver,," Sorry to answer because you can told Jazmin, but I still don't really understand why it's not the microscope from Part three, because that's also equipment and they also needed to find the water"
120.4,Oliver,," I'm like, I know you said that"
120.4,Oliver,,"Well, um, this is Oliver I heard you say Lunar Orbiter"
120.4,Oliver,,"Well, we agree that the microscope was a piece of equipment and they probably used it to to look at the water and then the only other piece of equipment we saw was the small machine"
120.4,Oliver,,Okay
120.4,Oliver,," Well, I think the key word as equipment, because you have to know that you're looking to find a tool to answer the question"
120.4,Oliver,," So I'm not sure I agree with Jazmin, because what I'm thinking is, if the water is so small that you can't even see it without a microscope, then how can you find it if you can't even see it"
120.4,Oliver,,I do have a question
120.4,Oliver,, Yes
120.4,Oliver,,"Oh yeah okay well yeah cuz my, my first answer was the same as some animals about the microscope"
120.4,Oliver,," I don't see why it's not the miscroscope, because it sounds like they used that too, right?"
120.4,Oliver,," as Farrah, and, and I still don't"
120.4,Oliver,,"I get that they sent the lunar orbiter, but I cricled the same answer"
120.4,Oliver,, AND NOW
120.4,Oliver,,Okay
120.4,Oliver,," Um, so I thought the microscope"
120.4,Oliver,, IT WAS THE RIGHT ANSWER
120.4,Oliver,," Well, now I know about the lunar orbiter is the right answer, but I don't really know how I would have known that I'm without without Jazmin telling us"
120.4,Oliver,,"Okay, so, um, I think, a part that you're talking about is the part in part two, where it says about looking for the ice deposits, because I guess the water was not just water"
120.4,Oliver,, It was ice and they found it as ice ice form
120.4,Oliver,, But there was one other tool
120.4,Oliver,,"Okay, well, um, before we have said down microscope, and I think we still bought kind of think about microscope might be right"
120.4,Oliver,, And that was the Lunar Orbiter
120.4,Oliver,,Yeah
120.4,Oliver,," Um, so my answer is the microscope"
120.4,Oliver,, Can I go
120.4,Oliver,,Yes
120.4,Oliver,, So thank you so much
120.4,Oliver,,"On actually I just looked up clock and we have to build a lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for having us look back at the text and look for really detailed answers on that was really helpful"
120.4,Oliver,,"Yeah, so, um, we have to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you because you listened to each one of our answers and you asked every one of us"
120.4,Oliver,,"Um, yeah, it's all what equipment did scientists to was to discover water on the moon"
120.4,Oliver,,um the question is asking what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon
120.4,Oliver,,um yeah so um they said it's microscopic um they also said it's ice
120.4,Oliver,,um yeah so I circled the same thing as some fan oh okay
120.4,Oliver,,What okay um I just had a quick question because all that stuff about the plume of dust and everything that's really cool but I don't know how I want to know that i'm
120.4,Oliver,,"Okay yeah I was saying, I was thinking well it says it'll land at the south Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater"
120.4,Oliver,,"Yeah sorry to interrupt you teacher, but I was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go so well i'll see you later okay"
120.4,Oliver,,um well i've just been kind of listening to what everybody else was saying um so I haven't changed mine yet um
120.4,Oliver,,um yeah well I had circled the same thing as Farrah
120.4,Oliver,," I circled that last sentence in paragraph three, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Oliver,,"Well, I was talking about the grand Canyon I was talking about remember"
120.4,Oliver,,"um well, so I said the same thing as Farrah about the microscope um because that's a scientific tool and they talked about in the story"
120.4,Oliver,, don't you need a microscope
120.4,Oliver,,"yeah well um it's sort of sounding like lunar orbiter's the right answer um, but I still think there's evidence about the microscope um how can you find something if it's too small to see"
120.4,Oliver,,yeah I can share so
120.4,Oliver,,"Okay Well, this is so, I changed my answer so first I said the microscope like Farrah did, but now now, I think, maybe they were just saying that it's really small so"
120.4,Oliver,,"yeah it's really, really interesting um and one thing I thought was really kind of especially interesting about it was that on when they found the water, it was so small"
120.4,Oliver,,"um well, I thought equipment also um like Farrah did um but I guess another important word would probably be water"
120.4,Oliver,,Um yeah we both circled the microscope
120.4,Oliver,,"Okay um so I wasn't sure, but I heard Chris and Luis saying that Jazmin's  answer was right, so I I said um NASA sent the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon"
120.4,Oliver,,um well investigate makes me think of like a detective searching for clues
120.4,Oliver,,Agile Teacher Lab: And I got this
120.4,Oliver,,"yeah well I think we did, but i'm still a little confused about why it's my not the microscope like why that isn't exactly the right answer"
120.4,Oliver,," Because I was sort of thinking, how can you discover something if you can't even see it yeah I mean, I guess, I guess they use that small machine, but I still think that microscope is the right answer"
120.4,Oliver,,What did you discover for that I said find
120.4,Oliver,,"Yeah, yeah well so um it sounds like the right answer is actually the Lunar orbiter and"
120.4,Oliver,,yeah okay well I forgot the same answer as Farrah that is um microscope
120.4,Oliver,,yeah um
120.4,Oliver,,yeah I circled the same as Farrah
120.4,Oliver,,"um yeah well, I would just say i'm actually I circled the same as Farrah"
120.4,Oliver,,I know teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's actually time for us to go i'm so off to see you later okay
120.4,Oliver,,"um yeah well, I suppose same thing as Farrah"
120.4,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.4,Oliver,,"edu: Okay yeah I got it so what the teacher saying Farrah it's a microscope was used to look at the water, but the Lunar orbiter it was used to look for the water"
120.4,Oliver,,harvard
120.4,Oliver,,yeah I think the microscope was the equipment they used
120.4,Oliver,,"Oh yeah we both said for the appointment, we both said i'm microscope"
120.3,Oliver,,I can read it
120.3,Oliver,, So question one is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
120.3,Oliver,,"Um, yeah, okay"
120.3,Oliver,,"Oh yeah, sure"
120.3,Oliver,," Okay, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate"
120.3,Oliver,, Okay
120.3,Oliver,,Sorry to interrupt Mr Teacher
120.3,Oliver,, But I was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch so we'll have to see you again later
120.3,Oliver,," Okay, so, paragraph two, um, let's see"
120.3,Oliver,,sure
120.3,Oliver,," These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one--"
120.3,Oliver,,"Okay, um, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate"
120.3,Oliver,, This lunar orbiter orbiter will land at the Moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
120.3,Oliver,,The Lunar Orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
120.3,Oliver,,I'm not sure
120.3,Oliver,," So it says, um, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon would be valuable"
120.3,Oliver,,Sure
120.3,Oliver,, Okay
120.3,Oliver,," Okay, so, um,"
120.3,Oliver,,"Um, yeah, I can read it"
120.3,Oliver,,"Yeah, I can do it"
120.3,Oliver,,"Okay, so it says on your needle scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.3,Oliver,,Um okay
120.3,Oliver,, These ice deposits are very small
120.3,Oliver,, This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
120.3,Oliver,," Um second paragraph, and number two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate"
120.3,Oliver,, And I swear
120.3,Oliver,,"Okay, one word or can be useful and other ways"
120.3,Oliver,, I swear I'm
120.3,Oliver,," Okay, um, water can be broken down into parts hydrogen and oxygen"
120.3,Oliver,, Cause that was my answer was a microscope
120.3,Oliver,, Yeah
120.3,Oliver,,"Know, you'll be used the um the microscope"
120.3,Oliver,,"We can read super fast, so we we did our two minutes"
120.3,Oliver,,Okay um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
120.3,Oliver,, These are still deposits are very small
120.3,Oliver,,It says NASA sent a machine called all Lunar Orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar quarter
120.3,Oliver,,All okay
120.3,Oliver,,Okay um what equipment did scientists use to find water on the moon
120.3,Oliver,," Okay, so we're looking for the equipment that scientist us to discover water on the moon"
120.3,Oliver,,Yeah okay this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar greater
120.3,Oliver,, On what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the mound
120.3,Oliver,,Yeah
120.3,Oliver,,Okay um so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.3,Oliver,,Mhmm yeah
120.3,Oliver,,"Okay yeah okay that's what equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon, so all the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question"
120.3,Oliver,,"edu: Like Oh, they want me to study the surface and don't know"
120.3,Oliver,,harvard
120.3,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
120.3,Oliver,,"um well actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to and valuing all of our answers"
120.3,Oliver,,"I can do it, um okay equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question"
120.3,Oliver,,"yeah Okay, right here on the question as what equipment that scientists use or discover water on the moon"
120.3,Oliver,,looks like it's looking for deposit
120.3,Oliver,,"Excuse me on i'm so sorry I really don't want to interrupt, but I just looked at the clock and"
120.2,Oliver,,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
120.2,Oliver,,"Well, I said no, there isn't any evidence because they haven't been able to get to the moon to find evidence because it's gonna take a lot of time and money"
120.2,Oliver,,"Well, we came to the same answer, basically"
120.2,Oliver,,Okay
120.2,Oliver,," Well, you said that it was what Jazmin and Chris said, but I, I don't understand why me and Farrah are wrong"
120.2,Oliver,,"Yeah, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter investigate"
120.2,Oliver,, This is the one that Chris just read right?
120.2,Oliver,,microscope
120.2,Oliver,,I thought it was pretty easy
120.2,Oliver,," It's not the microscope, but I thought it was the microscope"
120.2,Oliver,, But I guess since we're in this group
120.2,Oliver,,I think it's the microscope
120.2,Oliver,,"Excuse me, Miss Brown? I'm sorry to interrupt"
120.2,Oliver,,"I wish we had time to hear another answer, but actually we have to go to lunch, but this is a really fun class"
120.2,Oliver,, I don't want to end
120.2,Oliver,,um excuse me teacher it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later okay
120.2,Oliver,,i'm trying to and I love to teach I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch
120.2,Oliver,,"Oh yeah okay i'm so sorry I know we both thought about the answer to the question about equipment was on the microscope and since she she started first, so I just said, I circled all the same thing, instead of repeating"
120.1,Oliver,,Uh huh
120.1,Oliver,," Like, what would I add?"
120.1,Oliver,,I'm not sure
120.1,Oliver,,Okay so art or science teacher always talks about microscopes
120.1,Oliver,,I don't see anything that said discover in the story I'll look again
120.1,Oliver,, That's the second stop
120.1,Oliver,,"Um, well you did say that, um, you can't look if you're looking at the water than your, you have to first"
120.1,Oliver,," So then, um, I guess I have to look for the first step I gosh"
120.1,Oliver,," So basically, um,"
120.1,Oliver,,Yeah
120.1,Oliver,,"Um, let's see, I guess"
120.1,Oliver,," But I was listening to what you're telling everybody else, and I think you did help me think about if i'm answering the question and to try to find all the evidence and the answer"
120.1,Oliver,,"yeah well, I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go"
120.1,Oliver,,"Um, well, I would say like scientists use the microscope to discover water"
120.1,Oliver,," Well, before I do that, I just wanted to say I'm Oliver"
120.1,Oliver,,"Um, yeah"
120.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, I'll look"
110.4,Oliver,,"Water, and water"
110.4,Oliver,,"Like, like, yeah, when you find it"
110.4,Oliver,," And it says,"
110.4,Oliver,,"I was in paragraph one, it says, water is heavy"
110.4,Oliver,," Teacher, it's time for us to go to lunch, but wow I really, really appreciate how"
110.4,Oliver,,"Oh wow, okay"
110.4,Oliver,, I was just looking at the time and it's time for us to go
110.4,Oliver,,Sorry to interrupt
110.4,Oliver,, So we'll have to see you later
110.4,Oliver,," I just looked at the clock, it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say"
110.4,Oliver,,"Excuse me, must go on"
110.4,Oliver,, And we actually have to go to lunch now
110.4,Oliver,, I just locked up a lot
110.4,Oliver,,I'm so sorry
110.4,Oliver,,yeah i'm so sorry but it's time for us to know
110.4,Oliver,,"Um well so actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I want to say this was such a helpful class"
110.4,Oliver,,"Well, actually I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now, but before we go, I wanted to say thank you so much for being so welcoming of all of our answers and helping us see that we didn't have to just pick one that there was room for more than one idea Thank you so much"
110.3,Oliver,,"edu: Okay, I found it so it was in the um third paragraph"
110.3,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.3,Oliver,,harvard
110.3,Oliver,,um well actually I looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now all but I wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to all of our answers and taking the time to help us understand the meaning behind the text and the microscope that was so helpful Thank you so much
110.3,Oliver,,"Okay um well I I circled the same as Farrah, which was the microscope I think it was a microscope to look really closely about about little water at Chris was just reading about"
110.3,Oliver,,Okay um I just want to make extra sure I understand the answer to the question so as there's the right answer both the right answer is like lunar orbiter plus microscope equals right answer
110.2,Oliver,,"Okay, um, but, but, but, but, okay"
110.2,Oliver,," So, but I read it and it does say it such that they talk about the water in paragraph three"
110.2,Oliver,,"Um, yeah"
110.2,Oliver,, I just wanted to take a moment and thank you so much for working with us
110.2,Oliver,, But before we go to lunch
110.2,Oliver,," So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch"
110.2,Oliver,," Um, I have to read it through again"
110.2,Oliver,,"Um, I'm not sure"
110.2,Oliver,, Okay
110.2,Oliver,,"Um, well, I actually read somewhere that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so maybe it would be useful faster than Farrah and I thought"
110.2,Oliver,,"Okay, so you're saying I'm"
110.2,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.2,Oliver,,harvard
110.2,Oliver,,edu: um well I I said it wasn't ready yet so I said no too
110.2,Oliver,,"Oh okay teacher, I just looked at the clock it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you for kind of"
110.2,Oliver,,edu: i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but it's time for us to go so we'll see you later
110.2,Oliver,,harvard
110.2,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.2,Oliver,,"Well, I'm thinking because you're asking that maybe it does"
110.2,Oliver,,"Um, well, I said, pretty much the same thing as Farrah, um, you know, like I thought it was the microscope"
110.2,Oliver,,well
110.2,Oliver,,Thanks
110.2,Oliver,,"um yeah i'm so sorry um I just looked up a clock and we actually we have to put a lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand how"
110.2,Oliver,,"um yeah so actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much, I feel like you gave each one of us a strategy to help make our answer better on, and that was really helpful, thank you"
110.2,Oliver,,"Oh OK, so we could say either one"
110.2,Oliver,,"yeah well, I thought i'm sorry um it was interesting how they said that the water is is really, really small it's actually like a really, really, really small pieces"
110.2,Oliver,,i'm so sorry
110.1,Oliver,,"Well, I mean, yeah"
110.1,Oliver,," What I liked about, you know, like my answer, um, which Farrah had the same one true, um, was that the question asked her about, um, let me see the question asked her about equipment and a microscope is like a tool"
110.1,Oliver,, When you asked us all a say or answer
110.1,Oliver,," So first, I'm not"
110.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, yeah"
110.1,Oliver,, And it's the same thing that I found too
110.1,Oliver,, I heard hurts
110.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, I said the same thing"
110.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, I have that same answer"
110.1,Oliver,,I pretty much use the same thing
110.1,Oliver,," Like, I looked at the third paragraph and that was where I found like what I was mostly looking"
110.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us"
110.1,Oliver,, So thank you so much
110.1,Oliver,," Um, it was really cool to have you like helping us"
110.1,Oliver,," So I pretty much said the same thing as Farrah, and I circled the same area"
110.1,Oliver,,"Um, yeah"
110.1,Oliver,,We can breathe oxygen
110.1,Oliver,, But I did want to say that I appreciate it
110.1,Oliver,, How you kept asking about
110.1,Oliver,,I'm trying my supporting but I was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go
110.1,Oliver,,so what I chose
110.1,Oliver,, What was that it was the microscope
110.1,Oliver,," I think I know the words, but I was wondering about equipment because I basically said the same thing as Farrah"
110.1,Oliver,,I answered the same as Farrah
110.1,Oliver,,Awesome
110.1,Oliver,,Yeah
110.1,Oliver,, I also saw equipment and I thought like water too was maybe an important word
110.1,Oliver,,"Um, yeah, I agree with Farrah"
110.1,Oliver,,Oh yeah
110.1,Oliver,, I'm sorry to interrupt
110.1,Oliver,, Thank you
110.1,Oliver,," I know this was really, really short, and we just met, but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch"
110.1,Oliver,," But I really appreciate how you really just took some time to really listen to every single one of us, and I mean I didn't say anything, but you really listen to everybody sharing their ideas, and that was really nice"
110.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, I, I found it on my own but since you had asked Farrah"
110.1,Oliver,," First, I was just trying to say that I had the same answer, but I didn't like copy off for her talk to her to find it"
110.1,Oliver,,"Um, well, I guess, I guess I'm not sure because like you have, you have like the microscope, but you would study it and then you have like Jazmin, said the Lunar Orbiter"
110.1,Oliver,," I know this was really short and and we just met, but"
110.1,Oliver,,I'm sorry
110.1,Oliver,, I'm sorry to interrupt teacher
110.1,Oliver,,"Um, yeah, basically the same as Farrah, and for me like I was thinking about science equipment and discover, and so I also think that like it has to do, especially with the microscope"
110.1,Oliver,, So what I was thinking was when I was looking through the reading
110.1,Oliver,, I was seeing like so in the in the question
110.1,Oliver,,"Um, yeah"
110.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, that's right"
110.1,Oliver,, My name is Oliver
110.1,Oliver,,Okay
110.1,Oliver,," Oh, thank you so much teacher for really helping us by by telling us the things that we did do well and then I'm like helping us to look back at the story again to find our answer"
110.1,Oliver,," We just have to look and look again and look even closer at the story to find more information, I guess so"
110.1,Oliver,,"Well, I can see that it's time for us to go to lunch, and I know it was really sharp, but I do appreciate how you told us that we have"
110.1,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.1,Oliver,,harvard
110.1,Oliver,,"edu: So that we all did really well, I thought that I thought that i'm"
110.1,Oliver,,"Okay, okay, okay"
110.1,Oliver,,"Okay, I see one more piece of equipment in paragraph two"
110.1,Oliver,,Uh huh
110.1,Oliver,,Agile Teacher Lab: um well I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch now
110.1,Oliver,,"So, it flies flies through space"
110.1,Oliver,,"yeah so she went first I figure I don't have to say, the exact same thing as her because I found that same answer"
110.1,Oliver,,"Okay, I see your machine called the Lunar orbiter"
110.1,Oliver,,harvard
110.1,Oliver,,"edu: teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch, but I want to say thank you for for helping us i'm really look for more details in the story, because I thought I did find everything but that one you said to read and highlight I found more"
110.1,Oliver,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, to look really closely"
110.1,Oliver,,"Okay, okay, I'm"
110.1,Oliver,,I'm sorry
110.1,Oliver,," I didn't mean to interrupt you, but I was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to watch"
110.1,Oliver,,Uh huh
110.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, I circled that same thing"
110.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, it's, it's in the first sentence where it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate"
