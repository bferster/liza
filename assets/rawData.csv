67,Teacher,yes Luis your question.,Question,Respond,,remark,0,1,4
67,Luis,yeah i'm okay I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"that's awesome if you're, then you can help us figure out these couple questions so we're so glad to have you in this group, and you can you can kind of help us to follow the prompts of the, the question that we were that we were answering so i'm so glad you're here all right",,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,So we all as wild cats were talking about water on the moon right? All right,,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,yeah Farrah what What was your response to the prompt you remember?,Question,Respond,,remark,0,1,4
67,Farrah,yeah okay um I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"that's that's totally correct I think we'd all agree with you that if you had a microscope you would use it to look at water really closely, although let's think about what happens before that point right",,,130.1,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"And Oliver I think you said this, did you say the same thing is that right.",Question,Respond,110.1,remark,0,1,4
67,Oliver,yeah yeah same thing as Farrah,,,,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,awesome so Farrah and Oliver get awesome points for circling the parts in the text prompt because that was the the direction so A+  direction for following points,,,310.1,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"So let's think about before we actually look at water with the microscope what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water they found on the moon, so they use the microscope after they had found it, but what did they use to find it Do you remember",,Raise Hand,210.2,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"hi Jazmin I see you've got your hand. we're going to wait because i'm i'm talking to Farrah and deb because this is specific to the question that they that they asked is that OK OK, I put a pin you i'll come back to you",,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
67,Farrah,"As well Okay, you said, what do they use before the microscope and I guess, I guess, I don't really know I don't understand why my answer is wrong.",,Respond,110.1,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"Your answer isn't it wrong that they use the microscope to look at the water, but in the text that we just read It describes a piece of machinery that the scientists use to locate that water on the moon",,,410.3,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"Can you and Oliver work together to go back to the text and figure figure out what that machine was called, is that cool?",Task,Discuss,420.3,remark,0,1,4
67,Farrah,yeah yeah we can work together we work together really well,,,,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"awesome awesome okay Farrah and Oliver will pair up and and find the answer to that question, thank you folks",Task,,130.2,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,Okay Jazmin,Question,Respond,,remark,0,1,4
67,Jazmin,"Okay well Okay, I said NASA sent a small machine",,,,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,that's right you totally did and NASA did send a small machine,,,110.4,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,Do you remember what they called that machine science has all sorts of wacky names for their machines so that's what we're looking for we're looking to see if we can find The name of what that small machine was. Do you remember?,Question,Respond,210.4,remark,0,1,4
67,Jazmin,I don't know if I could remember but I have to look so yeah,,,,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"yep totally yeah look at the text look back, I think it's close to that same line about the small machine i'm not sure, but let us know",Task,Read,210.4,remark,0,1,4
67,Jazmin,"Okay, and NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter",,Respond,,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,nailed it yes Jazmin high five hashtag awesome lunar orbiter is the name of the machine great,,,110.4,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"Farrah and Oliver are you ready to come back to us with an answer, or do you want me to to investigate some other answers first",Question,Respond,210.3,remark,0,1,4
67,Farrah,"Okay well um so we we saw where it said lunar orbiter and we also heard you tell Jazmin that lunar orbiter is the right answer, and so I guess, I guess, I know that now, but I don't know um how I how I would have picked lunar orbiter instead of microscope does that make sense",,,210.3,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"I yeah totally um so the microscope if you look at the are three sentences Here are three paragraphs In paragraph three, it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you would need a scientific cool tool called a microscope to look really closely so there's the part with the microscope but, if we go before then. We see where you found it called the Lunar orbiter and paragraph two right?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"It says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and so that is the question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, not to look at it afterwards, does that make sense",Question,Nod Yes,210.2,remark,0,1,4
67,Farrah,Oh yeah okay okay so First they find it with the orbiter and then then also it's like they then they like study it they study it with a microscope,,Respond,210.2,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,Totally You got it,Affirmation,,110.4,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,Oliver are you are you on board with that,Question,Respond,130.2,remark,0,1,4

67,Teacher,let's hear it,Question,Respond,,remark,0,1,4
67,Chris,I went to NASA yeah I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"You nailed it they absolutely do they use so much equipment in science and NASA and they get to play with like lasers all day and I am jealous of them, yes thumbs up",Affirmation,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"So let's see Chris what answer, did you put for the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",Question,Respond,120.4,remark,0,1,4
67,Chris,"Oh man oh I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch. But I wanted to say thank you so much for coming in and bringing so much energy and helping us learn in such a fun way I didn't know that this was going to be so fun looking at this article, and I just wanted to say thank you for listening and explaining but also making it fun",,,120.4,response,0,1,4

67,Teacher,um so I was wondering if I could get them volunteer to share Their answer and what they were thinking,Open Question,Verbal Response,120.4,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"Like where where they found their answer in the texts, yes Farrah",,,230.2,remark,0,1,4
67,Farrah,"OK, so my answer is that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely on and about my my thinking so I found it in part three, and it talks about how the water is microscopic and you can't see it without a microscope",,,230.2,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,yeah awesome so you identify and equipment,Affirmation,nod yes,110.1,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"now um can I get someone else let's build on samantha's answer can I get someone else to talk about how This microscope would allow us to discover water so then we got the first part of the question right the equipment and now, can we get someone to think about how that connects to the discovering waterpark yes Oliver",Open Question,Verbal Response,130.2,remark,0,1,4
67,Oliver,"Um yeah. I can do that because I had the same answer Farrah about the microscope and so, in terms of discovering the water The water so small that you can't discover something you can't see, so I would need a microscope to see it to discover it",,,130.2,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"amazing yeah I love that and and I love that you are you agree with Farrah and you're adding more to the answer and together, you guys have collaborated on Even better answer",Affirmation,smile,310.1,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"So yes, great so you have this microscope and we're saying that we need it because to discover the water, because the water is so small that you wouldn't be able to see it otherwise awesome ",Affirmation,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,yes Jazmin,,Raise Hand,,remark,0,1,4
67,Jazmin,So I have a different answer on My necessary such a small machine And I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,230.3,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"Your answer is not around, I think that there are multiple answers here right so we've identified one equipment you actually",Explanation,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"i'm glad you brought this up, because I was just about to ask what other answers people had, so why don't you share a little bit about what you were thinking with your answer",Open Question,Verbal Response,230.1,remark,0,1,4
67,Jazmin,"Okay, so I found that in Part two And it's in the very first sentence, it says NASA Center small machine",,,230.1,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,yeah and what does the machine call,Open Question,Verbal Response,210.4,remark,0,1,4
67,Jazmin,A lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"awesome a lunar orbiter now let's have someone else add to that answer, so how did that allow scientists to discover water on the moon? Yes, Luis",Open Question,Verbal Response,130.2,remark,0,1,4
67,Luis,"Okay, so the Lunar orbiter I think it's kind of like a robot thing, and it can go into the craters the dark the dark moon graders and that's how it can find that that tiny, tiny water",,,,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"tiny water well can, yes I love that, so we have this lunar orbiter and it's going into this polar crater and it's looking for the small water and where's the small water located in",Affirmation,nod yes,210.4,remark,0,1,4
67,Luis,and greater,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"And what form so so, is it like we're looking for a giant lake so we're looking for what can we yeah well for me, what form is the water in what is the same, the text in part two, yes don't",Open Question,Verbal Response,210.4,remark,0,1,4

67,Teacher,"yeah I did I am so happy to hear that you already know so much about or like you went to NASA that's really awesome i've always wanted to go check out like nasa's and facilities and museums and I think you and Luis probably have a lot to talk about feed both share the interest in space, thank you for sharing",Affirmation,smile,110.3,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,yeah so definitely a lot of different equipment and even in this reading right we've already identified two different,Affirmation,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"and I love that you guys are really using the reading and pointing to specific parts and sentences in the reading to help equipment that allow us to discover water on the moon You come up with your answer and I think we already, so now we have identified two different equipments and you guys were able to build on each other's answers to",Explanation,nod yes,310.1,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"Add on, you know how exactly those equipment were used to discover water on the moon right, so I think each of you had like a piece of it, and then we just had it to we just needed to add on to that, so we have the microscope And that microscope was used so actually sorry um",Explanation,,130.1,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,Let me just stop pause for a minute and see if you guys have questions yeah Farrah,Open Question,Verbal Response,150.1,remark,0,1,4
67,Farrah,"Okay, well, so my question is, is it Okay, if I just say the microscope or do I have to less like all of the equipment, like the microscope and the orbiter and the oxygen tanks and masks and things",,,150.1,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,"Well, so I think that first you use, you can start with one right and then focus on really building that answer out Ray so identifying the the scientific the scientific equipment And then being able to explain how that equipment was used to discover water on the moon, and then, once you've gotten that you can add on to your answer ",Explanation,nod yes,420.2,remark,0,1,4
67,Teacher,yes Oliver,,Raise Hand,,remark,0,1,4
67,Oliver,"i'm i'm so sorry I just looked up a clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for encouraging us to build on our answers but also build on each other's answers on and make them way better that was so helpful Thank you so much",,,420.2,response,0,1,4
67,Teacher,You guys enjoy your lunch,,,,remark,0,1,4

69,Teacher,"Okay, I think, part of what we're doing right now is this isn't just about our knowledge of what we're learning we're going to think about the evidence we're looking for in that text to OK, so the background knowledge is going to be great and it's going to help us To understand a little bit what we're reading, but we specifically also want to look for evidence right",Explanation,nod yes,220.1,remark,0,0,3
69,Teacher,"and that's deb that's what I was going to ask you to read, is that second part of the question, there you see where it says circle",Task,Read out loud,120.3,remark,0,0,3
69,Chris,"yeah I can do up um it says circle, the evidence and the text that we can use to answer this question",,,,response,0,0,3

69,Teacher,and we're going to keep our eyes open,,,420.3,remark,0,0,3
69,Teacher,"And to recap we're going to look for that evidence so let's let's do a quick reread as a group of this so to keep going around Chris, if you wouldn't mind reading the first paragraph there, where it says one For the name of the equipment they use",Task,Read out loud,120.3,remark,0,0,3
69,Chris,"yeah okay um part one, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the rooms polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines",,,,response,0,0,3
69,Teacher,"Excellent Jazmin could you read the second paragraph, for us",Task,Read out loud,120.3,remark,0,0,3
69,Jazmin,"yeah, I would like to because this is where I found my answer it says",,,120.3,response,0,0,3
69,Jazmin,Okay NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these isotope posits are very small,,,,response,0,0,3
69,Jazmin,"And so, my answer was from this park it's a NASA scientist small machine, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,0,3
69,Teacher,"Well let's think about it, how can we make that even more specific Jazmin because you're absolutely right, they did send a small machine, how can we were in the text, can we find something that's going to give you even more specific information about that small machine",Open Question,Verbal Response,420.2,remark,0,0,3
69,Jazmin,Oh well in the part I just read it says they use it to investigate and look for iced deposits,,,420.2,response,0,0,3

69,Jazmin,name is,,,,remark,0,0,3
69,Teacher,"Excellent, so I would say, if you added that to your answer that would make it Nice and specific",Explanation,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
69,Teacher,"does so, what other folks think about this now is that where we want to agree as an answer go ahead Farrah",Open Question,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
69,Teacher,"So Okay, we might have found our answer in the second paragraph we're thinking that perhaps the equipment that they used is this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",Explanation,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
69,Farrah,"And so I found my answer and part three, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and that's evidence from the text also",,Verbal Response,130.2,response,0,0,3
69,Teacher,"yeah and you pulled out something very specific and you found another piece of equipment that was method mentioned in the text, which is very good, as well",Affirmation,,310.1,remark,0,0,3

69,Luis,"yeah you got it Okay, that means that the moon Estelle drier than the driest desert on earth water they found as a microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.3,response,0,0,3
69,Teacher,"Thank you so much Okay, so the question is asking us what equipment and scientists use yes Chris",Open Question,Raise Hand,120.2,remark,0,0,3

69,Teacher,Nice yeah they do use a lot of equipment yeah,Agree,nod yes,110.1,remark,0,0,3
69,Teacher,"That is yeah and I think there, we can see, even in this very short text that we see two different pieces of equipment mentioned right we sad the lunar orbiter and we're seeing this thing about a microscope so even just in a few sentences we're seeing multiple pieces of equipment, but how do we decide which one is the answer to this question right",Explanation,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
69,Teacher,"So what equipment, did they use to discover water on the moon",Open Question,,120.2,remark,0,0,3
69,Teacher,did they did this third paragraph tell us that the scientist used the microscope to find the water,Explanation,,210.4,remark,0,0,3

71,Farrah,"Oh yeah so my answer was i'm a scientist, You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Why did I say it all cuz I think that was the answer to the question, and it was in the story, and we had to find our enter in the store",,,,response,1,1,2
71,Teacher,"Okay, so you read it in the story I love that you found it in the story",Affirmation,smile,310.1,remark,1,1,2

71,Teacher,"Okay, and our question is what equipment did the scientists use so does that sentence mentioned that the scientists actually use a microscope Farrah",Question,Verbal Response,210.3,remark,1,1,2
71,Farrah,"Oh um in that sentence, no, I guess you need us, Oh no I guess I don't know",,,,response,1,1,2
71,Farrah,but we want to find a piece of equipment that the scientists actually used here,,,410.2,remark,1,1,2
71,Teacher,yeah so I love that you picked up on the microscope because it's really important when we're thinking about the word microscopic,Affirmation,smile,310.1,remark,1,1,2
71,Teacher,"Okay, so Oliver you had the same answer is Farrah, can you tell me why you put that answer as well",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
71,Chris,"um yeah yeah, I can tell you Oh, you know what while he's looking did you I went to NASA and I do know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
71,Teacher,"yeah so Chris you're right Those are all great examples of equipment, so you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, can you tell me more about that answer",Question,Verbal Response,230.1,remark,1,1,2
71,Chris,"yeah i'm cause I was looking for where they were talking about looking for water because that's what the question was asking about discovering water and in the first paragraph, they they say that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
71,Teacher,yeah so Oliver I love what you know about NASA and you're using evidence from the reading,Affirmation,smile,310.1,remark,1,1,2
71,Teacher,"can you read the question for me, what is the question actually asking Chris",Task,Read out loud,120.3,remark,1,1,2

71,Chris,"yeah I was looking for the keywords about like discovering water on the moon, and in the first paragraph there's a part where they say water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters so that kind of felt like it",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,Luis can I have just a second,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2

71,Chris,Just the first one,,,120.3,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,Did scientists yeah so we're thinking about equipment Chris Chris does your answer mentioned equipment,Question,Verbal Response,210.3,remark,2,1,2
71,Chris,It doesn't,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,"awesome so Chris, I want you to go back to the text, and I want you to find me a piece of equipment that the scientists use okay okay okay awesome okay Luis i'm ready for you",Question,Verbal Response,420.3,remark,2,1,2
71,Luis,yeah okay um I don't think i'm a should be in this group I already know all about space,,,420.3,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,"yeah, so why don't you tell me more about your answer, let me just say your answer",Question,Verbal Response,230.1,remark,2,1,2
71,Luis,"And I will, because I know that scientists use oxygen tanks to read",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,"yeah Luis that's awesome background knowledge, thank you for bringing that background knowledge so",Affirmation,smile,310.1,remark,2,1,2
71,Teacher,"We are trying to use this text, so does this text mention those oxygen tanks at all Luis",Question,Verbal Response,210.3,remark,2,1,2
71,Luis,"Um Okay, to be honest, I didn't really read that whole thing cuz I figured I already knew the answer",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,"awesome well Luis I have a job for you, I want you to look at this text and find me a piece of equipment that the text mentions okay Luis",Task,Read,420.3,remark,2,1,2
71,Luis,Okay,,,420.3,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,awesome,,,,remark,2,1,2
71,Teacher,"Alright, so",,,,remark,2,1,2
71,Teacher,Farrah and Oliver you had the same answer so Dave i'm going to ask you to start Oliver what made you say your answer,Question,Verbal Response,230.1,remark,2,1,2
71,Oliver,"Oh Well, maybe I think that's the answer to the question",,,,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,"say more, why is it the answer to the question Oliver",Question,Verbal Response,230.1,remark,2,1,2
71,Oliver,i'm cause the questions asking arm what equipment data scientists used to discover water on the moon and i'm in this in this part of the story house,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
71,Oliver,"they're talking about water, the found, and then they also named a piece of equipment which is a microscope so it's got science water they found and the microscope in",,,,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,Farrah was your reasoning similar to Olivers for why you said this answer was it different,Question,Verbal Response,230.1,remark,2,1,2
71,Farrah,"um I mean, I guess, he was pretty similar yeah I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
71,Farrah,"Because if it answers the question about a science equipment, the microscope has the equipment and they are using it to look at the water",,,,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,yeah so I love that you both know that microscopes are used to look at small things and that you were able to pull that out of the text,Affirmation,smile,310.1,remark,2,1,2
71,Teacher,My question for both of you is did the scientists actually use that equipment when they were working on the moon,Question,Verbal Response,210.3,remark,2,1,2
71,Teacher,can you reread that chunk of the text for me,Task,Read out loud,120.3,remark,2,1,2
71,Farrah,"Let me see, This means the moon is dry, the water they found us microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it, we need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,2,1,2
71,Farrah,"I mean, I guess, I don't say bye all of all, there are looking I thought microscope alone",,,,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,yeah that's right it doesn't really say that the scientists are using that,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
71,Teacher,At least here in this case so Farrah and deb I want you to look back at the text and see if you can find a piece of equipment that the scientists used when they were discovering the water so look back at the text and see if you can find a better piece of equipment,Question,Verbal Response,420.3,remark,2,1,2
71,Teacher,"All right, Jazmin",,,,remark,2,1,2
71,Teacher,yeah Chris oh yeah,Question,Verbal Response,,remark,2,1,2
71,Chris,cuz I was just listening to the conversation and I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and,,,,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,yeah they do Chris,Explanation,none,110.1,remark,2,1,2
71,Teacher,"Chris, did you find the piece of equipment in the text, yet oh",Question,Verbal Response,,remark,2,1,2
71,Chris,yeah sorry I got distracted I was listening um yeah I think it's the Lunar orbiter,,,,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,Oh okay Jazmin You said something like that didn't you,Question,Verbal Response,230.3,remark,2,1,2
71,Jazmin,yeah I said NASA send a small machine,,,230.3,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,"yeah so Jazmin can you say more about where you found that in the text, or why you said that",Question,Verbal Response,230.2,remark,2,1,2
71,Teacher,Because I think it relates to Chris's answer here yeah,Explanation,none,,remark,2,1,2
71,Jazmin,I found it in the second paragraph and it's the very first sentence yeah that one was mine too,,,,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,"yeah so that's awesome so it's in the text you both found this in the text, so my question for you is what does this small machine do Jazmin what is the machine doing",Question,Verbal Response,210.4,remark,2,1,2
71,Jazmin,It lands at the moon South Pole and looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,Alright um and does that sound like scientists could use that to discover something?,,,,remark,2,1,2
71,Jazmin,It looks for well yeah yeah cuz it's looking for ice so that's something,,,,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,They could yeah so we have to look for something to discover it,Task,yes/no,210.4,remark,2,1,2
71,Jazmin,yeah yeah,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,"yeah so Luis What did you find you were reading, what did you find for me",Question,Verbal Response,120.4,remark,2,1,2
71,Luis,i'm the same thing that they found that the Lunar orbiter,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,"yeah Farrah and Oliver have you guys were both reading, did you find something similar or something different to Harris and Jazmin and Luis",Question,Verbal Response,130.2,remark,2,1,2
71,Oliver,"Well, I mean that's The only other equipment that they have in the story is the Lunar orbiter",,,130.2,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,"Great job everyone, so how has your thinking changed, I want you to write in your reflection journal how has your thinking changed from when we started this activity",Task,Write,530.1,remark,2,1,2

71,Oliver,"Thank you for helping me use evidence from the text in my answer and arm and It made me feel valued when you asked me kind of questions about my answer sometimes teachers just tell me about how wrong I am, and so I I appreciate it",,,,response,2,1,2
71,Teacher,"Well, thank you for putting in hard work today",,,,remark,2,1,2
71,Oliver,Okay bye teacher see you next time,,,,response,2,1,2

73,Luis,"yeah yeah before we do that, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"Well i'm really glad that you feel like you have a good understanding of space, but we're just gonna we're just gonna talk really about that answer real quick i'm excited to hear what you have to share though at the at the end, whenever we get to your turn",Explanation,none,110.3,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"Farrah repeat for me what your answer was, real quick",Question,Verbal Response,120.4,remark,0,1,3

73,Teacher,Wonderful. ,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,Chris?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3

73,Teacher,Nice and Jazmin,Question,Verbal Response,120.4,remark,0,1,3
73,Jazmin,"Okay, well, I said that NASA send a small machine",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
73,Teacher,Great,Affirmation,smile,120.4,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,and Luis,Question,Verbal Response,120.4,remark,0,1,3
73,Luis,yeah okay well i'm scientists they use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,120.4,response,0,1,3
73,Teacher,Absolutely so so let's first like talk about that question when we say the word equipment what what do we mean what does equipment mean,Question,Verbal Response,210.2,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,Can somebody Can somebody answer that question for me yeah Oliver what's equipment,Question,Verbal Response,,remark,0,1,3
73,Oliver,"Okay um as like a tool, or something you use to do something",,,,response,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"Absolutely so let's say I asked you to write down your answer on a sheet of paper, what kind of equipment, will you be using for that",Question,Verbal Response,210.2,remark,0,1,3
73,Oliver,"Oh, like a pencil",,,210.2,response,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"Absolutely absolutely so you guys, all I think should have an understanding of what this word equipment means",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"So now let's look at the second part of this of this question, we want you to circle, the evidence in the text, so when we say that we want you to circle, a specific maybe word or words",Task,Write,,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,Vecause we're thinking about this this word evidence evidence is basically just it just means proof,Explanation,none,210.2,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"So when we talk about what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon, I want you to kind of circle, a word or two anybody circle two words or did you guys all circle one word",Question,Verbal Response,420.3,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,Jazmin yeah,Question,Verbal Response,,remark,0,1,3
73,Jazmin,"So I circled two words I circled small machine and I don't understand why, and I answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"Well i'm I wouldn't necessarily say that your answer is wrong, but I think that maybe there's a more specific answer to what it could be",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"So if we're talking about what the equipment, maybe the equipment has a name right",Explanation,none,210.4,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,So what does that small machine have a name does anybody anybody circle what that small machine is called,Question,Verbal Response,210.4,remark,0,1,3
73,Jazmin,"I can, I can look",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
73,Teacher,that'd be great,,,,remark,0,1,3
73,Jazmin,Okay um NASA such a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"Great So if I were to ask you again what kind of equipment, do they use what would you would What would you circle",Question,Verbal Response,120.4,remark,0,1,3
73,Jazmin,"So, so I just need to circle, then maybe I just need to circle lunar orbiter?",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
73,Teacher,yeah that'd be that'd be that'd be a great thing a lot of times you might look for keywords,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,Farrah yeah,Question,Verbal Response,,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"So for saying what equipment did scientist use discover water on the moon, maybe you can look for keywords like like the name of the equipment, because well the Lunar orbiter is a small machine it's also it's a lunar orbiter is a more specific example Farrah yeah",,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
73,Farrah,"Okay well microscope that's also equipment so um, why is it the Lunar orbiter and not the microscope",,,420.3,response,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"Well that's The great thing this answer has multiple answers and sometimes you want to circle, as many as you can",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"So microscope is a great example of one piece of equipment that they use, but they also use this use this this thing called the Lunar orbiter to investigate, and those things work together",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"So if we're looking at both of those sentences, if you guys want to look at your sheet of paper if you're looking for those two words that lunar orbiter and that microscope, are there any words that kind of signal to you what the equipment is?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,How the sentence is structured is there anything is there anything there,Question,Verbal Response,,remark,0,1,3
73,Farrah,"yeah well, it says that there's it's a scientific tool, so that tells me it's equipment",,,,response,0,1,3
73,Teacher,Absolutely,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"who remembers when Oliver asked what equipment was and Oliver said that it's like a tool right, so you can look for kind of key words like that Chris do you have a  question",Question,Verbal Response,420.3,remark,0,1,3
73,Chris,yeah well actually it's a comment um so I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,Explanation,none,420.3,response,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"Absolutely, and you are, you are, you are correct and, but when we're asking you in this question is to circle, the evidence, so we want you to draw your answer from something specifically that you read here",Explanation,none,430.2,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,A lot of times you can use background knowledge to to answer questions,Explanation,none,,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,Luis was telling us that he knows a ton of stuff about about space and you seem to also have a good understanding and those are definitely things that some astronauts use,Explanation,none,430.2,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"But if we're reading this article, we want to draw specific examples coming from that",Explanation,Nod yes,430.2,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,Does anybody have any questions about about what I mean when I say specific examples,Question,Verbal Response,150.1,remark,0,1,3
73,Chris,"Oh, so it has to be from the story",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"Absolutely, yes, that is what evidence is it's called textual evidence, it means you're drawing your answer from that source",,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,Sometimes you'll have to deal with multiple sources like we might watch a video and then read an article,,,,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"But if i'm asking you a question, where i'm asking like what equipment did scientists use and then i'm telling you this circle your answer on that your answer needs to come from what you just read",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,"So like a couple people just circle microscope and that's a great example, but there are multiple tools like you just pointed out  that come from these things",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,Does that make sense to everybody does anybody have any clarifying questions that that they have yeah def,Question,Verbal Response,150.1,remark,0,1,3
73,Oliver,"Oh well, actually I I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
73,Oliver,"But before we go, I just wanted to say thank you so much, because your explanations were were really specific and that really helped us understand why each one of our answers could could be even better, so thank you so much",,,,response,0,1,3
73,Teacher,Absolutely Thank you so much for for being willing to learn today really appreciate hard work going into that lunch,,,,remark,0,1,3
73,Teacher,hey everybody how's it going um,Greeting,smile,,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,The first thing I want us to talk about when we're here in this group is I want you to think what is this question asking,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,what what does it mean to circle evidence,Question,Verbal Response,220.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher, yeah Luis,Question,Verbal Response,220.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Luis,"um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,220.1,response,1,1,3
73,Teacher,um i'm glad you're really excited to learn about space um Luis,Affirmation,smile,110.3,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,and I noticed that your answer um you definitely say a lot of equipment that scientists do use so i'm assuming you've probably done some sort of independent research or reading on this,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,"so can somebody tell me, and I want to see your hands raised, what does it mean to find evidence",,,510.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,But we're really focused on trying to find evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question,,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,yeah Farrah,Question,Verbal Response,,remark,1,1,3
73,Farrah,okay um evidence means like a word or a sentence that's in the story that you use when you answer the question,,,,response,1,1,3
73,Teacher,Absolutely that's great that is a great definition of what evidence is right when we're talking about evidence we're thinking about what words do I see in this text or reading that help me answer this question,,,510.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,"Okay, so now we're looking at this first part of the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,"Alright, so we're talking about the sort of evidence or the sort of equipment that scientists use to get to that water or to find that water, not the evidence that sort of looks at it",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,so a couple of you put that they would need a microscope right,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,and while a microscope is part of the process we're trying to think about the equipment that scientists need to get to that,,,,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,so can someone try to find a part in the text where they see which equipment scientists use to discover the water,Question,Verbal Response,430.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,Jazmin yeah,Question,Verbal Response,,remark,1,1,3
73,Jazmin,"I think I found that equipment in my answer, I said NASA sent a small machine, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,1,1,3
73,Teacher,So um Jazmin what you did was you definitely got the answer correct,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher," right, you, you know you know what sort of equipment scientists use to discover equipment on the moon uh to discover water on the moon",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,but where i'm a little concerned because you didn't find that textual evidence right,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,so like Farrah said evidence is the kind of thing that we circle in an answer or in the text to help us discover that answer,,,,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,"so while NASA does send a small machine, we're looking for a certain word or group of words that tell us exactly what that machine is called or what it does",,,,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,so we're trying to circle maybe a sentence or a few words,,,430.2,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,Does that make sense?,Question,Verbal Response,150.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Jazmin,um yeah but I did that,,,150.1,response,1,1,3
73,Jazmin," Um the first part, the first sentence in paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine",,,150.1,response,1,1,3
73,Jazmin,And is there a second part of that sentence that tells you maybe what it's called or like the name of an equipment called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
73,Teacher,"Absolutely, so when we're trying to find like the name of an equipment like this question asks, the what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, we're looking for the name of something right",,,,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,"so we might look for cue words or leading words, like called, like you notice how called is before that, so that's a great example of a word that we might that we might use",,,510.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,Is anybody still unsure of what evidence means or is that something we all understand? raise your hand if you know what evidence is,Task,Raise Hand,150.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,"All right, um Chris, can you explain to me what evidence is",Question,Verbal Response,510.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Chris,"Okay, um so like Farrah said it's like um something um from the story that answers the question",,,510.1,response,1,1,3
73,Teacher,Absolutely,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher," So Oliver if I asked you what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,  how would you answer that using this textual evidence",Question,Verbal Response,210.3,remark,1,1,3
73,Oliver,"Okay, well, I mean I guess it sounds like the right answer is, you know, lunar orbiter um, and that's in the text, but I kind of think there's evidence that um the microscope's the right answer too",,,210.3,response,1,1,3
73,Teacher,"Absolutely, sometimes there's two parts right, you can be half right but sort of be be missing something right, you know",,,,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,sometimes you want to look for multiple things so you might want to circle all of the text in the answer that gives us that,,,,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,Just because an answer is right doesn't mean it's a full answer,,,,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,so Farrah and Oliver both circled microscope,,,430.2,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher," that is a half the answer um but you would also look for something that helped them, you know sort of get to the water and like how they were able to look closely",,,430.2,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher," Chris, you have a question",Question,Verbal Response,430.2,remark,1,1,3
73,Chris,Will I um I went to NASA so I know that scientists use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,430.2,response,1,1,3
73,Teacher,"Absolutely and that's something that like Luis put into his answer right and like those are correct, but we're looking at what this question is asking us",,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,right so um I want you guys to whenever you're  thinking about finding evidence to be circling things in the text,,,,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher," right, you can use your prior knowledge to sort of help guide you",,,,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,does that make sense?,Question,Verbal Response,150.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,"But when we're looking for evidence, we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help us",,,510.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Chris,So I have to find the equipment in the story,,,150.1,response,1,1,3
73,Teacher,Absolutely yep you want to look in the story for where you can find these answers,,,510.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,"alright, so can somebody tell me how maybe they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation",Question,Verbal Response,530.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,Yeah Oliver,Question,Verbal Response,,remark,1,1,3
73,Oliver,"um okay so um I guess what I learned is that um I should read the story really carefully because um, even if I have part of the answer I might be missing part of the answer",,,,response,1,1,3
73,Teacher,"Absolutely, what about you Jazmin",Question,Verbal Response,110.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Jazmin,Um I learned to make sure that I read the whole sentence or or that my answer is really clear,,,110.1,response,1,1,3
73,Teacher," Chris, what about you",Question,Verbal Response,110.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,Absolutely,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Chris,"Okay um I learned that if it says evidence, you have to say something in the story",,,110.1,response,1,1,3
73,Teacher,"Absolutely yeah no, these are all great observations about how our thinking can change by sort of learning a new piece",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,"right all of you guys were missing a little part of your answers, none of you guys were completely wrong",,,,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher,"But there was like a little parts that concern me and I wanted to help you guys sort of find that you can fix those answers, by looking for things like evidence and complete answers",,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
73,Teacher, Oliver yeah,Question,Verbal Response,230.3,remark,1,1,3
73,Oliver,um i'm sorry but it's time for us to go now,,,230.3,response,1,1,3

76,Farrah,Oh yeah yeah okay so,,,120.3,response,1,1,1
76,Farrah,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on moon,,,,response,1,1,1
76,Teacher,"All right guys I want you right now to look at this question, and I want you to underline in this question, what you think the most important word or the key word is in this question",,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher, Yes,,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher, Luis,,,420.1,remark,1,1,1

76,Teacher, Okay,,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher,"Well, I completely understand that and I can tell from your answer that you do know a lot of things about space because you talked about oxygen tanks and so I can tell that you do know a lot about space, but I just want us to help drill in on this specific answer for this question",,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
76,Luis,Okay,,,110.3,response,1,1,1
76,Teacher,Do you mind reading this question for me and finding this word that you think is really important in it,,,420.1,remark,1,1,1

76,Teacher, Those are both very important,,,110.4,remark,1,1,1
76,Farrah,I just was wondering because it seems like okay so we said equipment,,,110.4,response,1,1,1
76,Farrah," I was just wondering like why my answer was, was wrong",,,110.4,response,1,1,1
76,Farrah, Because I like I feel like microscope is equipment,,,110.4,response,1,1,1
76,Teacher,A microscope is equipment,,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher," Yes, but I want us to look in our question and I want us to find an action word because, so far we've underlined equipment and we've underlined water, but we haven't underlined our action word",,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher,"So right now, everybody to find action word and underline",,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher,"An action word is like a verb, and it tells us what you're gonna do with that equipment to that water",,,210.1,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher, Does anyone want to raise their hand and tell me what they think the action word is,,,120.4,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher,Okay,,,120.4,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,1,1,1
76,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,1,1

76,Oliver," Yeah, that seems like the one",,,,response,1,1,1
76,Teacher, And does anyone know,,,230.1,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher, Can someone tell me what discover means?,,,230.1,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher,That is absolutely correct,,,230.1,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,1,1,1
76,Jazmin,"Discover basically means to like find something, like to discover buried treasure",,,,response,1,1,1
76,Teacher,So we're specifically looking for a piece of equipment that was used to discover the water or to find the water,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher,Good,,,310.1,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher, I really like how you use your background knowledge to answer that question,,,310.1,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher, You told me about a tool that's used to look at the water and we're not looking at the water really closely,,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher,"So Farrah with your question, you tell me about a tool which was great",,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher, But when you tell me about the tool,,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher," What are we trying to do to the water, guys",,,410.2,remark,1,1,1

76,Teacher," We're not trying to look at it, Chris, did you have something to tell me",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher,We're trying to discover it,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
76,Chris," Like, that seems like it's important",,,210.2,response,1,1,1
76,Chris,"Um, yeah, I was just thinking like, Well, I went to NASA with my dad so I know that scientists use a lot of other equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, and I guess I was like that when we talked about like what equipment",,,210.2,response,1,1,1
76,Chris," It feels like that's missing from the, from the reading or I don't know",,,210.2,response,1,1,1
76,Teacher," What is it, it's specifically asking us about water right",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher, And I think it's really cool that you got to experience that,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher,"Yeah, all those things are really important",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1

76,Teacher, So what does equipment main guys,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher,So in this one it's going to tell us about the equipment that's used for water,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher,Oliver?,,,,remark,1,1,1
76,Oliver,It's like machines or or things you use to help you do something,,,,response,1,1,1
76,,Good,,,110.4,,1,1,1
76,Teacher,So we are going to look back in our passage,,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
76,,"So right now we are trying to answer the question, what equipment",,,120.2,,1,1,1
76,, So it's like a machine that we're going to use or like a tool,,,110.4,,1,1,1
76,Teacher, So I will everybody to get back into their passage,,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
76,Teacher," Yes, Oliver",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1

76,Luis," And like, that's how come I know so much about space",,,140.1,response,2,1,1
76,Teacher, So I am sure that you are going to do a great job when we look back for this specific tool because you probably heard of it before,,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,"Yeah, I am so glad that you know so much about space",,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,"So we're going to look at, paragraph two, okay",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, So I just want you to listen while I am reading and if we find a particular equipment we might stop and talk about it,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, Okay,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,Now they sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher," So what is a small machine, what's another word, maybe one that's in our question",,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, That means the same thing,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,2,1,1
76,Jazmin," It's a piece of equipment, right, like it's something you could use use",,,,response,2,1,1
76,Jazmin,So like a small machine,,,,response,2,1,1
76,Teacher, So a small machine is a piece of equipment and what is this piece of equipment called?,,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,Good,,,110.4,remark,2,1,1

76,Teacher, Farrah,,,130.2,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, And they're saying that they're using the Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,Exactly,,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,So what investigate mean does anybody know,,,130.2,remark,2,1,1

76,Oliver, Awesome,,,,response,2,1,1
76,Teacher, That is a synonym for investigate,,,420.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, So now let's look back at our question and see if we can find a word in our question,,,420.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, That's good,,,420.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,Find would be the same,,,420.1,remark,2,1,1

76,Teacher,"Discover, that's great",,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, But let's look back,,,420.3,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,"It's discovering so let's keep reading to see if it tells us what they're trying to discover because so far, we have a piece of equipment that's trying to discover something",,,420.3,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,"This lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposit in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one top of the one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water",,,220.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, So what is an ice deposit,,,220.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,Does anybody know,,,120.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,2,1,1
76,Luis,"I yeah yeah i know an ice deposit's, like on a planetoid or like a rocky planet or a moon on that",,,,response,2,1,1
76,Luis, It's like like ice like frozen water that's that's like on on the surface of the planet,,,,response,2,1,1
76,Teacher,So right now we have a piece of equipment that is discovering water,,,410.2,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,"Great, I can really tell you use your background knowledge with that",,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, So right now I want you to think about what might be a better answer to our question because now we found a piece of equipment that's looking to discover water,,,410.2,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, So you're absolutely right and ice deposit is a piece of frozen water that's on a planet,,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,"So take a second and write a new answer yes, Jazmin",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
76,Jazmin,I think I know the answer,,,420.2,response,2,1,1
76,Teacher,"Okay, do you want to share your answer with us",,,210.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Jazmin,"So I think I was really close, it's the lunar orbiter, the lunar orbiter's what discovered the water",,,210.1,response,2,1,1
76,Teacher,That's great,,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher," So guys, I want you to think",,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, That's absolutely right,,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, So we found this time that that's our specific answer that it was the Lunar Orbiter,,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, We just needed to look more closely at our text,,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,"So I want you to think about what you can do differently next time when you're answering your next question to make sure you get the specific answer that we're looking for, because you guys were all really close",,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,2,1,1
76,Chris,"Um, I actually forgot what I was gonna say",,,,response,2,1,1

76,Teacher,Oliver?,,,,remark,2,1,1
76,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,,response,2,1,1
76,Oliver, So scientists found the craters full of water on the moon,,,,response,2,1,1
76,Oliver,"So I was wondering, like, Um, did they use, they use the Lunar Orbiter to find it",,,,response,2,1,1
76,Oliver, But did they not use a microscope?,,,,response,2,1,1
76,Teacher,I understand what you're asking me yes there,,,,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher," So let's look at paragraph three, okay",,,,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, Let's look at what this sentence says,,,,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, If you were looking straight at it,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,You need a scientific toll called a microscope to look really closely,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher," So what is that microscope, helping them do guys",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
76,Oliver,"It's helping them see it, when they study it",,,210.4,response,2,1,1
76,Teacher,"Yeah, they're looking at it really closely, they're not looking",,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher," They're not discovering it yet what in order to look at it really closely, they have to have already found it right",,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
76,Oliver,I understand,,,210.2,response,2,1,1
76,Oliver, So it was like two different things,,,210.2,response,2,1,1
76,Oliver," They say, I understand",,,210.2,response,2,1,1
76,Oliver," Yeah, so they they found it using the Lunar Orbiter and they and they studied it using the microscope",,,210.2,response,2,1,1
76,Teacher," We had discovering it and we have looking at it, what are those two words",,,230.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, And what are those two different things,,,230.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, What kind of words are those that we talked about earlier in this lesson,,,230.1,remark,2,1,1

76,Teacher," What is the type of word we used, but remember way earlier at the beginning of this lesson when we talked about action words",,,130.3,remark,2,1,1
76,Oliver,And that's how we discover discover,,,130.3,response,2,1,1
76,Teacher, Yes,,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, It can help you to look for that action words in the question because that's going to help you know specifically what you're looking for,,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher, Chris,,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Teacher,"Yes, so the next time you're reading a tough question",,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
76,Chris,"So we have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for working with us and like specifically like, you you really helped us clear up some misconceptions, we have like you helped us to understand the meaning of the word discover and you also helped us make sure that we were using evidence",,,510.1,response,2,1,1
76,Chris, So thank you so much,,,,response,2,1,1
76,Chris, So I don't know,,,,response,2,1,1
76,Chris," Like I feel like I understand like the question, much better now",,,,response,2,1,1
76,Chris, And that was really cool,,,,response,2,1,1
76,Chris,When we were talking about stuff because we had to justify it in in the stuff that we were reading,,,,response,2,1,1

76,Teacher,Hi,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, [teacher name] and we're just going to be talking about your question today,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, I'm Ms,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,"So, in this article we heard a lot of things about NASA and the moon as a desert and let's just talk about your answers",,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,So we have a lot of different answers,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,So let's look back in our texts,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, Let's think about it,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, And let's see if we had the best answer,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Luis," Um, I shouldn't be ni this group",,,150.1,response,0,1,1
76,Luis,"Um, excuse me",,,150.1,response,0,1,1
76,Luis, I already know all there is to know about space,,,150.1,response,0,1,1
76,Luis,"Um, okay",,,,response,0,1,1
76,Teacher, Okay,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,"Okay, well, we're just going to work on making sure we have the best answer for the question",,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,And we had some really great responses,,,220.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, We're trying to figure out what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,So when we look back at our text,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, So we're going to make sure that our answers can be proven from our text,,,220.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,"So if we look back, it says that, they used a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,130.3,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,So did anybody talk about that? Let's see,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Jazmin,"Well, um, I",,,150.1,response,0,1,1
76,Jazmin, It's me Jazmin,,,150.1,response,0,1,1
76,Jazmin, I said that they used a small machine that was my answer,,,150.1,response,0,1,1
76,Teacher, So I think it's asking us to say like the title of the object,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,So did anybody say like a title?,,,130.2,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,"You did, you did say that, but if we look, it says What equipment",,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, So what is the name of that machine called?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, So let's look back and see if we can find it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,Because it's in our passage,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher," So it says, NASA sent a small machine called a Looper Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Chris,"Um, well, I talked about the polar craters because I said that they found a lot of water in the craters",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
76,Teacher, So they did use it to find a lot of water in the craters,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, But what tool where they using?,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
76,Jazmin,"Um, the small machine",,,,response,0,1,1
76,Teacher, It's telling us to talk about what equipment,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,You're right,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, But if we look back at our question,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, So,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, So let's read the sentence,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, But let's look back and see what that's called,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher," Okay, so we're on number two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,"Yes, the small machine",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Jazmin,"Oh, it's called a lunar orbiter",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
76,Teacher, So good,,,110.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,"Yeah, exactly",,,110.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,"So, to make our answer better",,,130.3,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,You get it?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, We could say NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,130.3,remark,0,1,1
76,Farrah,"Oh, I don't understand why my answer is still wrong",,,150.1,response,0,1,1
76,Oliver, I circled the same thing as Farrah,,,,response,0,1,1
76,Oliver,"Yeah, yeah",,,,response,0,1,1
76,Oliver, Me too,,,,response,0,1,1
76,Teacher,Okay,,,120.3,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher," Well, if we look back in the number three which says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth",,,120.3,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, The water they found is microscopic,,,120.3,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,Meaning you wouldn't be able to see it,,,120.3,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,Now let's look at our question and let's remember what our questions said,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher," If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close",,,120.3,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,So our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?,,,120.2,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,"Now, what does a microscope do? What did it say a microscope did in the text?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Farrah,"Um, you use it to look at the water",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
76,Teacher,ou have to discuss,,,,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,"Right, you use it to look at the water",,,110.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Oliver,Yeah,,,,response,0,1,1
76,Teacher,"Yeah, so you have to",,,,remark,0,1,1
76,Oliver,"Sorry, sorry",,,,response,0,1,1
76,Teacher, Does anyone know what discover means?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,So you have to find the water before you can look at it right,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Oliver, It's like when you find something,,,210.4,response,0,1,1
76,Oliver,"Yeah, it's like, um, it's like, um, you said already",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
76,Teacher,So do you understand how we could improve your answer?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, Before we can look at it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, And we're going to use the Lunar Orbiter to find it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,Right so discovers when we find it so we have to find it first,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Farrah,"Um, we have to say that need a scientific tool microscope to discover the water instead of just to look it",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
76,Teacher,"Okay, but can we do we use the microscope to discover the water?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,,Because let's look back at our passage and see what a microscope does,,,210.4,,0,1,1
76,Teacher,You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Oliver,"Yeah, Farrah, she said discover means to find it and and we we thought the thing said to to look at it which is different from finding it",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
76,Chris,"Well, I know a lot about space too I went to NASA with my dad and I know that astronauts, um, they have like oxygen tanks and, um, they have suits and they have masks",,,,response,0,1,1
76,Teacher,That's really cool,,,110.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,"Okay, so we're talking about the equipment they used to discover water",,,120.2,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, But let's get back on topic,,,110.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,0,1,1
76,Chris, Okay,,,,response,0,1,1
76,Chris," Well, well, I talked about water in my answer too",,,,response,0,1,1
76,Chris,Okay,,,,response,0,1,1
76,Teacher,So we asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?,,,120.2,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, But let's look at our discussion question,,,210.3,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,You're right you did talk about the water,,,210.3,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, Okay,,,420.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,So when we're answering questions we need to make sure we're answering the question that's being asked,,,420.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,So look back at your answer,,,120.1,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,Does it say anything about the equipment that they used?,,,210.3,remark,0,1,1
76,Chris,"Oh, no, no, it talks about the craters not the equipment",,,210.3,response,0,1,1
76,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,So we need to find the equipment that they used,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,"So look back in your passage, what equipment did they use to find the water",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,If we look at number two,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,NASA sent a small machine called a loomer Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,130.3,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher,This Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Teacher, These ice deposits are very small and what is what is ice?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
76,Chris,"Oh, oh, yeah, ice is the same thing as water",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
76,Jazmin,"Oh, right, yeah, yeah",,,,response,0,1,1
76,Farrah,"Oh yeah, I see that, ice is like, it's the same thing because we learned that in science class about how like the three states of matter",,,,response,0,1,1
76,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,1,1
76,All,Bye,,,,,0,1,1
77,Teacher,"Alright, so the discussion question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?",,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
77,Luis,Uh,,,,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,Go ahead,,,,remark,0,1,3
77,Luis," I, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,3
77,Luis, Yeah,,,,response,0,1,3
77,Luis,Excuse me,,,,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,"Okay, so what is your answer to the discussion question?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
77,Luis,"Um, let me see",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
77,Luis," I said, that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
77,Luis, I already know that equipment that they use,,,120.4,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,Go back to the text that you read,,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,"Um, well, you're right",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,Need you to narrow down your answer more specific,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,But what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon?,,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
77,Luis,"Um,",,,210.3,response,0,1,3
77,Luis,"Um,",,,,response,0,1,3
77,Luis,What did they use to discover water on the moon?,,,120.2,response,0,1,3
77,Luis,"Um, I don't know, um like maybe",,,,response,0,1,3
77,Chris,"Oh, well I said that they found craters full of water on the moon",,,,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,"Let's go back to our text, we have these specific answers from the text",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher, What equipment did they use?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,Okay then not full of water,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,They did find water,,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher, But the question wants to know what equipment did they use,,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
77,Farrah,"Well, in my answer, I, I talked about the equipment",,,210.2,response,0,1,3
77,Farrah," I said that they they used a scientific tool called a microscope to, to look really closely",,,210.2,response,0,1,3
77,Farrah," It's me, Farrah",,,210.2,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,Right--,,,,remark,0,1,3
77,Oliver,I,,,,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,Go ahead,,,,remark,0,1,3
77,Oliver,I was gonna show you that I have the same answer as Samantha,,,,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,"Okay, so what's your answer?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
77,Oliver,"Um, that they use the microscope to look closely at the water",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,Is that all that they used?,,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
77,Oliver, It says here the water they found is microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it,,,,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,Right--,,,,remark,0,1,3
77,Oliver,"Um, well, I mean, that's what it says",,,,response,0,1,3
77,Farrah,"Yeah, the um, the, the next part of that says you know that you'd like let me look at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,1,3
77,Farrah," So, I mean, I don't understand why my answer's wrong",,,,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,I didn't say it was wrong,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher, Once they found it,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,"So, but what did they use to discover the water that, they used a microscope microscope to look at it",,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,But what equipment did they use to find it?,,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,Go back to the text and look,,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,"Luis, what do you think?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
77,Luis," Um, well, like when they were on Earth, you know, because that's how you can look from Earth on",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
77,Luis,"Well, I think that because they they really like to have to travel around a lot that they probably use their like their their their like telescopes to look at the water",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,1,3
77,Jazmin,"Um, well, I, I had a different answer",,,,response,0,1,3
77,Jazmin,"And mine came from the text too, but I don't know why it's wrong",,,,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,"Okay, you need to be more specific in your answer",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher, What small machine? What was it called?,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
77,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar to investigate,,,410.2,response,0,1,3
77,Jazmin," Um, a lunar orbiter?",,,410.2,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,Yes,,,110.4,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher, You had to use a microscope,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher, You can't even see it,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,"So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it looked for ice deposits and the craters, and then they use that microscope to see it because it's so tiny",,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,So that makes sense?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
77,Jazmin,"Um, I mean, I guess so",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
77,Jazmin, I guess,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,Anybody have any questions about that question?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
77,Farrah," I mean, I guess",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
77,Farrah,"Um, well",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
77,Farrah," I mean, I guess it's like, but I still think like the microscope is is equipment too",,,,response,0,1,3
77,Farrah,I don't know,,,,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,It is,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher, But they didn't use it to discover the water,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
77,Chris, So I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too,,,130.3,response,0,1,3
77,Chris,I went to NASA,,,130.3,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,"Yeah, yeah, they do, but we were just discussing this question",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,You're all right,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
77,Oliver,"Okay, um, but, but, but, but, okay",,,110.2,response,0,1,3
77,Oliver," So, but I read it and it does say it such that they talk about the water in paragraph three",,,110.2,response,0,1,3
77,Oliver,They say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,0,1,3
77,Oliver, So I understand that you said that Jazmin has the right answer,,,,response,0,1,3
77,Oliver," But, but why cuz that's a tool too",,,,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher," It is, I didn't say it was wrong",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,It is,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,"But they use the machine, the Lunar Orbiter to find it to discover it",,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher,But then they use the microscope once they found it,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
77,Oliver,Oh,,,130.3,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,That make sense?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
77,Oliver," They use the Lunar Orbiter to um, they use the Lunar Orbiter to find the water and then I use the microscope to look at the water",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
77,Oliver,Okay,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,Right,,,110.4,remark,0,1,3
77,Teacher, Once they found it,,,110.4,remark,0,1,3
77,Farrah,"Okay, um, okay, y'all I so I get it because you you you told Oliver what it is, but, I guess I, I don't know like how how you got there",,,110.4,response,0,1,3
77,Farrah," Like, I know I can say it, but I don't know how, how um",,,110.4,response,0,1,3
77,Oliver," I think we gotta look at the text more, Farrah",,,,response,0,1,3
77,Oliver," Oh, look Farrah",,,,response,0,1,3
77,Oliver,Okay,,,,response,0,1,3
77,Oliver," I think, well, it's time for us to go to lunch",,,,response,0,1,3
77,Oliver, But I think what she was telling us is that we just have to keep looking at the text right cuz that's where you said a bunch of times,,,,response,0,1,3
77,Oliver, Okay,,,,response,0,1,3
77,Oliver, Thank you,,,,response,0,1,3
77,Oliver," Okay, bye",,,,response,0,1,3

77,Oliver, Thanks,,,,response,0,1,3
77,Oliver, That was the problem,,,,response,0,1,3
77,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,1,1,3
77,Luis, Like why I'm here because I already know,,,,response,1,1,3
77,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,1,3
77,Luis, So I'm not sure,,,,response,1,1,3
77,Luis, Like all sorts of stuff about space,,,,response,1,1,3
77,Teacher,"Alright, so I have gathered you all here today because I'm concerned about each one of your answers to the question and you each talked about equipment or tools needed",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,"That are used on the moon, but we need to figure out exactly which piece of equipment they use to discover water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,So we need to go back into the text and find specifically where it states what equipment they used to discover water on the moon and,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,"Farrah, you talked about a specific tool, a microscope",,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,"Also, Luis, your question or your answer",,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher, Had to do with equipment as well,,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,This piece of equipment is used for a different purpose,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher, But you talked about oxygen tanks and we're trying to figure out which equipment they used for discovering water not oxygen on the main,,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
77,Luis,"Now it's so they don't need the oxygen, if they're going up to space",,,410.1,response,1,1,3
77,Teacher, But we're specifically talking about which piece of equipment they used to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,They need oxygen,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
77,Luis, Yeah,,,210.2,response,1,1,3

77,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,1,1,3
77,Farrah, Like I can understand that they were looking for the equipment but but they didn't use the but the microscope wasn't the right answer,,,,response,1,1,3
77,Farrah,"Um, yeah, I guess I was just wondering, like what my answer was, because I'm, I'm still not quite sure",,,,response,1,1,3
77,Teacher,They might,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,Use,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,The microscope is used for a different purpose,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher, They didn't use a microscope on the men they use something else to discover water on the moon,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
77,Farrah,"Oh, what do you do you",,,130.3,response,1,1,3
77,Teacher,Let's go back into the texts and look,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,If,,,,remark,1,1,3
77,,You want all of us to look at the text or are we just waiting for the vamp,,,,,1,1,3
77,Teacher,Everybody look back into the text and find what did they use to discover water on the moon,,,120.1,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,Chris did you find the answer,,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
77,Chris,Um yeah i guess i well i went to NASA,,,120.4,response,1,1,3
77,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like,,,120.4,response,1,1,3
77,Chris,When like oxygen tanks at masks and shoot,,,,response,1,1,3
77,Teacher,"They do, yeah",,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher, But all of those pieces of equipment are used for a different purpose,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher, We're trying to figure out which,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,What equipment that they use to find water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,It yes is a specific tool or equipment that they used,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,It says it in the text,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher, If we go back and look,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher, It talks about equipment but there can be another word for equipment,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,And the question,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,In the text,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,Go back and look what's another word that we can use Jazmin,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,You,,,,remark,1,1,3
77,Jazmin,Another word is a small maching,,,,response,1,1,3
77,Teacher,"Still, yeah",,,,remark,1,1,3
77,Jazmin, Right,,,,response,1,1,3
77,Jazmin,A small machine,,,,response,1,1,3
77,Teacher, All right,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher, And what was the name of that machine,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,"Yes, a small machine",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,And he,,,,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher, That makes sense,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,"Yeah, the scientists use the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and discover water on the moon",,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,Awesome,,,,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,So the equipment that they used is the Lunar Orbiter to discover water on the moon,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
77,Teacher,Start simulation,,,,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,2,1,3
77,Luis,"Um, yeah, I just wanted to let you know my dad is actually an astronaut",,,,response,2,1,3
77,Teacher,That's cool,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,"Alright, so the next question is talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher, And I brought you here together because I'm concerned about your answers,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,"The only person Jazmin is the only person that said yes, that it was valuable and kind of told why she thought it was valuable",,,110.2,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,But in a text,,,220.1,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher," It tells why astronauts are using water from the moon and we need to go back into the text, all of us to figure out why we think that the water on the moon could be valuable",,,220.1,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,"So let's go look what what he says, Can the astronauts to use",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,The water on the main for,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,Data Jazmin,,,,remark,2,1,3
77,Jazmin,Is there anything that,,,,response,2,1,3
77,Jazmin,You missed it,,,,response,2,1,3
77,Teacher,What do astronauts use the water for,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
77,Jazmin,You that like the water,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
77,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,2,1,3
77,Jazmin,You could use the water on the moon in a garden and they could be like a moon garden out of it,,,,response,2,1,3
77,Teacher,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear your response",,,,remark,2,1,3
77,Jazmin,"I'm sorry, I said that you could like you could go and use the water and you can",,,,response,2,1,3
77,Jazmin,See,,,,response,2,1,3
77,Teacher,That would be really cool,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher, So why is it a valid valuable,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,"But what does it say in the text about how astronauts use the water, it should be under the bottle of water is a valuable source",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher, So resource,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher, What does it say,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,What are the ways that it's being used,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,Or how can it be useful,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,2,1,3
77,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,,response,2,1,3
77,Chris,"So you could basically be like, I also waters, so you know it's really good that they don't have to carry it in ships",,,,response,2,1,3
77,Teacher, They can use what's on the man,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher, Luis What do you have,,,,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,"Right, okay",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher, That can be one way that can be so they don't have to use a travel with it there,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,2,1,3
77,Luis,"Um, well, water can be the said water can be broken down into two parts like hydrogen and oxygen",,,230.3,response,2,1,3
77,Teacher,What do astronauts use it for Jazmin,,,130.2,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,"All right, and how do they use the hydrogen and oxygen",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
77,Jazmin,"Well,",,,210.4,response,2,1,3
77,Jazmin,And use oxygen to breath and the water to,,,,response,2,1,3
77,Jazmin,Stay hydrated and feel like they have to have water,,,,response,2,1,3
77,Teacher," A, then, what were you gonna say",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,Right,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
77,Luis,"Well, well, I was gonna say like they use it for",,,110.1,response,2,1,3
77,Luis,"Like rocket people, they can use hydrogen and make make food for the spacecraft",,,,response,2,1,3
77,Teacher,"Right, and that's going to be very valuable for the astronauts right they're going to use the water",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher, Right,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher," And also, Chris was saying that they wouldn't have to travel with it",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,"Yeah, oxygen, and then they can use the hydrogen from the water for rocket fuel",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,"From Earth to the Moon, and then I'll back right the indices what's there",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,"Yeah, so can we all agree that water is a valuable resource",,,130.3,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,is there convincing evidence that it's a valuable resource Farrah,,,130.2,remark,2,1,3
77,Farrah,"I'm still kind of, you know, like I i saw the parts that they were saying where they were like,",,,130.2,response,2,1,3
77,Farrah,"You could use the hydrogen fuel and you can use the oxygen to breathe, but I don't think",,,,response,2,1,3
77,Farrah, So like I guess evidence doesn't seem very convinced because they say like in really they said,,,,response,2,1,3
77,Farrah,"It's like convincing evidence, mostly because I didn't think that it would be possible for a long time",,,,response,2,1,3
77,Farrah,I,,,,response,2,1,3
77,Farrah,Use the moon water scientists need to come up with a plan for extracting getting out of the polar craters making this plan will take a lot of time and money,,,,response,2,1,3
77,Teacher,Yeah,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
77,Farrah,"It would be, you know, like it would take a long time",,,110.1,response,2,1,3
77,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,It would take a long time,,,130.3,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher," But eventually, it would be very, very, very valuable resource for astronauts to use,",,,130.3,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher, Do you have something to add,,,,remark,2,1,3
77,Oliver," So if you're looking at it, are like like immediately, then yeah, it's not very useful",,,,response,2,1,3
77,Oliver,"Well, I guess I sort of agree with Farrah",,,,response,2,1,3
77,Oliver, I got it kind of depends on like that time,,,,response,2,1,3
77,Oliver, But I guess,,,,response,2,1,3
77,Oliver," You know,",,,,response,2,1,3
77,Oliver," Like, even if it's useful someday",,,,response,2,1,3
77,Oliver, If it's really valuable,,,,response,2,1,3
77,Oliver, I don't know if I see that,,,,response,2,1,3
77,Oliver,"In like theory, but that's kind of a question like, I, I guess",,,,response,2,1,3
77,Teacher,"Okay, yeah",,,,remark,2,1,3
77,Teacher,"That's a good way of thinking about it, Jazmin",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
77,Jazmin, I just want to thank you for working with this and like in particular,,,310.1,response,2,1,3
77,Jazmin,"And yet, I just wanted to say",,,310.1,response,2,1,3
77,Jazmin, And we have to match the lunch,,,310.1,response,2,1,3
77,Jazmin, And how to improve,,,,response,2,1,3
77,Jazmin," And, you know, etc",,,,response,2,1,3
77,Jazmin,Like something I really wanted to thank you for was like we were really able to understand like you explain what we need to work on,,,,response,2,1,3
77,Jazmin,"You also really clear with like what you were concerned about and like what you wanted to work, which is like able to get you gives us a chance to like go forward and figure out like",,,,response,2,1,3
77,Jazmin,"What, like I better",,,,response,2,1,3
77,Jazmin,"Today, so much for all your work day was great working",,,,response,2,1,3

78,Teacher,"Okay, back to Farrah",,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
78,Teacher,"Yes, we do need a microscope to look really closely at things",,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
78,Teacher, But that is not what the scientist used to find the water on the moon,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
78,Teacher,"If you go back to the, I think it's the second paragraph, you'll see that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit and a large polar crater",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
78,Teacher,And so that is how they discovered that there was ice on the moon or water,,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
78,Oliver,"Um, I had the same answer as Farrah",,,130.3,response,0,0,2
78,Teacher,"Yes, you do",,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
78,Teacher, But did you read the article because I'm not sure that you really need that answer because you circled the same as her,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2

78,Farrah,"Oh, yeah",,,,response,0,0,2
78,Oliver," Why did they find ice microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you look straight at it and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah",,,410.2,response,0,0,2
78,Oliver, I know a lot of stuff,,,410.2,response,0,0,2
78,Farrah, Well that is why--,,,,response,0,0,2
78,Oliver, It says that the moon is drier than the dryest desert on Earth,,,410.2,response,0,0,2
78,Oliver, You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,410.2,response,0,0,2
78,Oliver," Um, I circled it, I circled that because I know that um that a microscope is is like a tool and this says, this says, if you look at the whole thing ",,,410.2,response,0,0,2

78,Farrah,Yeah,,,,response,0,0,2
78,Farrah," I mean like when I was I was looked at it and I saw that the question was asking about equipment and so, um, it said a scientific tool and a scientific tool like a microscope that's the same thing as equipment",,,,response,0,0,2
78,Teacher,"But even, you did circle, if you circled the same thing as Farrah, you are at, you at, you were both actually not correct with that answer, so if you would have circled about the Lunar Orbiter, you would have been correct",,,130.3,remark,0,0,2

78,Chris,Yeah,,,,response,0,0,2
78,Chris," I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,0,0,2
78,Teacher, It was the Lunar Orbiter,,,410.1,remark,0,0,2
78,Teacher," But that's not what the, um, that's not what",,,410.1,remark,0,0,2
78,Teacher,They do,,,410.1,remark,0,0,2
78,Teacher, The question is what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon? It said that those things are not what they used to discover water on the moon,,,410.1,remark,0,0,2
78,Chris," But, but I thought that I had the right answer you know, because I talked about the water in my answer about like how they they found the water because I know that, you know, to discover stuff means to find stuff",,,410.1,response,0,0,2
78,Chris," Like, I know that that's the answer, like the lunar orbiter is the answer",,,410.1,response,0,0,2
78,Chris,"Oh, oh, okay, okay, so I get it",,,410.1,response,0,0,2
78,Chris,"And so I saw in paragraph one where I was looking for, like, okay, they find some water and it says that scientists found evidence that water can be found deep within a moon's polar craters",,,,response,0,0,2
78,Chris," So, so, like, that's, that's how I got my answer",,,,response,0,0,2
78,Chris, And so I--,,,,response,0,0,2
78,Teacher,"If you would have read [unintellible] see where it says, NASA send small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate because you have to understand what the question is asking",,,210.2,remark,0,0,2

78,Teacher,What equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,0,2

78,Luis,"Yeah, I could do that",,,110.1,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher, Okay,,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher," And so the first question that what you were to answer was what experiment designed, what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"Okay, thank you very much",,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,so and you guys had varying levels of understanding,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"nd first I'd like to address Farrah Farrah, would you like to read your answer to us",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"And which is a good thing, because we can help each other grow",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
78,Farrah," Okay, so my answer was, you need a scientific tool calle a microscope to look really closely",,,150.1,response,1,0,2
78,Farrah,"Yeah, sure",,,150.1,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher," And, um, if you refer back to the question, it did mention equipment",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,Yes,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,You did mention a specific piece of equipment and although that may not be the best answer,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher," And you still address the equipment part of the question, and I appreciate that",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
78,Farrah,Thank you,,,310.1,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher, So I'm assuming that you address that you were thinking that it was the microscope as well,,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"You're welcome and and Oliver, you said that you had circled the same thing as Farrah",,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
78,Oliver,"Yeah, I had a microscope and I kind of thought",,,230.3,response,1,0,2
78,Oliver, Same thing as Farrah,,,230.3,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"Okay, yes",,,,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher, Farrah,,,,remark,1,0,2
78,Farrah,I guess I still don't really understand why my answers wrong,,,,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher, Look back at the question and take your pencil and maybe circle any important words in that question that you may see,,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"Okay, let's go ahead and talk about that",,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher, If you look at what it should be,,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"Okay, Farrah, which what, what, where did you circle or words",,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"Okay, so I circled equipment and discover",,,,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher," You said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and yeah, you would need a microscope to look really closely closely, but does",,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,okay and in your answer,,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher, Does your answer tell what discovered the water?,,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Farrah,"Oh, interesting",,,410.2,response,1,0,2
78,Farrah," So, well, I guess what I thought was that you couldn't discover the water, unless you saw the water",,,410.2,response,1,0,2
78,Farrah,Maybe there's another way,,,,response,1,0,2
78,Farrah,That another machine could find the water,,,,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"Look in paragraph two, of the passage to see if you might find another machine reread, paragraph two of the passage",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher, Okay,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"Yes, why don't why don't you look back you and Oliver work together since you were you had the same answer",,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Oliver,Okay,,,130.2,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher,And you can talk about it,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher, Okay,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher, And I'm going to speak with Chris for a moment,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"Okay, Chris, would you like to read your answer",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
78,Chris, So I said that pre scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
78,Chris,"Yeah, okay",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher,And they did,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"But my concern is, is that your answer doesn't really address the question that was given to you",,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher, That's very specific and I appreciate you being really specific in your answer,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,Did what important word or words did you circle in the question,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
78,Chris,So I circled water,,,210.3,response,1,0,2
78,Chris,That was the main word that I circled,,,,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"Okay, is that the only one that you circle",,,120.1,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher, So listen closely,,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"Yeah, I'm going to read the question",,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher," Okay, what equipment, did scientist used to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,So do you think one of the important words could be equipment?,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Chris,"Yeah, and it's okay so it's asking what equipment",,,210.2,response,1,0,2
78,Chris,"Yeah,I was thinking about the craters",,,,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher, I think right?,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"Yes, and that's where they found it",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
78,Chris,I you know my dad took me to NASA,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
78,Chris, And when we were there,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
78,Chris, We saw that like the astronauts used like suits and oxygen tanks and tasks and stuff,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
78,Chris,"Yeah, like it wasn't in the reading",,,,response,1,0,2
78,Chris, Did they use those to discover the water?,,,,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher," They might have used those when they discovered it, but they were not use to discover the water",,,130.3,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,No,,,130.3,remark,1,0,2
78,Chris,"Okay, gotcha",,,130.3,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher," Okay, and Jazmin, would you like to read us your answer",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,Yes,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
78,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher,And that is very close and,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,and Luis that would you like to read as your answer,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher,Can you be more specific look back and paragraph 2 to see if you can find the rest of the or the more detailed part of the answer,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
78,Luis,"Um, yeah, okay",,,420.2,response,1,0,2
78,Luis, So basically what I said I was saying that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that,,,420.2,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"And they do use that, but I'm just like with Chris",,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher," I asked him, did they use that to discover the water",,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
78,Luis," Like, I guess they must have used they used it, but they didn't use it to discover the water like that's not the job of like the tank or the mask",,,210.3,response,1,0,2
78,Luis,I guess not,,,210.3,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher,"Exactly, yes",,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher, Jazmin,,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
78,Jazmin,Fortunate we have to go to our next class,,,110.4,response,1,0,2
78,Jazmin, It was really fun to work with,,,110.4,response,1,0,2
78,Jazmin, Thank you,,,110.4,response,1,0,2
78,Jazmin," But before we go, I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us",,,110.4,response,1,0,2
78,Jazmin, This was really interesting,,,110.4,response,1,0,2
78,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,1,0,2
78,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher,"Okay guys, we're back",,,,remark,2,0,2
78,Luis, So you know I think I'm all good,,,,response,2,0,2
78,Luis,"Um, yeah, so I got all this stuff figured out",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Teacher,Okay hold on just a moment,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher, Okay,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher," Um, Farrah and Oliver",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher," Did you guys get a chance to finish reading, paragraph two, and revise your answer",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher,All right,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Farrah,"So we did look through paragraph two,",,,150.1,response,2,0,2
78,Farrah,"We saw, you know, a couple different things in there",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Farrah, Right,,,,response,2,0,2
78,Farrah,"I think that we have a new answer, but we're still a little bit confused about like, you know, I'm still kind of like I i think the answer is the lunar orbiter",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Teacher, And then we'll talk about the answer,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher,Why are you confused,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Farrah,Yeah,,,230.1,response,2,0,2
78,Farrah," So I think when I'm confused by is, um, I guess that they have the microscope and they said that that's like a piece of equipment",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
78,Farrah," And I just, I'm just wondering, like, if the waters microscopic, could they find it without a microscope",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Farrah,It is,,,,response,2,0,2
78,Teacher,"Yes, it is very hard to say without a microscope, but the lunar orbiter is very powerful",,,130.3,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher, That's where they found it and it looked for ice deposits,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher," So, since it was ice and it wasn't necessarily water, it is but frozen water and And they look in the large polar craters",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher, I guess it was really cold the,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher,It landed on the moon South Pole,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
78,Farrah,It seems really cool,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
78,Teacher,"Yes, it does",,,110.4,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher, You two are correct,,,110.4,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher, It is the Lunar Orbiter,,,110.4,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher, So you are right there,,,110.4,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher,I like your revised answer and that you guys work so well together,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher, And I'm but yes you are,,,110.4,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher,And you're welcome and Chris,,,,remark,2,0,2
78,Chris," Um, can I share my answer with you",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Chris,But that's okay,,,,response,2,0,2
78,Chris," And then I think we were talking about how that wasn't really answering the question, right",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Chris,"Yeah, I saw my original my original answer was that scientists found craters full of water on the food",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Teacher,Right,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher, So did you say you have a new answer,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Chris," I'm like, I think that I could see like Oliver and Farrah, said the lunar orbiter was the thing that that found it like that sounds like that's the answer",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
78,Chris,"Yeah, I think so",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
78,Teacher,"Yes, and Jazmin",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher,"Did you have a chance, did you go back and look and find the same answer or did you find something different",,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
78,Jazmin,"Although I see actually that confused because it kind of makes sense that all I was missing was the name of the machine, right",,,230.2,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin," So I said, like NASA send this small machine, but I have to say, like, what evidence is, I have to say what it is, right?",,,230.2,response,2,0,2
78,Teacher, You should be able to find your evidence in there to support your answer,,,120.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher,"Yes, if you look through there and then circle your answer",,,120.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher,"But yeah, she did a great job and you were very specific also",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher, Right,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher,"It, Luis, and we see here and we were talking about using all the other equipment",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
78,Luis,Yeah,,,230.3,response,2,0,2
78,Teacher,And I don't think you had,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher," Did you have a chance to go back and read paragraph two,",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Luis,Um no I didn't take a look yet,,,150.1,response,2,0,2
78,Teacher,"Okay, go ahead and do that for a moment",,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher,"Yes, Oliver",,,,remark,2,0,2
78,Oliver,"Um, so I I read something interesting",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Oliver,Would like is connected,,,,response,2,0,2
78,Oliver," I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and so maybe they could use these things like I'm like the water, pretty soon",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Teacher,"Well, that would be awesome",,,110.3,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher, I didn't know that you taught me something,,,110.3,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher,Okay Luis What do you think,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
78,Luis,"So I looked at, paragraph two, and what we see and like what I was listening to everybody",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
78,Luis, I'm,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
78,Luis," I'm like, that's the answer to the question, I guess I just keep thinking like",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Luis,Like they said that the lunar orbiter was the thing,,,,response,2,0,2
78,Luis, And so I guess that makes sense that it was the Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,2,0,2
78,Luis,They must have used other stuff,,,,response,2,0,2
78,Luis, But you said that that they didn't use the suits and the oxygen to find the water,,,,response,2,0,2
78,Luis,"they used it to help them beyond the moon, if they were on the moon",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Teacher,Right to help them survive,,,210.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Luis,Yeah,,,210.1,response,2,0,2
78,Luis," Yeah, exactly",,,210.1,response,2,0,2
78,Teacher,"Yes, they did",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher," Yes, Jazmin",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Teacher,Guess that's all that I have unless you have some questions,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
78,Jazmin, And I think that we just wanted to share,,,150.1,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin, But before we go to lunch,,,150.1,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin, So we have to go to lunch,,,150.1,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin,I know I think that we all understand,,,150.1,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin,"I really wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular, I really do",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin," Thank you for, like, making sure that our answers were really accurate",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin,"And you really encouraged us to use evidence from the text and you also asked us, like why we were like saying the things that we were saying",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin, Um yeah like I think everybody feels like they got to do something really interesting,,,,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin,So we got this,,,,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin, Think about like our own thinking and how that led to our answer like right guys,,,,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin, And like we also had time to explain all of our ideas,,,,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin," And finally, I think everybody really value",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin,And I think that that like working with your class was really cool,,,,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin,"So like everybody's answers like you were so like like supportive of our answers, even, even if they were right",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin, It was really fun,,,,response,2,0,2
78,Jazmin," And that was really cool, thank you so much for working with us",,,,response,2,0,2
78,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,2,0,2
79,Teacher," I appreciate the answers that you gave, let's go ahead and review some of the things that we've talked about",,,220.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,"Thank you for joining me at the small group table, guys",,,220.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, Luis,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,So let's talk about some of your answers,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, Would one of you like to volunteer your answer,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,Our question that we have was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
79,Luis, I don't think I should be in this group,,,120.2,response,1,1,2
79,Luis,"Well, I was just gonna say like I already know like so much about space and like I don't really think I need any help",,,120.2,response,1,1,2
79,Teacher, So I'm glad you're here with us,,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,You don't think you should be in this group,,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher," Well, I'm glad you're in this group because maybe you can help us all out with some of our questions we have and how we answered",,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, Luis,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,Can we start with your answer,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Luis,"Yeah, sure",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
79,Luis, So basically what what I said was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
79,Teacher," You are right, and I'm sure there's a lot more than just oxygen tanks and a lot more than what we know about  Here, since we are not an astronaut or we don't go out into space",,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,"Yes, they do have to use a lot of equipment",,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,Help me understand if you don't mind what equipment they might use just to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, So Luis Can you help me understand,,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,I really like the fact that you have a lot of knowledge about it because it tells me that you're probably really interested in space,,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,"Maybe other equipment that they might have used to just find oxygen, or excuse me, just to find the water on the moon, what some other points that you made for us in our passage we read what were some other points, they made",,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
79,Luis,"Well, I have to be honest, I don't think I read it very close because I thought I knew all this stuff",,,230.2,response,1,1,2
79,Luis, But it sounds like there's other equipment that maybe I didn't know,,,230.2,response,1,1,2
79,Luis," Is that right, like not like maybe what they use also but like what really binds, it is that right",,,,response,1,1,2
79,Luis,"And so I'm kind of looking through now and I'm seeing other equipment and you were saying like, I need to think about like how like what is really finding the water",,,,response,1,1,2
79,Teacher, But I like your thinking of what keeps the water together that is in our passage,,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,Not exactly,,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,But let's specifically focus if we can On just how they discovered water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, What equipment,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, Did they use to discover that water,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, All of you can take a look at the question again,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, If you can take a look at your passage,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,And in your question,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, Can you take your pencil and just underline the really important words that could help us find our answer,,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,What's a really important word in that question that could help us find our answer,,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, Can somebody volunteers for me to give me a word that you might have underlined that can help us find an answer,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, Jazmin,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,Great,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Jazmin,"Yes, in the way that I underlined was well action like two words",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
79,Jazmin, Equipment and discover,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
79,Teacher," So tell me, just reading our passage Jazmin",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher," Can you tell me what the word equipment might refer to in our passage, what kind of equipment",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, Great,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,So you underlined equipment and discover,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, Did the scientists discover water on the moon with,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Jazmin,"Yeah, so that's like something that you use to find or do you use, like if you need something",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
79,Jazmin, They have to discover certain equipment has the evening mean I use it to discover,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
79,Jazmin, And so I said that it's the small machine,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
79,Teacher," I see your line of thought and I really appreciate that you're telling us that they sent a small machine, which is the equipment and they used it to discover which is to find out, or to see",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,"Excellent, excellent",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher," Yes, Jazmin",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, Thank you,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Jazmin," You know why I was in the group, it sounds like this small machine was was maybe a right answer",,,310.1,response,1,1,2
79,Jazmin, My answer was wrong,,,310.1,response,1,1,2
79,Jazmin,"I was wondering why, my answer the question",,,310.1,response,1,1,2
79,Teacher, And I appreciate that answer,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, You did a great job using your background knowledge and using all the information that was in our text,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, That was one of our right answers,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,It was a right answer,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,but it's not quite the only thing that they used,,,410.2,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,"Chris, could you help us out a little bit more, maybe with finding a different piece of equipment that they might have used",,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, He told us that scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,Also Chris's answer,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, How else could they have found or what other Oliverices could they have used to find water on the moon in the craters,,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher," When we read deeper into that passage, and the answer that you gave us",,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,So Chris,,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Chris,"Ah, well I guess that's I kind of was thinking about what he was saying because I went to NASA with my dad and we saw that they use masks and suits an oxygen text to explore them",,,210.3,response,1,1,2
79,Chris, So I guess I was thinking maybe they use that stuff to go in the craters,,,210.3,response,1,1,2
79,Teacher,So you were thinking they use a lot more equipment on their body to go into the craters like he was talking about oxygen tanks,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Chris,"Yeah, like maybe, you know, like, I guess I'm not yeah like I was thinking like, did they use that to go into craters and see like I i understand like, it's not as much water like but like, you know, if we went in the crater",,,230.3,response,1,1,2
79,Chris, Like there's they find the water by like walking in with their space suits,,,230.3,response,1,1,2
79,Teacher," Because your response said they found craters full of water on the moon, but can you look at your passage with me take a look at, paragraph two, and your passage",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, Can you look at your passage with me,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,With their space suits by walking into the big craters,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,"And made it says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, Now the lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in large polar craters,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,"but the ice deposits are, what can you tell me what that says the ice deposits are very small",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Chris,Very small,,,120.3,response,1,1,2
79,Teacher, So if they're looking for something very small and they're having to take that lunar orbiter in there,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher,Very small,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, Yes Oliver,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Teacher, We also read in paragraph three,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
79,Oliver," I hate to interrupt, but we have to run",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
79,Oliver, Bye,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
79,Oliver, Thank you,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
79,Oliver," But unfortunately, we have to go to our next class",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
79,Oliver, Bye bye,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
79,Oliver, But thank you so much for working with us,,,210.4,response,1,1,2

79,Oliver, It was really fun to work with you,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
79,Teacher,"Guys, thank you",,,,remark,1,1,2
79,Farrah, I think no,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah," And I think that because I don't think it will be a long, long time",,,,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah,My answer was that you know is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver, So even though we think it could work like we don't know,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver, I don't think that's very convincing because it's not really ready,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver,"Um yeah and i i agree, like I think know as well",,,,response,2,1,2
79,Chris,"Yeah, I said basically, the water is so good that ships don't carry it",,,,response,2,1,2
79,Chris, What if you don't have to carry anymore,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Jazmin,So basically I think yes that there's really convincing evidence because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated and you kids are fine without water,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Luis,"And also, I was just going to remind everybody that my dad is actually an astronaut, which is pretty cool",,,,response,2,1,2
79,Luis,On yeah and I really like was gonna say like water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Teacher,"All right, thank you for your answers",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,I wanted to just Farrah,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher, If you remind me of your answer,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
79,Farrah,"So no, not for a long time",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah, I don't think that the evidence is,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
79,Teacher," Farrah based on our passage, what makes you think that the evidence is not convincing",,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,And what makes you think that way,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
79,Farrah,"Yeah, that's a really interesting question",,,230.2,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah," So when I look at the, like, here's what I saw, I was thinking that okay a paragraph six",,,230.2,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah," The water and it says, making this plan will take a lot of time and",,,,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah,It says to use the water scientists need to come up with a plan for extract or getting out of the polar crater,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah, Sure,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah, Right,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah, And I think it's very valuable,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah, So I think that maybe it would be valuable,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah, We don't even know how to how to do it,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah, So we could use,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah,I was thinking like honestly that like it doesn't work yet,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Teacher,"Well, I appreciate that",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher," I can see what you're thinking, and where you were going with that",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher, And I really like the fact that you use those contexts clues and explain to me what extracting meant,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher, So I appreciate that your opinion is that no you don't think that it's  It's going to be convincing or or it's going to be valuable,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher," Reading You told us that extracting was getting the water out and I see where you use that evidence, saying that it might take a lot of time and money",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,Excellent,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,"Teacher:And I'd like to take a look and read in paragraph four, if you will, Farrah and and the group",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher, If you look at their paragraph four,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,That word could that's in the second sentence,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher," Can you circle that word could with your pencil, if you will, in the second sentence of paragraph four, it says, it could be useful in lots of ways",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,"Then the question two says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,"So would you think that the word useful iss also the same as maybe valuable if we look back in that paragraph and it's telling us, it could be useful",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher, Do you think that could be is an important way to express that water can be valuable in the future,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,Farrah,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
79,Farrah,"Yeah, I think what's interesting, because I do think that it could be valuable",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah, Maybe sure I see that in the reading,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah,It's not really valuable like that the evidence is it,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Farrah,"Because we haven't seen like them build like a winner waters and we don't even know they can, like, they can we haven't seen",,,,response,2,1,2
79,Teacher, I appreciate that,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher, I do agree with you,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher, We haven't seen it yet because it is something that may take a lot of time and money for us to see but,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,That we haven't seen it yet,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher, Chris was that you,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,"Um, let's see who was it that told me that the water is heavy and carrying the water was maybe not a good idea",,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
79,Chris,Yes that was me,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
79,Chris,I was saying that you don't have to have water,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Chris,"Anymore, get it from the moon",,,,response,2,1,2
79,Teacher,"And so, carrying all that water may not be very may not be a very good idea if we can find water and a way to use it on the moon,",,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,"Because it's possible that we could get it from the moon and I see Chris's thinking was, he said that water is very heavy",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,Am I correct Chris is that you're thinking,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
79,Chris,Yeah,,,230.3,response,2,1,2
79,Teacher, I can see how it would be very useful to leave behind all that weight because we may be able to find that water and use water on the moon and not have to carry that would be valuable,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,Good,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,"I'm sorry, go ahead",,,,remark,2,1,2
79,Chris,"Oh, I just said totally",,,,response,2,1,2
79,Teacher,Okay,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher," Um, so I can see Chris I appreciate the fact that you see value in that because it would be a valuable source",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,"Space and on the spacecraft, it would be valuable to not have to carry all that weight if we had access to water on the moon",,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher, We could carry more equipment or more astronauts instead,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher, And that would make it valuable to us,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher,Oliver and were you a person who said no,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
79,Teacher, Can you tell me your answer and give me some of the thinking that you had in mind,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
79,Oliver, I just wanted to share with you,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver,"Yeah, I would love to",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver, Unfortunately we do have to go to lunch,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver, But before we go to lunch,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver,"Some really cool stuff like I wanted to thank you so much for working with us and, like, in particular, you really helped us to focus on like",,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver,"certain words in the questions so that we understood, like what we were looking for",,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver, And I think that made things a lot more quicker,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver, You know what I mean,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver,"And then, like, on top of that, like you helped us to understand like you help us clarify our answers",,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver, And you asked us about our thinking,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver,"And like when we started like thinking about like what we were saying, I think everybody right like everybody kind of had a moment of like",,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver,"You know, like everything makes a lot more sense when we're like trying to you know what I mean, like,",,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver,Like we can understand and we can hear each other and we can think about like what everybody else's,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver,"And then even like beyond that, like you really help us to feel value like once you like heard about what we were thinking, I think that like everybody felt like you really respected us and that was so cool because",,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver, Bye,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver, So I really appreciate that,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver,That's not like every teacher,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver, Thank you,,,,response,2,1,2
79,Oliver," And thank you so much for just like giving it a try, though",,,,response,2,1,2
79,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,2,1,2
80,Teacher,"So can one of you, would one of you like to volunteer to read the first paragraph?",,,120.3,remark,0,1,1
80,Luis, I'll read it,,,120.3,response,0,1,1
80,Luis,"Yeah, sure",,,120.3,response,0,1,1
80,Luis," Um, me Luis, I'll read it but but I do want to say, I don't think I'm supposed to be in this group, cuz I already know a lot about space",,,120.3,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher,"Well you know what, because you do know a lot and that means you can help the rest of us out that don't know as much as you",,,110.3,remark,0,1,1
80,Luis,"Oh yeah, okay",,,110.3,response,0,1,1
80,Luis," Cool, yeah",,,110.3,response,0,1,1
80,Luis,"Okay, um first paragraph, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher,"Okay, is would someone like--",,,,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher, And what did that first paragraph tells us? Do you know?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher,Let's stop for a second,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
80,Luis,That scientists have found evidence of water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters,,,210.4,response,0,1,1
80,Luis, These craters are dark places where the sun never shines,,,210.4,response,0,1,1
80,Luis,"Well, like the craters on the moon are really dark",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher, Um,,,,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,1,1
80,Chris,"Um, well",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,1,1
80,Chris,"Um, well, also that that's where they found the water",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher,Okay,,,120.3,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher," Would you like Chris, would you like to read the second paragraph?",,,120.3,remark,0,1,1
80,Chris,"Yeah, sure",,,120.3,response,0,1,1
80,Chris, These ice deposits are very small,,,,response,0,1,1
80,Chris,"Okay, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Chris, This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar creator,,,,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher, Can someone paraphrase that paragraph for me?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher,Okay,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher,"It means, means put it in your own words on what that you heard that paragraph say",,,510.1,remark,0,1,1
80,Jazmin,"Um, well, I'm looking at it and um I think it says, like okay, NASA sent this whole machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,510.1,response,0,1,1
80,Jazmin, These ice deposits are very small,,,510.1,response,0,1,1
80,Jazmin, This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar creator,,,510.1,response,0,1,1
80,Jazmin,"Okay, so it's saying like they sent they sent the Lunar Orbiter to look for ice deposits",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher,"Yeah, what would I deposits be, what do you think they would look like?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
80,Jazmin, I guess,,,210.4,response,0,1,1
80,Jazmin,"Um, I don't know, like, like ice",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher," When you deposit something, how much do, what do you deposit? Do you have a deposit a really large piece of something or smaller pieces?",,,140.1,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher,Okay,,,140.1,remark,0,1,1
80,Farrah,"Um, well, I go to the bank with my mom sometimes, and she'll deposit her paycheck, but I don't know if it's like a lot of money or like a small amount of money",,,140.1,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher,"Well, when you think of a paycheck every week that would be a smaller amount for what you would make for the entire month",,,140.1,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher, Does that make sense?,,,140.1,remark,0,1,1
80,Farrah, But I don't I still don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,140.1,response,0,1,1
80,Farrah,"Um, I guess so",,,140.1,response,0,1,1
80,Farrah,"Well, it's not wrong",,,110.2,response,0,1,1
80,Farrah,But I'm just wanting you to look at it and different views,,,140.1,response,0,1,1
80,Farrah, But when you look at it over a whole month that's only a partial of the money,,,140.1,response,0,1,1
80,Farrah, So in one week that might be a lot of money,,,140.1,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher,Does that makes sense?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
80,Farrah, Um,,,150.1,response,0,1,1
80,Farrah," Because I don't have a job and so like, so I don't really get, like, you know, for grownups and and how much money they have",,,150.1,response,0,1,1
80,Farrah,"I mean, I guess so",,,150.1,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher,That's okay,,,110.1,remark,0,1,1
80,Farrah," Like, I don't get why is that a wrong answer",,,110.1,response,0,1,1
80,Farrah," Let me see, what did I circle okay I circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,110.1,response,0,1,1
80,Farrah,"But, but I actually, I was talking about, like, my answer to the question because cuz I I wrote that",,,110.1,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher,"Well, they didn't send a microscope",,,130.3,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher, They sent a machine called the lunar orbit orbiter right,,,130.3,remark,0,1,1
80,Farrah,But the microscope is a machine,,,130.3,response,0,1,1
80,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher,It is,,,110.4,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher,"Is a tool that they use because the deposits are so small you can't see it with your eyes, you have to use the tool of a microscope to be able to see it",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher," However, that's not, they didn't just send a microscope up to the moon",,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher,They had to send this machine called the lunar orbiter right,,,130.3,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher,So you were partially correct that you do need a microscope to see this,,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher,Does that make a little bit more sense?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
80,Farrah, Like they sent I sent this Lunar Orbiter,,,150.1,response,0,1,1
80,Farrah, You did tell me like I hear what you're saying,,,150.1,response,0,1,1
80,Farrah," Um, but what--",,,150.1,response,0,1,1
80,Farrah,"Um, I mean, I guess",,,150.1,response,0,1,1
80,Farrah," I mean, I guess, cuz you're you",,,150.1,response,0,1,1
80,Oliver,"Okay, I had, it's me, Oliver, I have the same answer as Savannha, right",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Oliver," And I looked at the question and the question says what equipment did scientists use, so I was like looking and to discover the water, I was like, you know, I was, I was looking at the um story to for for equipment and look for, like, I'm looking for water",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Oliver," Um, cuz I looked at the the the story",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Farrah," And I was like, okay, a microscope is like a tool and tool is like equipment and they said that they they use it to look for the water and so yeah, that's the same",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Farrah,"Yeah, I did the same thing",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher,"Well, you are you are partially correct, but the the equipment that they sent was this machine called the Lunar Orbiter and that was able to go across the ground, the surface, the moon surface to check for these deposits",,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher,Yes Chris,,,,remark,0,1,1
80,Chris,"Um, yeah, I went to NASA with my dad and so I know a lot about this stuff too in space, like the astronauts need oxygen tanks and they need masks and they need suits too",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Chris,"Yes, they do",,,110.2,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher,So would someone like to read me the third paragraph?,,,120.3,remark,0,1,1
80,Luis,"Um, I can read it",,,120.3,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher,Teach: Okay,,,,remark,0,1,1
80,Luis, The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you are looking straight at it,,,,response,0,1,1
80,Luis,"Okay, um, that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Luis," Oh yeah, that's where you that's where you got your answer, Farrah and Oliver",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Luis,You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher, So have you all  you seen frost in the wintertime or in the fall?,,,140.1,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher,Yeah,,,140.1,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher,Have you seen on your mom's car windows or the grass?,,,140.1,remark,0,1,1
80,Luis,"Um, um, yeah, like on a car",,,140.1,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher,Okay that is moisture,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher, But that's still bigger than the moisture they found on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
80,Teacher," We can see frost with our naked eye, but what they found on the moon, we would not even be able to tell that it's there without the Lunar Orbiter and the and the microscope, being able to see that",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
80,Luis,Okay--,,,210.4,response,0,1,1
80,Luis," So, um, I just want to say thanks for for coming to our class and really taking some time to listen to all of our ideas because sometimes the teachers don't always listen to everything that we have to say and trying to help us with a question",,,,response,0,1,1
80,Luis,I'm a little bit but I just looked at the clock and I realized that it's time for us to go to lunch,,,,response,0,1,1
80,Teacher,"Okay, I think I'm ready, we can start the simulation",,,,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,Hello,,,,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher, Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,"Okay, we've just answered what equipment",,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,"Luis Can you tell me, can you read the paragraph, where it says",,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher, Where did you find evidence that,,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,The scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Luis," I also want to say that I don't think I should be in this group, I already know a lot about space",,,230.2,response,1,1,1
80,Luis,"Okay, well yeah I I can read it",,,230.2,response,1,1,1
80,Teacher,"Well, that will really help us by you knowing some things because you might be able to teach us some things we don't know",,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,"Okay, why",,,,remark,1,1,1
80,Luis,"Okay, okay, what did you want me to read",,,,response,1,1,1
80,Teacher,"Where paragraph, does it talk about the scientists use a equipment like oxygen tanks",,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Luis,"Okay, I'm walking",,,230.2,response,1,1,1
80,Luis,"Well, I guess I don't really see oxygen tanks in here",,,,response,1,1,1
80,Luis,"I was just something I know, I know",,,,response,1,1,1
80,Teacher," Um, we definitely need oxygen",,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,Okay,,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher," When we go to space, don't we, because we don't have oxygen up there like we do here",,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Luis, Scientists can't breathe the astronauts can't breathe out oxygen tank,,,110.2,response,1,1,1
80,Luis,Yeah,,,110.2,response,1,1,1
80,Teacher, Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,That's right,,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher, So let's look at our passage and see what equipment,,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher, Can anybody tell me,,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,Let's look at our passages and let's see what paragraph that that might be,,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
80,Chris, Paragraph one,,,120.3,response,1,1,1
80,Chris,I found my answer,,,120.3,response,1,1,1
80,Chris,Because they were talking about the water there about how there's a lot of water in the craters,,,,response,1,1,1
80,Teacher, Did they use to find that,,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,"Okay, but we're going to what equipment",,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,"What about number, paragraph two, could anybody find that answer",,,120.4,remark,1,1,1
80,Farrah,"Yeah, I found the equipment, but it wasn't an aircraft to I found the equipment in paragraph three because yeah",,,120.4,response,1,1,1
80,Teacher, Can you tell me where what you found,,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,Great,,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Farrah,Yeah,,,230.2,response,1,1,1
80,Farrah," So, in paragraph three, it says that the water they found is microscopic and they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,230.2,response,1,1,1
80,Teacher," Why would a microscope, help us see the water",,,230.1,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,Excellent,,,230.1,remark,1,1,1
80,Farrah,Because you need a microscope to look at things,,,230.1,response,1,1,1
80,Teacher,"Because it's so it's so big, or it's so small",,,230.1,remark,1,1,1
80,Farrah,Because it's so small,,,230.1,response,1,1,1
80,Teacher, Do you think the water on the moon looks the same as a glass of water that we would drink,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,Okay,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
80,Farrah,I don't know,,,210.4,response,1,1,1

80,Teacher,What does it say right after that,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
80,Farrah,Okay,,,210.4,response,1,1,1
80,Farrah,Let me see,,,,response,1,1,1
80,Farrah, If you were looking straight at it,,,,response,1,1,1
80,Farrah,You wouldn't be able to see it,,,,response,1,1,1
80,Teacher, Can't wait,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher," So if we're having a glass of water with our lunch, we can see that",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher, Yes,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher, We can see that there's something in our glass,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,Good,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,So what does that tell us that the water on the moon is what compared to the water that we have here,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1

80,Teacher,"Your, your answer is not wrong",,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,You need a microscope to be able,,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,To see it,,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,"But they also use the Lunar Orbiter to that's what they use to find the water that there was water in the crater, then they had to go and use a microscope",,,130.3,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher, Okay,,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher, Okay,,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,Let's look back at the text,,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,"Says, and and paragraph to the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,So how do you think that lunar orbiter is being able to do that,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
80,Farrah,How's the lunar orbiter able to do that,,,210.4,response,1,1,1

80,Teacher,And see the surface of the moon,,,130.3,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,Then once they figured out that there was,,,130.1,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher," Okay, the microscope actually gave them the evidence",,,130.1,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,"Deposits, a very small water then they had to get the microscope out to make sure what they thought was there",,,130.1,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,That there was water on the moon,,,130.1,remark,1,1,1
80,Teacher,You understand that,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
80,Farrah,I'm thinking about,,,150.1,response,1,1,1
80,Farrah," Okay, so what you're saying is that they sent the Lunar Orbiter and then they found the water and then they use the microscope to",,,150.1,response,1,1,1
80,Farrah,To look at the water,,,,response,1,1,1
80,Teacher," Because remember, in paragraph three, it says, we wouldn't be able to see the water",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1

80,Teacher, Let's talk about your answer,,,230.2,remark,2,1,1
80,Chris,In the first paragraph,,,230.2,response,2,1,1
80,Chris,It says that scientists have found evidence that water can be deeper than the polar craters,,,,response,2,1,1
80,Teacher, Did it say that it was there,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1

80,Chris,Water can be,,,,response,2,1,1
80,Chris,"Hmm, well I guess because it said that they found evidence about the water that I thought that that meant that they found the water",,,,response,2,1,1
80,Teacher,"Yes, sometimes we have to read this passage, maybe more than one time to really understand what it's saying to us right",,,150.1,remark,2,1,1

80,Teacher,It was more than the lunar orbiter that they use dry,,,130.3,remark,2,1,1
80,Teacher,Because it wants to know what equipment and so they sent the Lunar Orbiter,,,130.3,remark,2,1,1
80,Teacher,"But what else, what other kind of equipment or tool",,,120.1,remark,2,1,1
80,Teacher, Did they have to use,,,120.1,remark,2,1,1

80,Teacher,"Well, the tool they had that the equipment they had to use",,,130.3,remark,2,1,1
80,Teacher,Was the Lunar Orbiter to find the water,,,130.3,remark,2,1,1
80,Teacher,Then to actually make sure that they see it,,,130.3,remark,2,1,1

81,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,0,4
81,Teacher,"Well, it's great that you know a lot about space, but we're going to specifically talk about the moon and the water that was found on the moon",,,220.1,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher, I want,,,220.1,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher, OK,,,220.1,remark,1,0,4

81,Teacher, Okay,,,220.1,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,"But I want us to look deeper into that the question asked us, okay, because we all struggled a little bit with giving a specific answer to the question",,,220.1,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher, So can we go ahead and look back at the question and I want you to circle or underline two key words that you think are important in the question,,,420.1,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,So there are two key words that I want us to look for when we're looking at the question,,,420.1,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher," Did you guys circle, a word",,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,All right,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4

81,Teacher," Okay, so the two words that we really want to focus on is equipment and discover,",,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,"so some of your answers did involve equipment, but it also needed to involve the word discover",,,430.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Farrah,"I just, I was just wondering, Well my answer was wrong",,,210.2,response,1,0,4
81,Teacher,"Okay, so you said that you'd meet a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and you are right, the microscope is a piece of equipment",,,130.1,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher, It says that they use this equipment to discover water to find water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,That scientists use,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher," But remember, the second word that you circled or underlined in the question was, discover so they in the paragraph",,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,"Okay, good, so blessed",,,,remark,1,0,4
81,Farrah,To be get the microphone because they probably use the microscope to discover,,,,response,1,0,4
81,Farrah," I guess I'm still wondering, I did",,,,response,1,0,4
81,Teacher,"Okay, well let's look back at our reading passage and Farrah and Oliver since you guys had the same answer of microscope",,,130.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher, I want you guys to look back at your reading passage,,,130.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,and if you finish before I come back to you,,,130.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,And remember your two key words equipment and discover and look back to see if you can find a paragraph and the passage that uses the word discover and equipment,,,420.3,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher, Go ahead and work on the next question,,,130.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,1,0,4

81,Chris, We saw EXCITED TO SET US Basques shoot and stuff like that,,,,response,1,0,4
81,Chris," So I guess I was wondering like it like, is that something that is that an answer",,,,response,1,0,4
81,Teacher, You're right,,,410.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher, There are a piece of equipment that they used,,,410.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher," And, but if you look back in our paragraph like our set our reading passage, there's going to be one specific tool",,,410.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,So scientists do use those type of things,,,410.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,To discover the water,,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher, So would you like to go ahead and start looking back through the passage to see if you can use the word discover and equipment defined your answer,,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher," And Luis you also were right that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks,",,,130.1,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,"Yeah, sure",,,130.1,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher, Okay,,,130.1,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,but we said when we circled in the second key word,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,"so, would you like to look back in your paragraph to see if you can find",,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,"In our question that we need to also look for the word discovered what they use to discover, discover is an action word",,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher, It's something that they did,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
81,Teacher,That answer,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4

81,Teacher, Farrah,,,420.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,"So our second question that we answered, um, was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,0,4
81,Farrah,"Should we, should we circle the words, this time",,,420.1,response,2,0,4
81,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,"Yes, you can circle or underline them",,,,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,Go ahead and look for two words in the past or in the question,,,420.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, Okay,,,,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,Everybody finished,,,,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,Can someone tell me what two words that they circled,,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,"Right jack Jazmin, what's, what's a word that you circled",,,,remark,2,0,4
81,Jazmin," Okay, so I circled water and I circle",,,,response,2,0,4
81,Jazmin,"Okay, so basically what I said was, I said that",,,,response,2,0,4
81,Jazmin,Value,,,,response,2,0,4
81,Teacher, That's right,,,130.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, But we're going to look for one more thing,,,130.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, Could you tell me what word another word that you circled,,,130.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, One more,,,130.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,Valuable okay yes I agree that valuable is a key word,,,130.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, Other key word in the question so Farrah,,,130.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Farrah," So, okay, I should actually, I had a question, because I circled",,,130.1,response,2,0,4
81,Farrah,"Oh, yeah",,,130.1,response,2,0,4
81,Farrah,Valuable,,,,response,2,0,4
81,Farrah,"And then I also circle evidence, but I thought I should circle convincing too",,,,response,2,0,4
81,Teacher,"But yes, the two key words that I was wanting you guys to find was evidence and valuable yes def",,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,That's a very good point,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, So you could circle convincing evidence together,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher," Yeah, that's a great idea",,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Oliver,"Oh, I think to answer my question",,,310.1,response,2,0,4
81,Teacher,"Okay, good",,,,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, Jazmin,,,,remark,2,0,4
81,Jazmin,So I was just thinking that you could use the water to make a garden on the moon,,,,response,2,0,4
81,Teacher,So let's look back at our question,,,120.2,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, You could if there's enough water,,,110.2,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher," It says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,That is true,,,110.2,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,So now that we know the two key words that we need to look for in our reading passage is evidence and valuable,,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, Can everybody look back at the reading passage and underline what you think a good answer would be,,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher," Did anybody see that in paragraph four, the word valuable is actually at the beginning of the paragraph",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,Okay,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,Good,,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, So who would like to share what they circled on their paper or on their breeding passage,,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,"Chris, what did you underline or circle",,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
81,Chris,"Okay, so what I circled up",,,120.4,response,2,0,4
81,Chris," All right, what I was looking at was, I was thinking like that water can be broken down into two parts, and that was where was that, oh yeah, in paragraph by water can be broken down two parts hydrogen and oxygen",,,120.4,response,2,0,4
81,Teacher,"So, Chris I want you to take a moment and look back at paragraph four, where we see the word valuable okay because we're looking for evidence that water is valuable",,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, Okay,,,110.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,Good,,,110.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, It's important,,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,"Okay, Farrah, you know, what did you underline or circle",,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
81,Farrah,"So, okay, be what I was looking at",,,120.4,response,2,0,4
81,Farrah," So the stuff that I was focused on like I was doing the reading was I was looking in the past, paragraph paragraph six that are making this plan will take a lot of time",,,,response,2,0,4
81,Farrah,Well basically I was thinking that it's valuable,,,,response,2,0,4
81,Farrah,"Like, I think it would take a long time",,,,response,2,0,4
81,Farrah," You know what I mean, I think it would be valuable",,,,response,2,0,4
81,Farrah, Maybe,,,,response,2,0,4
81,Farrah," Sure, but I don't think it's valuable right now",,,,response,2,0,4
81,Farrah, And I don't think it would be valuable for for a long time,,,,response,2,0,4
81,Teacher,"Well, that's okay",,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, And we always want to make sure that we're looking forward,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, Even if it's not valuable right now,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, Like you just said in your answer that it would be valuable in the future,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, Can you do that,,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher," Now, but in the future",,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,"So like you said you have a good, you have a good point that it may not be valuable",,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,"so let's look look back at paragraph four, and see how, in the future, water would be valuable",,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, It would be,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, All right,,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher, Then what did you underline or circle,,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
81,Teacher,Okay,,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
81,Oliver, But before we go to lunch,,,120.4,response,2,0,4
81,Oliver," I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and, like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you",,,120.4,response,2,0,4
81,Oliver,"So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,120.4,response,2,0,4
81,Oliver," So that was really cool, thank you so much for working with us",,,,response,2,0,4
81,Oliver,For like making sure that we all felt valued and like also you made sure that we were using evidence really clearly like that we were going back to the text to make sure that's where we brought our evidence,,,,response,2,0,4
82,Teacher,"I love that Farrah, use the text when she found her answer and I wonder if",,,310.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, So I know where your answer came from,,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"Deb, I know you said that you had the same answer as Farrah, but if you could find that in the text and circle it",,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, That would be awesome,,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Oliver,No problem,,,420.2,response,0,1,1
82,Teacher, And that's absolutely something that was in that reading,,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,but we're trying to figure out what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, That is absolutely true,,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,Chris scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,So can you look a little deeper and try to answer that question?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Luis,"I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,150.1,response,0,1,1
82,Teacher,You know all about space?,,,110.3,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,Can you tell me more?,,,230.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Luis,I watch a lot of--,,,230.1,response,0,1,1
82,Luis,"Sure, sure",,,,response,0,1,1
82,Luis, So I know that astronauts need like um they need oxygen masks,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Luis, I watch a lot of YouTube videos,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Luis, So they have to wear these really heavy boots to help them to walk on the moon,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Luis,"and often because there isn't any way to breathe, there's no oxygen space and there's no gravity in space",,,,response,0,1,1
82,Luis,"Um, and then there's like a space shuttle that takes off, but it has like two parts to it and one part falls off and then the other part like shoots them off into space",,,,response,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"Luis, that is such awesome information and I'm so proud of you, that you go out and look for that information on your free time, and I can't wait to share all of that information with the rest of the class when we get back with them",,,110.3,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher," Oh, nice",,,110.3,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, Thumbs up,,,110.3,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, I love that you know about oxygen,,,110.3,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, That's awesome,,,110.3,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"For right now, I love that you know that there's oxygen tanks",,,110.3,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher," Can you look back in the reading and there might be YouTube videos on this, too, that you can look at a little bit later, when you get back home",,,120.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,but we're going to talk a little bit about the wate,,,120.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"But can you look back in the reading and can you tell me It just the same way that you found out about the oxygen can you look back about the water and see what it says about that because I think if we use our brain just for a little bit and we read that reading, you're going to have all those same answers about the water too",,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Luis,Okay,,,150.1,response,0,1,1
82,Teacher," I'm looking for the specific name and it starts with the letter M, if that's helpful",,,430.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, You can look back in your reading for that,,,430.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, I would love if you could tell me a little bit more about what that machine is,,,430.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,And Jazmin NASA send out a small machine,,,430.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Jazmin,"Okay, because I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,430.2,response,0,1,1
82,Jazmin,So I'll look and see,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"Well, Jazmin, don't think that your answer is wrong, sweetheart",,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,I just want you to get a little bit more specific with what you tell me,,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.2,response,0,1,1
82,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, Did you find that answer in there?,,,120.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,Chris,,,120.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Chris,"Yeah, about the water?",,,120.1,response,0,1,1
82,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,1,1
82,Chris, It talks about how the scientists found evidence that the water can be found in the crater to really dark craters,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Chris,"Yeah, I did",,,,response,0,1,1
82,Chris, It's in paragraph 1,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"All right, well, that's awesome",,,110.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"So, in paragraph one, it does tell us, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters",,,110.4,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"I wonder, maybe Oliver can help us out because I sent him on this mission to find this answer",,,130.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, So we know where it was,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"I wonder, it's asking about the equipment",,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, So that's kind of like the machine that was used to discover it,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, But now we're asking about the machine,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, Did you find that answer in the in the text?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,So Oliver,,,230.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Oliver,"Yeah yeah I when I looked on, and to find the answer and I had circled the part that's the very last sentence of the whole text it says",,,230.2,response,0,1,1
82,Oliver, So that's how I got it,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Oliver,"You'd need scientific to the tool called a microscope to really closely and because a microscope is a tool and like, yeah, like, like a tool is like equipment, you know",,,,response,0,1,1
82,Teacher,I love that you cited where you found it in the text,,,310.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"Farrah, would you agree with what Oliver said?",,,130.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Farrah, And that's what the question is asking,,,130.2,response,0,1,1
82,Farrah, Because they were looking at the water,,,130.2,response,0,1,1
82,Farrah, I had circle too Oliver,,,130.2,response,0,1,1
82,Farrah,Yeah yeah cuz that that was the same,,,130.2,response,0,1,1
82,Farrah, I had circled like you know you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,130.2,response,0,1,1
82,Teacher,Jazmin,,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, Did you did you hear how they gave it a little bit more of a specific name? So instead of just saying a small machine,,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, Did you find that in the text?,,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, They called it a microscope,,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Jazmin,"No, sorry I wasn't, I was, I was reading again",,,,response,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"That's okay, sweetheart",,,,remark,0,1,1
82,Jazmin, I wasn't paying attention,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Chris,Sorry to interrupt,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Chris, I went to NASA,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Chris, I just wanted to say that I know a lot,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Teacher,I'm sure they do and I bet that Luis could probably tell you more and you can share that information together,,,110.3,remark,0,1,1
82,Luis,"Yeah, I can",,,110.3,response,0,1,1
82,Farrah,"Oh yeah, sorry Chris was, before Chris interrupted, we were, um, I was trying to figure out, like, what was the problem with my answer too cuz I mean an equipment as a tool",,,,response,0,1,1
82,Farrah, It's the same thing,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Teacher, So they're synonyms of each other,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, So when we have something that's the same word for a tool we would call it a synonym,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"You right equipment and tools, the equipment is another word for a tool",,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"So Farrah, you said you need a specific tool called a microscope to look really closely which is absolutely true",,,310.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, Instead of saying equipment like the question did you just said tool,,,310.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"And that's perfectly because they're synonyms, which means that they're the same or they mean the same thing",,,310.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Farrah," Yeah, exactly",,,310.1,response,0,1,1
82,Farrah,Great,,,310.1,response,0,1,1
82,Farrah,"But then so so so what, why is my answer wrong?",,,,response,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"Your answer is not wrong, honey, you're, you're right",,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,You told me and you gave it to me from the text that a microscope is what is needed to look really really closely,,,310.1,remark,0,1,1
82,Farrah,"Oh, oh, okay, well then why",,,310.1,response,0,1,1
82,Oliver," Um, it's, it's, but I was I was looking at the clock, and it's actually, it's time for us to go to lunch",,,,response,0,1,1
82,Oliver, I'm sorry to interrupt,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Oliver, And you're also you're really a nice teacher,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Oliver, I know this was really short,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Oliver," And we just, I really appreciate how how you like each of us question and and look again",,,,response,0,1,1
82,Oliver, Thank you,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Oliver,I'm sorry,,,,response,0,1,1
82,Teacher,"Well, thank you",,,,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher, Chris and I appreciate that,,,,remark,0,1,1
82,Teacher,Start simulation,,,,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher, Farrah,,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,Hey everybody,,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher, You said that you use the microscope to look closely,,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher," I loved your answer, but I want to challenge you a little bit",,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,"But take a look at the question and what it's asking, it's asking us what was used to discover water",,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,do you know the difference or can you explain the difference between discovering and looking,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Luis,Excuse me Ms,,,210.2,response,1,1,1
82,Luis," Teache while she's thinking I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,210.2,response,1,1,1
82,Teacher,"Luis, then you'll be able to help us as we as we explore a little bit more about what we what we've read about",,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,"So when you discover something, have you ever seen it before?",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Farrah," It's like when you find something, I guess",,,210.2,response,1,1,1
82,Farrah,I guess like I'm when I discover on I was thinking more,,,210.2,response,1,1,1
82,Teacher,Finding it but planning it for the first time,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher," That's how I would change your answer, just a little bit to make it a little bit more clear now",,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,Looking into and finding it for the first time,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,"Oliver, you told me that you circled the same answer as Farrah but I want you to challenge you and see if you can find in the text where it says or where it talks about a microscope, because",,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Oliver," Well, yeah, it's the last, the last sentence",,,230.2,response,1,1,1
82,Oliver,"I circled it in the last paragraph, but it was just hard Farrah said her answer before mine and she have the same answer as me",,,230.2,response,1,1,1
82,Oliver, And the last paragraph,,,230.2,response,1,1,1
82,Teacher,"Okay, great",,,310.1,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher," I'm glad that you had some place that you could reference back to, because that's really helpful in showing me that you know where the information came from",,,310.1,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,But I do want to challenge you to go back and would you actually read the the discussion question for me again,,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,"Scientists found craters full of water on the moon, you are absolutely correct",,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Chris,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,110.2,response,1,1,1
82,Teacher,"So look at your answer and look at the question and see if your answer actually answered the question that was a lot of those a lot of words that were the same, but you have your answer actually is answering the question while you're looking, I'm going to hop over to Jazmin",,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
82,Jazmin,"Yeah, I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,420.1,response,1,1,1
82,Teacher,"Your answers not wrong, but I want you to be more specific",,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher," So a small machine is great, but there's more specific information in there that could give a more specific answer",,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,"I asked Farrah over there who could go deeper into the text and find her answer, you should be able to pull it right from the text",,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,Can you look for that for me,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.2,response,1,1,1
82,Jazmin, So I just have to write the whole stuffer sentence,,,,response,1,1,1
82,Jazmin,"Oh, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,,response,1,1,1
82,Teacher,"Well, they used a lunar orbiter",,,430.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher, But we need to figure out what in the world that is so keep reading and see if you can find that one word That I'm looking for,,,430.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,Luis you've been super patient with me,,,,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher, So I know that you can really help us out here,,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,And I know that you know a lot about space,,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,Scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,"And I want to challenge, just like Chris, take a look at that question",,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher, Can you read the question for me,,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
82,Luis,Um yeah okay um what scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,response,1,1,1
82,Teacher,Now did scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon?,,,210.3,remark,1,1,1
82,Luis," They didn't use them to discover water on the moon, but they use oxygen tanks to breathe on the moon",,,210.3,response,1,1,1
82,Luis,"Well, I mean, no",,,210.3,response,1,1,1
82,Teacher,"And that's awesome, and I love that you know that because it's very, very helpful and necessary for all those astronauts up there",,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher, It's answering a different question,,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,But it's not answering that specific question that was being asked of us,,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,"So let's hop back to Chris for a second and see if he was able to find what answered, or the answer to this specific question",,,130.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher, So even though your answer is true,,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
82,Chris," Um, but then I remembered that you told Farrah that finding isn't the same thing as discovering so now I'm not really sure, you know",,,130.2,response,1,1,1
82,Chris,"Okay, so I saw in the first paragraph, where they're talking about the water and the water was found deep within the moon's polar craters",,,130.2,response,1,1,1
82,Teacher," Chris, it's totally okay when you just-",,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher,"Whoa, okay",,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher," So, that's okay",,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
82,Teacher, So finding a finding and discovering are really similar words and I totally understand why we could get confused with them,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
82,Chris,"I mean, I know stuff about speaks to like Luis I went to NASA",,,150.1,response,1,1,1
82,Chris," So I know that our scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks in suits, but I just don't know which equipment they use to, to, to find the water or, I guess, discover water on the moon",,,150.1,response,1,1,1
82,Teacher,Let me point you in the right direction,,,120.3,remark,1,1,1

83,Teacher,Gotcha,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
83,Teacher,"So do you think Chris, that if we're asking about the equipment that's used for water, we would need all of the different equipment or only just the parts that would help us discover the water?",,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
83,Chris,That's a really good question,,,210.3,response,1,0,3
83,Teacher,"Yeah, that was a big question",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3

83,Jazmin,And I would say that it's in paragraph two and that's where you would find that like where you will find the equipment used to discover the water,,,230.2,response,1,0,3
83,Chris,And I just want to say that I think it's important for me with the microscope,,,,response,1,0,3
83,Chris," But unfortunately, we just have to go to lunch to wanted to thank you so much for working with us but but we have to go look",,,,response,1,0,3
83,Teacher, He said he thought it was in paragraph three,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3

83,Teacher,Wonderful,,,230.2,remark,2,0,3
83,Farrah,"Well, I guess I can see how the small machine or I guess the lunar orbiter is the small machine like I could see how that was used to discover",,,230.2,response,2,0,3
83,Farrah, So I guess I guess what I was thinking is like you can't see the water without the microscope,,,,response,2,0,3
83,Farrah," So, like, how could you discover it?",,,,response,2,0,3
83,Farrah,"So the water you see is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close",,,,response,2,0,3
83,Teacher," Can anyone tell me what they think would be the answer to Farrahs question, which is, wouldn't it be the microscope that discovered the water or can Jazmin support her answer with evidence that is the Lunar Orbiter",,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher,Okay that's a great question,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher, Okay Luis What do you think?,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
83,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,130.2,response,2,0,3
83,Luis, You can detect water using other tools,,,130.2,response,2,0,3
83,Luis," Just like on the question that you're asking is, like, you use lots of equipment and you don't need a microscope to to detect it",,,130.2,response,2,0,3
83,Luis, So what I was thinking,,,130.2,response,2,0,3
83,Teacher,"Okay, I like that answer a lot and Chris, would you like to add anything to that",,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
83,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,110.1,response,2,0,3
83,Chris," So I guess I wish to keep kind of the same thing that basically there's lots of equipment you, you could use",,,110.1,response,2,0,3
83,Chris, So like you don't the microscope isn't necessarily the quick,,,110.1,response,2,0,3
83,Chris, It could be other things,,,110.1,response,2,0,3
83,Chris, You know what I mean like it could be sensors,,,110.1,response,2,0,3
83,Teacher, That's very true,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher," Jazmin, what would you like to add",,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher,Yes,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher, Okay,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
83,Jazmin,He said that I support my answer right,,,110.1,response,2,0,3
83,Jazmin, So the question was what equipment it scientists use to discover the water,,,,response,2,0,3
83,Jazmin,"So, okay, yes",,,,response,2,0,3
83,Jazmin, Here's how I would support my answer,,,,response,2,0,3
83,Jazmin,"I was thinking that the word discovers like the word investigate so like it seemed like the best answer was, like, what was the word that matched the question right and even though you might use the microscope study the water like you use the Lunar Orbiter to discover the water",,,,response,2,0,3
83,Teacher,"Oh, what a nice way to explain that",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher,"Farrah, are you able to relate to what Jazmin was saying where the lunar orbiter is what we use to actually discover the water, but the microscope is what we use to study the water",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
83,Farrah,"Yeah, actually",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
83,Farrah, That does mean a lot of sense,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
83,Farrah, Okay,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
83,Farrah,"I still like, I guess I'm not like 100% sure but I do understand like that that matches the word keyword",,,,response,2,0,3
83,Teacher,Right to discover the water is the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher," Okay, so someone raise your hand and tell me some of the other equipment that we've talked about in this reading",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher, Was there any other equipment that they've talked about,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher,What we've talked about the lunar Lunar Orbiter and we've talked about the microscope,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,2,0,3
83,Luis," Okay, you said what they talked about so not like what we were saying",,,,response,2,0,3
83,Luis,"Um, well, I guess",,,,response,2,0,3
83,Teacher,"What we read in our, what we read in the paragraphs was there other equipment that was discussed in the paragraph that we read?",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
83,Luis,"You know, I guess not",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
83,Luis," Like, there really isn't other",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
83,Luis, It's just a microscope and the lunar orbiter in the text,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
83,Teacher,"Okay, anybody else have a different answer than that",,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher,Just those two pieces of equipment,,,110.4,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher," Okay, wonderful",,,110.4,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher,Let's go to question two is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher,What is the question asking us for please raise your hand if you think you know what the question is asking us,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
83,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,2,0,3
83,Jazmin, I just wanted to take a moment,,,,response,2,0,3
83,Jazmin, But before we go too much,,,,response,2,0,3
83,Jazmin,We have to go to lunch,,,,response,2,0,3
83,Jazmin,"And I really wanted to thank you because there's a couple things that you were doing that, like, really helped us understand like the question and get to the answer,",,,,response,2,0,3
83,Jazmin,"First that you've really helped us to clarify, like how you were asked, like, you know, the ways that you asked us about our thinking and like what we were saying, and like, in order to like use evidence to justify our answers",,,,response,2,0,3
83,Jazmin,Like you really gave us a chance to explain it,,,,response,2,0,3
83,Jazmin, And that was pretty cool because like we don't always get to like explain what we were thinking,,,,response,2,0,3
83,Jazmin,"And also that you really value our thining, even though it looks like lunar orbiter the right answer",,,,response,2,0,3
83,Jazmin, Like you really valued what we were thinking about ans where they were coming from,,,,response,2,0,3
83,Jazmin," So, like, that was really cool to be able to begin that but especially to like be looking at all that stuff",,,,response,2,0,3
83,Jazmin, So thank you so much!,,,,response,2,0,3
83,Jazmin,"And I also, you know, like we're really beginning to ask us like you know like what we needed to work on and like we're giving ideas for how to improve it",,,,response,2,0,3
83,Teacher," So, could I please hear a little bit more about the scientific tool like a microscope that you think you might need?",,,120.1,remark,0,0,3
83,Teacher,Hi everybody,,,120.1,remark,0,0,3

83,Oliver,"Well, I mean, yeah",,,110.1,response,0,0,3
83,Oliver," What I liked about, you know, like my answer, um, which Farrah had the same one true, um, was that the question asked her about, um, let me see the question asked her about equipment and a microscope is like a tool",,,110.1,response,0,0,3
83,Oliver,You need a scientific tool,,,,response,0,0,3

84,Teacher, But our discussion question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?,,,120.2,remark,0,1,4
84,Teacher,So Farrah and Oliver,,,,remark,0,1,4
84,Teacher,"You guys said they use the scientific tool called a microscope, which that's answering the question",,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
84,Teacher, Right?,,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
84,Farrah, So that's equipment,,,110.2,response,0,1,4

84,Luis,Yeah,,,,response,0,1,4
84,Luis, That's like the same thing,,,,response,0,1,4
84,Farrah,"Yeah yeah cuz a microscope is a tool, a scientific tool",,,110.2,response,0,1,4
84,Luis," You know, like that's equipment on tool and equipment",,,,response,0,1,4
84,Teacher,Right and then it says what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,4
84,Teacher,So can you guys look back at paragraph two?,,,120.3,remark,0,1,4
84,Chris,I went to NASA,,,120.2,response,0,1,4
84,Chris,I know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,1,4
84,Chris," A lot, a lot of different equipment",,,,response,0,1,4
84,Teacher,"Right, so they wouldn't, you would need more than just a microscope to look at it right",,,210.1,remark,0,1,4
84,Chris,"Right, yeah",,,210.1,response,0,1,4
84,Teacher, And what else could she have put instead of just a small machine?,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
84,Teacher," And she said, NASA send a small machine",,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
84,Teacher,"Right, so that's why I was looking at Jazmin's answer",,,210.3,remark,0,1,4

84,Teacher, He is to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
84,Teacher,So I want us to look at the question and it said the question asked what equipment did scientist,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
84,Teacher, So we're trying to figure out what equipment so what what sort of tool did scientists to use to find the water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
84,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,2,1,4

84,Teacher," She said that, um, let me see if I found it NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
84,Teacher,Perfect so answering that Jazmin answered it perfectly,,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
84,Teacher,Correct?,,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
84,Teacher, But it's not the specific machine,,,410.2,remark,2,1,4
84,Teacher,And Luis That you put scientists found is using a small machine so that small machine is correct that small machine could be any sort of tool,,,410.2,remark,2,1,4
84,Luis,Okay,,,410.2,response,2,1,4
84,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,2,1,4

84,Luis, It's just that I didn't say enough?,,,150.1,response,2,1,4
84,Teacher,Your answer was that scientists found I see using smaller machines,,,130.2,remark,2,1,4
84,Teacher," But guys, did we know that ice is water right?q",,,130.2,remark,2,1,4
84,Chris,"Yeah, for, for me, that's why I was I was confused because I was looking for water in the story",,,130.2,response,2,1,4

84,Teacher, How many of you guys were looking for the word water in the in the passage,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
84,Teacher,"Yeah, and that's that's understandable because that's what the question asked was What did they use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,2,1,4
84,Teacher,So whenever we're looking in our passage we have to be able to  read and understand that ice on the moon is the same thing as water,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
84,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like tanks and masks and suits,,,210.4,response,2,1,4
84,Chris, I went to NASA,,,210.4,response,2,1,4

85,Teacher,So it is asking in the text field like back in the text,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
85,Teacher, There's one piece of equipment that they used looking for that water right,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
85,Luis, I saw like in the reading,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
85,Luis,"Well, I saw on you know Orbiter and microscopes that was the equipment",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
85,Teacher, So do you think the microscope to help them,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
85,Teacher, Look for water while they're physically on the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3

85,Teacher, This is it,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
85,Teacher, They use the lunar orbiter right,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
85,Teacher,"And microscopes, it has both of them there that but when it's talking specifically about finding water",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
85,Teacher, See if you can look back in the texts and find where it says film equipment used to find water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
85,Teacher, Chris,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
85,Teacher, Yeah,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
85,Chris,"So we were talking and I was saying, oh,",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
85,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment oxygen tanks and masks and suits and I really think that's the answer,,,,response,1,0,3
85,Chris,"So like I was saying, I know that, like, because I went to NASA with my dad",,,,response,1,0,3
85,Teacher, That's right,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3

85,Teacher," Specifically, right",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
85,Teacher,but in this question specifically it's asking what piece of equipment,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
85,Teacher, Did they use to search for water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
85,Teacher,Well enough,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
85,Teacher,So if you go back in the text and you look in that first part Where they're talking about the piece of equipment,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
85,Teacher,They've talked about the moon being a desert right and they think that there's no water,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3

85,Teacher,"Water on the moon craters full of water, then yeah",,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher,That is the text very good for finding that pulling out all the texts Chris,,,110.2,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher,I think what Chris Jazmin and Luis I think you guys you read the text and you understood the text,,,110.2,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher, Right,,,410.1,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher,And the question I think we need to be a little more specific,,,410.1,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher,So all those facts are right that you guys had but they're wanting a little more specific answer okay,,,410.2,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,2,0,3
85,Chris,So I went to NASA with my dad and we saw that like,,,,response,2,0,3
85,Chris, So I was thinking maybe that was part of the answer,,,,response,2,0,3
85,Chris,"You know, scientists use like oh suits masks, like, stuff like that",,,,response,2,0,3
85,Teacher, They sent the lunar orbiter up,,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher, So those are pieces of equipment that they use it in,,,130.1,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher,"But in this specific case, they didn't need any of that",,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher,"Well, okay",,,130.1,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher, Right,,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher," So, that is correct",,,130.1,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher," So instead, it it checked for water on the moon",,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher,And it went,,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher," If you guys want to look over that text again together, starting with paragraph one, two, and three",,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher,So maybe Chris and Jazmin,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher, I think that may help if you reread that okay,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher,"Now, Luis, our science expert",,,110.3,remark,2,0,3
85,Luis,Yeah,,,110.3,response,2,0,3
85,Teacher,"And they did have lots of equipment right that's what she put on there, but I think you may still be a little confused about what the questions asking",,,410.1,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher, Luis we read it to me one more time,,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher,So let's look at the question again,,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
85,Luis,Yeah,,,120.3,response,2,0,3
85,Luis," Um, okay, so what equipment Did scientists use discover water on the moon",,,120.3,response,2,0,3
85,Teacher,"So if you look back in paragraph two, what does it tell you about the piece of equipment they use, what's it called?",,,420.3,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher, Right,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher,They're looking for quick the equipment,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
85,Luis, Let's see only equipment in paragraph two is the Lunar Orbiter,,,420.3,response,2,0,3
85,Luis,Wow,,,420.3,response,2,0,3
85,Teacher,And what does it say about the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher,Right,,,110.4,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher, That is exactly right,,,110.4,remark,2,0,3
85,Luis, So is the lunar orbiter the right answer,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
85,Luis,"Um, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and then it says like it'll land at the moon south pole look ice deposits",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
85,Teacher, Luis So how's your thinking changed since the very beginning,,,530.1,remark,2,0,3
85,Teacher,Exactly,,,530.1,remark,2,0,3
85,Luis,I'm not totally sure,,,530.1,response,2,0,3
85,Luis,I that I'm like looking at the paper,,,,response,2,0,3
85,Luis," It says that it's like the lunar orbiter is in paragraph two, but I guess not totally sure why that's the answer",,,,response,2,0,3
85,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,2,0,3
85,Jazmin," But we just wanted to thank you so much for working with us, in particular, and really wanted to",,,,response,2,0,3
85,Jazmin,"Fortunately, all happy to watch",,,,response,2,0,3
85,Jazmin,Just like taking the time to help us understand the question,,,,response,2,0,3
85,Jazmin, And make sure that we were reviewing like that and then you're asking us to make sure that we really like you know like we really thought about our eater,,,,response,2,0,3
85,Jazmin," So thank you so much for working with us, it was",,,,response,2,0,3
86,Chris,Hi,,,,response,0,0,1
86,Teacher,Hi,,,,remark,0,0,1

86,Teacher,"Oh, okay",,,,remark,0,0,1
86,Teacher, I think,,,,remark,0,0,1
86,Luis,Excuse me,,,,response,0,0,1
86,Teacher,Yes?,,,,remark,0,0,1
86,Luis,I shouldn't be in this group because I already know all about space,,,,response,0,0,1
86,Teacher,"You think that you know everything about space, you don't have to learn everything more",,,230.3,remark,0,0,1
86,Luis,"Well, I mean, not like everything, but I know a lot a lot a lot about space",,,230.3,response,0,0,1
86,Teacher,"Okay, but maybe there is something that you don't know and you would like to learn or you will be grateful after the class to learn that thing",,,110.3,remark,0,0,1

86,Teacher,"Okay, please, can you please read the question again",,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
86,Oliver,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?,,,120.2,response,0,0,1
86,Teacher,"Okay, so you have to think a little bit more about these questions because it says two words that are essential for your answer and one of the words is equipment and one of the words is water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
86,Teacher, So you have to think about these two words before you try to make an answer,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
86,Teacher,"and, let me read this, um, you said, it, Luis, you said that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but the question is not asking you about what they are using to be on the moon, you have something to say, Savanah?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
86,Farrah, I was going to say that in my answer I did talk about the equipment I talked about the microscope and they use a microscope to look for the water,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
86,Farrah, So I don't know why my answers wrong,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
86,Farrah, So I have both of those,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
86,Farrah," Yeah, I was",,,210.4,response,0,0,1
86,Farrah,On,,,210.4,response,0,0,1

86,Jazmin, Ice is just frozen water right?,,,130.3,response,0,0,1
86,Jazmin,"I don't understand because it says, Oh, what did they use to discover the water",,,130.3,response,0,0,1
86,Jazmin," And so, in paragraph two, they talk all about like looking for the ice deposits, and we we learned in science class that ice and water, are the same thing",,,130.3,response,0,0,1
86,Teacher, Yes,,,130.3,remark,0,0,1
86,Teacher, Right?,,,130.3,remark,0,0,1

86,Teacher," Um, I think that may be you can read a little bit",,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher,"Okay, so you said that NASA send a small machine and that is right, but",,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher,What do you think this Jazmin?,,,120.1,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher,"Um, how can I say maybe you can read again the paragraph to really understand what is this small machine that they use",,,420.3,remark,2,0,1
86,Jazmin,"Like, what is the machine?",,,120.1,response,2,0,1
86,Teacher,"Uh huh, that they used to discover water on the moon",,,120.1,remark,2,0,1
86,Jazmin,Small machine is it's called a lunar orbiter,,,120.1,response,2,0,1
86,Teacher,"Again, please",,,,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher, I didn't hear you,,,,remark,2,0,1
86,Jazmin, The machine is called a lunar orbiter,,,,response,2,0,1
86,Jazmin,Sorry,,,,response,2,0,1
86,Teacher, That's right,,,110.4,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher,Lunar Orbiter,,,110.4,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher, That is the small machine,,,110.4,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher, Okay,,,110.4,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher,But what did they use to find actually water on the moon,,,120.1,remark,2,0,1
86,Jazmin,"Well, I was wondering",,,120.1,response,2,0,1
86,Jazmin,Because when I think about it,,,,response,2,0,1
86,Jazmin, I think it you know they use the Lunar Orbiter and they don't really talk about like having anybody on board,,,,response,2,0,1
86,Jazmin,They had to use some kind of tool,,,,response,2,0,1
86,Jazmin, And then they studied with the microscope,,,,response,2,0,1
86,Jazmin, The to find the water in your enemy,,,,response,2,0,1
86,Jazmin, So I guess they could they have used it seems like they use the Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,2,0,1
86,Teacher, Thank you,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher,"Yes, that's a really good answer",,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher," Yes, mean you are right",,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher,"Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on them on LinkedIn, that that is a good answer to the question, What equipment did they use to discover water on the moon",,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
86,Chris,"I don't know, is it not a good answer?",,,110.1,response,2,0,1
86,Teacher," But if the question says, What equipment did they used to discover what water on the moon",,,120.1,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher, What do you think that should be a good answer to that question,,,120.1,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher,"Yes, that is an answer",,,120.1,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher,If you read the text again,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
86,Chris,"Oh, I guess, like, I guess I would have to say a piece of equipment",,,210.4,response,2,0,1
86,Chris,"Right, like not is that one",,,,response,2,0,1
86,Chris, My answer was,,,,response,2,0,1
86,Chris,What,,,,response,2,0,1
86,Chris," Okay, so what I was gonna say is that basically",,,,response,2,0,1
86,Chris, And I was thinking that was missing fromt he reading,,,,response,2,0,1
86,Chris,"You know, like I went to NASA with my dad and when we, when we saw that scientists use masks and oxygen tanks and stuff",,,,response,2,0,1
86,Teacher,Yes and yes and actually they use oxygen and all the things that you say to be there in the moon to discover water,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher," So yes, that's something really good to add Chris",,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher, Oliver?,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
86,Teacher, Thank you,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
86,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,110.2,response,2,0,1
86,Oliver, I just wanted to take a moment and thank you so much for working with us,,,110.2,response,2,0,1
86,Oliver, But before we go to lunch,,,110.2,response,2,0,1
86,Oliver," So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,110.2,response,2,0,1
86,Oliver, How you asked us to connect like our,,,,response,2,0,1
86,Oliver,"And like, in particular, it was really cool",,,,response,2,0,1
86,Oliver,Our responses to like our experiences and like share with you what we thought about them beyond just our answers,,,,response,2,0,1
86,Oliver,"And that was really cool because it helped us to both like clarify what we were kind of thinking a little bit and then also was like helping us to think about, like,",,,,response,2,0,1
86,Oliver,"What kind of evidence, like maybe we should do so like I think everybody by like talking to everybody",,,,response,2,0,1
86,Oliver, You asked everybody like,,,,response,2,0,1
86,Oliver, And that was really cool,,,,response,2,0,1
86,Oliver,"You know what I mean, like, Who should like who should talk and like you can share",,,,response,2,0,1

87,Oliver,"Hi, Mister A",,,,response,0,0,1
87,Teacher,So we just finished up our reading today and I'm interested to know and i think i've just got your responses back here,,,,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," Oh yes, Luis",,,220.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,And I wanted to kind of dive into these here,,,220.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, I want to make sure we're all on the same page and kind of understanding that test to text to its full extent,,,220.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Luis," Um, but I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,220.1,response,0,0,1
87,Luis,Excuse me,,,220.1,response,0,0,1
87,Teacher, Let's see,,,120.4,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,You know all about space,,,120.4,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," So even if I remember correctly, you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,120.4,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,So I can add a bit of background info here,,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," Um, so, Luis Can you give me another example of equipment, maybe something from that article that we just read that you know that NASA is using in space",,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Luis,"Um,",,,310.1,response,0,0,1
87,Luis,I okay well I have to look back and see,,,,response,0,0,1
87,Luis," Um, I'm",,,,response,0,0,1
87,Luis,"Not really sure I'm, come back to me because now I gotta read it and I gotta look look for",,,,response,0,0,1
87,Teacher,That's a okay remember it is always find to go back and look at the text that can only help you,,,120.3,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," So if anyone else wants to take a look back, feel free to do that now",,,120.3,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,"So while we're letting you take a look back, let's dive into another response",,,120.3,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,"So I think the one that stands out to me the most is going to be you Oliver, I noticed that your response says that it's kind of more in relation to Farrah, as opposed to telling me anything about what went on in that text and",,,410.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,Let's get even a little more basic there,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,"let's say, you know, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on Mars",,,210.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,"So why don't we kind of read and rephrase this a little bit,",,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," So, um, what equipment do they talk about in this text? What do we see what what's getting used?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
87,Oliver," That was, that was my answer",,,420.3,response,0,0,1
87,Oliver, Right,,,420.3,response,0,0,1
87,Oliver, So it's the microscope,,,420.3,response,0,0,1
87,Oliver," It was the same one I savannas, but like, it's only cuz you asked her first, if you would have asked me first, then maybe Farrah would have said I have the same answer as Oliver",,,420.3,response,0,0,1
87,Oliver, Yeah,,,420.3,response,0,0,1
87,Oliver,Microscope,,,420.3,response,0,0,1
87,Teacher,And I see it's the microscope,,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," Very good, very good",,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," Um, are there any other equipment you noticed in there, other than the microscope?",,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Oliver," Um, I have to read it through again",,,110.2,response,0,0,1
87,Oliver,"Um, I'm not sure",,,110.2,response,0,0,1
87,Oliver, Okay,,,110.2,response,0,0,1
87,Oliver,I see something in paragraph two,,,,response,0,0,1
87,Teacher,That's right,,,110.4,remark,0,0,1
87,Luis,"Yeah, right I see that too, I see that too",,,110.4,response,0,0,1
87,Teacher,"Very good, very good",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, I'm glad you're seeing it,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," So let's take a look back, Oliver noticed, paragraph two could have some insight for us",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," So let's take a back and see what sort of equipment do we see mentioned specifically in paragraph two,",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
87,Jazmin,"Mister A, my answer came from paragraph two, but I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,210.4,response,0,0,1
87,Teacher," So, Jazmin, you said NASA sent a small machine",,,230.3,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, And that's true,,,230.3,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, Let's take care of that,,,230.3,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, Let's then switch track,,,230.3,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,All right,,,230.3,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, Let's see here,,,230.3,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, All right,,,230.3,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,"In fact, you kind of took a took some some liberties that were there",,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," So we have to think, um, why might that not be hitting right where we needed to",,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," So you say a small machine, what specific small machine do you think you were talking about there?",,,410.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,So your answer could be improved with a little bit of clarity,,,410.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," If we were more, a little more specific, I should say",,,410.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Jazmin,Well as sentences NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that this specific machine is the Lunar Orbiter,,,410.2,response,0,0,1
87,Teacher, That's very good,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,That's very good,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," But if I was only reading the answers to this specific question, I might not have the context and know that So by saying lunar orbiter instead of a small machine you allow whoever read that response to know exactly what you're talking about",,,430.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, That's very good,,,430.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, So right both a small machine and a lunar orbiter would be correct,,,430.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,That's very good,,,430.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Jazmin,"Oh, OK",,,430.2,response,0,0,1
87,Jazmin," OK, I think, I think I understand that",,,430.2,response,0,0,1
87,Teacher," Um so,",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, I'm proud of you,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, That's good,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, That's good,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,Phenomenal,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," Um, we gave you a little bit of time, did you have a chance to look back over",,,120.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,"Let's see, Luis",,,120.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, Would you like more time?,,,120.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Luis, I was gonna say the same thing that Jazmin said like when you're asked me to look for equipment,,,120.1,response,0,0,1
87,Luis, I found two pieces of equipment,,,120.1,response,0,0,1
87,Luis,"Oh no, I read the whole thing",,,120.1,response,0,0,1
87,Luis,"The Lunar Orbiter, but also the microscope that that Oliver was talking about",,,,response,0,0,1
87,Teacher, You guys seem to be hitting a lot of this,,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,"Absolutely, absolutely",,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," Luis you've knocked it out very well being able to read all through that and noticing both there as well as most of you here, Farrah Oliver did very good with that and Jazmin knocked it out of the park",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,"Um, and I think another real benefit here",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,And I think Chris did really well in the kind of identifying a part of it that we haven't talked too much about and that's that,,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," Oh, you know, they found craters full of water on the moon",,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," It's just the question might have been not necessarily trying to hit there, so Chris talk",,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,"Um, and that was an important part of this, so very good job in identifying kind of like the main idea of the article we're reading",,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Chris,Yeah,,,110.2,response,0,0,1
87,Chris, And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit stuff,,,110.2,response,0,0,1
87,Chris," Well, I went to NASA",,,110.2,response,0,0,1
87,Teacher,That's really good,,,140.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," Well, it sounds exciting",,,140.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, Did you enjoy yourself and NASA?,,,140.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Chris, It was the coolest ever,,,140.1,response,0,0,1
87,Chris,"Yeah, oh yeah, me and my dad we when we saw like all of these different space shuttles and all of these like different astronauts suits",,,140.1,response,0,0,1
87,Teacher," Chris and I'm really glad to hear you had a good time there, and I can tell that you've got some background knowledge, just like Luis had there and--",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,That's wonderful,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Chris,Yeah,,,110.1,response,0,0,1
87,Teacher," But we got to make sure when we're answering these questions, we really read and we really try to figure out what does this question want from me?",,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,"And you, like I said, you hit a very important part of the article",,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,"So this question, remember it said what equipment did scientists used to discover",,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,"Now, they discovered the water",,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, You got that right on the nose,,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,But for this one answer wasn't quite there is because we needed to focus more on that equipment than what the equipment was finding,,,410.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,So you kind of see where we went wrong?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
87,h, Right,,,150.1,,0,0,1
87,h,"Um, yeah, you said that I was right on when I was talking about the water, but I didn't talk about the equipment",,,150.1,,0,0,1
87,Teacher," And you offer a lot of insight,",,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, Okay,,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," That's, that's my, my fault there so, Instead, I should have said, the way you answer that I see where you're coming from",,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,"Yes, yes",,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher," Well, maybe I phrased that poorly",,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, So we have to make sure we talk about the equipment specifically,,,410.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, And it doesn't really tell us what the question is trying to get at,,,410.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher,but it's still wrong,,,410.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Teacher, We want to know about this equipment,,,410.2,remark,0,0,1
87,Chris,"Okay, okay",,,410.2,response,0,0,1
87,Chris, Yeah,,,410.2,response,0,0,1

87,Oliver,I know this has been really short,,,,response,0,0,1
87,Oliver, Thank you,,,,response,0,0,1

87,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be on this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,1
87,Teacher, You sound confident in your knowledge there and a lot of us here do have a lot of good knowledge to share,,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," Well, even",,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, So being in this group doesn't mean you don't necessarily know about it,,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, Maybe you're going to be helping your classmates learn about,,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,Good,,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, I'm happy to hear that,,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Luis,"How, okay",,,110.3,response,1,0,1
87,Teacher," Today, Luis, and hopefully we all can grow and learn a little bit from what we're going to be doing today",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,Thank you for your help,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, And I'm really excited to get to talk to you guys about it,,,220.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,So we should look at our responses and kind of see where we can grow and where we can improve with our understanding of the article,,,220.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, Now we got to read about something really cool,,,220.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, Sounds like something it's out of a sci fi novel,,,,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,We're trying to find or rather we did find some water on the moon but sounds crazy,,,,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, So I first want to hear,,,,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, So I'd like to start with Farrah,,,230.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,"What your what your answer was, and sort of how you got there",,,230.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, So let's hear your answer,,,230.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, And how do you think you got to that answer,,,230.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Farrah,"So I said, I'm you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and um I got their cars that was a piece of equipment and they were talking about looking at what",,,230.1,response,1,0,1
87,Teacher, Farrah,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,Absolutely,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, Very good,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, I think that definitely gives a lot to whoever's reading that answer to include them in,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, I think that's very good,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, I like your use of detail there,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,"Um, to kind of build off that Oliver",,,130.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," Could you remind me of what the question was, what question are we answering here",,,130.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Oliver, The question was whatequipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,130.2,response,1,0,1
87,Oliver, Okay,,,130.2,response,1,0,1
87,Oliver,"Yeah, sure",,,130.2,response,1,0,1
87,Teacher, And so what was your response to this,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," Very good, thank you",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,Absolutely,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
87,Oliver, Do you need assigned a tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,120.4,response,1,0,1
87,Oliver,"Well, I mean, I had that same as Farrah, because I circled the last what she thought was the last sentence and I I circled the last sentence",,,120.4,response,1,0,1
87,Teacher," And that's, that's very good",,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,Okay,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, I'm glad you're able to get that sort of perspective on it,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," Um,",,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," It's hard for me to know what you meant, because maybe what if I grade your paper before I grade Farrah",,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,"As a, as the teacher, you know, if you want to put yourself in my position a little bit when I see response like that",,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," So if we were able to come to that same sort of answer, but give more details, you might be able to better inform your reader, who's me the teacher",,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, You want to make sure I'm in for sure,,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,Then I'm kind of in the dark,,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, Right,,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, Right,,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Oliver,"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I can see that",,,420.2,response,1,0,1
87,Teacher," What was the Oh, pardon me, Chris, Farrah",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," And like I said, I appreciate your analysis there so Chris",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, So that's good,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," Yes, question",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,Thank you,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, That's an area we can improve,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Farrah,"Yeah, I still don't understand why my answers wrong",,,150.1,response,1,0,1
87,Teacher, So there's definitely some room for improvement there and you gave some good information but,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, Okay,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,Yes,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,The what we're looking for is a bit wider of an understanding what you said is factually true right with the microscope you do use that to look but,,,410.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,"If we're looking at the the story as a whole, we see that we're talking a lot about space and a lot about the moon, do you think your answer invoke some ideas of the moon or invokes ideas of space",,,410.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Farrah," Yeah, cause I know we're supposed to pull something out of the story, and they talk about the microscope and they talk about looking at water really closely on the moon",,,410.2,response,1,0,1
87,Farrah," So, yeah",,,410.2,response,1,0,1
87,Farrah,"Um, okay",,,410.2,response,1,0,1
87,Teacher, They absolutely do,,,410.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,You give really good strong details on that very specific part,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,"Yes, yes, they do",,,410.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, But I think that answered might leave out some important parts of the story,,,410.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, Right,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, What makes it very interesting to read,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,But we also have the part of that getting to the moon about searching them all there we've got this whole elaborate backstory,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,So we got to make sure that when we're answering,,,410.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, We try to include some some things like that to let us know to let whoever our reader is of our answers kind of clue in to where we were,,,410.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Farrah,Okay,,,410.2,response,1,0,1
87,Teacher,"Thank you for that understanding today so Chris, I'd like to hear your response",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
87,Chris,"Well, I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,120.4,response,1,0,1
87,Chris,Went to NASA,,,,response,1,0,1
87,Teacher," It sounds like you have some first hand experience and I'm really glad we have you in our little circle here because that's great getting some more perspective, like that, um,",,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,That's very exciting,,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," Chris, I might have dismiss heard you",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," Could you repeat your response for me, word for word just an I make sure I",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,"So, uh, and I'm so sorry",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,Know what I'm dealing with,,,,remark,1,0,1
87,Chris," So I said, scientists found critters full of water on the moon",,,,response,1,0,1
87,Chris,"Oh yeah, sorry",,,,response,1,0,1
87,Chris, I've never actually I didn't see it on,,,,response,1,0,1
87,Teacher, So I can kind of see your enjoyment there now a way we can sort of improve or something we might want to see is,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,"Okay, that's, that's great",,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, I think you've got the main idea,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, And so at the heart of your answer there,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, And that's really exciting,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, We found some water on the moon,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, So in the article,,,430.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,"Kind of letting our reader who is answer reading our sort of responses here, kind of get a better idea of what's talking about there",,,430.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," Did they find a whole lot of water on the moon, or was it closer to a little bit of water",,,430.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Chris,"Oh, I thought it was a lot of water",,,430.2,response,1,0,1
87,Teacher, I think the article talks about being able to find water and,,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,"Okay, okay, well, we may need to take another look back there",,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,While there is some water there,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, It might not be a whole lot of might not be buckets and buckets and buckets and oceans of water,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, So if we're able to kind of rephrase our answer,,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," I think you've got a, you know, an interesting perspective there",,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,But it may be a smaller amount,,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," Can you remind me what the question says,",,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," But then we also have to remember right, we're looking for equipment, we're looking for, you know, these mechanisms that help us get there because that's what the questions answering",,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, Right,,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,I'm glad we're able to see that,,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
87,Chris, Yeah,,,210.2,response,1,0,1
87,Chris,What equipment all yeah okay what equipment scientists use to discover water on them,,,210.2,response,1,0,1
87,Teacher, What's another way you might answer that question,,,530.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," So can you see, um, you know, how we can approach that question a little differently now that you've kind of looked at it",,,530.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,"Yes, yes",,,530.1,remark,1,0,1
87,Chris,I guess,,,530.1,response,1,0,1
87,Chris,They used,,,,response,1,0,1
87,Chris,O equipment,,,,response,1,0,1
87,Chris," Well, I don't know",,,,response,1,0,1
87,Chris," I don't know what the, what the equipment is that they use",,,,response,1,0,1
87,Teacher, You have a question,,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,That's okay,,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher," So that's one of the great things that we can do, since we're in a class in a learning environment, we can use our skills to reread some articles and we can look back and we can try to find these details if you give me one moment Chris yes def",,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, That's okay,,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
87,Oliver,"Now I'm trying to what I just looked at the clock and that's our time for us to go, so we'll have to talk to you again and see you later",,,420.3,response,1,0,1
87,Teacher, I appreciate you being here,,,,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher, Thank you all for your time,,,,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,That sounds good,,,,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,Bye,,,,remark,1,0,1
87,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"Hello guys, can you hear me",,,,remark,2,0,1
87,Luis,"Yeah, okay",,,,response,2,0,1
87,Luis, So I'm all good,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Luis,I got this all figured out,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher, So let's take a look right now,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,You got it all figured out,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, We had your response as scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, Luis I'm excited to hear,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,And you think you've got it out,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, So there were some room for,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,Improvement and tell me what changes,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, Did you make,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Luis,"Okay, so, um, I heard that you when you're talking to Farrah and Oliver and you're asking them to think about the idea of the story",,,210.3,response,2,0,1
87,Luis, So I took out the oxygen tanks and I just had that scientists use a lot of equipment on the mode,,,210.3,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher, Thank you very much for listening,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, Those are very good listening skills and making sure you're always being an active learner and to I think you really took to heart,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, So I appreciate that,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"Well, one",,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, That was very good,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, What I said there,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, So with our question we're asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher," I think that's a great response, but I think we can make it an amazing response",,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"Um, I think that we can do even better",,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"So, because at the end of that right they get a little more specific",,,120.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, Right,,,120.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, What did they use to discover,,,120.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, Could you tell me maybe another piece of equipment that NASA used in this article to help discover water on the moon,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,I think we can be a little more specific in your response,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher," Um, they're, they're gonna use oxygen tanks there",,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher," So you said like oxygen tanks and yeah, absolutely",,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Luis," Um, well",,,420.2,response,2,0,1
87,Luis,Okay,,,420.2,response,2,0,1
87,Luis,"Um, I know it's not the microscope, because you already told them that they were wrong",,,,response,2,0,1
87,Luis,"So I'm the only other one that I see only in the first three paragraphs, right, we're only looking at the beginning part of the article",,,,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"Right, I believe so",,,,remark,2,0,1
87,Luis," Um, so the only other thing that I can see as the Lunar Orbiter",,,,response,2,0,1
87,Luis,Okay,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher, I think a lunar orbiter is really key here,,,110.4,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, Right,,,110.4,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, Without that sort of orbiter right,,,110.4,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"Absolutely, absolutely",,,110.4,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, They can't get any of their equipment up to the moon,,,110.4,remark,2,0,1
87,Jazmin,"Well,",,,110.4,response,2,0,1
87,Jazmin,I'm still confused,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Jazmin," I am, yeah",,,,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher," You could give me one moment, Jazmin, talk to me about why you're confused what's going on",,,230.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,That's okay,,,230.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher," Jazmin, absolutely you can",,,230.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Jazmin," I mean, I use",,,230.1,response,2,0,1
87,Jazmin,The answer,,,230.1,response,2,0,1
87,Jazmin," I said, I'm not too small machine, but I'm in this group",,,230.1,response,2,0,1
87,Jazmin, So why is my answer,,,230.1,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher, And that is really close to what we're looking for here,,,410.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, So the difference are kind of the difference maker here instead of a small machine that could mean a lot of things do you think a microscope counts as a small machine,,,410.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher," So, good job",,,410.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"Yes, so NASA did send a small machine",,,410.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Jazmin,Yeah,,,410.2,response,2,0,1
87,Jazmin," Yeah, you did",,,410.2,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher, Could a lunar order maybe also be a small machine,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"Um, depending on size",,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Jazmin," I think that fast, the probably the one that I was talking about, I guess",,,210.3,response,2,0,1
87,Jazmin,"Yeah, yeah",,,210.3,response,2,0,1
87,Jazmin, Does that make sense,,,420.2,response,2,0,1
87,Jazmin, I don't have to leave things to be ambiguous,,,420.2,response,2,0,1
87,Jazmin,"Ah, so what I think we could do to improve is maybe make your answer be a little more specific, so that way when I read it, I know exactly which piece of equipment, you're talking about",,,420.2,response,2,0,1
87,Jazmin,"Yeah, so I just, I just got to add the name that I sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter",,,,response,2,0,1
87,Jazmin, Okay,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher,That's absolutely one of the pieces of equipment that was used to send there and,,,110.4,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"Um, I think we can look and a lot of us has focused on one piece of equipment",,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, I think that we could even,,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, So this is kind of for all of us here,,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,Include in our answer multiple pieces of the equipment we heard about microscopes and we've heard about lunar orbiters,,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, A Luis Do you think that's a good idea,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, It talking about more than one piece,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher," So maybe a good response could be talking about, you know, including multiple ones that we read about it there",,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, It could be more than one,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,But the way they use equipment here means it could be plural,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,210.2,response,2,0,1
87,Luis, But you said that's not I wasn't,,,210.2,response,2,0,1
87,Luis, So I felt like that's what I did,,,210.2,response,2,0,1
87,Luis, And so I said a lot of equipment so that it would include more than one,,,210.2,response,2,0,1
87,Luis, I took off the oxygen tanks,,,210.2,response,2,0,1
87,Luis,I wasn't right,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher, You both pretty much gave me a good answer you gave me,,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, Luis So what we can do is you can kind of learn from Jazmin here and she can learn off of you were looking for a middle ground between the both of you,,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,That's right,,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher," In this case, Jazmin was a little too vague",,,410.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,Something that's right on the cusp of being just what I'm looking for,,,410.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher," I think he would be on a great, great track",,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"And Luis might have been a little too specific, if you can come in the middle of there",,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, If you can include multiple pieces of equipment and kind of fully answer that question,,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Luis,"Okay, so I just got to add the names like how Jazmin did",,,430.2,response,2,0,1
87,Luis,A lot of equipment like,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Luis,arbiters and microscopes,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Luis,I think i think that,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher,I would say that a lot better answers the question,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, And if we wanted to make sure it was perfect,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, We might include how those,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"Help to discover a water on the moon, right, because that's how it ends",,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,Things like the microscope,,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher," Let our reader or the person that's looking at our answers know exactly what we're, we mean",,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, Right,,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,And the Lunar Orbiter,,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, We could say they use the Lunar Orbiter to reach the moon and a microscope to find the water there specifically those kinds of things,,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,And we're very specific when we're writing,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Luis,"Oh man, that's like a lot of words, you're saying we got to write all that down",,,420.2,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher," That way you don't get any confusion, so they know you're just as smart as I know you are",,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"A lot of words can seem tough, but making sure that your reader knows exactly what you are saying can go a long way",,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Chris,You know I've heard that there could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,420.2,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher,That's incredibly exciting,,,110.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, I would hope that that's the case,,,110.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, And with water here that could help us in our future exploration,,,110.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, We're very excited to see that,,,110.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, I'm glad to see you guys are listening to the topic and trying to expand on that knowledge,,,110.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, We know that Chris did visit NASA,,,110.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"Um, I want to see",,,,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, How do you feel about your answer,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, I think a Farrah,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, What might you say instead,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,Just to kind of circle back a little bit,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, Now that we've kind of talked to some other people in the class there,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, If you were giving it another shot at it,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Farrah,Okay,,,210.3,response,2,0,1
87,Farrah," Um, so like you told Jazmin and Luis that they had to have more more",,,210.3,response,2,0,1
87,Farrah,More details,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Farrah,And that there's two answers,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Farrah," So, um,",,,,response,2,0,1
87,Farrah,But then like even more details about the question who okay um so I say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Farrah," So if I was going to say, ah, I say you need a scientific tool called a microscope",,,,response,2,0,1
87,Farrah,On,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Farrah,Or a lunar orbiter,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Farrah,To look really closely,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Farrah,I'm not sure,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher, So we're starting your sort of response with you need right,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, I like the growth and I see that we're definitely getting closer there,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,You got a lot closer there,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,And I think we can kind of change how that sets up,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, This is how you go about doing it,,,410.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, We're talking about NASA specifically right,,,410.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,We're not necessarily letting somebody know hey if you're looking for water on the moon,,,410.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, We're talking about someone that's already done,,,410.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,So instead of starting with something that says you you would need this to do that,,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, You can use this to do that,,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher," Here, why don't we change that to be NASA, how would we rearrange that sentence if we were talking about NASA specifically well",,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, Why don't we change the subject,,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Farrah,"Oh hey, why would we change it to start with NASA",,,430.2,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"Oh, so",,,,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"Let me make sure I'm speaking, yes",,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher," So NASA, they're the ones that sent the lunar orbiter right",,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, So we know that they're kind of the subject,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher," They're kind of who this article was talking about, right",,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"And they're the ones that use the microscope to look at the small, small, you know, particles of water when we find those on the moon",,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,And so when we're giving our response to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher," So you could say, NASA",,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, I think would convey your meeting,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"Right, we kind of want to let our readers know that we're talking about the scientist specifically",,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, Or you could say scientist used if you want to do either one of those,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Farrah,"Okay, okay",,,420.2,response,2,0,1
87,Oliver,"That's good, I think",,,,response,2,0,1
87,Oliver," Okay, I'll try it out",,,,response,2,0,1
87,Oliver," Um, okay",,,,response,2,0,1
87,Oliver, Scientists use a microscope,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Oliver,"Ah, Lunar Orbiter talk really closely",,,,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher, We're almost exactly where we want to be,,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,Oliver,,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher," That was really, really good",,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, But we're so close now,,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, We can still make a couple of improvements on the end there,,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, So thank you for your,,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,Addition there,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, So you started off really powerfully and then up when you end your response there,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, You talk about a to look really close,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,"Now that's true, you do use a microscope to look really close, but remember this article and this question are both asking about the discovery of water",,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, We can change the end of our answer to say to find or to discover water,,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher, So maybe instead of focusing on the looking really close,,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
87,Oliver,"Guys, you know, I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch",,,150.1,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher," Thank you so much, guys, I hope you enjoy",,,,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher,Time slips away from me,,,,remark,2,0,1

87,Oliver, But Mr,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Oliver, But I was less than i and i i really appreciate how you you help us,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Oliver," But I mean, I guess, like I know that's what I'm supposed to do",,,,response,2,0,1
87,Oliver, I don't,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Oliver, And our answer,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Oliver,Keep thinking about the evidence from the text and and putting the details from the question,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Oliver," NEXT TIME, MA'AM, it's still hard",,,,response,2,0,1
87,Oliver, I feel like that's something I can do,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Oliver, I couldn't figure out how to do it,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher,That's good,,,,remark,2,0,1
87,Teacher," I'm glad we have a direction, we can move forward",,,,remark,2,0,1
87,Oliver,Okay,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Oliver, Bye,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Oliver, See you next time,,,,response,2,0,1
87,Teacher,Bye guys,,,,remark,2,0,1
88,Teacher," Hi, guys",,,,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,0,0,2
88,Unclear,Hi,,,,,0,0,2
88,Teacher,"All right, Farrah, you said that you use a microscope to look closely at what you found in the crater",,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,What were you looking for?,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
88,Farrah,"Um, so I was saying like that you can use a microscope to see the water",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
88,Teacher, That's what I was trying to get out of you really want to look and be specific about what you're trying to look for when you respond to something right,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,"Right, good",,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher," So, but what are you looking closely for? Good job though",,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,So you just provided the I'm gonna use a microscope to look really closely,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Farrah,"Um, well, like you are looking closely for the water like the astronauts would have to use a microscope to like look at the ice crystals that make up the water",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
88,Teacher,Perfect,,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher," Now, what was the microscope attached to?",,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
88,Farrah,I'm not totally sure,,,210.3,response,0,0,2
88,Luis,"I know, I know, I know, I know, I know",,,,response,0,0,2
88,Teacher," All right, Luis, go for it",,,,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher," All right, who else",,,,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,"All right, who said, I can't, let me pop over here",,,,remark,0,0,2
88,Luis," So, um, I don't think I should be with this group because I had, I always get my answers right like when I'm when I'm talking about space because I know all about space already so I don't even have to be here",,,,response,0,0,2
88,Luis,"Alright, so here's the thing",,,,response,0,0,2
88,Teacher, But what was the microscope attached to? Help Farrah out,,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,"Oh, well, I'll see here, Luis, and I appreciate your feedback",,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Luis,"Well, I guess I didn't really read that part because I didn't think I had to read the part cuz I already know man",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
88,Teacher, So what was the microscope attached to? How did they find the water in the crater?,,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,"Well, I mean, won't you go back and reread it and help Savannnah out and Oliver, what do you think? You said you circled the same answer as Farrah",,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Oliver,"Was um was a microscope attached to, like, to the astronaut?",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
88,Teacher,"Not really, but that's a good guess",,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher," Chris, what do you got?",,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Chris, I think that Oliver's guess is pretty good,,,130.2,response,0,0,2
88,Chris,"Um, so I guess like I kind of know a lot about NASA and I know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and like you know like masks and suits and stuff so I don't know",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
88,Chris," Like you could look and say, like the microscopes on like like what if you attached it to the hand of the spacesuit?",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
88,Teacher, I'm Question you,,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,"Okay, I'm one of these are really good guesses",,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher, Jazmin,,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher, But we're still missing the point,,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher, What do you got?,,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Jazmin,"What I said was, it, it was a small machine",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
88,Teacher, What is that small machine called,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,"A small machine, right, perfect",,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Jazmin,"Well, I guess if I look at it, like, it says like the lunar orbiter, right, that they sent up in space",,,110.2,response,0,0,2
88,Teacher, You did very well,,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher, That's how they actually examine the water and the craters,,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher, It's the Lunar Orbiter,,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,That is correct,,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher," Yes, Farrah?",,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
88,Farrah,"Um, so what I'm confused though is, is my answer wrong, or is Jazmin's answer wrong? I said the microscope and Jazmin said the lunar orbiter",,,110.4,response,0,0,2
88,Teacher,"That's right, see you had one piece of the puzzle, right, you had the, that's what I was talking to you earlier as you mentioned, the microscope",,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher, Correct?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,"But, and that's the part of that actually goes down and looks very closely, but we need to figure out how they found the water in the the craters",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher," So, which is a good thing",,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,So you're both right,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher, That's great about working in groups,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher, We all participate and contribute,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Jazmin,"So, am I like more right because I was saying about the Orbiter and like Farrah is like sort of right? But you know, I'm like wondering",,,110.2,response,0,0,2
88,Teacher,All right,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher," Well, let's think about it this way, Jazmin, should you look very closely at the water molecules without the microscope?",,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher, You just didn't have the--,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,Right here where you couldn't because you wouldn't have the ability to look closely and Farrah good couldn't get it up to the moon without yours,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher, So you're both right,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher," See, that's a great thing about having a group collaboration we can all work together",,,,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,"So, but good",,,,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,0,2
88,Jazmin," And the thing is, is like sometimes we like really drive science teacher crazy",,,,response,0,0,2
88,Jazmin,"I just wanted to say, unfortunately, we have to go",,,,response,0,0,2
88,Jazmin," But I just wanted to say to you, because I know we just met you, but I wanted to thank you because you were really warm and positive with us",,,,response,0,0,2
88,Jazmin, So I just wanted to say thank you,,,,response,0,0,2
88,Jazmin,"And like I feel like you were so patient with us and you've really listened to our answers and you really helped us to like hear each other's answers because we don't always pay attention to, like each other",,,,response,0,0,2
88,Teacher,You're very welcome,,,,remark,0,0,2
88,Teacher, And I'm glad I could help out,,,,remark,0,0,2

88,Teacher,That's awesome,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, You can help me out with the other kids,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, How about that once you just chill out for a minute,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, That's okay,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"So hey guys reason I brought you together is I was looking at your answers these questions on this text, we just read and I just wanted to maybe help you out with some stuff",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Luis,I guess I'll,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"All right, so yeah",,,,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, What was your answer to the question number one,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"So Farrah, let's start with you",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Farrah,Okay,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah," So I said,",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah,You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"And you know what, that's correct statement that you wrote down, you do need a Microsoft Skype look at something that's really small, but we when we go back and look at the question",,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,What is the question actually ask us,,,120.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Farrah,"Oh, the question says what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.1,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah, All right,,,510.1,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah,Right,,,510.1,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah," So if we look at the passage, we need to start comprehend here",,,510.1,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah, Here's what and this goes to all you guys right so I'm going to give you a really quick reading strategy to help you out,,,510.1,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"So when you read something there's, it's a three step process when you're trying to answer a question",,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, More flow through this,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,The first time you scan it right,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher," You just read it really fast, you know, just know, blah, blah, blah",,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"And then you go look at your question and you look at what it's really asking you, and then you've read it again",,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, So it's three steps skim it read it fast go look at the question and then you read to find the answer to that question,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, Right,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"Oh,",,,,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, So what equipment decides this you discover water alum of you've already read it one,,,,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher," Okay, so I don't want you to try",,,,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, Does that sound good,,,,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, So we're going to assume you've already a skin right,,,,remark,1,0,2
88,Farrah, I did it,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah,"Yeah, right",,,,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"Okay, so once you go back and circle the evidence in the text that can you can use to answer the question",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, Once you try it,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
88,Farrah,Okay,,,420.3,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah,"Um, but, I mean, I got my answer right from the text, do you see in paragraph three, the last sentence",,,,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah,You you,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah,That's where it got it okay I circled that,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"Okay, so let's look at the question what equipment",,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,Did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Farrah,"Well, I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,120.2,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"Well, let's look at what made you think of that",,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,That the microscope,,,,remark,1,0,2
88,Farrah,"Cuz, cuz in science class",,,,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah, It says that you'd need this to look at the water so,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah, And then the question asks about discovering the water and in in this paragraph,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah,"The teachers always like, Okay, we're going to use microscopes today",,,,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah," And so, so I know that microscopes, or equipment on",,,,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah, Let's get off the equipment,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"Ah, say that statement",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, One more time,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,Was the last part,,,,remark,1,0,2
88,Farrah,"Oh,",,,,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah,You need this to look at the water,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,key word there is look in the question asked you to see what you need to look at the water,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Farrah,"Oh,",,,210.2,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah,"Oh no, it is to",,,,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"Discover the water right so it rereading the passage, what would you think led the scientists to discover the water",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,Once you take a quick glance at it,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Farrah,Okay,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,Alright so Oliver while she's doing that,,,,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"You circle, the same as savannas, does that help you any",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Oliver, Okay,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
88,Oliver," I said, Man, I was like, okay, a scientific tool is equipment on the water",,,150.1,response,1,0,2
88,Oliver, It's not the same as discovering okay,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
88,Oliver,Well okay so yeah cuz I I I kind of had the same thinking,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
88,Oliver," But yeah, I see what you're saying about looking",,,150.1,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher, All right,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher," So, Chris, what's up man, how are you",,,110.1,remark,1,0,2

88,Teacher," So they did using what they,",,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, I liked your answers,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,what did they find these with,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, Scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"Well, good",,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Chris,"Oh,",,,210.4,response,1,0,2
88,Chris,"Well, I mean, I went to NASA",,,,response,1,0,2
88,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher, But what is the text tell you about it,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,Right,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Chris,"Oh, text",,,210.4,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,Yeah,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, Correct,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher," So remember, that's what we're trying to get the information Pro is what ring",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Chris, Right,,,420.2,response,1,0,2
88,Chris,Yeah,,,420.2,response,1,0,2
88,Chris, Right,,,420.2,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah,Okay,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah, I see on there's a small machine one in paragraph to,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Farrah," Oh, okay, mister mister fortune",,,,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher, And what's the small machine called,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,That is correct,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Oliver, It's a lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
88,Oliver,"Okay, I found out to",,,210.4,response,1,0,2
88,Oliver, But it doesn't say anything about water and that paragraph,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,Why it doesn't say anything about water and that's a great point there but,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher," Okay, NASA send a small machine",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,It's what NASA sent it will look at the tax,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, I'm going to help you read it,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, So what does that just that first little bit of text tell you,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Oliver,I'm,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
88,Oliver,A fan for machine,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,Right,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher," And what is it called,",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Oliver,"Oh, the Lunar Orbiter",,,210.4,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher, So now let's look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,Right,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,So if you read the text and you read the question What words are kind of synonyms for each other,,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Oliver,I'm okay,,,420.1,response,1,0,2
88,Oliver,Equipment is machine,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,Very good,,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,So putting that together,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Jazmin,That equipment is machine,,,210.2,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,But,,,,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,You didn't,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher," You didn't actually name the machine, right",,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"So maybe next time when you're doing that you could you could be more specific, you said NASA send a small machine",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, Right,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher," Well, that'd be a good strategy",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"So, but you could clarify your statement, a little bit more",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
88,Jazmin,"Yeah, yeah, I can add, I can add a little bit more",,,420.2,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,Okay and Luis,,,,remark,1,0,2
88,Luis,Yeah,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,So let's look at your answer,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, Use scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they do,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"But again, when we read the text and we read the question we need to correlate or we need to put one and put them together to see what they're actually asking",,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,So why don't you read that question for me again,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,That's very knowledgeable of you point that out,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Luis,Okay,,,510.1,response,1,0,2
88,Luis,Why equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"Okay, so now let's look at your statement",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,Now once you read your statement again,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Luis,Yeah,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
88,Luis,I said all scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher, Does that answer the question,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,So if you look into your statement,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
88,Luis,I guess,,,210.3,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"Okay, so what can you do to to find the answer",,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, Thank,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,You the strategy I talked about,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Luis,"Oh, oh, you mean like reread it again",,,510.1,response,1,0,2
88,Luis,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah",,,,response,1,0,2
88,Luis," I mean, I already know the answer, Chris Jazmin said it angers intended and deaths at it",,,,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"Okay, so what is",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
88,Luis,The Lunar Orbiter,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher,Awesome,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, I appreciate it,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, That means just paying attention,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher, Good job,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
88,Luis,No problem,,,110.1,response,1,0,2
88,Oliver, We'll see you next time,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Oliver," Um, but thanks for working with us",,,,response,1,0,2
88,Oliver," Excuse me, Mr fortune arm I just looked at the clock and I'm it's time for us to lunch",,,,response,1,0,2
88,Oliver,All,,,,response,1,0,2
88,Teacher, See ya,,,,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,"Have a good day, guys",,,,remark,1,0,2
88,Teacher,Was lunch,,,,remark,2,0,2
88,Luis,It was really good,,,,response,2,0,2
88,Luis, We got to,,,,response,2,0,2
88,Jazmin,Chocolate chip cookies,,,,response,2,0,2
88,Luis,I got this all figured out,,,,response,2,0,2
88,Luis,Figured out,,,,response,2,0,2
88,Luis,So good now,,,,response,2,0,2
88,Teacher,"Okay, so what, what, why don't you use this new strategy then and let's look at second question from the text so Luis wants to read the second question for us",,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
88,Luis,"Okay, it says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,120.3,response,2,0,2
88,Teacher,"So,",,,,remark,2,0,2
88,Luis,I read the question I read the story,,,,response,2,0,2
88,Luis,"You said read the question, read the story and then",,,,response,2,0,2
88,Teacher,"Okay, so",,,,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher, No,,,120.1,remark,2,0,2

88,Luis,Unless story,,,,response,2,0,2
88,Luis," Um, it says that water can be while it has water can be broken down into two parts, but I wrote it in my own words, water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen",,,,response,2,0,2
88,Luis, And we learned that those are valuable and finance class,,,,response,2,0,2
88,Teacher,"That's right, they, you know, they, they are very valuable and I like how you pointed that out",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher, But when we look back at the question,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher,What specifically remember post to a look at what the questions asking and what the text is,,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher,Saying what specifically,,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher,"Is it saying about the value of water on the moon, why is that very valuable",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher, What do you think about the answer to the question is,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher,Once you read that to go back to Chris Chris,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
88,Chris,"Okay, I also kind of like Luis I definitely feel like I knocked it out the park this time because",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
88,Chris,Last time you said I didn't have anything about the equipment but this one is asking about water and valuable,,,,response,2,0,2
88,Chris," And so I think I answered it, and I got it from the story",,,,response,2,0,2
88,Teacher,"Also, let's hear",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2

88,Chris," Um, water is heavy",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
88,Chris,Carry it in the ships anymore,,,,response,2,0,2
88,Chris,Valuable,,,,response,2,0,2
88,Teacher,You are absolutely correct errors and you are that is very valuable when you're talking about spacecraft because it takes a lot of force to get stuff up in the air,,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher, And if you don't have the heavy water,,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher, Right,,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher,So that's going to be very valuable,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher, So what else can be valuable there,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher, It talks about in there,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher,How are you going to is that all of the information or just one part of it,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2

88,Teacher,Say it's not a good answer,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,2
88,Jazmin,"Yes, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated",,,,response,2,0,2
88,Jazmin,You can't survive without water,,,,response,2,0,2
88,Teacher,And what does it say about water can be split into,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
88,Jazmin,The thing that he said hydrogen and oxygen,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
88,Teacher," What else, what other purposes",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2

88,Teacher, Remember this your posts to look at the question and see what specific information is looking for,,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher, Once you reread that question,,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher,That's right,,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher," So, but let's look at the question again",,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
88,Oliver,Oh yeah okay okay um and start convincing evidence that water in a moment can be valuable,,,420.1,response,2,0,2
88,Oliver," Now, commenting evidence because it's not ready",,,420.1,response,2,0,2
88,Oliver, So I said no,,,420.1,response,2,0,2

88,Teacher," And again, like he said you know that's one way to look at it",,,410.1,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher, What's the potential value,,,410.1,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher,So potential,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher, It has the potential to be valuable,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2

88,Teacher, Let's look at the question again,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher,Is there convincing evidence that water on the,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher,So are all these things we just talked about that have value,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
88,Teacher,Moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2

89,Teacher, Luis,,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, So our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question,,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,120.2,response,1,1,1
89,Luis," So I kind of know all about space already like, I don't think I need to even in this",,,120.2,response,1,1,1
89,Teacher," What you have Luis is a lot of background knowledge which is going to help you answer the question, because you have background knowledge and already understand the topic",,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, That's great,,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,Okay so awesome,,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, It says circle the evidence in the texts that we can use to answer this question,,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,So let's look back at our question,,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher," So we're going to go around and I would like you to share with me the evidence that you used Farrah, let's start with you",,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,I have your responses in front of me but I'm curious to know what evidence did you circle in the tech,,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Farrah, Know what I mean like that the microscope was,,,230.2,response,1,1,1
89,Farrah,"Okay, so basically, so what I circled in the text was that the the microscope",,,230.2,response,1,1,1
89,Farrah,The equipment that they used to study the ice basic,,,,response,1,1,1
89,Teacher, What evidence did you use,,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,Oliver,,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,"Okay, so you you focus on microscope and circle the microscope",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Oliver,I pretty much use the same thing,,,110.1,response,1,1,1
89,Oliver," Like, I looked at the third paragraph and that was where I found like what I was mostly looking",,,110.1,response,1,1,1
89,Teacher,"Okay, awesome, and I love how Deb's original response was that he found the same as Farrah, that shows that Oliver is able to make a connection with his classmate and relate his thinking to Farrah thinking",,,310.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,And that's a very critical tool when we're learning together as a group that's awesome dead,,,130.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,"Chris, what evidence did you circle",,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Chris," Well, no, I looked at the craters and they said how the craters had water",,,130.1,response,1,1,1
89,Chris,So basically what I looked at what's up,,,130.1,response,1,1,1
89,Chris," Well, actually, I guess I didn't really circle",,,130.1,response,1,1,1
89,Teacher, Awesome,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, Right,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,"Jazmin, what evidence did you circle to help you answer",,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher," So what the scientists are really looking for are the craters, where the water is found",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, So you found that the craters are full of water,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,Okay,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Jazmin," And I was like, I basically was looking at like the small and I just want like I still don't understand why my answers",,,110.1,response,1,1,1

89,Teacher,"Okay, you are on you are on track to find the right answer",,,130.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,To get more specific with our response,,,220.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher," Did you find, were you able to circle specific evidence in the text to help you",,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, Luis What evidence,,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,And I want to hear from Luis really quickly,,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Luis,"Um, you know, I actually was thinking about all that I knew about space and I kind of knew that, you know, the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and",,,230.2,response,1,1,1
89,Luis,Stuff like that,,,,response,1,1,1
89,Luis," And I guess I just thought like I kind of know this, though",,,,response,1,1,1
89,Luis, I mostly just wrote down on the side,,,,response,1,1,1
89,Teacher, Luis,,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,"Awesome so Luis used his background knowledge and he was able to infer based off of information that is coming from our passage that yes, scientists do need lots of equipment so that's awesome",,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, And that's a good skill,,,310.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,I love how Farrah Oliver Chris and Jazmin were able to look specifically in the text,,,310.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,Luis when we are asked to answer a question,,,410.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, The first thing is to always find evidence in the text,,,420.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,It's very important that we go back in the text,,,410.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,"And our question even asked us to circle evidence in the text, but even when questions don't prompt us to do that",,,420.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,So let's look at your evidence so Farrah and Oliver looked right towards the microscope Chris looked,,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, All of these are good pieces of information from our passage,,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,"At the craters on the moon and Jazmin was looking at, paragraph two at a small machine",,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,"Now I want you to start using a scale after you circle your evidence, I want you to go back and think deeper about the question",,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,"What might be a key word in that question that we can use to help us answer the question, what's a key word",,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,1,1,1
89,Luis," So I'm, I'm thinking from how you said it that discovery, like it's a question of like how how do we discover how did we find",,,,response,1,1,1
89,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,1,1
89,Teacher,"Jazmin, what was going to be your keyword",,,,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,"Okay, how did we discover how did we find the water",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, Yeah,,,,remark,1,1,1
89,Jazmin,I basically had the same thing,,,,response,1,1,1
89,Jazmin," I said, discover and like it was something that like how, you know, it made me like how stuff",,,,response,1,1,1
89,Teacher,"Yes, and survey, Anna",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Farrah," Well, so I'm still kind of",,,110.1,response,1,1,1
89,Farrah,"Um, I actually, I was thinking, based on what you said, I was thinking maybe it was discovered",,,110.1,response,1,1,1
89,Farrah, Maybe it's a different piece of equipment,,,,response,1,1,1
89,Farrah,"Not totally understanding, but I think I'm beginning to understand that that maybe the microscope was you to to discover the world like if that's a keyword",,,,response,1,1,1
89,Teacher," So, Farrah says that maybe if our keyword and our keyword is discover maybe if our keyword is discover I'm trying to find something that helps me locate where the water is found Chris, what did you want to add",,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,Awesome,,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Chris,"Well, I just, I, I kind of like, okay, I was thinking about out my dad took me to NASA",,,230.3,response,1,1,1
89,Chris," I was just wondering, like, you know what I mean",,,,response,1,1,1
89,Chris,"And when we went like, you know what, even said like scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and I was like, How could they, how could they not use",,,,response,1,1,1
89,Teacher,"Awesome Chris, so you're also able to reference your background knowledge to help you dig deeper into this passage",,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,So I want to go back to what Farrah was saying,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, Did they use to discover,,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher," Okay, what equipment",,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,She was saying that maybe if the key word is discover what equipment right equipment can name several different things,,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,The water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, What am I doing,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, So when I think of that word discover,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, And when you think of the word discover what are some things that come to mind when I'm discovering something,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, What are we doing Jazmin,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,When I first discover something,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Jazmin,"You're finding it like you're you're seeing it for the, for the first time",,,210.2,response,1,1,1
89,Teacher,Awesome,,,130.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, Does anyone else have a different response than Jazmin,,,130.2,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,Okay,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher,So you all were the same,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Teacher, So when you def,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
89,Oliver,"Yeah, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us",,,110.1,response,1,1,1
89,Oliver, So thank you so much,,,110.1,response,1,1,1
89,Oliver," Um, it was really cool to have you like helping us",,,110.1,response,1,1,1
89,Teacher,Okay so Susanna you were just telling me,,,,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, How is that keyword discover changing what you were originally thinking,,,530.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, Can you go back to that,,,530.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,About our keyword discover and you were thinking about how that was changing your thinking,,,530.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Farrah,Oh well,,,530.1,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah," So basically, like, okay, so at first I thought like, okay, you're gonna discovers",,,530.1,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah,"You have use the microscope to see because we know that the ice is microscopic so if I figured, Well you'd have use a microscope to to discover, but it sounds like we can, I think, you use the word or it sounds like we get it or that",,,,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah,"That they they use, like other and it sounds also like because we don't see the feeling that you know what i mean that that the astronauts are on the lunar orbiter",,,,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah, They must have some kind of other,,,,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah,"Do you, you know, you know what I mean",,,,response,2,1,1
89,Teacher, So let's go back to what Luis Do you have a question,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,Yeah,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Luis, So that's pretty,,,110.1,response,2,1,1
89,Luis,"Well, I was gonna remind everybody that my dad is actually an astronaut",,,110.1,response,2,1,1
89,Teacher," So, and Luis was able to use his background knowledge to let us know and to infer from everything that tells us in our passage here that NASA and our scientists are using a lot of equipment",,,110.3,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, Yes,,,110.3,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,Awesome,,,110.3,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, Can we all agree on that,,,110.3,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,So Farrah is realizing that maybe they didn't use the microscope tool to to first discover the water on the moon,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, I'm looking for it,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, So what might the scientist have used to first initially locate that water Jazmin,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, I am seeing it for the first time I'm able to locate it,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, I remember Jazmin said when we discover something I'm finding it,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,So what what might they have used to first discover,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Jazmin, That's the small,,,210.2,response,2,1,1
89,Jazmin, It's the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.2,response,2,1,1
89,Jazmin,So basically nothing stops and it's not like I shouldn't do that,,,210.2,response,2,1,1
89,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,110.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, Your answer was never wrong Jazmin's original answer was that scientist,,,110.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher," So, earlier you asked you didn't understand why you were why your answer was wrong",,,110.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,"Or the NASA said a small machine and she pulled that from the second paragraph, so if everyone will look back at the second paragraph",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher," It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,120.3,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,In their paper with me,,,120.3,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,So when we are discovering something we are locating it for the first time we're finding it right,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,Scientists aren't sure if there's water out there or not they are going to investigate,,,210.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, Okay,,,210.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,So Farrah,,,130.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher," You are right, they, they set that small machine",,,130.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, And that's what they were using to discover where the water was,,,130.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,"But when we are answering a question and we when we are prompted to use evidence from the text, our answer must be specific",,,410.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher," Tell me, so it says that that small machine was called a",,,430.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,So that means that I can't just stop at NASA sent a small machine,,,430.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, I need to dig a little deeper,,,430.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, And what else does the passage,,,430.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,2,1,1
89,Chris,It says lunar orbit,,,,response,2,1,1
89,Teacher,So what equipment,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, Did the scientist use and send out to the moon to first discover and locate water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Chris,The scientists use the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.2,response,2,1,1
89,Teacher,Just,,,,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,"Discovered yes yes now Farrah, later on, they're going to use other equipment right now that they've discovered the water",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, Later on they can study deeper,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,Into the water right they want to look closely at it,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher," And that's what our passage says they tell us that if we if we want to look really closely in paragraph three, we're going to need another tool called a",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,Microscope microscope so are scientists using a lot of equipment,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,Yes or No are scientists using a lot of equipment,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
89,Chris," I mean, they're using a bunch of",,,210.4,response,2,1,1
89,Chris,"Yeah, they're using",,,210.4,response,2,1,1
89,Teacher, But what is the microscope helping scientists do,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,"Yes, so they are using a microscope",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,2,1,1
89,Oliver,Like the microscope is helping the scientists to it's helping them study the water like after its bow,,,,response,2,1,1
89,Oliver," Right, so they they use it sounds like the Lunar Orbiter to find it",,,,response,2,1,1
89,Oliver, And then they they use the microscope to study the microscopic water right,,,,response,2,1,1
89,Teacher,Right,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, So,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, That is correct,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher," So they are using the microscope to study and look deeper into the water, but they first had to find the water with the equipment, the small Lunar Orbiter and that's what our passage is about",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, We found a key what,,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,What I want to challenge you with is the next time that you are posed with a question I want you to first think about your question and then dig into the passage and really circle and find the evidence,,,520.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,So remember when we looked at our question,,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,You remember what I asked you to find,,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Oliver,"A, keyword, keyword",,,510.1,response,2,1,1
89,Teacher,Keyword to help us and to answer the question,,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, Did we need to answer this question,,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, And what key word,,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,2,1,1
89,Farrah,So the keyword was up,,,,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah," Okay, so it was like discussed right so it was equipment, but it was also discussed",,,,response,2,1,1
89,Teacher, Did they used to discover,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher," Because remember, there's lots of equipment that is used for lots of different things",,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, But the key was what equipment,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,"So, so we needed to find the equipment",,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher," So always locate the key word right we had to figure out what they used to discover the water, which means to thirst locate it to first find it",,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,So the key was what equipment,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, Did they use to discover,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,"And then later on in the passage we learned, they, they used other equipment to study the water deeper",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, It is so important,,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,So always find and identify a keyword,,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, So you really understand what you're looking for and go back in the text,,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,"To use our background knowledge like Luis used in to make inferences using our background knowledge and what the text tells us, right",,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, We want to make inferences and use our use our prior knowledge that's very important,,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,"However, we also have to use specific text evidence and just like Jazmin learned I can't just stop at NASA said a small machine, right",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher, And be sure to answer every single part of the question using evidence from the text Farrah,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Teacher,Keep reading what small machine get very specific with your answer,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
89,Farrah, But before we go to class,,,420.2,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah,"Yeah, so we have to go to our next class",,,420.2,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah, I really wanted to,,,420.2,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah," First up, I really wanted to you for helping us to your",,,,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah,Bring up like,,,,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah, But I think that we all understand now like basically what it means and why it was so,,,,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah, I think for us,,,,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah,Meaning of the word discover like at first it was a little music,,,,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah,"And then you help this like use evidence from the text to, like, you know, answer our question that we made sure we were looking back at what we read",,,,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah," You know what I mean, our answer",,,,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah, So we like I think everybody understands clearly,,,,response,2,1,1
89,Farrah,"And then even beyond that, like you really asked us to use like like how, what are the key was behind",,,,response,2,1,1
89,Teacher,Hi,,,,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher, Okay,,,,remark,0,1,1
89,Jazmin,Hi,,,,response,0,1,1
89,Teacher, And then why your elbow partner agrees with you,,,130.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher,"So I would like to know, I would like to hear from Farrah, and why you found what you found",,,130.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Farrah,Okay,,,130.2,response,0,1,1
89,Farrah,Well,,,,response,0,1,1
89,Farrah," So I found the like microscope to be really important because, like, that's something that like the astronauts would have to look like if they wanted to see the water",,,,response,0,1,1
89,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,1,1
89,Luis,"Okay, so here's the thing",,,,response,0,1,1
89,Luis," Um, I don't think I should be in this group because I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,1
89,Luis, There's no way that I got any of these questions wrong,,,,response,0,1,1
89,Teacher,"Well, what was your answer to what equipment ID scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Luis,"Well, so my answer was, like, they had to use like oxygen tanks and spacesuits",,,120.2,response,0,1,1
89,Luis, And like all the stuff that astronaut would need if they were going up in space,,,120.2,response,0,1,1
89,Teacher,And how did you gather that information,,,230.1,remark,0,1,1
89,Luis,"Well, I knew it already",,,230.1,response,0,1,1
89,Teacher,Would anyone else like to build on his response,,,130.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Farrah,"Oh, yeah",,,130.2,response,0,1,1
89,Farrah, So I think that he's right about equipment,,,130.2,response,0,1,1
89,Farrah," But I don't think that like I don't think he was I don't think he was reading, ma'am",,,130.2,response,0,1,1
89,Farrah," I think she was just saying stuff like that he knew, like I looked at it and I said like I think it's a microscope",,,130.2,response,0,1,1
89,Farrah,"Because how could you even see the water if you couldn't see the fragment like if you didn't use a microscope, you know what I mean, like, I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,,response,0,1,1
89,Teacher," You would need something to help you find what they were looking for when they were looking for the water,",,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher,That's a very good point,,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher, And they did,,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher,"I would like to see if Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher,but we are wondering what equipment did they use to find this,,,120.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Chris,"Like, okay, so like I went to NASA, like with my dad and like I like know already that like you have to use spacesuits and oxygen tanks and like kind of like what Luis was saying like I saw it in the exhibits like I i just already knew that that you have to use all that stuff",,,120.2,response,0,1,1
89,Teacher, Did you read our passage,,,230.1,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher,So Chris,,,230.1,remark,0,1,1
89,Chris,"Ah, um",,,230.1,response,0,1,1
89,Chris,Sort of,,,,response,0,1,1
89,Teacher,"Okay, Chris, I would like you to go back when you get a chance, and look back over the passage, and I would like for you to underline where the scientists and what they're using, um, to help them find the water and",,,420.3,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher,"Jazmin, I would like to hear from you",,,120.4,remark,0,1,1
89,Jazmin,What I said was that scientists is used a small machine,,,120.4,response,0,1,1
89,Teacher,And where did you find that out in the passage,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
89,Jazmin,"So it was in paragraph two, the first sentence",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
89,Jazmin, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,response,0,1,1
89,Teacher, She used the passage that we provided to find her answer,,,510.1,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher, I like how Jazmin was able to tell me exactly where she found her answer and Chris and Luis that's more of what I would be looking for when you try to respond,,,510.1,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher,That's very good,,,510.1,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher," Again, I like how she's very specific",,,510.1,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher," She didn't just use her background knowledge, she made sure to go back and find something in the text",,,510.1,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher,"And Farrah then, actually Oliver you agree with Farrah",,,230.1,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher, Will you tell me where you found your answer,,,230.1,remark,0,1,1
89,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,230.1,response,0,1,1
89,Oliver, So where I found my answer was the same place that Farrah did in paragraph three,,,230.1,response,0,1,1
89,Oliver," So basically, um, okay",,,230.1,response,0,1,1
89,Oliver,That they said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,0,1,1
89,Teacher, So Oliver also is able to go back and tell me the paragraph and where he found that in the passage,,,230.3,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher,"So I'm Chris or Luis, Are any of you ready to dig deeper and tell me another answer",,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher,Very good,,,230.3,remark,0,1,1
89,Chris," Like, I don't understand, like, did the astronauts who saw the water, did they use a microscope",,,230.3,response,0,1,1
89,Chris, But I guess I'm confused,,,230.3,response,0,1,1
89,Chris,"Well, I guess like it makes sense that like you would have to use those things",,,230.3,response,0,1,1
89,Chris," Like, it sounds like the answer of Jazmin's is like kind of right but it sounds like Oliver and Farrah",,,230.3,response,0,1,1
89,Teacher,What do you think,,,230.1,remark,0,1,1
89,Chris, Cuz I feel like they,,,230.1,response,0,1,1
89,Chris, But how could they be in space if there weren't astronauts,,,230.1,response,0,1,1
89,Chris,"I'm, um, I don't know",,,230.1,response,0,1,1
89,Chris, It doesn't say that there were astronauts,,,230.1,response,0,1,1
89,Teacher, I want to see what you two can come up with together,,,130.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher,"Why don't Chris, you talk with Jazmin",,,130.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Chris,Okay,,,130.2,response,0,1,1
89,Teacher,Luis What are you thinking,,,230.1,remark,0,1,1
89,Luis," I gotta look at the paragraph, so I gotta see",,,230.1,response,0,1,1
89,Luis, So if I look at it after I looked at it and listen to Jazmin's answer like,,,230.1,response,0,1,1
89,Luis,"I'm like, I'm like, I'm kind of thinking that, like, I understand",,,230.1,response,0,1,1
89,Luis,"Yeah, I guess so",,,,response,0,1,1
89,Luis," Lunar Orbiter and I guess maybe they had astronauts, or maybe they didn't",,,,response,0,1,1
89,Luis, But I guess,,,,response,0,1,1
89,Luis," Yeah, that's kind of what I think is that one",,,,response,0,1,1
89,Teacher,"Okay, Farrah and Oliver, you did think that the scientists used a microscope to look very, very closely",,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher,Okay,,,130.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher," Jazmin and Chris are Looking back, and they're thinking about Jazmin's answer",,,130.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher," I would like for the four of you, and Luis can jump in, try and combine your answers and see what you come up with",,,130.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher,"So, Jazmin was looking in paragraph two, they sent a small machine and Farrah and Oliver thought that they needed a microscope",,,130.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher, So why don't the for the five of you talk together and combine those answers,,,130.2,remark,0,1,1
89,Teacher,Yes?,,,,remark,0,1,1
89,Oliver,"So I just, I just wanted to say, um, because we have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to take a moment and thank you for coming into the classroom today and working with us like",,,,response,0,1,1
89,Oliver, So I think that it was really nice to like work together,,,,response,0,1,1
89,Oliver, So like thank you a lot for like making that happen,,,,response,0,1,1
89,Oliver,"Sometimes we get really are like we really frustrate our science teacher and I feel like you really took the time to listen to what we were saying, and like really thought about like what our answers were and you also like really helped us to like work together because sometimes we get a little, um, we get a little irritable with each other",,,,response,0,1,1
90,Oliver,Hi,,,,response,0,0,2
90,Teacher,Hello,,,,remark,0,0,2
90,Chris,Hello,,,,response,0,0,2
90,Teacher,"How are you doing,",,,,remark,0,0,2

90,Oliver,"Well, doing well",,,,response,0,0,2
90,Teacher,Awesome,,,,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher,Let me see,,,,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher,Luis I noticed that you answered that need a lot a oxygen tanks,,,,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher,Why do you say that,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
90,Luis," So first off, I feel like I should even be in this group",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
90,Luis, And I know all this stuff,,,230.1,response,0,0,2
90,Luis," Like, I know a lot about space",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
90,Luis," Like, I don't have to do the reading to know that you need like oxygen tanks and all that other stuff",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
90,Luis, I already know that,,,230.1,response,0,0,2
90,Luis,"Um, well, okay",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
90,Teacher,"Yeah, that's a good point that you do need oxygen tanks whenever you're in outer space, but we're talking about the different pieces of equipment that you need to be able to see what's on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher,You remember what we were talking about on the in the story about the equipment?,,,120.1,remark,0,0,2
90,Luis,"Yeah, so I guess like well do the astronauts need those tanks, like when they're looking at the water on the moon",,,120.1,response,0,0,2
90,Teacher,"Well, they will need it to help them breathe, but what is the equipment that they used to see the things on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
90,Luis, That makes a lot of sense,,,120.2,response,0,0,2
90,Luis,Gotcha,,,120.2,response,0,0,2
90,Luis, Okay,,,120.2,response,0,0,2
90,Teacher,"The small things on the moon was having to be looked at, through a what Farrah?",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
90,Farrah,"so I said microscope, but I'm not quite sure",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
90,Farrah, Like why is my answer wrong,,,120.4,response,0,0,2

90,Teacher," Your answer was correct it, you do need the microscope in order to see things that are very, very small that are smaller than what you can see with your human eyes",,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher,No,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2

90,Teacher,Why did you choose that,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
90,Oliver,"Yeah, so, um, I said that because on in paragraph three, it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
90,Teacher,That's good,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher," That's correct, yes",,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher, Jazmin,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
90,Jazmin, Like if my answers wrong,,,110.2,response,0,0,2
90,Jazmin,"I guess my question is, like, so if Farrah's answer is right like is my answer wrong, just like the small machine like is that not like is that not the thing that like you used to discover the water like I'm confused",,,110.2,response,0,0,2
90,Teacher, It was,,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher,"Well, your answer was correct",,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher," That's one of the machines that they use was the rover to explore the moon's surface, to be able to locate the particles of water, which we would have to look at through a microscope",,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
90,Jazmin,Okay,,,210.2,response,0,0,2
90,Teacher, What was your answer again,,,,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher,And Chris,,,,remark,0,0,2
90,Chris,"Um, so, like I was saying like, I went to NASA",,,,response,0,0,2
90,Chris, And I know like a lot about like what the scientists use and like the equipment they have to use and like I know they have to use like oxygen tanks and like masks and suits and stuff like that,,,,response,0,0,2
90,Teacher,Right,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher,That's correct,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher, They wouldn't need all that in order to protect them while they're in outer space or on the moon,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
90,Jazmin,"So did they send the astronauts with the machine or did they just send the machine, Chris?",,,110.2,response,0,0,2
90,Chris,I don't know,,,,response,0,0,2
90,Teacher,You don't know?,,,,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher,"Oh, that's something that we can look at together in some of our other stories whenever we start studying a little bit more on this",,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
90,Farrah,"Okay, gotcha",,,110.1,response,0,0,2
90,Farrah," Okay, that makes sense",,,110.1,response,0,0,2
90,Farrah," So I guess like I think that Jazmin and I are, so are both of our interest correct or is one of us were correct",,,110.1,response,0,0,2
90,Teacher, On what machinery is needed to to locate and find and to be able to see the particles from the moon,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher,Both of you are correct,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2

90,Oliver,"I'm like you were very patient with us and like sometimes our science teacher gets a little frustrated with our group, but like, you're so patient and you really like listened to our answers",,,,response,0,0,2
90,Oliver,And like tried to help us to like put our answers together and think about everybody else's and we don't always do that,,,,response,0,0,2
90,Oliver, So I just wanted to thank you because that was pretty cool,,,,response,0,0,2
90,Teacher,"Thank you, Oliver",,,,remark,0,0,2
90,Teacher, I'm glad that you enjoyed the lesson with me today,,,,remark,0,0,2

90,Teacher,"Hello, guys",,,,remark,1,0,2
90,All,Hi,,,,,1,0,2
90,Teacher,How are you doing?,,,,remark,1,0,2
90,Luis," Teacher, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group",,,,response,1,0,2
90,Luis, I already know all about space,,,,response,1,0,2
90,Luis, But Mr,,,,response,1,0,2
90,Luis,I'm good,,,,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher," What all do you know about space? Let me know, and that way, you can help me with the rest of the group, OK? What do you know?",,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,OK,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
90,Luis, And then they have to wait for a window in order to come back to Earth,,,110.3,response,1,0,2
90,Luis,"I know that astronauts have to wear spacesuits, cause they can't breathe on the moon and in space",,,110.3,response,1,0,2
90,Luis, And I know that they have boosters that get them up into space,,,110.3,response,1,0,2
90,Luis," And then they also wear gravity boots, so that they can walk on the moon",,,110.3,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher,OK,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher, That is a lot of good information,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher, Does anybody else have anything to say about that? Any input on what you think about space?,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Chris,"Yes, yes",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Chris," My dad, me and my dad went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment, like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to--",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher,OK,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher, Why would-- why do you think that they would need the oxygen tanks?,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Chris, The atmosphere on the space shuttle and on the moon isn't the same as the atmosphere here,,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Chris,Because they can't breathe,,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher,That is right,,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher, Thank you,,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,How about Jazmin? Can you tell me something that you know about space that can also add in with what Chris and Luis is telling us?,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher," That is a good job, Chris",,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
90,Jazmin, And so we might have to live on Mars or something if they keep destroying our Earth,,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Jazmin,"Well, I don't know a lot about space, but I know that our environment is really bad",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher," Because if our atmosphere, which is the air that we breathe, which is in the oxygen tanks that we are talking about going into space, if that is messed up, then we won't have any air here on Earth, so we would have to look for some other place to possibly live",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,That is a good point,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher," How about you, Oliver? Do you have anything to input?",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Oliver,"I'm not really into space, so--",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher,OK,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher," How about you, Farrah? Do you have any input to go with the group?",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher, A lot of people aren't into space,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher," Some people are into the oceans and stuff, which is very interesting too to learn about",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher," Well, that's OK",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher," Some people are more into the environment, like Jazmin was talking about",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Farrah," So they didn't go into space, but they traveled through space and time",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Farrah,"Well, I read-- I read this book, A Wrinkle in Time, which is about going to different universes",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher, Is that what you would consider a fiction or a nonfiction story?,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,OK,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Farrah,LAUGHS,,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Farrah, We are able to do a lot of things,,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Farrah," But if you look back in the older books from the past, a lot of stuff has come out that people thought was just science fiction and would not happen, and with science, we have brought it about",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Farrah,That is pretty cool fiction,,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Farrah, Like back in the 1930s-- is that a long time ago?,,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher,"Oh, LAUGHS",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher, They had to wind on the wall,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,"Yes, they didn't have phones back then, the cell phones, like this",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher, They didn't have anything like that,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,GASPS,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,And there was cartoons and books about phones,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Farrah,Really?,,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher, But do we have it today?,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,"And people thought that was just going to be-- that was science fiction, and that was not realistic",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Chris," Yes, we've got lots of phones",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Chris,"Oh wow, yes",,,140.1,response,1,0,2

90,Teacher,"Right, right",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher," And it used to be science fiction that we would be able to go into space, which is what we've been studying about is space and going to the moon and being able to do all these different explorations",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Chris,"Oh, man",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Chris," No, no",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Chris," When me and my dad went to NASA, we saw about that the whole controversy about when Pluto was a planet, and then it wasn't a planet, and then it was a planet, but I didn't know anything about Saturn",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher, And there's actually a moon that's called Titan,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,Yes,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher, Saturn has a lot of moons that are floating around it,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher, And they think that they may have found life on it,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,GASPS,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher, So it's really cold there,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,"Well, they're microscopic aliens that live in the very, very cold, because it's really, really cold on the moon",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher," On that moon, it's like 200 below zero",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher," But they think that with their equipment, like what they had on the moon that was-- that they used to find the water on the moon, they think that they found some lifeforms that may have existed on Titan",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Jazmin," Oh, wow",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Jazmin,Huh,,,140.1,response,1,0,2

90,Luis," I didn't know anything about the Saturn stuff and the moons and, like, teeny-weeny aliens",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Luis, I didn't know that,,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher,Yes,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher," Yes, and we'll go into more of that as we study on about outer space and the different equipment that they're using, with the rockets and the satellites and stuff that they're using out there",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Luis,"OK, cool",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher,"OK? Do you have anything else? Do you have any interest in that, Oliver, about the aliens on the moon of Saturn?",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2

90,Jazmin,Mr,,,110.1,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher, Which that is very good that you said,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,Your answer wasn't wrong,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher," You were talking about the atmosphere, which that is something that we are exploring in space to find different atmospheres that would hold life from Earth",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Jazmin,"No, I meant on the story",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Jazmin, But I told her that I think that I have the right answer,,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Jazmin," My teacher said that we all had to come and work with you in a small group, because we needed more help with our answers",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
90,Farrah," But we're in this group, I guess, because our answers are wrong",,,,response,1,0,2
90,Farrah,"Oh, well, I thought I had the right answer too, Jazmin",,,,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher,"But you had a really good answer, Jazmin",,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher, All of you had really good answers,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,They're not necessarily wrong,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,We're just looking at the way that we are seeing our answers in different ways and what perspective that we're coming from,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Farrah," OK, so I said--",,,150.1,response,1,0,2
90,Farrah,"Oh, OK",,,150.1,response,1,0,2

90,Oliver, So I thought that the microscope was the right answer,,,,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher, Remember that?,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher," Well, they do use the microscope to be able to look at the microscopic things on the moon, to find the water that they were digging with the equipment",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,"Now, the specific question was what kind of equipment they used to dig up the water or find that water with, and that was the Rover",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,Hmm,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
90,Jazmin, I said NASA sent a small machine,,,210.2,response,1,0,2
90,Jazmin," And that's the one, right there",,,210.2,response,1,0,2
90,Jazmin, So what's wrong with my answer?,,,210.2,response,1,0,2
90,Jazmin,"Yes, but that's what I said",,,210.2,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher,They were just wanting a name for it,,,430.2,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,There's nothing wrong with your answer,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher," They know that you realized it was a small machine, but they were wanting to dig deeper and find out if you remembered the name of what that machine was",,,430.2,remark,1,0,2
90,Jazmin," Well, so I just had to add the name to my answer, and then I'm good to go?",,,430.2,response,1,0,2
90,Jazmin,"Oh, OK",,,430.2,response,1,0,2
90,Teacher,That would help,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2

90,Teacher,PHONE ALERT,,,,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher," Well, we've all been separated into a different group",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher," That way, we can learn from each other and get some more perspectives on what we answered for these questions",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Teacher,Right,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
90,Oliver," Lawrence, I just looked at the clock, and it's time for the next group, so we'll have to see you later",,,150.1,response,1,0,2

90,Teacher,And I've looked over your answers,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher," We're moving on to question number two, which is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,All right,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher," Luis, what was your answer again, and why do you think that's a good answer? What's--",,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Luis," Because, remember, my dad's an astronaut",,,120.2,response,2,0,2
90,Luis," So I said that water could be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen",,,120.2,response,2,0,2
90,Luis,OK,,,120.2,response,2,0,2
90,Luis, LAUGHS,,,120.2,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher,Right,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher, So what would the use of being able to split the hydrogen and oxygen apart? What benefit would that give the astronauts?,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
90,Luis," I just saw it in the story, and that looked like that was the important thing",,,210.3,response,2,0,2
90,Luis,"Well, I don't know",,,210.3,response,2,0,2
90,Luis, And I know I learned about it in science class,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher, That is an important thing,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher, You can use the oxygen,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,Right,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher, The astronauts could use that to breathe,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher," And they can also use that for fuel, with hydrogen and the oxygen, if they separate it out into the atoms, they can make fuel out of it",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher, So it can be separated out,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher, OK?,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
90,Luis,OK,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher,"So that's a good answer, Luis",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher, You just need to go in a little bit more detail on that,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
90,Luis,So I just have to write down what you said?,,,,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher, You can do that,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,In your own words,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Luis,OK,,,150.1,response,2,0,2

90,Jazmin,"We take a bath here, and we drink water a lot",,,110.1,response,2,0,2
90,Jazmin, And I was remembering what Luis and Chris were talking about,,,110.1,response,2,0,2
90,Jazmin," And yes, you need water to live",,,110.1,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher," If they had water on the moon, they could use that to drink, and they wouldn't have to carry the water all over the place and save up some room for their stops",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher, Which would also go in with what Chris was saying about water is so heavy,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher," What do you think about that, Chris?",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,Yes,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2

90,Jazmin,"They could use the water to grow things, so we could have a moon garden on the moon, too",,,,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher, They could,,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,They would have to make a-- what would they need in order to be able to do a really good garden on the moon?,,,140.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,There you go,,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
90,Jazmin,I guess they'd have to bring the plants with them to plant on the moon,,,140.1,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher," But they would have to work on their atmosphere, right?",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,"Yes, they would have to do that",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
90,Jazmin,Um-- um--,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher,"Remember, the atmosphere is what you breathe, the oxygen and--",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Jazmin," Yes, yes",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
90,Jazmin,"Oh yes, yes",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher,So the moon doesn't have oxygen on it,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,"So they would have to bring in an artificial greenhouse or something like that, possibly, maybe",,,140.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Jazmin," Yes, right",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
90,Jazmin,"Oh, yes",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
90,Jazmin, I forgot about that,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher,"What do you think about that, Oliver?",,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
90,Oliver,"I mean, I guess it would be fine to grow stuff on the moon, you know, I guess",,,130.2,response,2,0,2
90,Oliver," I mean, I'd probably want to have video games or something up there, I think",,,130.2,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher, The water on the moon can be all kinds-- used for all kinds of different things,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,Mhm,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher, Yes,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,"What do you think, Farrah? What was your answer on that? Do you remember?",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Farrah,"Well, I had said-- I answered no",,,110.1,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,2,0,2
90,Farrah," So that's why I said no, not for a long time",,,,response,2,0,2
90,Farrah,"Cause they said in the story that it was like they need to study the moon's surface, and making this plan will take a lot of time and money",,,,response,2,0,2
90,Farrah, So it's like it would take a long time for that to happen,,,,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher, It may not happen for a long time,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher, That's a good answer,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,"But like I was discussing in the last session, about what we thought was science fiction a long time ago, like with Wrinkle in Time, it can actually happen, possibly, in our lifetime, to where they're able to do that",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,OK,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Farrah, So is my answer wrong?,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
90,Farrah,Oh,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher,You need to go into a little bit more detail on it,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,"And actually, the water would be valuable in the future",,,130.3,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,"Your answer is not wrong, but it's not totally right, either",,,130.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Farrah,OK,,,130.1,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher,OK?,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Farrah,OK,,,150.1,response,2,0,2
90,Farrah, OK,,,150.1,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher,"Right now, you may not see a use for water being on the moon, but in the future, as we continue with our space journeys and explorations, then possibly water will be very, very valuable on the moon",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
90,Chris, Lawrence?,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
90,Chris,Mr,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,0,2
90,Chris,I was thinking about what Luis said,,,,response,2,0,2
90,Chris, But I don't see how they could have fuel out of that,,,,response,2,0,2
90,Chris," And you know how water could be broken down into two parts, you know, like hydrogen and oxygen? I was like, yes, so then they could breathe, right? And then Jazmin could have a moon garden",,,,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher,"Well, the rockets, the hydrogen will break up into-- it breaks down, and it's able to make rocket fuel, which help the spacecrafts move",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher," And like in the story, it's like the cars",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher, You know how you put gas in a car?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Chris,Uh-huh,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher," That would fill their gas tank, so they can move out and go throughout space",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher," Without the gas, your car won't go",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher," Just like the rocket fuel, which is made out of different strands of the hydrogen and also some oxygen",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,And that helps your car to go,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Chris, OK,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
90,Chris,OK,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher,That's a good question,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Chris,"And is my answer-- did I get it right when I said that the water is heavy, so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore?",,,310.1,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher, So being able to stop somewhere and pick up water is a lot better than having to carry it around with you all the time,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher, And water is heavy,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,"That is a good answer, because that is part of the answer",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher,The water is heavy,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Teacher," And if there was water on the moon, then they wouldn't have to carry it, which would be a lot of drain on their fuel supply, and it would also take up a lot of space in their spacecraft",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
90,Jazmin, Lawrence?,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
90,Jazmin,"Excuse me, Mr",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,0,2
90,Jazmin,"I was just looking at the clock, and it's time for us to go to lunch",,,,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher,OK,,,,remark,2,0,2
90,Jazmin," And I guess also helped me and Chris kind of, if we put our answers together, then we'd have one right answer",,,,response,2,0,2
90,Jazmin, Is that right?,,,,response,2,0,2
90,Jazmin,"But I wanted to say I appreciate that you helped me understand the meanings of some of water, with the hydrogen and oxygen and what will be necessary",,,,response,2,0,2
90,Teacher,"I think if you added Luis in there too, you would have a complete answer, because each of you took a segment of the story, different parts of the paragraphs, and put it in together",,,,remark,2,0,2
90,Luis," Oh, cool",,,,response,2,0,2
90,Luis," So yes, you've got to put me in there too, Jazmin",,,,response,2,0,2

91,Luis,"Yeah, so like, here's my thing",,,,response,0,1,1
91,Luis," Like, no offense, but I don't think I should be in this group like I know everything about space already so like I don't know why I should have to be here",,,,response,0,1,1
91,Teacher,"Well, we're all in this together, we are just looking at this article closely together",,,220.1,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher," So we're just in this all together, just looking at this little reading together",,,220.1,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,Just to see what we can take away from our just our reading and then our discussion,,,220.1,remark,0,1,1
91,Luis, I'll give it a try,,,220.1,response,0,1,1
91,Luis,"Okay, okay, okay",,,220.1,response,0,1,1
91,Teacher,"All right, thank you",,,,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,"Alright, so our question was what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Jazmin,"Yes, I think it was a small machine",,,120.2,response,0,1,1
91,Teacher,A small machine that is correct,,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,That a small machine did collect the water on the moon,,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher, Does anybody know,,,230.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,But what was the name of that small machine,,,230.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Jazmin," Where would I, let's see, I guess it's like the lunar orbiter, is that the machine?",,,230.2,response,0,1,1
91,Jazmin,I don't know,,,230.2,response,0,1,1
91,Teacher,That is the machine that collected the water,,,110.4,remark,0,1,1
91,Farrah,"Um,",,,110.4,response,0,1,1
91,Farrah,"Okay, so here's what's interesting",,,,response,0,1,1
91,Farrah," Like, okay, so I think like the microscope is something that the astronauts used to look at the water",,,,response,0,1,1
91,Farrah," So I'm kind of thinking like on maybe like, okay, so like, why is my answer, not quite right",,,,response,0,1,1
91,Farrah, You wanted us to come and work over here,,,,response,0,1,1
91,Farrah,"But I don't understand, cuz like you",,,,response,0,1,1
91,Teacher, So you said you think of the scientific tool is called a microscope to look really closely at it,,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,Your answer is,,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher," Right, Farrah?",,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Farrah,Yeah yeah,,,110.2,response,0,1,1
91,Teacher, You are correct with the microscope,,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,"Alright, so the lunar orbiter is just a machine that collected the water, but then the, the actual equipment to see the water was the microscope",,,130.3,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,So Farrah you are,,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Farrah,"Oh, okay, okay",,,110.2,response,0,1,1
91,Teacher,Does anybody else have any questions on why it is the microscope,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,Chris?,,,,remark,0,1,1
91,Chris,"I think like the thing that I think so, like, okay, so I kind of went to NASA, like my dad took me to NASA",,,,response,0,1,1
91,Chris," So like I kind of feel like I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like they use oxygen tanks and masks and suits, but I guess like I wonder if like the astronauts were on the lunar orbiter or if it was an unmanned aircraft",,,,response,0,1,1
91,Teacher, Correct?,,,230.3,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,"So you're thinking it was an unmanned aircraft, meaning that there was nobody on the moon, but they sent just a machine",,,230.3,remark,0,1,1
91,Chris,Yeah,,,230.3,response,0,1,1
91,Teacher," At that time, or did they just send that machine called the lunar Lunar Orbiter",,,210.3,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher, Do we think they people were actually on the moon,,,210.3,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher," It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher, If we look back on our reading,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,So according to that,,,210.3,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,"Okay, so it looks",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
91,Chris,Not sure,,,210.3,response,0,1,1
91,Teacher, Okay,,,,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher," Jazmin, do you have anything to add to that",,,,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,Not sure,,,,remark,0,1,1
91,Jazmin, So two things,,,,response,0,1,1
91,Jazmin,Okay,,,,response,0,1,1
91,Jazmin, It just says that there's a machine,,,,response,0,1,1
91,Jazmin, Like there are astronauts,,,,response,0,1,1
91,Jazmin,"Like I think like the lunar orbiter like probably like, okay, so if you do the reading and you look at the reading",,,,response,0,1,1
91,Jazmin, If you look like it doesn't say that,,,,response,0,1,1
91,Jazmin,It doesn't say that there are any astronauts,,,,response,0,1,1
91,Jazmin, It just says machines,,,,response,0,1,1
91,Teacher,"So say if there isn't, they said if they didn't clearly say that there was people on there",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher," I would assume as well that it would just be a machine, called that Lunar Orbiter",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,Correct,,,110.4,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher," I would, I would agree with that",,,110.4,remark,0,1,1
91,Jazmin," Um, I wonder, like, I feel like I feel like, are both Farrah and my answer correct?",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
91,Jazmin,"So I think what I'm wondering is, like, okay, so if the lunar orbiter was this machine, and it went up there, did the lunar orbiter like discover something and like, was it the thing that like kind of found the water",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
91,Teacher," Jazmin, I would say, because the question is very specific meaning what a piece of equipment",,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,I would say that you are almost there,,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher, You said a small machine,,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher, Jazmin,,,410.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher, You're on the correct track Jazmin,,,410.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher, So you're on,,,410.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher, Go ahead,,,410.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,"But I think it was wanting to be a little bit more specific, as in the microscope lunar orbiter getting a little bit more detail from the reading",,,410.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher, We just need to push it a little bit more into detail,,,410.2,remark,0,1,1
91,Jazmin,"Yes, we have to go to lunch",,,410.2,response,0,1,1
91,Jazmin, Just having you today,,,,response,0,1,1
91,Jazmin, And it was really nice to like talk to you and I think like one thing,,,,response,0,1,1
91,Jazmin, Like sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher,,,,response,0,1,1
91,Jazmin,"We have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say before we left for lunch that it was being nice",,,,response,0,1,1
91,Jazmin,But you really have to listen to each other and you really asked us to like rethink our answers and you were really patient with us and sometimes our teachers aren't as patient,,,,response,0,1,1
91,Jazmin,"And so I just wanted to thank you for, like, really just like spending the time to like listen to our answers because that was really cool",,,,response,0,1,1
91,Teacher,"Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it",,,,remark,0,1,1
91,Teacher,"Good afternoon, everybody",,,,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, Hope you're doing okay today,,,,remark,1,1,1

91,Luis,Yeah,,,,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"Well, that's awesome",,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher," Well, I just want to kind of talk to The small group just to have a little bit more extra time with you to go over a few things I'm looking at your responses",,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,For the first question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher," I want to talk about that question real quick, before, Before we go to lunch",,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, Would anybody like to share one of their responses for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon S,,,120.4,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,So,,,120.4,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,1,1,1
91,Farrah," So I said, um, let me look back at my paper",,,,response,1,1,1
91,Farrah," I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,1,1,1
91,Farrah,"Yeah, okay",,,,response,1,1,1
91,, Let's look at the question again,,,420.1,,1,1,1
91,, The question says what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,420.1,,1,1,1
91,,Now the question,,,420.1,,1,1,1
91,, Now what are some key words that kind of help us to find the answer in in the text,,,420.1,,1,1,1
91,,"Yes, you do need a microscope to look at things that are really small",,,130.1,,1,1,1
91,Farrah,Equipment,,,,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher,Equipment I,,,110.4,remark,1,1,1
91,Oliver,"Water, and water",,,110.4,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher, We need to know that we're looking or what's where we find and what equipment was used to find water,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, Anything else anybody,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"Yes, definitely",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Chris,"I thought I thought water was an important one, too",,,210.2,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"Jazmin or Luis, did you have any other keywords",,,210.3,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,Alright so Chris thought the same thing as Oliver,,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
91,Jazmin,"I said, equipment and I thought I circled discovered in the question for me",,,230.3,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher," Alright, so what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"Oh, yes",,,,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"Yes, I believe equipment discover water",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, Those are all three key words that we need to look at for this for answering this question,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, So when you discover something,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,1,1,1
91,Luis,"Well, I think moons pretty important",,,,response,1,1,1
91,Luis," You know, I mean, that's where they are",,,,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher, Now when you discover something,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, Does that mean you've already looked at it before,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,Yes,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, Have you looked at some when you discover something new,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher," Did they when they were on the moon, looking for things on the moon, for sure",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, Now with them what the moon right there,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Oliver,"I don't, I guess",,,210.2,response,1,1,1
91,Oliver," No, I guess not",,,210.2,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher," And so when we go to discover something, it's, it's the first time we've seen it",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, It's the first time you see something so you're really not being able to Really dive in and examine and look at it,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"Yeah, so when you discover something",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,So what was the piece of equipment that was used to find water,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,Right now on the moon,,,210.1,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, We've seen water before but they people haven't seen water on the moon yet,,,210.1,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"So, not to look at water but to discover water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"If we can look back at paragraph two, so take a moment, look back at paragraph two",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,1,1,1
91,Oliver,Okay,,,,response,1,1,1
91,Oliver," Oh wait, nevermind I just realized you said, paragraph two, cuz I found my answer in paragraph three",,,,response,1,1,1
91,Oliver, Oh,,,,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher,Go ahead,,,,remark,1,1,1
91,Jazmin,I found my answer in paragraph two,,,,response,1,1,1
91,Jazmin,But I don't understand why my answers wrong,,,,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher, They did send a small machine,,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"Jazmin, you said that NASA sent a small machine, right",,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, But what I'm looking for is what is also the name of that small machine,,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Jazmin,"Oh, Lunar Orbiter",,,410.2,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher,Yeah,,,130.3,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, So though small machine was named the Lunar Orbiter,,,130.3,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, That was the machine that discovered ice or discovered water on the moon's surface,,,130.3,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"And then on paragraph threee, it says that they found the water that they found was microscopic meaning it was super small that they had to use a microscope to use it to look at it",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"So they did use a microscope, but it wasn't the item or the piece of equipment that discovered water on the moon",,,130.3,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
91,Jazmin,"Yeah, so I just have to add the name of it",,,150.1,response,1,1,1
91,Jazmin, And then my answers fine?,,,150.1,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher, Of what that they found so they would add that,,,130.3,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher," So the answer, like a complete answer that I'd be looking for would be that the lunar orbiter was a small machine that found microscopic water on the earth or on the moon",,,130.3,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,Where you would add the name of it and then you would add what type of water or what was the size of the water,,,130.3,remark,1,1,1
91,Jazmin,"Okay, okay",,,130.3,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher,So you got to pull those things together,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
91,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits,,,420.2,response,1,1,1
91,Chris,"I, I went to NASA",,,420.2,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"Yes, they use all all of those are examples of equipment and just for this particular moment",,,130.1,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,And for this particular reading The biggest piece of equipment that they use was that lunar orbiter that they used to discover,,,130.3,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, It was the equipment that they used to discover water,,,410.1,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"But yes, Chris, you are correct, that those are all different types of equipment that astronauts use that for this particular question",,,410.1,remark,1,1,1
91,Chris," Um, but it doesn't say that like I didn't, I didn't see discover or water in that paragraph",,,410.1,response,1,1,1
91,Chris," I mean, I say they say like you can drink water",,,410.1,response,1,1,1
91,Chris,"So, but ok but they don't actually say anything about water and and paragraph true they only talk about water in paragraph",,,410.1,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher, There's different forms of water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher," There's a frozen form, what is that called Oliver?",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher," Now, what is a different form of water",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"Okay, so with water",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher," Now, in paragraph two, okay",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
91,Oliver,"Oh, oh yeah ice",,,210.4,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher," So ice is just a different form of war, it's just water in a different form, it's frozen solid",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,Yes,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
91,Oliver,"Oh, oh, okay, okay",,,210.4,response,1,1,1
91,Chris,Okay,,,,response,1,1,1
91,Chris," Um, so, it talks about ice and it talks about the Lunar Orbiter, but it doesn't say anything about discover and and I know we're supposed to look for the word discover, and I don't see it in there",,,,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"Okay, let's look back at the text, real quick",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"Now when you discover something you're correct, it doesn't it doesn't say discover",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher," it says that scientists have for long time that the moon is a desert, because it is it has no atmosphere like we have on Earth",,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher,But in that first paragraph,,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher," However, they used to believe there was no water on the moon",,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher, Oliver,,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
91,Oliver, Okay,,,120.3,response,1,1,1
91,Oliver,Sorry to interrupt Mr Teacher,,,120.3,response,1,1,1
91,Oliver, But I was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch so we'll have to see you again later,,,120.3,response,1,1,1
91,Teacher,"Alrighty, enjoy lunch",,,,remark,1,1,1
91,Teacher," All right, so is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Alrighty guys welcome back from lunch,,,120.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, We're going to start with a new question,,,120.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, Luis What did you have to say,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"Now, I noticed that Farrah and Oliver noticed that there is they said that there's not any evidence right and then Chris Jazmin and Luis did say that there is some evidence",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Luis,"I think I got this figured out, so I'm all good",,,230.3,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher, So is there convincing evidence That water on the moon could be valuable,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, It's a new question,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"Okay, now with this question",,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, Now there are some key words in this question,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Does anybody have a key word that they want to look at?,,,420.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Luis,"Okay, I think that it was evidence",,,420.1,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher,What's another key word That we could add to the list,,,420.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Evidence,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, So what so evidences one,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Chris,I said water again this time because I think that's what the whole thing is about,,,110.1,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher," Okay, now",,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Yes,,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher," So that's our topic is water, for sure",,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Chris,,,230.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, What was one piece of evidence that you thought About this that some evidence that said water could be valuable,,,230.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Chris,"Yeah, so, um, info which paragraph was it",,,230.2,response,2,1,1
91,Chris, The title is water is a valuable resource right,,,230.2,response,2,1,1
91,Chris," Okay, yeah",,,230.2,response,2,1,1
91,Chris, In the first one because it's the whole,,,230.2,response,2,1,1
91,Chris,"So I said, the thing about water is heavy",,,,response,2,1,1
91,Chris, So,,,,response,2,1,1
91,Chris,"It's, it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore",,,,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"Yes, right",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher," So if we look back, you were us used an example from the text from paragraph five, all right, or excuse me, paragraph four, and it was saying that Since water so heavy",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, It would take up a lot of space,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, It would save some space,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, And then if we didn't have to bring it,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,So way to use that evidence there for for a reason for water being valuable to us all right now,,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, Chris,,,,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"Jazmin, what did you say about what",,,,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, Go ahead,,,,remark,2,1,1
91,Luis," So a my answers is good, but I don't understand why I gotta be in this group because I did that I did everything right",,,,response,2,1,1
91,Luis,"Wait, yeah",,,,response,2,1,1
91,Luis, Right,,,,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"Yes, you did a great job on that we are just wanting to I'm just pulling people together, just trying to get different ideas because there's difference of opinions on this question",,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, So we're just trying to get a sample size of different answers,,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Chris,Okay,,,150.1,response,2,1,1
91,Jazmin," Yeah, I'm still confused",,,,response,2,1,1
91,Jazmin,"Yes, still can",,,,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher,What are you confused about Jazmin,,,230.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Jazmin,"Well, because if if he got the right answer",,,230.1,response,2,1,1
91,Jazmin, Then I thought that I had the right answer,,,230.1,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"Well, there can be multiple and there are multiple answers for a question",,,210.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, Can't there,,,210.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"So Chris just listed one, there's a couple more in there and what in your said that astronauts can drink water and stay hydrated",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,It's this is kind of there's multiple reasons or multiple arguments or convincing evidence that you could use to say why water is valuable,,,210.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, You can't survive with water alone right,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher," And so if you look back, you found your answer in paragraph four, and it says for example future future astronauts could drink this water",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Yeah,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"Right, so we know as people on earth we have to have water to live",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, And so if they have water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"So yes, that's another great example of convincing evidence",,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"They don't have to worry about bringing that water and so they could just drink the water on the moon, and they can stay hydrated",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
91,Jazmin,"Wait, I have to, I have to write down all the other stuff that you just said?",,,210.4,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher, You can keep your answer the same,,,110.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,We just need to add on to it that because you can drink water,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"No, ma'am",,,110.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, That's convincing evidence that it is valuable,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,And waters on the moon,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, So we just have to rework your answer,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Jazmin,"Okay, I have to add something about convincing evidence",,,420.2,response,2,1,1
91,Jazmin, Okay,,,420.2,response,2,1,1
91,Jazmin, Is that good,,,420.2,response,2,1,1
91,Jazmin, You can't survive without water that is convincing evidence,,,420.2,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"Yes, ma'am",,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Luis said you said that water can be split into parts hydrogen and oxygen right,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, And that can be water can be split in those two different elements all right now,,,230.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Yep,,,230.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, Luis Where did you find that in the text,,,230.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Luis, There it is,,,230.2,response,2,1,1
91,Luis," Okay, your paragraph five in my second sentence",,,230.2,response,2,1,1
91,Luis, Yeah,,,230.2,response,2,1,1
91,Luis,"Oh, there it is",,,230.2,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Second sentence that is correct,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher," Right, so water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen now",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"That is important, but what's the reason why they would want to break down what was the reason why they wanted to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, What could they use hydrogen and oxygen for,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
91,Oliver,"Well, I read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024",,,210.4,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher, Don't they need oxygen to breathe,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"Yes, there could be and that would be great for for another reason",,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, But let's look back at if we have people on base,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Luis,"Yeah, yeah",,,210.3,response,2,1,1
91,Luis," Okay, so then that's my answer so that they can breathe",,,210.3,response,2,1,1
91,Luis," Okay, so then that's so",,,210.3,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher, Now what about the hydrogen part of it,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, Why would the hydrogen be useful for,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,So they would use the oxygen breathing,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Luis,Look back at paragraph,,,210.3,response,2,1,1
91,Luis, I don't know,,,210.3,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Look at paragraph five,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
91,Luis,"Oh, rocket fuel rocket fuel",,,210.4,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher," Have they split that water and they use that hydrogen oxygen for rocket fuel and that's how they could get to the moon and they can leave from the moon, right",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,We could use that,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, So that's another reason why water could be such a valuable commodity,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Teacher:Oliver,,,,remark,2,1,1
91,Luis," I gotta write down all of that stuff that you just said that's a long answer, man",,,,response,2,1,1
91,Luis,Teacher,,,,response,2,1,1
91,Luis, I gotta write down,,,,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"It's a long answer, but what we can do for your answer",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Is just that we can add that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen because it allows people to breathe and you can make rocket fuel with it,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, We just need to add that little bit to your answer,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,So we just need to add in just that hydrogen Can be used for rocket fuel and oxygen can help people breathe,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Luis, How come I have to add all of that and Chris Chris and Jazmin didn't have to add all that to their answers,,,420.2,response,2,1,1
91,Luis,How come,,,420.2,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher,But you had a you had another good piece of evidence,,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,  And so your piece of evidence was just a little bit bigger,,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher," And so you just have to add on a little bit, little bit more than them",,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Because we chose to do a different piece of evidence,,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, After discussing Chris's Jazmin's and Luis's,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Farrah and Oliver have your answers changed at all,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Farrah,"Oh, I mean, I can see I can see where they're coming from, but I still think that I was right",,,210.3,response,2,1,1
91,Farrah," I said, not for a long time, you know,",,,210.3,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"What, what can you go into a little bit more detail for that",,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Farrah," Yeah, they're not gonna be able to have water for like a long time so",,,210.3,response,2,1,1
91,Farrah, So the answer's no,,,210.3,response,2,1,1
91,Farrah,I'm here,,,210.3,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"Okay, so since you said, and with no so that means there's is there small amounts of water on the moon as what we believe",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Farrah, Yeah,,,230.3,response,2,1,1
91,Farrah, Yeah,,,230.3,response,2,1,1
91,Farrah," Cuz we read that in the first part, it says they're small amounts",,,230.3,response,2,1,1
91,Farrah, Yeah,,,230.3,response,2,1,1
91,Farrah,okay,,,230.3,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher, And so since they're small amounts are we going to be able to use it as use it like the amount of water that we use on Earth,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
91,Farrah,Nope,,,210.3,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"And so you, you do have a good convincing Answer right there",,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"Nope, because we've got a lot more of it",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"But you just need to add a little bit more to it, just so that way, we have an idea",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"I lost my train of thought,  just so that we can explain a little bit more on why you think it's not going to be able to be useful, just because they're smaller amounts of it",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Teacher, Okay,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
91,Oliver,"Teacher, it that looks like our time for the next group took out, but I know I heard you're telling everybody that they have to add more details to their answer so",,,420.2,response,2,1,1
91,Oliver,"I'm sure that's what you were going to tell me, too, is that we have to have more more evidence from the text and our answers",,,,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher,"Yes sir, not used to that was the common thing",,,,remark,2,1,1
91,Oliver,"Okay, well, we'll see you next time",,,,response,2,1,1
91,Teacher,I yes,,,,remark,2,1,1
92,Teacher, How is everybody,,,,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Hi boys and girls,,,,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,1,1,3
92,Oliver,"We're doing great, we're really happy to see you",,,,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, I'm happy to see you guys too,,,,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,Good,,,,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher," Yes, Mr",,,,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, So I pulled us all back here,,,,remark,1,1,3
92,Luis," Like all about space, you know, so I don't need any help",,,,response,1,1,3
92,Luis,"I don't think I need to be in this group, you know, cuz I already know",,,,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Correct?,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,"Okay, so what I wanted to pull us back here about is because even though we might have a lot of information that we've learned in other places about space we were reading a text specifically on a mission and finding water on the moon",,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,And our question was what equipment was used to find that water,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher," Okay, so can we look at deeper into that question",,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher," Luis a lot of us found different types of equipment or we used background knowledge, but that's not exactly what the question was asking us to do",,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher," Now, Mr",,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher," Is that okay, yeah",,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Luis,That's that sounds great,,,220.1,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher," Okay, so I want to start by us all looking over at question, paragraph two, okay",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,Perfect,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, So let's look at paragraph two in our passage,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,"Paragraph two, I'm going to read and I want you to follow along",,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher," OK, now I'm going to stop there",,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher," It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,"Can anybody tell me if they heard something in the two sentences we just read that sounds like it might answer the question, what equipment was used?",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,Go ahead Miss Jazmin,,,,remark,1,1,3
92,Jazmin,"Basically it was this small machine, I think that's how they found the water",,,,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher," Okay, so can we look where it says small machine and figure out what that small machine was called?",,,430.2,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, I see where you're going with that,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,what I'm concerned about is we're not getting the whole picture there,,,430.2,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,Good,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher," And it is a small machine,",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Jazmin, Okay,,,430.2,response,1,1,3
92,Jazmin," So, lunar orbiter",,,430.2,response,1,1,3
92,Jazmin,That makes sense,,,430.2,response,1,1,3
92,Jazmin, I didn't really answer the question,,,430.2,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher,"Good job, Jazmin",,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Thank you so much,,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Miss Farrah,,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Farrah,"Um yeah I wondering like, I think I'm still confused",,,110.4,response,1,1,3
92,Farrah, Like why my answer is wrong,,,110.4,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher,"Okay, so can you tell me your answer again",,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Farrah," So basically, my answer was just that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.4,response,1,1,3
92,Farrah, Yes,,,120.4,response,1,1,3
92,Farrah,Oh,,,120.4,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher," And I want to ask you, do you know what we use a microscope for",,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,Okay,,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Farrah,"I'm like, you know, you use it to like look at small things like in science we look at like bacteria and stuff like that",,,230.1,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher, And where did you find in the text that it talked about microscope,,,230.2,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,Good,,,230.2,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Okay,,,230.2,remark,1,1,3
92,Farrah," It was, I think it was in paragraph three",,,230.2,response,1,1,3
92,Farrah,"Um, let's see",,,230.2,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher,Words in paragraph three,,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,Can I yeah,,,,remark,1,1,3
92,Farrah,"Oh, sorry",,,,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher,That's okay,,,230.2,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Could I read to you the sentence that I'm thinking and you tell me if that's where you found your answer,,,230.2,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,"Okay, so what I'm seeing is that in paragraph three, the second sentence starts out by saying",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,Is that where you found your answer,,,230.2,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher," If you were looking straight at it, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Farrah,"Yeah, right there",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher," So you did you found a piece of equipment you found a tool that was used, but did it say that this microscope was used to find the water to begin with",,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Okay,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Was this the first machine that they use to find the water,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,Good,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
92,Farrah,"Well, I guess I'm guessing not",,,210.3,response,1,1,3
92,Farrah, How could they find it if they couldn't see it?,,,,response,1,1,3
92,Farrah,"Do you have any ideas for how I can find like or like, you know what I mean, like how I could tell the difference, because it seems like they would have to look through the microscope to see the water",,,,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher,So that's a very good question,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher," And what I'm going to ask you is, have you considered to look back a little bit further before the microscope",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,"So if we look at paragraph two, I just want you",,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, You can read it to yourself or you can read it out loud,,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Could you read the first sentence of paragraph to to me,,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
92,Farrah,That's just a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,120.3,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher, And now I'll read the second sentence to you after you tell me what did NASA send to investigate,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Okay,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Can you tell me what that was called,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,Perfect,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Farrah,Yeah a lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher,So now I'm going to read the next sentence,,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,Good a lunar orbiter and it said that that was a small machine,,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Okay,,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,It says that this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater,,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, We just read a little part of it,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,"So I know that the scientists back in paragraph one, they found out that there was water on the moon because they had craters that had ice in them",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, But how did they find out that the craters had ice in them,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Do you remember how that happened,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,Go ahead Mr Chris,,,,remark,1,1,3
92,Chris," So I was thinking that, you know, they would have to use oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that",,,,response,1,1,3
92,Chris," So like, um, well, I went to NASA and and I saw like exhibit",,,,response,1,1,3
92,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher,"Okay, and they do use that and NASA and that is a good point",,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, But I have a question,,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,"Mr Chris, did you consider that those machines were not put inside of our text",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
92,Chris,"Oh, okay",,,410.2,response,1,1,3
92,Chris," Oh, yeah",,,410.2,response,1,1,3
92,Chris, Okay,,,410.2,response,1,1,3
92,Chris, Okay,,,410.2,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Okay,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,"But we have to look at the tools that are inside of the text because every time we have a story that we're reading and questions about it, our answers are always going to be in that passage",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher," And that's awesome to bring to the table, but I want you to try to find the answer in the text",,,430.2,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, Okay,,,430.2,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, That's amazing,,,430.2,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,"So even though we might have prior knowledge, which is what you have, because she went to NASA",,,430.2,remark,1,1,3
92,Chris," Okay, that makes sense",,,430.2,response,1,1,3
92,Chris,Gotcha,,,430.2,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher," Are you guys feeling a little bit more comfortable with going back further into the text, Mr Oliver",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,Okay and Farrah,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, I just wanted to touch back with you and Oliver,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher, I know you had the same answer is Farrah,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
92,Oliver," Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,150.1,response,1,1,3
92,Oliver, But thank you so much for working with us,,,150.1,response,1,1,3
92,Oliver,"Um, yeah, I think that we are getting more comfortable",,,150.1,response,1,1,3
92,Teacher,"Perfect, thank you guys",,,,remark,1,1,3
92,Teacher,"Okay, so everybody has just given their answers to our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, And Oliver,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher," It looks like you dug in the text to you're saying that you said the same thing as Farrah, you circled the same thing",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, Can you tell me a little bit more about how you got to that conclusion?,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher," And Farrah, I really loved how you dug in the text",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,I see a lot of good thinking,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
92,Oliver," So basically, like I circled the same thing, like in the paragraph three, where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
92,Teacher, Good job,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,Good,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, Luis You have a question?,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, All right,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Luis," Like, I know all about space, like, I don't think I should be in this group, because I don't really get answers about space like wrong",,,110.2,response,0,1,3
92,Luis,"Um, yeah, I guess this is kind of a question",,,110.2,response,0,1,3
92,Luis," Um, so here's the thing",,,110.2,response,0,1,3
92,Luis, So I don't think I have to do any work on it,,,,response,0,1,3
92,Luis,And like I know like everything there is to know about space,,,,response,0,1,3
92,Teacher, I'm glad you know a lot about space,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,Okay Mister Luis,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, And that's a good point,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher," I know that you answered, saying that they used equipment like oxygen tanks",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,"However, when we're given a text, we do have to look at what it talks about in the text",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, And just imagine that I don't know anything else about it at that point,,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher," So if I look in here, I don't see anything about oxygen tanks",,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,"But, when I'm looking for a question from a text, I have to use what was in that text",,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, So can you find maybe another type of equipment that they might have used to help find water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,About oxygen tanks,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
92,Luis,So I gotta find something that's in the text like not like from my own like memory like I gotta read the text,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
92,Teacher,Absolutely,,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher," At that point, you've just got to find it in there",,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher," When you find something in the text, could you let me know",,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, You always have to dig into that text and just pretend like you don't know anything else,,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,Perfect,,,,remark,0,1,3
92,Luis,"Yeah, definitely",,,,response,0,1,3
92,Teacher,Okay,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, All right,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, Jazmin,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher," I know that you were talking about a small machine, which is what equipment is right? Yeah?",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,What did you say Chris,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, Do you think that equipment might possibly be a small machine as well,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Chris, And I know that scientists have to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to go into space,,,130.2,response,0,1,3
92,Chris,"Um, yeah, I think it could be, um, I just feel like also like for me",,,130.2,response,0,1,3
92,Chris," Like, I went to NASA",,,130.2,response,0,1,3
92,Teacher," Luis, we have to find it in the text",,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, But just like we were telling Mr,,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, That's a very good point,,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,"They do, and they have to have that stuff to keep them alive and well while they're out there",,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,"So, what's a piece of equipment that's inside the text that they might have been able to use, can you look for that for me",,,,remark,0,1,3
92,Chris,"Yeah, I can",,,,response,0,1,3
92,Chris, I can take a look,,,,response,0,1,3
92,Teacher," Yes, Miss Farrah?",,,,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,Perfect,,,,remark,0,1,3
92,Farrah," Um, so I said that the the microscope was how they studied the water, but I don't understand",,,,response,0,1,3
92,Farrah," Okay, so here's what I was wondering",,,,response,0,1,3
92,Farrah, Like why my answer is why my answers kind of wrong,,,,response,0,1,3
92,Farrah,Oh yeah,,,,response,0,1,3
92,Teacher,Hmm,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, Why do you think your answer is wrong,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
92,Farrah,"Like I'm thinking about, like, who cuz you know how we're all here together like to to like better find our answers and our thinking",,,210.3,response,0,1,3
92,Farrah," And I think that's how they discovered it, but maybe my answers wrong",,,210.3,response,0,1,3
92,Farrah," So like I think the microscope like, they definitely used it",,,210.3,response,0,1,3
92,Teacher,"Well, let's take a look",,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher," I know a lot of you that found your answer for microscope found it in paragraph three, and I'm going to read that to you real quick",,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, Okay,,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, I want you guys to look,,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,It says that that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher," The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it, even if you're looking straight at it",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,And then they told you that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look at it closely,,,420.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, That is one way that you could find it,,,420.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, But is that the way that NASA found it on the moon?,,,420.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, That's not what it says,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,Did they go up there with their oxygen tanks and a microscope to see if it was on there,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,Why don't we back up?,,,,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher," So I want everybody to just look at paragraph two, and I want you to read along with me",,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, Okay,,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,"Let's back up a little bit more to paragraph two, okay",,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, These ice deposits are very small,,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,"It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,"Ok, so that's paragraph two, does it talk about a piece of equipment that they used",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,Anybody want to raise their hand? Does it talk about one? Miss Jazmin?,,,,remark,0,1,3
92,Jazmin,"I think what's interesting is that it was kind of like my answer, but there was like there was more to my answer",,,,response,0,1,3
92,Jazmin,"So I said, they sent a small machin, but the small machine is the Lunar Orbiter",,,,response,0,1,3
92,Jazmin, So that's how I think they discovered the water,,,,response,0,1,3
92,Teacher, Good job,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, Okay,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, Can you give me a thumbs up if you agree,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher," If you're not quite sure, or thumbs down if you disagree with Jazmin",,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, A thumbs in the middle,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, Jazmin,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, Can you guys do that,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, I want you guys to give me,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,That is absolutely correct,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
92,Jazmin,"well, we can't quiet do the thumbs, but we could do raised hands if we agree and then no raise hands if we disagree, is that okay?",,,130.2,response,0,1,3
92,Teacher,That would work perfect,,,,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, You can put your hands down,,,110.4,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, Luis agrees,,,110.4,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher," Good job, guys",,,110.4,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, All right,,,110.4,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,"Okay, so, Farrah agrees, Oliver and Chris agree",,,110.4,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,"So I want you guys to make sure that when we look, we're off, we're always looking back in the text because we have to look for that small machine just like what Jazmin did",,,520.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher," She had said that NASA sent a small machine into space, right, Jazmin?",,,520.1,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,0,1,3
92,Jazmin,We have to go to lunch,,,,response,0,1,3
92,Jazmin,"We have to go to lunch, but I just, I just wanted to take a minute to thank you for working with us like like sometimes our science teacher gets kind of frustrated with us",,,,response,0,1,3
92,Jazmin, But you were so patient and you really like helped us understand like the difference between like discovering something and the difference between like studying it,,,,response,0,1,3
92,Jazmin," And also, like, I feel like Luis and Chris like, they, it seems like they understand better like that, you have to really use the text, you can't just use like information from your life",,,,response,0,1,3
92,Jazmin, And it was really interesting to hear other people's answers,,,,response,0,1,3
92,Jazmin, So thank you so much,,,,response,0,1,3
92,Jazmin,You have to study the text,,,,response,0,1,3
92,Jazmin, So I just wanted to thank you cuz it was really clear,,,,response,0,1,3
92,Teacher, Jazmin,,,,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher, You guys were wonderful,,,,remark,0,1,3
92,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,1,3
93,Teacher,Start simulation,,,,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher,Hey guys,,,,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher,"So let's talk about, yes",,,,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,1,1,4
93,Luis,"Um, yeah, I think, like, I need to be in this group because I already corrected my answer",,,,response,1,1,4
93,Teacher,Okay Luis What did you create your answer to?,,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
93,Luis,"Um, so basically what I was saying was that scientists found ice using a small machine",,,120.4,response,1,1,4
93,Teacher,"Okay, so the anybody get a different answer for Luis?",,,130.2,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher, What do you get,,,130.2,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher,Did anybody get a different answer from Luis,,,130.2,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher," Um, Farrah, what did Oliver",,,130.2,remark,1,1,4
93,Oliver,"Yeah, I actually did get a different answer because I was still kind of thinking that it was the microscope",,,130.2,response,1,1,4
93,Oliver," I feel like you know, like, that was really the equipment that they use to find the water",,,130.2,response,1,1,4
93,Farrah,"Okay, so, you know, initially, that's what I thought, too",,,130.2,response,1,1,4
93,Farrah,But then I revise my answer to scientists use the Lunar Orbiter to discover tiny bits of water in craters on the moon,,,,response,1,1,4
93,Teacher, How did you get to that answer,,,230.1,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher,Farrah,,,230.1,remark,1,1,4
93,Farrah," Like, I got to the answer, partially by listening carefully to Jazmin",,,230.1,response,1,1,4
93,Farrah,That's a really interesting question,,,230.1,response,1,1,4
93,Farrah, And her answer and to our discussions together,,,230.1,response,1,1,4
93,Farrah,"But really think that I got to the answer by reading the text more close because I think that I missunderstood the question because they didn't use the microscope to find the water, they used the microscope like afterwards to study the water, but it was the lunar orbiter that really found the water",,,,response,1,1,4
93,Teacher,Oliver and Luis,,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher, Does that help clarify that question,,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
93,Oliver,"Um, yeah, I think that that makes sense because yeah okay that actually makes a lot of sense",,,150.1,response,1,1,4
93,Oliver," So like Farrah, you're saying that like basically like that, you know, if you use like a microscope to see the water after you find it",,,150.1,response,1,1,4
93,Oliver, First is that right,,,150.1,response,1,1,4
93,Oliver, You have to find it,,,150.1,response,1,1,4
93,Farrah,Yeah,,,,response,1,1,4
93,Teacher,So Oliver,,,,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher, Chris,,,,remark,1,1,4
93,Chris, Sorry,,,,response,1,1,4
93,Chris,"Oh, um, I actually didn't mean to raise my hand up",,,,response,1,1,4
93,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher," What about you, Jazmin",,,,remark,1,1,4
93,Jazmin,And I just wanted to say that I changed my answer,,,,response,1,1,4
93,Teacher,What did you change your answer to Jazmin,,,230.1,remark,1,1,4
93,Jazmin," It was the lunar orbiter, you know what I mean?",,,230.1,response,1,1,4
93,Jazmin,"Basicallt my answer was incomplete, and I was just saying small machine instead of like that",,,230.1,response,1,1,4
93,Teacher, What did you do to make that change,,,530.1,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher,And how did you find that instead of small machine it was the Lunar Orbiter,,,530.1,remark,1,1,4
93,Jazmin,"Yeah, that's a really good question",,,530.1,response,1,1,4
93,Jazmin, I sort of thought about it,,,530.1,response,1,1,4
93,Jazmin,"First I looked more closely at the text that was thinking, why was my answer wrong at first, and I was trying to figure it out and basically you know if if the lunar orbiter was the small machine",,,,response,1,1,4
93,Jazmin," So I kind of had the answer, but I just I just wasn't complete in what I was saying",,,,response,1,1,4
93,Teacher, I think what we all need to take away is that when we're doing things we really need to focus on going back and reading the article in detail and maybe highlighting it annotating the text so that we can really understand in detail what we're learning  and why we're learning it,,,520.1,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher, Jazmin,,,520.1,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher,Very good,,,520.1,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher," Um, what other questions do you have Chris",,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
93,Teacher,Okay,,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
93,Chris," And so I i know that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and suit, and I guess I'm wondering, like why that wasn't right",,,120.4,response,1,1,4
93,Chris,I guess like I went to NASA,,,120.4,response,1,1,4
93,Teacher,"Why don't you Chris, like I just said, why don't you go back and look at the text and maybe take a highlighter and reread it, and see if you can come to that answer yourself, find the answer yourself",,,420.3,remark,1,1,4
93,Chris,"Okay, I'll take a look",,,420.3,response,1,1,4
93,Teacher,Yes Oliver?,,,,remark,1,1,4
93,Oliver,"Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but um I think we'll see you again soon",,,,response,1,1,4
93,Teacher,Hello,,,,remark,0,1,4
93,Chris,"Hi, how are you",,,,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"I'm good, how are you",,,,remark,0,1,4
93,Luis,Doing well,,,,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher, So I have Farrah Oliver Chris Jazmin and Luis,,,,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher, Luis You have a question?,,,,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,It's good,,,,remark,0,1,4
93,Luis, So here's what I was thinking,,,,response,0,1,4
93,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,1,4
93,Luis," Um, I know all about space",,,,response,0,1,4
93,Luis," So, like, I don't think I have to be in this group because I feel like I know everything there is to know already",,,,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Oh really,",,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
93,Luis,Yeah,,,110.1,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Okay, so why do you what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon, Luis",,,120.2,remark,0,1,4
93,Luis,"Um, so I think that the what they used was oxygen tanks and um space suits and all that kind of stuff, because otherwise they wouldn't be able to be on the moon and like run around",,,120.2,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Well, that, that's correct",,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,But how did they discover water on the moon?,,,120.2,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,Because what you just described is how they got to the moon,,,420.1,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Was there any other equipment that you think they used to discover water by, could you look back on the text and think about what they actually use to discovered water on the moon",,,230.2,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher, They have to have certain equipment to get to the moon,,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
93,Luis,"I didn't really read it so I can read it, I guess",,,110.2,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher,So why don't you take two minutes and read over the passage and tell me what you think that scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,remark,0,1,4
93,Luis,"Okay, I'll do that",,,120.3,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher,Does anybody else have any questions,,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,0,1,4
93,Farrah,"Okay, so here's my main question",,,,response,0,1,4
93,Farrah, I'm trying to understand like why my answer is wrong,,,,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Okay, Farrah so",,,,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Um,",,,,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher, Does that make a difference?,,,410.2,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Your answer is about the kind of water that they found they signed up for was that I thought was microscopic, it doesn't really say that how they got the water",,,410.2,remark,0,1,4
93,Farrah," Okay, so the question was, like, how did scientists discover water on the moon and like so they use a microscope for like something for like to, like, study the water",,,410.2,response,0,1,4
93,Farrah," So, like so",,,410.2,response,0,1,4
93,Farrah,Yes,,,410.2,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Yes, so the water they found, you would use a microscope to study it, but it doesn't explain how they found the water",,,410.1,remark,0,1,4
93,Farrah,"Oh, OK",,,410.1,response,0,1,4
93,Farrah," OK, gotcha",,,410.1,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher, Any other questions,,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Okay, thank you",,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher, Farrah for your question,,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
93,Jazmin,"Jazmin, do you know how scientists discovered water on the moon?",,,150.1,response,0,1,4
93,Jazmin,"Basically, the scientists used a small machine",,,,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher,You know what the small machine was called?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,4
93,Jazmin,I can look it up,,,230.2,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Yeah, why don't you do that Jazmin",,,,remark,0,1,4
93,Jazmin,"It's paragraph two, it says, NASA small machine called lunar orbiter to investigate",,,,response,0,1,4
93,Jazmin, Lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher, Does everybody else agree with her answer?,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Very good, Jazmin",,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,Or anyone else find anything different?,,,130.2,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Yes, Chris,",,,,remark,0,1,4
93,Chris,"Yeah, so I think like I kind of disagree",,,,response,0,1,4
93,Chris, So I'm still confused like why Luis's answer was incorrect,,,,response,0,1,4
93,Chris," Like, I went to NASA with my dad and we like looked at, like, the stuff that they use to like fly around and I feel like the scientists like would have to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, like when they're out in like the space like they'd have to you know use all that stuff",,,,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Okay Luis's answer was about how they got to the moon, okay so astronaut have to have things to fly around and have oxygen in order to get to the moon",,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher, That is correct,,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"But what this article is talking about is how they discovered water on the moon, and I use a lunar orbiter to find [?] water on the moon",,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,What Luis and Chris described is how they got to the moon,,,410.2,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,but the Lunar Orbiter it's what they use to find water on the moon,,,110.4,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,That make better sense?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
93,Chris,"Yeah, I think that's a little clearer",,,150.1,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher,Is anything else I can do to clear this up for you guys,,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
93,Oliver,"Um, I guess, like what I was wondering, like, Um, okay, so like a small machine",,,150.1,response,0,1,4
93,Oliver," Well, okay, so I think that I'm beginning to understand, but can you help me understand just like super clearly like how the ok so the microscopes like not quite the right answer and I got the same answer as Farrah",,,150.1,response,0,1,4
93,Oliver,"So it sounds like the answer is the Lunar Orbiter, but I just wanted to understand, like, why the lunar orbiter is the right answer and the microscope's, not quite the right answer",,,,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Okay, was that Oliver speaking?",,,,remark,0,1,4
93,Oliver,Yeah,,,,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Okay, so a microscopic okay, so the lunar orbiter is what you use to discover the water",,,110.4,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,That's how you got to know that there's water on it,,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"And then the microscope is what she needs to study the water because it's so small that you need to microscope did this study yet, but the lunar orbiter is how you discover the water",,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
93,Oliver,So they use the Lunar Orbiter to like discover it and then microscope to like study it,,,130.3,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher," Yes, that is correct",,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
93,Teacher,Yes,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4

93,Teacher,Hold on [turns off ringing phone],,,,remark,0,1,4
93,Jazmin,Sure,,,,response,0,1,4
93,Teacher,"Okay, what were you saying Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,1,4
93,Jazmin,I just wanted to take a moment and thank you like sometimes our science teacher gets frustrated with us,,,,response,0,1,4
93,Jazmin,But you were so patient in listening to like what we had to say,,,,response,0,1,4
93,Jazmin," And then also, like,",,,,response,0,1,4
93,Jazmin,"You like took our answers and you like kind of helped us to understand each other's answers and like understand better like kind of about the text, but like",,,,response,0,1,4
93,Jazmin, And sometimes we get kind of like in fights with each other,,,,response,0,1,4
93,Jazmin, But this was really easy for us to listen,,,,response,0,1,4
93,Jazmin," So just to like, thank you for your patience and like helping us to listen to each other",,,,response,0,1,4
93,Jazmin,By helping us listened to each other,,,,response,0,1,4

94,Teacher, Yes?,,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
94,Luis,Yeah,,,230.3,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher, Why did you mention oxygen tank,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher,"All right, you mentioned oxygen tanks",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Luis,"Um, so the reason that I mentioned it was because I know that like astronauts have to use oxygen tanks when they're going up into space and they have to use, like, stuff like that, in order to walk around",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher,"All right, what, what part of this text that you read gave you the impression that they had to use them",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
94,Luis,"Well, I guess I didn't really look at the text because I already knew this",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher,"Oh, well, can you tell me any other equipment that you may have seen in the text that you didn't read",,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
94,Luis,"Maybe there's something in there because I didn't, I didn't really read because I thought I already knew",,,420.3,response,0,1,3

94,Teacher, Okay,,,510.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher," Sometimes we come across scenarios where we know a lot and we think we know too much, maybe you can take a moment and read back over that and I'll come back to you",,,510.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Luis,Okay,,,510.1,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,0,1,3

94,Farrah,Yeah,,,230.3,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher,"Okay, what does a microscope look for? how do you use it",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Farrah,"Well, like you use it to like study something",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
94,Farrah," And like look at something really closely, you know what I mean like you, you look at it like like small things",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher,"Oh, well, what exactly does the microscope do to help you look at small thing",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Farrah,"Um, so I think if I remember it's like you",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
94,Farrah," So in the text is said that, um, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, so like I guess it helps you look at small things",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
94,Farrah," Um, okay",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher, And I'm glad that you referenced the text because that was awesome and correct,,,310.1,remark,0,1,3

94,Farrah," Like what, why is my answer, not quite right",,,310.1,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher," Yes, Farrah?",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher,"Well, your answer says they use a microscope to look really closely, but what are they looking closely at what can they use it to focus on, like, are they looking at something really small, or really big",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
94,Farrah,"So I guess they're looking at like something really small, they're looking at the water, they're studying the water",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher, Good job,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher,There you go,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher, There's something small that they're looking at is the water,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher,"Oliver, you had your hand raised",,,,remark,0,1,3
94,Oliver,"Yeah, I was gonna say basically the same thing",,,,response,0,1,3
94,Oliver," Like, you can look closely at the water",,,,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher,"All right, is there anything else that they could look closely at besides the water with a microscope?",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Oliver,"Um, well, like, I don't know",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
94,Oliver," Like, what if, like, it's not really in the reading",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
94,Oliver, But like you could look at germs and stuff,,,230.1,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher,"You could, but what is something on the moon that they could look at on the moon",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher, What else could they look at if they say desert,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher, They said the moon is a desert,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
94,Oliver,"Ah, they could look at like the sand and like the dirt",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher, Great job,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3

94,Teacher, You have a question,,,,remark,0,1,3
94,Jazmin,"Yes, so I'm just so I guess my question is like so, whose answer is, like I thought that it was a small machine and I'm trying to understand, like, why is my answer not right",,,,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher,"Well, I didn't say your answer was wrong",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher," It is technically correct, they did send a small machine, but what kind of small machine, did they send? Can you tell me that Jazmin",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
94,Jazmin,"Yeah, well, I guess, I guess in the reading",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
94,Jazmin, I guess I can look and see,,,230.2,response,0,1,3
94,Jazmin, So in paragraph two NASA sent a small machine called a  lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,0,1,3
94,Jazmin, Is it the lunar orbiter?,,,,response,0,1,3
94,Jazmin,ok ok ok I see it,,,,response,0,1,3

94,Chris,Because you have to like Luis's answer like I went to NASA,,,,response,0,1,3
94,Chris," So like I know that you have to use a space soon if you're gonna go like walk around and study something so I'm trying to understand, like, why is my answer, not quite right",,,,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher,"Well,",,,,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher,Can you tell me where they found the water on the moon,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Chris,"Oh, they found it in the craters that were full of water",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher,Did they find it in the crater,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Chris,"I thought that, um, I thought that's what they said",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher, If you could read that for me,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher,"Oh, well, let's look at the first paragraph",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
94,Chris,"Um, yeah, okay, um, scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on Earth",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
94,Chris, Scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines,,,,response,0,1,3
94,Chris,"However, they used to believe there was no water on the moon, now they know this is not true",,,,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher,Correct,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher," Now, did it say the craters where full of water or was the water below the crater?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
94,Chris,"Oh, so like there wasn't much water like there was only some water because you had to look at it through the microscope",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher,Not exactly,,,,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher,They didn't really use a microscope to find the water,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher, The water was located underneath the ground,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
94,Chris,So how did they find the water,,,130.3,response,0,1,3
94,Teacher, It's craters,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher, How did they find the water under the moon,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher,"Oh, that is a great question",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher, I think that is something we could both look at for the next time we have class,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
94,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,1,3
94,Jazmin, I just wanted to take a moment and thank you for working with us today,,,,response,0,1,3

94,Jazmin,"So, we have to go to lunch",,,,response,0,1,3
94,Jazmin, But you were so patient,,,,response,0,1,3
94,Jazmin, But before we went,,,,response,0,1,3
94,Jazmin,"And you really like helped us to feel like we were part of, like, like a group like like that we weren't just wrong",,,,response,0,1,3
94,Jazmin," Like that we had like some learning to do that, we could do together",,,,response,0,1,3
94,Jazmin,"And so, like, it was really nice that you are just so supportive of each of us as we try to learn about it",,,,response,0,1,3

94,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,1,3
94,Luis,"Um, yeah, I was just gonna say like, I don't think I need to be in this group because I already know all about space",,,,response,1,1,3
94,Teacher,"Well, I'm glad you know all about space, but we're looking for specific information from the text that we have",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher,And the first one I went like talk to his Chris with your question,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher,"I like that you focused on the the craters in the moon, but I'm a little concerned that you think or you found that they're full of water",,,430.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher, Can you find a quantity of ice or water inside that paragraph?,,,430.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher, If you go back and look in section two or paragraph two of the text,,,430.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Chris,"Yeah, oh, I'm 32 ounces and 4 glasses",,,430.3,response,1,1,3
94,Teacher,You're correct four glasses of water is that a lot of water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
94,Chris,"No, that's, that's, um, that's not very much at all",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
94,Teacher,It's not very much at all,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher, Do you think that could fill up a crater,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
94,Chris,I guess not,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
94,Chris, So the craters aren't full at all,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
94,Teacher,No they're not,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher," There's such a tiny amount of water that it's almost, you have to have a special tool to see it",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher, They're not full at all,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher,"And that special tool is what Farrah mentioned Farrah, you mentioned that you they use a scientific tool called a microscope",,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher, Yes,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Farrah,"Yeah, that was people used to find it",,,230.3,response,1,1,3
94,Teacher,"Well, that's where I'm concerned a microscope is used to look at objects, not really, to find them",,,430.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher, Do you think you can look in paragraph,,,430.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher," Let's see a paragraph two, and find the name of the machine that's a use to find the water",,,430.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Farrah,"Yeah, let me see",,,430.3,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah," Well, is it the",,,,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah, Is it the Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah,I see,,,,response,1,1,3
94,Teacher, And did they find a lot of water or a little water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher,"You're right, it is the lunar lunar orbiter they use that to find the water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
94,Farrah,No,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah, He just found a little water is that was what Chris found,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah, Right,,,,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah,but I think I'm still a little confused just like why my answers not correct,,,,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah," So like, it seems like they found",,,,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah," You know what I mean, like, yeah, they use the orbiter, but didn't they use the microscope, because they could see it without the without the microscope",,,,response,1,1,3
94,Teacher, They had the machine,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher,"Well, scientists weren't on the moon to look at the water by themselves so they didn't need the microscope",,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher, The Lunar Orbiter investigating the ground for that water,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Farrah,That's interesting,,,130.3,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah, So they didn't use the micrsoscope to find it,,,130.3,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah,They were using my something else on the lunar orbiter like a sensor or something like that,,,,response,1,1,3
94,Teacher, That's how they would find it,,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher,"Oh, absolutely",,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
94,Farrah, So did they use the microscope,,,110.4,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah, Okay,,,110.4,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah, Yeah,,,110.4,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah," I'm like, it sounds like they used it",,,110.4,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah," Yeah, that makes sense",,,110.4,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah,Okay,,,110.4,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah, So I guess,,,110.4,response,1,1,3
94,Farrah, Did they say they had to do something else before they used the microscope,,,110.4,response,1,1,3
94,Teacher," They had to use something else to find it before they could use or identify the water with a microscope, because it was such a small amount of water",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher,Correct,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher, You have the same answer as Farrah,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher,"Now, Oliver",,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher, Did you follow along with what we just went with,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Oliver,"Um, yeah, I followed along",,,210.3,response,1,1,3
94,Oliver, So I think like,,,210.3,response,1,1,3
94,Oliver," Um, and then like",,,,response,1,1,3
94,Oliver,"Okay, so the lunar orbiter was the thing that discovered the water",,,,response,1,1,3
94,Oliver,They use the microscope to study it after they found it,,,,response,1,1,3
94,Teacher,"Yes, they could use the microscope after they found it to study it",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher, That's very good deduction there,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher," I like what you did there, Oliver",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher, Chris,,,,remark,1,1,3

94,Chris, So my dad took me to NASA and like when we were there,,,,response,1,1,3
94,Chris," But we saw that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like I was thinking like, did they not use those things as oh",,,,response,1,1,3
94,Teacher," Well, in our story in the moon is a desert",,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher,"Well, I'm glad you brought that up",,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher," It doesn't mention that the astronauts themselves were on the moon, so they wouldn't have the need to include that equipment in our story today",,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Chris," Luis Like, that's the thing to remember, like they didn't do that",,,130.3,response,1,1,3
94,Chris,Okay,,,130.3,response,1,1,3
94,Chris," Is that right,",,,130.3,response,1,1,3
94,Chris, Yeah,,,130.3,response,1,1,3
94,Chris," Okay, so they weren't actually there",,,130.3,response,1,1,3
94,Chris, So they didn't need to use masks and suits and stuff like that,,,130.3,response,1,1,3
94,Teacher," They sent that small machine, the equipment",,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher, The Lunar Orbiter to investigate the moon,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher,Correct,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher,"And with that, Chris",,,410.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher," So I'm concerned why you're talking about things, not in our story",,,410.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher," Let's look at Luis Luis You mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but like we just talked about with Chris that oxygen tanks weren't exactly in our story",,,410.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Luis,"Yeah, I was using up like you know how we talked about in class, sometimes like background knowledge",,,410.3,response,1,1,3
94,Luis, So I was using background knowledge and I was thinking like,,,410.3,response,1,1,3
94,Luis," Like, why should I not use background knowledge, this time",,,,response,1,1,3
94,Luis,"Um, you know, like, that was like probably enough to answer that question",,,,response,1,1,3
94,Luis," But I was thinking like, I guess I was wondering, like, even though it wasn't in the story",,,,response,1,1,3
94,Teacher,"Well, for the question",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher," It's asking exactly what they used to discover water on the moon,",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher,"and they didn't use oxygen tanks, although they do use them",,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Teacher, They did not use them to find the water on the moon,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
94,Luis," So they did, like, Okay, that makes sense",,,210.2,response,1,1,3
94,Luis,Gotcha,,,210.2,response,1,1,3
94,Luis," Oh, OK",,,210.2,response,1,1,3
94,Luis, So it's really like what was in there reading,,,210.2,response,1,1,3
94,Luis,"So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,,response,1,1,3
94,Luis, It was really fun to work with,,,,response,1,1,3
94,Luis," But before we go, I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us",,,,response,1,1,3
94,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher,Welcome back everybody,,,,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher," Yes, sir",,,,remark,2,1,3
94,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,2,1,3
94,Luis," So I was just gonna say, I think I got everything figured out, so I think I'm all that",,,,response,2,1,3
94,Teacher," First, let's see, our water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen",,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher,"All right, well then, if you think you're good",,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher, Let's look at your response,,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher," That is very true, but I'm concerned that you're not giving me a reason to as why it could be valuable on the moon",,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher,Is there a place in the text that that mentions what hydrogen oxygen can be used for?,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
94,Luis, Yeah,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
94,Luis, So you can use them for rocket fuel,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
94,Luis,Me see,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
94,Teacher,You can use them for rocket fuel can do you can use both of them?,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Luis,I'm like you could use like them mixed together and you can also read the oxygen And you can drink the water,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
94,Teacher,Absolutely,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher," Luis That was, that was a great find in the text",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher, The water before it's broken apart can be drunk by astronauts good observation there from the text and the usefulness for oxygen and hydrogen can be used for rocket fuel here,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher,"Speaking of drinking water, Jazmin, you mentioned astronauts can drink water and stay hydrated and you can't survive without it",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher, That is true,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher,But how much water is on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Jazmin,You're talking about,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
94,Jazmin, I remember that it wasn't actually a lot,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
94,Jazmin, Why is there enough water for astronauts,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
94,Jazmin, So I'm actually still kind of confused because it sounded Like it sounded like there was it very much,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
94,Teacher,There probably isn't enough in the drink on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher, But what do you think they can do to get more water on to the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Jazmin,Take it with them,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
94,Teacher,They could take it with them take it with them on a what,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Jazmin,On a spaceship,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
94,Teacher,On a spaceship,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher, Would that increase the value of water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher, If they brought it with them,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Jazmin,"We get, I think it would be like, yes, it would be more valuable if it was on the moon like already",,,210.4,response,2,1,3
94,Jazmin," And then they could just build their even, and they could see it right there",,,210.4,response,2,1,3
94,Teacher," If they already had it or put more on the moon, good job there",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher, Jazmin,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher, I think that that would be a more valuable deduction,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher,Absolutely,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher,"I'm, uh, but Chris, you mentioned that water is heavy",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher,What it but you yeah but you say they wouldn't have to carry it on ships anymore,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
94,Chris,Yeah,,,230.3,response,2,1,3
94,Chris,"I'm I think what they were saying is that they were saying that like you could, you know, you could basically",,,,response,2,1,3
94,Chris,Not have to take the water or you could just get it from the moon,,,,response,2,1,3
94,Teacher," So I'm a little concerned that you're saying that astronauts don't need to take it on their ships anymore, do you think they may still need to take some water with them",,,410.3,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher, There's not a lot of water on the moon,,,410.3,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher,"Well, like we just talked about with Jazmin",,,410.3,remark,2,1,3
94,Chris," If there's like if there's not very much because we said that, like there were only a few ounces right glasses",,,410.3,response,2,1,3
94,Chris,"Yeah, I guess so",,,410.3,response,2,1,3
94,Chris,"On and so like it actually wouldn't be enough to, you know what I mean, do everything, but I think it would be really valuable because water is so heavy, but that doesn't make sense, yet so they they still yeah they would still have to carry some on the ship",,,,response,2,1,3
94,Teacher,Exactly,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher," And in paragraph one, what does it say that the future astronauts could do",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Chris,They could drink the water,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
94,Teacher,"That's right, they could drink the water in the future",,,110.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher," And no, not for a long time",,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher," Oliver and Farrah, you mentioned that it's not ready",,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher, Why do you think Farrah and Oliver that it's not valuable yet,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher,"Teacher:So, with it being in the future",,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
94,Oliver,"Um, so I think that's not valuable yet because it seems like it would be really complicated to actually get the water to a place where you're like,",,,230.1,response,2,1,3
94,Oliver, Like I read somewhere that they weren't going to maybe put a moon base up on the moon in 2024 and I was thinking like,,,,response,2,1,3
94,Oliver,All all yeah I can use us really easily,,,,response,2,1,3
94,Oliver, Like they said in the read,,,,response,2,1,3
94,Oliver,"They, they wouldn't like they don't really have figured out, it seems like like they need to come up with a plan to get the water out of the moon",,,,response,2,1,3
94,Teacher,Exactly,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher,You can find that in paragraph six,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher, That's great use of your background knowledge about that space station that they're planning to build it will take a lot of what in order to get that process going,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
94,Oliver,Lots of time and money,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
94,Oliver,So that seems like like it seems like you know we don't spend like very much,,,,response,2,1,3
94,Oliver, So it seems like it would be kind of,,,,response,2,1,3
94,Oliver, Because it seems like a really expensive,,,,response,2,1,3
94,Oliver,"Money on like space travel, like that's something that I know from my reading",,,,response,2,1,3
94,Oliver," I'm like, it seems like it would be kind of hard to like make this work",,,,response,2,1,3
94,Teacher,"Oh, absolutely would be expensive",,,110.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Teacher," Yes, Farrah",,,110.4,remark,2,1,3
94,Farrah,"Um, so, unfortunately, unfortunately, we, we have to go to our next class",,,110.4,response,2,1,3
94,Farrah," But before we go, I really wanted to thank you",,,110.4,response,2,1,3
94,Farrah,"for working with us and, like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you for, like, explain to us what we all needed to work on like offering like the concerns that you had",,,,response,2,1,3
94,Farrah,And you are so kind about the way offer them that I think we offer really okay with like hearing about concerns like I don't think anyone took it personally,,,,response,2,1,3
94,Farrah, You know what I mean,,,,response,2,1,3
94,Farrah, So you really also give a suggestion on like how we should do,,,,response,2,1,3
94,Farrah,And I think like everybody like really learned something from being able to listen to each other,,,,response,2,1,3
94,Farrah, Thank you so much,,,,response,2,1,3
94,Farrah,So it was really fun working with,,,,response,2,1,3
95,Oliver,Hi,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher,"Hi, how are you all?",,,,remark,0,0,1
95,Chris,We're doing okay,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher, Has everyone had a chance to answer their question what equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,Good,,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher, Luis?,,,,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,0,1
95,Luis," Like, I don't like I know all about space already so like I don't think I need to be here",,,,response,0,0,1
95,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,0,1
95,Luis," Okay, so here's what I was just needed to say is, I don't think I should be in this group",,,,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher, So maybe you can help us teach the others since you know,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,"Well, that's aweseome",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
95,Luis,Okay,,,110.1,response,0,0,1
95,Luis,Yeah,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher,Awesome,,,,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher, Thank you,,,,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,"So, who's ready to tell me what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,Are you ready,,,,remark,0,0,1
95,Farrah,"Yeah, okay",,,,response,0,0,1
95,Farrah, Yeah,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Farrah," So, um, I said that the the scientists that they, okay",,,,response,0,0,1
95,Farrah, Yeah,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Farrah,If I look at the text it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Farrah, Like why my answers not right,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Farrah," I think it was a microscope, but I'm not sure",,,,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher," Oliver, do you want to give your answer",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,Let's go and see what someone else said before we get back and talk about whose answer is correct,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
95,Oliver," So I pretty much said the same thing as Farrah, and I circled the same area",,,110.1,response,0,0,1
95,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,110.1,response,0,0,1
95,Oliver,"Like in paragraph three, that the um the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it, if you were looking straight at it so like I think you have to use a microscope to discover the water",,,,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher,Right,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,"Okay, Chris, do you have a different answer",,,,remark,0,0,1
95,Chris," So, like, I know that they have to use all that stuff",,,,response,0,0,1
95,Chris,"Yeah, so like for me like I kind of just like I went to NASA",,,,response,0,0,1
95,Chris, So like I I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Chris, And masks and suits and stuff like that,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Chris, And like the craters are so full of water on the moon that like I guess it's pretty easy to find,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher,"Okay, Jazmin, what do you think",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
95,Jazmin, Okay,,,110.1,response,0,0,1
95,Jazmin,That,,,110.1,response,0,0,1
95,Jazmin, So I think that it's this small machine,,,110.1,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher,"Okay, and what was a small machine called",,,230.2,remark,0,0,1
95,Jazmin,"NASA send this machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate, so Lunar Orbiter",,,230.2,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher,Luis Do you want to add to this discussion,,,,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,"Okay, that is the name of the small machine",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,"Okay, let's not stray too far and understand that, you know, a lot of this information, but we want to find the answer here in the paragraph that you read",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher," So you would need exactly what Farrah and Oliver said, you would need a microscope to look really closely to see it",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,"As I'm going back and looking in, and it says that the water they found is microscopic which means you you can't see it with your naked eye",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
95,Luis, So I just kind of didn't read the text,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
95,Luis,I guess I didn't really read it like I kind of knew the answer,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher,So it's important to read it right,,,510.1,remark,0,0,1
95,Luis,Yeah,,,510.1,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher,"Yeah, then that way you can help everyone else",,,,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,"Okay, thank you",,,,remark,0,0,1
95,Luis, Okay,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Luis,Um sure I'll take a look at it,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah?",,,,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,It is,,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
95,Farrah,"Um, so I think like so I can kind of wondering like, who is right like is Jazmin right or are Oliver and I right because like like, is it the microscope that discovered the water---",,,,response,0,0,1
95,Farrah,or is it the lunar orbiter?,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher,The lunar orbiter was the machine that NASA sent to investigate to look for ice deposits,,,130.3,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,So the water they found is microscopic so you would need the scientific tool,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,You would need the microscope to be able to see it,,,130.3,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher, So you and your answer and Oliver's answer was correct,,,130.3,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher, It was a microscope,,,130.3,remark,0,0,1
95,Jazmin,Reach Every ReadeR: So my answer---,,,130.3,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher,"But I guess you could say, you know, they did use the lunar orbiter also to investigate it, but to actually see it, you would need the microscope",,,130.3,remark,0,0,1
95,Jazmin,So is my answer wrong or is it like sort of right?,,,130.3,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher,But the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,"So they use that the Lunar Orbiter to investigate, but to see the water they had to use the microscope",,,130.3,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher, They did send the machine,,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,It's sort of right,,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
95,Jazmin, Okay,,,130.3,response,0,0,1
95,Jazmin,Okay,,,130.3,response,0,0,1
95,Jazmin, That makes sense,,,130.3,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher,Any other questions?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,Yes Oliver,,,,remark,0,0,1
95,Oliver,"Um, so we have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to take a moment before we had to go to thank you",,,,response,0,0,1
95,Oliver, Like you were really patient with us,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Oliver, And so I just wanted to thank you for like taking the time to do that because it was really nice,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Oliver, And sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher and you were so patient with us,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Oliver,And you like helped us like use our prior knowledge to like like be part of the discussion,,,,response,0,0,1
95,Teacher,"Well, thank you, thank you",,,,remark,0,0,1
95,Teacher,How are you all?,,,,remark,1,0,1
95,Jazmin,Good,,,,response,1,0,1
95,Jazmin, Great,,,,response,1,0,1
95,Teacher, I have what are your questions are the answers for the passage that you read water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,Great,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
95,Luis, I know a lot about space,,,150.1,response,1,0,1
95,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group teacher",,,150.1,response,1,0,1
95,Teacher,"Well, that is wonderful",,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher, And maybe you can help me teach them Some new things about space,,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher," I'm glad you know a lot about space, but maybe our friends don't",,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
95,Luis,Maybe I can teach you guys some stuff,,,110.3,response,1,0,1
95,Luis, Yeah,,,110.3,response,1,0,1
95,Teacher,That would be a good thing,,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,So going back to the question,,,120.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher, What equipment didn't scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,"It was, is there",,,120.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,How did you come up with your answer,,,230.1,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher, Farrah,,,230.1,remark,1,0,1
95,Farrah, And so I found it in paragraph three,,,230.1,response,1,0,1
95,Farrah,"Um, well, I saw the question asked about equipment and so I was looking for a paragraph that talks about equipment and water",,,230.1,response,1,0,1
95,Teacher,Okay,,,110.1,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,"So what about you, Oliver?",,,120.1,remark,1,0,1
95,Oliver,Okay so art or science teacher always talks about microscopes,,,120.1,response,1,0,1
95,Oliver," She's like, Okay, take out the equipment for science class and we're going to use the microscopes",,,,response,1,0,1
95,Oliver," So then I was looking at a question and I was looking for something on the story that talked about, like, You know, discovering water ",,,,response,1,0,1
95,Oliver,"When, when it's time for us to take out microscopes",,,,response,1,0,1
95,Oliver,"And I saw the part where it says you need a microscope, which is a tool",,,,response,1,0,1
95,Oliver, Which is equipment to look really closely and then we're talking about the water,,,,response,1,0,1
95,Teacher," So microscope isn't isn't a piece of equipment, but the word in the sentence that we need to look at is discover",,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher, So when the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,Right,,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,"So why don't you go back to your passages and You know circle some or go back to the question and read it again, and let me know if you have any questions",,,120.1,remark,1,0,1
95,Oliver,I don't see anything that said discover in the story I'll look again,,,120.1,response,1,0,1
95,Jazmin,Teacher,,,,response,1,0,1
95,Jazmin,"Yes, it's me, Jazmin",,,,response,1,0,1
95,Jazmin, I don't understand why  my answer is wrong,,,,response,1,0,1
95,Teacher,"Well Jazmin your answer was, NASA sent a small machine",,,110.1,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,They did send a small machine to discover water on the moon,,,410.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher, We're looking for more detail,,,410.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher, What was the name of the small machine,,,410.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher, But what was the name,,,410.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Jazmin,Oh I don't remember,,,410.2,response,1,0,1
95,Teacher,The question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,We need to be a little more detail,,,430.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher, We can't just say a microscope,,,430.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher," We can't just say a small machine, you know, a microscope is a small machine",,,430.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher, You know what they used To discover water on the moon,,,430.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher, So we need to be a little more detailed and go back into the passage and highlight,,,430.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Jazmin,"Okay, so I have to say more details",,,430.2,response,1,0,1
95,Teacher,"Yes, more details",,,110.4,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,"And as you're reading the passage, you know, might be good to take a highlighter and highlight key words",,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher," So when you go back, you can look at what you highlighted to help you find the answers",,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
95,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.3,response,1,0,1
95,Oliver," Okay, I'll try that, because I still don't see on Discover and here so I'll see what I find",,,,response,1,0,1
95,Oliver,Okay,,,,response,1,0,1
95,Teacher,"So if you go back to the passage, you know, discover is to look for",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher," But if you were to keep reading that sentence, it would tell you what the small machine was called that they sent to investigate",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher, They sent a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,"Go back and, the second paragraph says NASA send a small machine",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher," Well, which is what Jazmin read",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
95,Jazmin,"Yeah, I just found the name",,,210.4,response,1,0,1
95,Jazmin," Um, and so I added I added the rest of that sentence to my answer",,,210.4,response,1,0,1
95,Jazmin," So now my answer says, NASA sent a small machine cutter Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,response,1,0,1
95,Teacher, That is great,,,110.4,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,Wonderful,,,110.4,remark,1,0,1

95,Teacher,You did,,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher, You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they do use equipment like oxygen tanks,,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,But the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,"So that's when you have to go back and you have to, you know, dig in a little deeper to find you know where they're talking about water on the moon and what they what piece of equipment",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher, Did they use for that,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,"Okay, the oxygen tanks allows them to breathe better when they're on the moon",,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
95,Luis,It does cause they can't breathe without oxygen tanks,,,210.3,response,1,0,1
95,Teacher,"Right, yeah",,,,remark,1,0,1
95,Teacher,"So the question was, you know, they're trying, they're going to need the oxygen tanks while they're on the moon, but you're also going to need different equipment to discover water on the moon",,,130.3,remark,1,0,1
95,Luis, All right,,,130.3,response,1,0,1
95,Luis,Okay,,,130.3,response,1,0,1
95,Luis, Now I should say like scientists used a lot of ox used equipment like oxygen tanks and um and others equipment like I guess I could what Jazmin said and and the small machine to investigate to call it a lunar orbiter,,,130.3,response,1,0,1
95,Teacher,"Exactly, exactly, the more detail you have, the better off your answer is",,,420.2,remark,1,0,1

95,Luis,What a long day,,,,response,2,0,1
95,Teacher,Understand the question was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher, And each one of you had different answers in your journals,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Luis,"Excuse me, I'm a teacher, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,150.1,response,2,0,1
95,Teacher,"Well, that is wonderful",,,110.3,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher, Luis But we are still learning more information about space,,,110.3,remark,2,0,1

95,Teacher,Farrah,,,410.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher," I'm not sure that maybe you understood the question correctly, you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,410.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Farrah,"Yeah, I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,410.1,response,2,0,1
95,Teacher,"Well, you do need a microscope to look really closely, but this question is, we're looking for the name of the piece of equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,410.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Farrah,But they said that you need the microscope to look at the water,,,410.1,response,2,0,1
95,Teacher, I'm sure you do,,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher,"But right now, we're looking for the The actual to the piece of equipment that was used to discover water on the moon",,,410.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher,Really close,,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher, You said scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1

95,Teacher,Chris and Jazmin,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher,"I don't think you read the question correctly, either",,,410.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher,"So if we go back and we look in the passage, the first paragraph is called the moon is a desert",,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher," It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,120.3,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher," But if you go to the second paragraph, and the very first sentence",,,120.3,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher, The moon is a desert,,,120.3,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher,In the first paragraph tells us what scientists have known for a long time,,,120.3,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher,Says the orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,120.3,remark,2,0,1
95,Jazmin,Jazmin: That's where I got my answer from,,,120.3,response,2,0,1
95,Teacher,You what,,,,remark,2,0,1
95,Jazmin,That's where I got my answer from that sentence at the beginning of the second paragraph,,,,response,2,0,1

95,Teacher,The Lunar Orbiter,,,110.4,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher, Right,,,110.4,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher, It says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher,And it also does say in here in the third paragraph,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher, I'm and I see where Farrah could have got her answer,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Farrah,"Yeah, yeah, that's where I got mine from",,,310.1,response,2,0,1
95,Teacher,Right,,,420.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher, You're looking for the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,420.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher, But if you go back and you reread the question again and you take out your highlighters and you go slowly,,,420.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Farrah,"Oh, and so like discover is not the same thing as as like to look at it",,,420.1,response,2,0,1
95,Teacher,Right to discover is to look for,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher,"To look at something, but to discover you're going to, you know, look for",,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher,"So that's what they use to discover the moon, the water on the Moon was the Lunar Orbiter",,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher,Okay,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher, Does anyone have any questions,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Chris,"Okay, I guess it's not a question",,,150.1,response,2,0,1
95,Chris,  So I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,2,0,1
95,Chris,But I went to NASA,,,,response,2,0,1
95,Teacher,You're exactly right,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher," And it also says in the second paragraph, um, that they do, they could not breathe oxygen",,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher, So they do use those suits and they do use oxygen tanks when they're up on the moon and when they're in space,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher, So thank you for that added comment,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher,"Yeah, you're exactly right here",,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
95,Chris,"Okay, so I'm reading it now",,,110.2,response,2,0,1
95,Chris," So how can that be the right one, because they don't have discover in this one",,,110.2,response,2,0,1
95,Chris, And the other thing I guess is that I don't see them talking about water in the paragraph about the Lunar Orbiter,,,110.2,response,2,0,1
95,Chris," Oh, I do see look for ice",,,110.2,response,2,0,1
95,Teacher,And looking for and discovering,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher,So in the second paragraph,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher, It's called water is a valuable resource,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher, If you look at the heading on,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher,So it's talking about the water in space,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher,  And what a valuable resource it is,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
95,Chris,Okay,,,210.4,response,2,0,1
95,Chris," And so I missed, I missed that one in paragraph two,",,,,response,2,0,1
95,Chris,So me and Farrah thought discover and looking at where it's the same thing,,,,response,2,0,1
95,Chris, And now okay yeah and I forgot to discover means to look for something,,,,response,2,0,1
95,Teacher, You take a holiday you highlight important facts when you go to your question you highlight important words in your question,,,510.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher,Make sure when you're reading the passage,,,510.1,remark,2,0,1
95,Teacher, So you can go back and you can try to find that in the passage,,,510.1,remark,2,0,1

96,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,1,1,2
96,Luis,"I, I, I really know",,,,response,1,1,2
96,Luis, So I don't think I should be in this group,,,,response,1,1,2
96,Luis," Like, I don't think I need any help with this because I know like everything there is to know about space",,,,response,1,1,2
96,Teacher,So tell us something that you learned from reading the text what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
96,Luis,"Wow, like, okay, so they use, like all kinds of equipment like they had to use like space suits and they had to use like, you know, all the stuff that astronauts have to use right",,,120.3,response,1,1,2
96,Teacher,but helping reading the text and finding the evidence within the text can help you learn specific answers to the question like what specific equipment was used and how the scientists use that equipment to find water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
96,Teacher,Correct,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
96,Teacher,So it can deeper deepen your understanding about space,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2

96,Jazmin," And particularly, I wanted to thank you for correcting me to look more closely at the work and really valuing the thinking that I was because I was thinking about it, but I guess I didn't really realize how much was the complete answer that you really like helped me to see like how to look to see the text and how to really get a more complete answer",,,310.1,response,2,1,2
96,Jazmin, That was really cool,,,310.1,response,2,1,2
96,Jazmin,"Gotcha, well we have to go to Lunch",,,310.1,response,2,1,2
96,Luis, So thank you so much,,,,response,2,1,2
96,Luis,"Are yeah and I really appreciate that, that you're so interested in my stories about like my dad and space and all that stuff",,,,response,2,1,2
96,Bennett, So how did that feel,,,,,2,1,2
96,Bennett,Welcome back,,,,,2,1,2
96,Teacher,Hello,,,,remark,0,1,2
96,Oliver,How are you today,,,,response,0,1,2
96,Teacher,"Good, how are you",,,,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,"Yes, Luis?",,,,remark,0,1,2
96,Luis,"Um, okay",,,,response,0,1,2
96,Luis," Like, I know all sorts of stuff about space already",,,,response,0,1,2
96,Luis," So here's the thing, like, um, so I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,2
96,Luis, So I don't think I need to be in this group,,,,response,0,1,2
96,Teacher, Okay,,,,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,I bet you do,,,,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher, Luis said the small group purpose is to dig a little deeper and get a better understanding of the texts that we're reading,,,,remark,0,1,2
96,Luis,Okay,,,,response,0,1,2
96,Teacher,So your answer to the question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher, But if you can go back and read the text,,,,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher," Can you find the specific piece of equipment that was mentioned in the text, or how scientists found water on the moon",,,,remark,0,1,2
96,Luis,"Um, so maybe I didn't really, um, look at the text, I kind of just knew that",,,,response,0,1,2
96,Teacher,"Yeah, so, um, that's great that you knew, but it's always good to completely read everything that's in the text as well to gain a deeper understanding in that way you can answer the question a little more specifically",,,,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,As far as what type of equipment did scientists used to discover the water on the moon,,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher, So it's always very important to read everything in the text before answering the question,,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher, It has a specific name,,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher, Okay,,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
96,Luis,Okay,,,420.3,response,0,1,2
96,Teacher,"So,",,,,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,Can you elaborate a little more on your answer for what equipment did scientist used to discover water on the moon,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
96,Oliver, So I circled the same things as Farrah,,,230.1,response,0,1,2
96,Oliver,"Um, yeah, I can totally do that",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
96,Oliver,"And I said, in paragraph three that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,1,2
96,Teacher," So can you reread paragraph two, and see if you can find a little bit more information there that will answer the question a little better?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,"Okay, so if you can go  back and let's look at paragraph number two, it specifically talks about the exact equipment that the scientist used to investigate and find the water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
96,Oliver,"Um, I'm not sure",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
96,Teacher,"Let's look at paragraph number two, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher, These ice deposits are very small,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher, The lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,"And then it goes on in paragraph three, to talk about how you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher, Okay,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,"So a scientific tool called the microscope is a correct answer for looking at the water, but to actually just for the scientists to actually discover water on the moon, as it says in paragraph to the machine was called a lunar orbiter",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher, You can also underline important information that will help you answer questions after you are finished,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,So as you're reading and answering your questions always look back in the text,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,"And I notice Jazmin said that NASA sent a small machine so Jazmin, can you look back in the text and recall what was the name of that small machine that NASA sent?",,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
96,Jazmin,I can do that,,,230.2,response,0,1,2
96,Jazmin," I guess what I saw, so NASA it's in paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbitor to investigate",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
96,Jazmin," So I guess it's the lunar orbiter, right?",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
96,Teacher," And Nice job, looking back at the text",,,310.1,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,Exactly,,,310.1,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher, Very good,,,310.1,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,0,1,2
96,Farrah, But what equipment Chris did they use to find the water on the moon in the craters?,,,,response,0,1,2
96,Farrah, And they did find that on the moon,,,,response,0,1,2
96,Farrah,And I see that Chris answered that scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,,response,0,1,2
96,Chris," Like, so I went to NASA with my dad",,,,response,0,1,2
96,Chris,"Well, so that's kind of interesting",,,,response,0,1,2
96,Chris, So s that the answer?,,,,response,0,1,2
96,Chris,Like so,,,,response,0,1,2
96,Chris," Yeah, it was really awesome and like when we went there, like they talked about how like that astronauts had to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that stuff",,,,response,0,1,2
96,Teacher,They used that equipment to keep themselves safe in space,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher, But the question for discussion is what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,So they wouldn't exactly be using their tanks and their masks to find the water on the moon,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher," That's just part of their, their work uniform and protective clothing",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher, So look back in the text and you can kind of scan over it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,"Which is very important, but the discussion question where you're trying to answer is the equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher, So what was the name of the small machine that NASA sent to investigate?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,And we were looking at paragraph two moment ago to specifically answer that question,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
96,Chris,"Well, I guess based on like Jazmin's I guess the Lunar Orbiter",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
96,Teacher, That is correct,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,Lunar orbiter,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
96,Farrah,I have a question,,,110.1,response,0,1,2

96,Farrah," Um, can you help me understand why my answer's not correct",,,,response,0,1,2
96,Teacher,"Okay, who is speaking right now cuz I didn't see a hand go up",,,,remark,0,1,2
96,Farrah,"Um, it's Farrah",,,,response,0,1,2
96,Teacher," OK, so maybe Farrah your answer is correct",,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,Farrah,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,Scientists did use a microscope to look at the water that they found,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher," The question was, how did they discover the water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher," So the microscope was looking at actual droplets of water after it was, the water was discovered",,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher, But the question was asking what was used to discover the water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
96,Teacher,That make sense?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
96,Farrah,"Oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
96,Teacher,Great,,,110.3,remark,0,1,2

97,Jazmin,"Well, um, it says that there's water on the moon",,,120.2,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Okay, so how could that be valuable for the astronauts",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher," So, for example, right now, okay, say there's no there's no water on the moon, right?",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,So what,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"So there's no water on the moon, then what are they in order for astronauts to go to the moon and have water, what do they need to do?",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Jazmin, They'd have to bring their own water,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
97,Jazmin,If there's no water in the mud in order for them to go to the moon,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,Bring their own right?,,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"In paragraph four, what does it talk about when regarding water?",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Jazmin," See, that's where I got my",,,210.4,response,2,1,2
97,Jazmin, I mean when we say it can be useful in lots of ways,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
97,Jazmin, Yes,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
97,Jazmin,Water on the moon can be valuable,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
97,Jazmin," For example, future astronauts could drink this water",,,210.4,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Keep reading, what does the next one say?",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
97,Jazmin, It takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things,,,120.3,response,2,1,2
97,Jazmin,"Okay, I'm water is heavy",,,120.3,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,All right,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, So why is it valuable to find water on the moon?,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Jazmin,Because it would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things,,,120.1,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Well, and it's also what does it say what does it say about the weight of water",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Jazmin,It says that water is heavy,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
97,Jazmin," You know, I also know you can use water to grow things so we can have like a moon garden on the on the moon",,,210.4,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,You like the martian?,,,140.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Jazmin,I like that movie,,,140.1,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"So, all right",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, So what do you think you can do to add to your answer,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Yeah, it's a good movie",,,140.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Jazmin," You can't survive without water, having water on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft, water is heavy",,,140.1,response,2,1,2
97,Jazmin, So I can say I should ask and drink the water,,,140.1,response,2,1,2
97,Jazmin,"Um, okay",,,140.1,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,How could that be beneficial how could that be valuable,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, So it's good,,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, Let's go to Chris's answer okay there's you said water is heavy,,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Okay, so let's speaking of waters heavy",,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, They don't have to carry it,,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Chris,"So if, if you don't have to carry the water, then you could have room on the ship for some other stuff that you wanted to carry",,,210.2,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Okay, do you think, do you think take off for a spaceship could be easier without the weight of the water",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
97,Chris, So,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
97,Chris,"Well, I know that like weight matters because like when we get on the airplane, you know, they weigh our suitcases",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
97,Chris," And so, um, but I know that rocket ships go out into space and there isn't any arm gravity in space",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher, Right,,,210.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Well, but to get to get out of the Earth's atmosphere",,,210.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher," Okay, takes a lot of force",,,210.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, Correct,,,210.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,So if your rocket doesn't weigh as much and it'll probably be a little easier for the rocket to get into outer space,,,210.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Chris,Yeah yeah yeah yeah,,,210.1,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,Yeah,,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher," Alright, so there's that",,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher," That's a, that's a good valuable reason to have water on the moon",,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Okay, so let's look at Oliver",,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Okay, your answer, no",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, It's not ready yet,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Chris,"Sorry Teacher I just, I just thought of one more thing",,,110.1,response,2,1,2
97,Chris,"Yes, that I had read also that water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen",,,,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Right, yeah",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, It can be,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, Will you explain your answer for me?,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,Alright so Oliver,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Oliver, Yeah,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
97,Oliver,"Yeah, sure",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
97,Oliver, So it doesn't look like they're ready to pick up any of the water from the moon,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
97,Oliver," Last paragraph, they talking about how hard it will be and how it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
97,Oliver, It's not ready yet because,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
97,Oliver," Okay, so, um, I said no",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,Okay,,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, Does that answer the question,,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,Right,,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, So how does your answer,,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher," The question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon to be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,What is the question,,,120.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, Right,,,120.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, Show me evidence of water being valuable,,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Oliver,"Well, I said no, there isn't any evidence because they haven't been able to get to the moon to find evidence because it's gonna take a lot of time and money",,,120.2,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,Hold on you just said they haven't been to the moon yet?,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
97,Oliver,I don't think so,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Well, what is what is, what is the section to say, paragraph two,",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Oliver,"Oh yeah, we talked about the the lunar orbiter all yeah cuz they sent the machine there",,,210.4,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,So they have been there right so they have been there and they have found evidence of water,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,That's what it says in verse in section two,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Oliver," Like, like, I remember",,,210.4,response,2,1,2
97,Oliver,Right,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
97,Oliver, Okay,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Oh, we already had the evidence of water",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"and Farrah, you can help out too",,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Now, what kind of value, why would that be valuable",,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Farrah,Okay,,,210.2,response,2,1,2
97,Farrah,"Okay, why would it be valuable",,,,response,2,1,2
97,Farrah,"Okay, okay, in paragraph five, it says moon water",,,,response,2,1,2
97,Farrah, It could be useful and other ways or it can be broken down into two parts,,,,response,2,1,2
97,Chris,RER: That's what I said hydrogen and oxygen,,,,response,2,1,2
97,Oliver,And oh okay astronauts could breathe oxygen,,,,response,2,1,2
97,Oliver," But that's not water, that's oxygen",,,,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Oh, but it says that water is broken down into two parts",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Farrah,Yeah,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
97,Farrah,So they could breathe the oxygen part of the water,,,,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,What else does it say the oxygen and hydrogen could be used as?,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Luis What else is to say that oxygen, hydrogen could be used as",,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Luis,It sounds like that could be used as rocket fuel,,,130.2,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, So how would that be a valuable resource to have,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
97,Luis,"Well, I mean like if I needed fuel to get back home and they could like make the fuel I guess on the moon and have it be like a gas station so they could fly back home",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Okay, so then that means that they have less gas when they start right when they take off from Earth",,,210.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"Go ahead, Jazmin",,,,remark,2,1,2
97,Jazmin, Then they have their lighter and they can go faster,,,,response,2,1,2
97,Jazmin," Well, it's better to be light, so if they have less gas when they take off",,,,response,2,1,2
97,Jazmin,"Cuz, cuz you were telling Chris that if it's too heavy",,,,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher, Okay,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, So what are some benefits and valuable,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, Let's recap,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, Why is it valuable to have water,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, And it's a lot easier to get out into space,,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, So let's recap,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,Right,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,There you go,,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
97,Chris,You can break it up into two parts hydrogen and oxygen,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
97,Oliver,We can breathe oxygen,,,110.1,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,2
97,Luis,And and we can make they can make rocket fuel with it,,,,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher,"What else, what are some other benefits",,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,You can grow a garden on the moon with it with the water too,,,,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher, Okay,,,110.2,remark,2,1,2

97,Teacher, Yes,,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
97,Farrah,I don't remember,,,110.2,response,2,1,2
97,Farrah," The other thing it was the thing that you said Jazmin it's it's it if you if you can get water up there, then you don't have to take it with you, I guess",,,110.2,response,2,1,2
97,Teacher, And so what is,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher," I mean, what is water essential for",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
97,Teacher,Okay,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
97,Farrah,To drink or bath,,,210.3,response,2,1,2

97,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher, Luis?,,,,remark,0,1,2
97,Luis, So we all looked at that question,,,,response,0,1,2
97,Luis," Like, I don't think I need to be in this group because like I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Luis," So I don't like I don't need to, like, be like, learn more",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Luis, But here's the thing,,,,response,0,1,2
97,Luis, And so we shared our answers,,,,response,0,1,2
97,Luis, I already know about it,,,,response,0,1,2
97,Luis,"Oh, yeah",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Teacher, What do you think the question is asking you,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"Okay, that's great",,,230.1,remark,0,1,2

97,Luis,"Wow, okay",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
97,Luis," So, ah, the question is what equipment did like scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"Okay, and what was your answer",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
97,Luis,"So I said, like they need like all the oxygen tanks and they like you know they need, like, all that stuff that like astronauts used to like go fly around in space",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"Okay, well, did you read the the article that was with the question",,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
97,Luis,Maybe I didn't really read it,,,210.3,response,0,1,2

97,Teacher, Keep reading,,,,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher,Keep going,,,,remark,0,1,2
97,Luis,"Okay, this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for deposits in a large polar crater",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Luis, That's just like four glasses of water,,,,response,0,1,2
97,Luis,"These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"And again, Luis, what was the question",,,120.1,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher,OK you can stop you can stop now,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher," Okay, so the first sentence that you read was NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
97,Luis,"Um, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"Okay, so from the article what equipment did, did the scientists use to discover water",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
97,Luis,"Um, like Jazmin's answer the small machine",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
97,Jazmin,"Okay, and Jazmin, what was the small machine called",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
97,Jazmin,"Ok, so after we just read it, the small machine is called a lunar orbiter",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"Great, great, great answer",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher, So Luis Do you think from your question from your answer to your question that you think that you needed to revise that question or the answer?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
97,Luis," I think I understand, like, why that's that might be a better answer",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
97,Luis," So yeah, I think that I see",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
97,Luis,"Yeah, I didn't really read it the first time",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
97,Teacher, Farrah?,,,,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher, I'm happy that we got that resolved,,,,remark,0,1,2

97,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,1,2
97,Farrah," Okay, so, like, um, I didn't understand, like, maybe you can help me understand like why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Farrah,Yes,,,,response,0,1,2
97,Teacher," Um, what, will you read your answer to me, please",,,,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"Okay, well let's look at your answer",,,,remark,0,1,2
97,Farrah,"Okay, so my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to investigate",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"Okay, what is the question asking us",,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
97,Farrah,"the question sayas, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,210.3,response,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"Okay, and what equipment from the article that you read and the Luis just read and in paragraph two, what did the article, what did the scientists use to find water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher,Water on the moon,,,,remark,0,1,2
97,Farrah,I guess like Luis and Jazmin's answer was the Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,0,1,2
97,Farrah,"But like is like microscope, is that equipment too? Did they discover it with the microscope?",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"Well microscope is definitely equipment, but it's not used in space, like, because we",,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher," We used the Lunar Orbiter, which was able to be controlled from, you know, from the earth",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher," And we didn't use a microscope to go and look for, you know, water on the moon",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"microscopes are used for to find tiny, tiny organisms underneath right to magnify it to make it bigger",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
97,Farrah, I see,,,130.3,response,0,1,2
97,Farrah,"Oh, OK",,,130.3,response,0,1,2
97,Farrah,So they discovered it?,,,,response,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"Microscope, microscope",,,,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"Exactly, yes",,,,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher, I have a question for you,,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"Now, Oliver",,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher, You said I circled the same as Farrah,,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher, Did you actually read the article?,,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
97,Oliver,"Um, I did read the article, and I did circle the same thing though, like a section in paragraph three about like you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, but I heard what Farrah was saying about and why you're saying like the dhe difference between like like looking at something and finding or discovering it",,,210.3,response,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"Right, and so they use the Lunar Orbiter to discover the water",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher, Now they use the microscope to look at the microscopic organisms that were found inside of the water,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"You know, microscopic meaning small tiny right so in order to to look at that in a larger sense they use the microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher," In this case, the machine they're using is a lunar orbiter",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher, Okay,,,410.2,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"The thing that troubles me with your answer is that you said the same ias Farrah, which shows me that you didn't that you're either looking at Farrah's paper or you didn't have your own idea",,,410.2,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher, And so that's why I need you to to write your own thoughts and think for yourself,,,410.2,remark,0,1,2
97,Oliver,Okay,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
97,Teacher,And so in this case case,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2

97,Chris," So like, like, here's the thing, like I went to NASA with my dad",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Chris," And like I know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and like, stuff like that",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Chris, So like is that possibly an answer?,,,,response,0,1,2
97,Chris,I went to NASA with my dad,,,,response,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"Well, they use oxygen tanks and that they need oxygen in space",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher," The question states or asks you what equipment, equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher,"However, that's not the question here is, and if you read the question",,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher, Right,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher, We're looking for this specific one,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher, And so we're not looking for just any scientific equipment that it's used out in space,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher," This article says discovered the water on the moon, which in this case like Luis and Jazmin had said, is the Lunar Orbiter",,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher, The key phrase there,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher,The key word discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
97,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,0,1,2
97,Luis,"Um, yeah, so",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Luis,Basically okay so,,,,response,0,1,2
97,Luis,"I just, we have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to like",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Luis," Like for working with us today and like, like I wanted to thank you for like helping us to listen to each other like sometimes we kind of don't like listen to each other very well and we kind of make like our science teacher gets kind of frustrated but you are really patient",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Luis,Thank you real quick,,,,response,0,1,2
97,Luis," So, like, just wanted to thank you for like doing that and like taking that time for us to do that",,,,response,0,1,2
97,Luis, And that was pretty cool,,,,response,0,1,2

98,Teacher,"That's good, but you can still remain in the group to help the others",,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher," Okay, so you have attempted to answer the question, which is good",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,"So that's, that's good to know",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Okay,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,So I want to just say thank you so much for the answers that you have given and I'm here to just try to clarify the answer that you have and to see how best we can work around to arrive at a more suitable answer,,,220.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Okay,,,220.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Right,,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher," So the question is, what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,All right now,,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,Now one of the strategies that we were going to use today is to look at some key words that we have in our question,,,510.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Okay,,,510.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,Now I want to go back and just look at the question one more time,,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, And I wanted to read it and see if you're fully understand it words that you don't understand,,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, I wanted to circle those words for me,,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,So wanted to take just a minute to do that,,,,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,So go ahead and circle the words that you're not sure you know the meaning off,,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Yes,,,120.4,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Luis,,,120.4,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,"Okay, okay",,,120.4,remark,1,1,1

98,Teacher, What words did you choose what words from the question,,,120.4,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Did you circle,,,120.4,remark,1,1,1
98,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,120.4,response,1,1,1
98,Luis," So I guess I was wondering, like, I think I know the words, but I was wondering about like discover",,,120.4,response,1,1,1
98,Teacher, The word this cover,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher," Okay, let me hear some other ideas",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1

98,Teacher, What word did you choose Oliver?,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Oliver,so what I chose,,,110.1,response,1,1,1
98,Oliver, What was that it was the microscope,,,110.1,response,1,1,1
98,Oliver," I think I know the words, but I was wondering about equipment because I basically said the same thing as Farrah",,,110.1,response,1,1,1
98,Teacher, And what about you,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Farrah,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1

98,Teacher," All right, now and Chris, the you know the defining the words that you're not sure of",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Chris, So I think I know the words pretty well,,,110.1,response,1,1,1
98,Chris,Not like I really love space and my dad has taken me to NASA before,,,110.1,response,1,1,1
98,Teacher,"All right, very good",,,130.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, I'm going to give you about 30 seconds to do that,,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,and I want you to look at those words again and share your ideas of what you think those words mean,,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher," So I want you to talk to each other in your groups and I'm going to ask Chris Jazmin and Luis to be in one group and Oliver and Farrah,",,,130.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher," Okay, so go ahead and do that for me",,,420.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Oliver,So Farrah,,,420.1,response,1,1,1
98,Oliver, I think that basically you know that we like equipment is like the tool or something that you use,,,420.1,response,1,1,1
98,Teacher, So he was at all,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher," Okay, very good",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1

98,Teacher, Did you discuss,,,120.4,remark,1,1,1
98,Jazmin,"So basically we said like, what was that we talked about the different machines that people would say, okay, people would use",,,120.4,response,1,1,1
98,Jazmin,"And so I was wondering, cuz I was like confused why my answer was wrong",,,,response,1,1,1
98,Teacher, So what is an equipment we say it's a?,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,let us look back at the words,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, So we talk about discover and we talk about equipment,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher," But let's let's before we go into that,",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Right,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Okay,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher," Um, so, so you had selected a machine a small machine",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,Okay,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,It's a tool right,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,"And Jazmin, you rightly said that it's a machine",,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Now what about the word discover,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,Very good,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,You know what the word discover means? Yes Oliver?,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Oliver,And discover is like when you find something,,,210.2,response,1,1,1
98,Teacher,Very good,,,110.4,remark,1,1,1
98,Oliver,"Like, like, yeah, when you find it",,,110.4,response,1,1,1
98,Teacher," So what we're looking for, then, is a tool that was actually used to find the water right?",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Right,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,"now I'm Jazmin, you said microscope",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,Right,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,"Sorry, I'm Farrah, you said microscope",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Right,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
98,Chris, Right,,,110.1,response,1,1,1
98,Chris,I also said microscope,,,110.1,response,1,1,1
98,Chris, Yeah,,,110.1,response,1,1,1
98,Teacher,And those are tools right,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,"now, I want you to, yes Chris?",,,,remark,1,1,1
98,Chris, And I saw that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that,,,,response,1,1,1
98,Chris,"Um, well, I was just thinking that some other tools were like, because I went to NASA",,,,response,1,1,1
98,Chris, So did they use those things?,,,,response,1,1,1
98,Teacher,Or they probably did,,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Right,,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, But for the sake of this question and the passage that we're looking at,,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, We are going to actually identify the answer from the passage,,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Okay,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, And the question is asking you to identify the equipment that they used to discover,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,"Okay, great",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Or we could say the tool that they use to find the water,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Right,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, So you said discover means to find right and equipment means a tool,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, So what words are we going to look back in the passage for? we're going to look for water,,,420.3,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,So what we want to do now is to go back to the passage take a closer look at the passage and see if you can identify where the words equipment discover as it relates to finding the water,,,420.3,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,And we are going to look back for the tool as a machine that was used,,,420.3,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher," Okay, so I want you to go back in the groups that you were take a closer look at the passage and see if you can find out where machine was mentioned where water was mentioned and where the word discover was mentioned",,,420.3,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,"Or we could say, look at the word investigating this case",,,420.3,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher," Alright, so go back in the passage and look for me",,,420.3,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,"Okay, now did you find the word machine",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,"Okay, can you read the sentence at the word machine comes in Farrah",,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
98,Farrah,"Oh yeah, I can do that",,,120.3,response,1,1,1
98,Farrah,"Okay, so basically it's NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,,response,1,1,1
98,Teacher,"All right, very good now",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, What we're looking for is the machine actually or the tool that was used to find the water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, So the word machine is in that sentence right now,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher, Now what tool is mentioned in that sentence,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
98,Farrah,The Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,response,1,1,1
98,Teacher,"Very good, and which word in that sentence sentence tells us that they actually find the water",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
98,Teacher,Yes Oliver,,,,remark,1,1,1
98,Oliver, So we have to run really quick,,,,response,1,1,1
98,Oliver,"Um, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but I think that will have a chance to see you after lunch",,,,response,1,1,1
98,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,1,1
98,Jazmin,"Hey, can you see us?",,,,response,2,1,1
98,Teacher,I'm not seeing you,,,,remark,2,1,1
98,Jazmin,You might have to close the Zoom window,,,,response,2,1,1
98,Jazmin, Or maybe move your Internet browser out of the way,,,,response,2,1,1
98,Jazmin,Or move it out of the way,,,,response,2,1,1
98,Teacher,"Okay, here we go",,,,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher," Now, I must say",,,,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher,You're doing a great job you're doing a fantastic job so far,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher,And so we had left of where we were trying to actually locate the answer from the passage,,,220.1,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher, Yes,,,220.1,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher, Okay,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher, So we are going to just briefly recap that we were looking at the word,,,220.1,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher, Luis,,,220.1,remark,2,1,1
98,Luis, My dad is an astronaut,,,220.1,response,2,1,1
98,Luis, So I just wanted to say,,,220.1,response,2,1,1
98,Luis, So I think that could be kind of helpful,,,220.1,response,2,1,1
98,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,220.1,response,2,1,1
98,Teacher,"Oh yeah, okay",,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher, What does the word discover means,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher," It could be, but we were on the right path as well and I fantastic job that you're doing",,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher,"Okay, now we were looking at the word discover right and we said the word is",,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,2,1,1
98,Jazmin,"So discover means like to find something or to, you know, investigate like the way that NASA use the small machine to get to the water",,,,response,2,1,1
98,Teacher, And what machine,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher,Right,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher, Did we identify that was used,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Jazmin,It was the lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,2,1,1
98,Teacher, And there was another word in that sentence that you've read that also has to that will give us a clue of the word discover,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher,Very good,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher, Do you know what that word is?,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher,When we discover when you discover what are you actually doing,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Jazmin,You find something?,,,210.4,response,2,1,1
98,Teacher,You're finding,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher, What must you do,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher, But in order to find it,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Jazmin,RER: Look for it?,,,210.4,response,2,1,1
98,Teacher,There's a word in the sentence,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher, Can you can you go back to that sentence for me the sentence that talked about the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher,Is another word in that sentence that helps us to know that we actually are discovering something,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher, So what do you have to do to discover,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher, Look at that sentence for me,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Jazmin,RER: Is it investigate?,,,210.4,response,2,1,1
98,Teacher,"Very good, very good",,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher,So the word investigate means that in order to find something you have to investigate,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher, Okay,,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher, Jazmin so investigate,,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher, Okay,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher,"Okay, now we can go to the other question",,,,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher,And as we said the word discover means to find so yes truth,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher,The truth is that the lunar orbiter is what was used to actually find water,,,130.3,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher," Yes, Oliver?",,,,remark,2,1,1
98,Teacher,"Now the other question is, is there convinced",,,,remark,2,1,1
98,Oliver, We have to go to lunch,,,,response,2,1,1
98,Oliver," But before we go, I just wanted to say thank you so much for working with us",,,,response,2,1,1
98,Oliver,"I'm actually, I'm sorry",,,,response,2,1,1
98,Oliver," And what was really special when you are working with us is that you really help us to understand the meaning of the word discover because we didn't totally understand when we started, but now we all know what discover meets and not just that",,,,response,2,1,1
98,Oliver,But you helped us use evidence from the text you made sure that we were using information from the text and not just stuff that we knew from like our background,,,,response,2,1,1
98,Oliver, So that was really awesome,,,,response,2,1,1
98,Oliver, Thank you so much for working with us,,,,response,2,1,1

98,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,1,1
98,Luis," Okay, so I don't know if like I should really be in this group, because I know like all about space and like I know all this stuff",,,,response,0,1,1
98,Teacher," I mean, we learn from each other has been going on",,,110.3,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher, Right,,,110.3,remark,0,1,1

98,Teacher," The question is,",,,,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher,What took equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher,"Now, um, let me see those really understood what you read",,,,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher,Did you understand the passage?,,,,remark,0,1,1

98,Teacher, So what are we going to do,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher, We're going to go back to the passage and we are going to look for the Oliverice or the equipment,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher,Discover means to find something right,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher,"And yes, dear? Yes, Farrah?",,,,remark,0,1,1
98,Farrah,"Um, I think that I think that you were just about to say this, but I am not quite sure why",,,,response,0,1,1
98,Farrah, Maybe it's serious wrong because I think it's the microscope,,,,response,0,1,1
98,Teacher,You think it's a microscope,,,230.3,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher, Now what did they say the microscope was used for,,,230.1,remark,0,1,1

98,Teacher, Yes,,,230.1,remark,0,1,1
98,Farrah, You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,230.1,response,0,1,1
98,Farrah,"Okay, so, um, let's see, in paragraph three, they said the water they found is microscopic me wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it",,,230.1,response,0,1,1
98,Teacher," Um, but you said that the water they found right",,,230.3,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher,Okay,,,230.3,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher,Does that mean they already find the water?,,,210.3,remark,0,1,1
98,Farrah,"Oh, you mean---",,,210.3,response,0,1,1
98,Teacher,"Can you think of,",,,,remark,0,1,1

98,Teacher,Exactly right,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher," So the question I asked you, what did they used to look at it, or what do they use to find it?",,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
98,Oliver,"they said, what did they use to find it",,,210.2,response,0,1,1
98,Teacher,"Exactly, so not what they used to look at it",,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher, So I wanted to go back,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher, Is there anybody else who wants to share on that and that issue,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher," Yes, Jazmin?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher,"All right, go back and look again and see if there's something another Oliverice or another equipment that was mentioned",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
98,Jazmin,"I realized that based on what they're saying, the small machine, I think was the thing that I think this small machine is what found that water",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
98,Teacher,"Right, so can you go back and look if there's another machine or equipment that was mentioned in the passage?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
98,Jazmin,"In paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
98,Teacher,"Exactly to investigate, investigate means what",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
98,Jazmin,Look for?,,,210.4,response,0,1,1
98,Teacher,"Right, Jazmin means to look for, right, or to discover as as the question asked you,",,,110.4,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher," Yes, Chris?",,,110.4,remark,0,1,1
98,Chris,"Um, yeah, I was just kind of wondering like, so I went to NASA with my dad and we had a chance to like look at all the displays all the rockets and stuff",,,110.4,response,0,1,1
98,Chris,So like I know that scientists like have to use lots of equipment but but I was thinking that they used equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that,,,,response,0,1,1
98,Teacher," Right, Chris?",,,210.1,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher, Right? But a question actually relates to the passage,,,210.1,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher,Right,,,210.1,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher, They use different equipment,,,210.1,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher, So what we want to do is to find the equipment that was mentioned in the passage,,,210.1,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher," Right? But remember, you're looking at the the passage",,,210.1,remark,0,1,1
98,Chris,--,,,,response,0,1,1
98,Chris,"Yeah, yeah--",,,,response,0,1,1
98,Chris,Oh,,,,response,0,1,1
98,Teacher,Good,,,,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher," So can you think of, I can you see another equipment that was mentioned in the passage, apart from the microscope",,,410.1,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher,So we are looking for the one that was used to discover or to find,,,410.1,remark,0,1,1
98,Chris,"Yeah, the lunar orbiter",,,410.1,response,0,1,1
98,Teacher,Very good,,,,remark,0,1,1

98,Teacher,"Even had some experience, Chris had some experiences",,,420.3,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher, But you remember you're looking for the answer that's relating to the passage,,,420.3,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher," Yes, that's good to use your experiences",,,420.3,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher," Yes, Jazmin",,,420.3,remark,0,1,1

98,Jazmin,I really wanted to thank you for like you were so patient with us,,,,response,0,1,1
98,Jazmin, Like sometimes we can frustrate our science teacher and you were so patient and,,,,response,0,1,1
98,Jazmin," And also, you were really careful about like",,,,response,0,1,1
98,Jazmin," And that was really cool cuz, cuz that doesn't always happen",,,,response,0,1,1
98,Jazmin,You help us to really listen to each other and like help build our answers like off one another,,,,response,0,1,1
98,Jazmin, So you really helped us to read carefully,,,,response,0,1,1
98,Jazmin, I just want to thank you,,,,response,0,1,1
98,Jazmin,"The answer to the question and like helping us break down the words to be honestly, sometimes we don't read as carefully as we could",,,,response,0,1,1
98,Teacher,"Oh, you're welcome",,,,remark,0,1,1
98,Teacher, That's very good,,,,remark,0,1,1

99,Luis,"Oh, hi",,,,response,1,1,3
99,Teacher,"Well, Luis I'm glad you are a part of this group, maybe you can share with us some of your",,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,Knowledge and help us expand our learning on space,,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
99,Luis,I can do that,,,110.3,response,1,1,3
99,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher, I asked you to,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,and then Chris,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher, Did you go back and look through your textbook,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,"Now, Farrah and Deb, you obviously have the same idea",,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,So I just reviewed your answers for what told it scientists use to find locate water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
99,Chris," So I'm going to guess that I didn't, you were saying, I didn't answer the question, right, because the question was, how did the scientists what equipment",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
99,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
99,Chris," Right, right",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
99,Chris, Did the scientists use to discover water and I just was talking about the creative,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
99,Chris," So I did a look, I think",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
99,Teacher,Okay,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,Jazmin refresh my memory,,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher, What was your answer,,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
99,Jazmin,To be connected with that they use a small machine,,,120.4,response,1,1,3
99,Teacher, That's right,,,110.2,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,A small machine,,,110.2,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,"Okay, sir",,,,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,Our high quality answer can be found in the text,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher," Yes, Jazmin well",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
99,Jazmin, Ever since you were,,,150.1,response,1,1,3
99,Jazmin," We were talking, I was just wonder, like, I guess",,,150.1,response,1,1,3
99,Jazmin,I guess,,,150.1,response,1,1,3
99,Jazmin," Still not sure like my, my answer",,,150.1,response,1,1,3
99,Teacher, Alright,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher, So my concern is while you guys use your text to answer the question,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,but we're going to focus on a elaborating our answers,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,"Your answer wasn't wrong they did use this question,",,,110.2,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher," Okay, okay, okay",,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,I will have more,,,,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,"OK, I will",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher, So the first part is I want you to take your pencil or your tablet pin and let's reread the part of the text where it describes the type of machine that was used,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher, Let's take our little answer and make it a great big answer to make it make more sense to make it concrete,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,Okay,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher, What is the actual equipment called,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,"Okay, not just a microscope",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,Use your context,,,510.1,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,"Okay, you got it",,,,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,"Okay, so let's read straight from the text",,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher, Farrah,,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher, Let's go,,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
99,Farrah,"Um, okay",,,120.3,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah, So should I should do the part that I circled,,,120.3,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah," Okay, basically",,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah,Yes,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah," So, okay, what I was circling was I still stuck on the microscope and i can i can tell you why I said it like because it says it's a scientific to exit and then I circled like",,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah,Small machine because I think that was jazzmines answer,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah,And and it sounds like that might also be it,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah, So it's both the small machine and and the microscope,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah,But I guess I'm thinking that,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah, Okay,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Teacher, What did you circle the,,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,"Okay, it can be at Oliveron",,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
99,,One,,,120.4,,1,1,3
99,Oliver, If you can't see yet,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Oliver," I, I just start called the microscope again because I still think that that was what they used to, you know, to, to discover it like when they were discovering the water like how could they discover it",,,,response,1,1,3
99,Oliver,Pretty much the same thing,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Oliver, And they said that the ice was microscope,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Teacher," Alright, so let's find out",,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,Luis What did you circle,,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,Okay,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
99,Luis,"Um, so I basically when I went in",,,120.4,response,1,1,3
99,Luis, I circle,,,120.4,response,1,1,3
99,Luis,Lunar Orbiter and microscope,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Teacher,So how about let's restating the question to form our answer,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,"Okay, so we're getting there",,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher, The scientists used a tool called the moon,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,The Lunar,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
99,Jazmin,Orbiter,,,130.3,response,1,1,3
99,Jazmin,The Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Teacher,That has a microscope,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,To explore for water on the moon,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher," Yeah, this is really short one word answer we created a whole sentence where anybody reading our answer can identify what we are talking about what we're learning about",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,See how that answer grows,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,"Farrah any you look a little, little stunned",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher, Is there something I can help you with,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
99,Farrah,With you up me,,,150.1,response,1,1,3
99,Teacher,No Farrah,,,,remark,1,1,3
99,Farrah,"Oh, this is Farrah",,,,response,1,1,3
99,Teacher,"Oh, OK",,,,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher, Sorry,,,,remark,1,1,3
99,Farrah," So, um, yeah, basically, I guess",,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah, Sometimes I can have a voice that sounds like the voice,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah,"No, that's okay",,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah,I think I understand,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah, Like we restate the question,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah," So okay, so in the in the question",,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah," It's like scientists use the, you know, a particular equipment to to find the water on the moon",,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah,And,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah," I guess I'm still wondering like,",,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah,I guess so I can understand that,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah,Is,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah,"Like, okay, so it sounds like Jazmin's answer was, was the right answer",,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah,Is is the microscope like,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah,Do we say both of them or do we say like Jazmin,,,,response,1,1,3
99,Teacher,"You say, both of them because the lunar orbiter had the microscope on it",,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
99,Farrah," Okay, gotcha",,,130.3,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah," Okay, interesting way",,,130.3,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah,"Oh, interesting",,,130.3,response,1,1,3
99,Farrah, So like you would say both,,,130.3,response,1,1,3
99,Teacher,To make your answer very clear,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher, And to clarify,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
99,Teacher,Any misconceptions,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
99,Oliver,"Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but thanks so much for working with us",,,420.2,response,1,1,3
99,Oliver, It was really want to work,,,420.2,response,1,1,3
99,Teacher, How was lunch,,,,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,Hi,,,,remark,2,1,3
99,Oliver, THANK YOU,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver,WAS GREAT,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Teacher,"Hi, Luis",,,,remark,2,1,3
99,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Luis, So I just wanted to remind everybody that my dad is actually an astral which is pretty cool,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Teacher,That is cool,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,"Okay, so we were focused on",,,,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,The Lunar Orbiter consent by you remind me what why the lunar rover is so important,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,2,1,3
99,Jazmin, They said that that was it,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Jazmin,"That with the small machine that they use to discover the, you know what I mean",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Jazmin,So I think it's really important that with,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Teacher,That is a very good answer,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher, Thank you,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher, You remember from your text and you're elaborated by restating the question,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher," Chris, did you want to add something",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Chris,"Well, I was gonna say lunar orbiter as well and I changed my because you asked us to look at the text and not like necessarily background",,,310.1,response,2,1,3
99,Chris," Now even though I know that, like they use lots of other stuff",,,310.1,response,2,1,3
99,Chris, So I guess I wasn't quite sure I didn't quite catch Jazmin and but it sounds like it was important to rephrase it,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Chris,It's clear that you know what i mean that the lunar orbiter is is in the text,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Teacher, Yes,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,To restate the question to the form your answer,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,"Okay, great",,,,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,So let's continue Oliver asked me a question about our text,,,,remark,2,1,3
99,Oliver,You want me to ask a question,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver," Um, I guess the question I have is that in the text right they say",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver, So I'm still a little torn about the microscope,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver,About the text,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver," Um, so I guess like one question I have",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver," I guess I'm wondering, like, you know, like how did they find",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver,"Don't in paragraph three, they say the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver,"Um,",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver,"Well, it's kind of confusing as they say like you wouldn't be able to see it unless you are looking straight at it, or even if you were looking straight at it",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver," So, like, what did they use the microscope for",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Teacher,That is a very good question to anyone,,,130.2,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher, Anybody wants to help him out and answer,,,130.2,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher," Why would they put a microscope, along with the Lunar Orbiter",,,130.2,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,2,1,3
99,Farrah, So if they put it on the lunar orbit that they still found it using it sounds like something else,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Farrah,"Well, I think that that's where they said, you know, you have to look really close that catches",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Farrah, They're like they just say it's a lunar orbit,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Farrah, So I think,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Farrah,So they don't say it the texts like if it's if it's true or something,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Farrah,I think that's the best answer because,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Farrah,I think I feel like I'm getting,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Teacher,Your all on top of it,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,"Okay, so from reading the text today and using our tools by going back and rereading the text circling important information, how can this broaden your understanding in the future of any topic that we discuss whether it's space or farming",,,520.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Jazmin,Jazmin,,,520.1,response,2,1,3
99,,Do,,,,,2,1,3
99,Jazmin,You think the state,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Jazmin," But basically, one thing I would say just that",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Jazmin," You have to, you have to find you have to discover it",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Jazmin,To Farrah's queestion they use the Lunar Orbiter to get to the war like you can't find it with the microscope,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Jazmin, So I think what I would use is basically like we have to close it,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Jazmin,"So, and then use the like what we would use like",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Jazmin, And then we have to restate the question which is really hard,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Jazmin," You know,",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Jazmin,Right,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Teacher,Sometimes it is if you listen to the question,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,"Where my concern is, is sometimes you don't listen",,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher, You can just rearrange them to restate the question,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher, The words on your paper or on your iPad,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,So just with write down the question and then use them,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
99,Jazmin,Can you show us,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
99,Teacher,I can,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher, What did you have to offer,,,,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,"Okay, Oliver",,,,remark,2,1,3
99,Oliver,"Um, I don't",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver,I'm not sure,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver, Now I'm really interested in in learning how to do that question,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Teacher,"Oh, to restate the question",,,510.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Oliver,Yeah,,,510.1,response,2,1,3
99,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,"Maybe I can, I might be able to share screen, hold on",,,,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher, Oh,,,,remark,2,1,3
99,Oliver,"Oh, I don't think you can share the screen",,,,response,2,1,3
99,,I,,,,,2,1,3
99,Teacher,I just tried,,,,remark,2,1,3
99,Oliver,Yeah,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Teacher,"So for restating a question you listen carefully for the words being used, such as in our question",,,510.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher, What scientific tool was used to discover water on the moon,,,510.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher," What did science, what tool",,,510.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher, Scientists used the scientific tool called what,,,510.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,So to answer the question using and A race method you restate the question,,,510.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Oliver,"Um, well, it sounds like the lunar orbiter is the right answer",,,510.1,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver, And even if I'm not totally 100% sure why,,,510.1,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver,So you would say scientists use the lunar orbit,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Teacher,To discover water on the moon,,,130.3,remark,2,1,3
99,Oliver, So scientists to the question is like how what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,130.3,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver," Oh, okay, yeah",,,130.3,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver,Scientists use the Lunar Orbiter,,,130.3,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver," And you say, like right back scientists use the Lunar Orbiter to discover water on the moon",,,130.3,response,2,1,3
99,Teacher," Okay, so",,,110.4,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,"There you go, you got it",,,110.4,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,How has learning to restate a question,,,520.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher, How can you use that that knowledge on our next lesson,,,520.1,remark,2,1,3
99,Luis," Well, the first thing I would do is I would restate the question",,,520.1,response,2,1,3
99,Luis," I would say like, okay, so if the question asked this",,,520.1,response,2,1,3
99,Luis, Then I got it,,,520.1,response,2,1,3
99,Luis,It's a good question,,,520.1,response,2,1,3
99,Luis,"I got to answer that question because my response didn't really answer the question I was saying, like, the scientists found craters below water",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Luis, You know what I mean,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Luis,So it didn't really answer what you asked,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Luis," So I guess it might answer can't answer the question, then it's like, Okay, like that's not the answer",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Teacher, That is absolutely correct,,,110.4,remark,2,1,3
99,Teacher,Was that you,,,110.4,remark,2,1,3

99,Oliver,Where we were focused instead,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver,"You know what I mean like you gave us a lot of ways that we could make our answers better like both being more accurate, but then also like",,,,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver, So,,,,response,2,1,3
99,Oliver,"You know, like restating the question that a lot of booze and be found, like just saying the question back because then things make make more sense",,,,response,2,1,3

99,Luis,"It was fun, but I have a question",,,,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher, Luis?,,,,remark,0,1,3
99,Luis,"Um, I don't think that I should be in this group like I already know all about space and like everything there is to know",,,,response,0,1,3
99,Luis, I don't think I need any help,,,,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,"So what was your answer to the question, what tool did the scientists used to discover water on the moon",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
99,Luis,"Well, I was saying that the scientists would have to use like I'm like spacesuits and that they would need like rocket fuel and they would need oxygen and like all that stuff that I already know before like ever doing the reading",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,"Oh, okay",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher," Farrah, what did you, how did you answer the question",,,,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher," So you have some prior knowledge of space travel, right",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher,"Okay, so let's start with Farrah",,,,remark,0,1,3
99,Farrah,"Um, so my answer was that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look closely",,,110.3,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher, Oliver?,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher,That's very good,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
99,Oliver,I answered the same as Farrah,,,110.1,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,"And Chris, how did you enter the question",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
99,Chris," So like I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that kind of stuff, like I already know about all that stuff",,,110.1,response,0,1,3
99,Chris,"So, I went to NASA",,,110.1,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,"Great, okay",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3

99,Teacher,"Okay, great",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher," Okay, so let's reread over the text because Chris and Jazmin are really close to the answer",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher,"I'd like you to reread paragraph two, and see if you pair up together, Chris Jazmin to see if you can find any better information about the tool that scientists scientists use to discover water in the craters",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher,"now, Luis Farrah and Oliver to read paragraph two as well and see what extra equipment or what kinds of equipment could narrow this down",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
99,Farrah,"Okay, we read through it",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
99,Farrah," But, um, I have a question if that's okay",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,1,3
99,Farrah,"So my answer about the microscope, I just, I'm not quite understanding why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher, You're still correct they you will need a microscope,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher, If you want to see the water,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher,It's not wrong,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher,"But what was in paragraph two, in the very first sentence? Let's see if we can find exactly what they used",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,1,3
99,Jazmin,"Okay, so it says, um, it says on paragraph in paragraph two",,,,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,Go ahead,,,,remark,0,1,3
99,Jazmin,It says basically that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher, All right,,,,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher," Chris, you want to elaborate on her answer?",,,,remark,0,1,3
99,Chris,"Um, well, I just, I feel like we're talking about stuff that that we know like cuz I went to NASA with my dad and I feel like we're missing stuff that like we have to use",,,,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,"Jazmin's right, she's not wrong",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher, See what else you can discover,,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher,Keep reading,,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
99,Jazmin,So it's the lunar orbiter?,,,110.1,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher, It's the lunar orbiter that they sent to look for the water,,,110.4,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher,Mhmm,,,110.4,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher,So where did they find the water?,,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher,Farrah?,,,,remark,0,1,3
99,Farrah,Well I was going to answer the earlier question,,,,response,0,1,3
99,Chris,I know where they found the water,,,,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher, It's her turn,,,,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher, Keep going Farrah,,,,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher,"Ok, but let Farrah talk",,,,remark,0,1,3
99,Farrah,So I was gonna say,,,,response,0,1,3
99,Farrah," Um, so did they use the the microscope to discover the water as well, or did they use it for something else?",,,,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,"Okay, from your text it says that you would need what to see the water?",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
99,Farrah,a microscope,,,230.2,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,There you go,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher," Okay, Chris, what did you want to add?",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
99,Chris,"Um, so I was just gonna say like that basically I can understand so like the lunar orbiter is the machine that like went up there like Jazmin said, did they have astronauts in it? Did they need all that stuff?",,,110.1,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,"It did not clarify, did it? So maybe this could have been an unmanned mission and they just send the machinery and the lunar orbiter was part of the bigger machine that discovered the water",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
99,Chris," Okay, so maybe they didn't send any astronauts at all",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
99,Chris,"Yeah, that makes sense that makes sense",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,There you go,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher," Okay, so Oliver, where were they finding this water?",,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
99,Oliver,"Um, so they found the water in polar craters",,,210.3,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,In polar crater,,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher," So what does that mean, is it around the earth or is it the top and the bottom",,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
99,Oliver,"Um, it's at the top and the bottom",,,140.1,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,"Okay, that's what polar craters mean",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher, What is the target they they want you to know,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher," Polar means the poles, the North and the South",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher, So what is the main idea of this section,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher," What is, for informational texts, what is the main idea",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
99,Oliver,"Um, do you mean for the, the three paragraphs or in one paragraph",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher,"All three paragraphs, what is the central idea",,,,remark,0,1,3
99,Oliver,"Well, I guess the central idea is that, um, the water is that there's water on the moon and the lunar orbiter found it and the microscope was used to look at it",,,,response,0,1,3
99,Teacher, So each--,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
99,Teacher, Great job guys,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3

99,Jazmin,I just wanted to take a moment and I just wanted to thank you for for being so patient as we all work together,,,,response,0,1,3
99,Jazmin,And for helping us to listen to each other's answers and kind of use each other's answers to help our own answers,,,,response,0,1,3
99,Jazmin, And I think everybody else does,,,,response,0,1,3
99,Jazmin," So, um, I really appreciate that",,,,response,0,1,3
99,Jazmin,"Sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher, and it was really special to be able to work with you and to have you encouraged us to listen to each other",,,,response,0,1,3

100,Teacher,How did you answer the question again?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
100,Jazmin," And then when I was reading, I said NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
100,Jazmin,So I said that NASA sent a small machine,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, so who can tell me about the Lunar Orbiter",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
100,Teacher, Go back to paragraph two,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2

100,Luis,"Um, okay",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
100,Luis, So like that's what the lunar orbiter does it flies up and it orbits the moon,,,,response,0,1,2
100,Luis,The Lunar Orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,,response,0,1,2
100,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,1,2
100,Teacher,The ice deposits are very small,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
100,Teacher,So do you think the Lunar Orbiter was able to see the ice deposits or what how do you think the lunar orbiter was able to find the ice deposits?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
100,Luis,"like, maybe it had like instruments on board like it had like very scientific instruments",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
100,Teacher,That's a good answer,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
100,Teacher," Farrah, what would you like to add to the conversation",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
100,Farrah,"Okay, so I thought that it's the microscope that discovered the water but um I I don't understand why my answer is wrong because I thought the microscope discovered it, and also the yeah I thought the microscope discovered the water",,,110.1,response,0,1,2
100,Teacher, What paragraph does our reading talk about the microscope,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, so you're, you want to talk, the microscope",,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
100,Farrah,"Okay, so it's paragraph three, and it says the water is, the water they found is microscopic um and then you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
100,Teacher,Okay,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
100,Teacher, Does it say the microscope found the water in that paragraph?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2

100,Teacher,"And Chris, that's really cool",,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
100,Teacher," Oliver, can, can you look back at your reading in paragraph two, and read that one more time for us? Okay",,,120.3,remark,0,1,2

100,Oliver,"Oh, like to look at, to like, look for something",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
100,Teacher,"To look for something, to, what do you, do you have anything else, Luis Jazmin or Chris or Farrah to add to that? Investigate means what, what does that mean to you",,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
100,Teacher,"If you're going to investigate something what-- Jazmin, what do you think",,,,remark,0,1,2
100,Jazmin,"So I think if you're investigating, it's like how you're finding something",,,,response,0,1,2
100,Jazmin, So you went off and looked for something,,,,response,0,1,2

100,Teacher,"Luis Luis What did you want to ask first,",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Luis, I don't think I need to be in this group,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
100,Luis,"Um, well, I was just gonna say that I kind of know like all about space",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
100,Teacher, Luis So maybe we could look at this together,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, Appreciate that answer,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,Okay,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, And maybe we could come to some new conclusions possibly,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, what I understand that your answer was scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,"Now I can see since you already have a lot of prior knowledge about space, how, why you would come up with that answer",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher," And that is a great answer, our passage",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, And if we can look at that paragraph and I want you to circle the word machine,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,Today I would like for all of you to look back at paragraph number two,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,"And then I would like for you to read to yourself silently just passed the word machine, what actually let's have Luis read that sentence for us",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
100,Luis,"Okay, so, um, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,120.3,response,1,1,2
100,Teacher, So what did,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, What did NASA send to investigate,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,Okay that sentence,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,1,1,2
100,Jazmin,They sent the lunar orbiter,,,,response,1,1,2
100,Teacher, OK,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,The Lunar Orbiter,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, So our question that we had what equipment did scientist us to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, What do you think they sent,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
100,Jazmin,A scientist sent the orbiter to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,response,1,1,2
100,Teacher,That is correct,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, so what did you your",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, Chris?,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, They did send that,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, And what did you want to add to that,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Chris,"Oh, I was just gonna say the same thing",,,110.1,response,1,1,2
100,Teacher, Can you read the next sentence for me Oliver,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, so let's look down the next sentence past that one",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
100,Oliver,The Lunar Orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,120.3,response,1,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, so what did the lunar orbiter do who can tell me",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,1,1,2
100,Farrah,So the lunar orbiter landed at the South Pole and it looks for ice water,,,,response,1,1,2
100,Teacher, Yes Farrah,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,Okay so ice and water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, Is that the same thing,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Farrah, It's just that ice is frozen water,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
100,Farrah,"It's, it's the same thing",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
100,Farrah," And I guess I just, I wanted to ask, I think I'm still a little bit confused about why my answer is wrong",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
100,Teacher, What made you say that,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, so you your answer, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope scope to look really closely, so I can",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
100,Farrah,"Well, it says, it says in the question that they're looking for the equipment that was used to discover",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
100,Farrah," So I said, Okay, the key word is equipment",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
100,Farrah,"And discover, and I thought, what's equipment and I saw the microscope, and I know that you use the microscope to see stuff and they said the water was microscopic so you couldn't see without the microscope",,,,response,1,1,2
100,Farrah, You know what I mean,,,,response,1,1,2
100,Farrah, So I was thinking like you have to see it to find it,,,,response,1,1,2
100,Teacher,But did the microscope actually find the water?,,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,"I can see exactly why you would say that because it does say the water is microscopic and you would need to see a microscope, you would use a microscope to see it",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
100,Farrah,"Oh,",,,310.1,response,1,1,2
100,Farrah, It sounds like they found it with something else,,,,response,1,1,2
100,Farrah,I guess I guess not cause it didn't say that they found it with the microscope,,,,response,1,1,2
100,Farrah,With the lunar orbiter right?,,,,response,1,1,2
100,Teacher,Exactly,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, The very first thing some paragraph to NASA send a small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, So if we will let's underline that sentence on number two,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, I'm sorry, Chris, what did you want to add to that",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,And then the second sentence underline that one as well,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, This lunar orbiter will land at the most South Pole and look for ice deposits,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher," OK, now let's go on to the third paragraph so",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Chris,"Um, well actually it was more of a question",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
100,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,1,2
100,Chris,"Yeah, I guess it was that I went to NASA with my dad and we saw that scientists like oxygen tanks at masks and suits and stuff",,,,response,1,1,2
100,Chris," And I was wondering, like, that wasn't in the reading",,,,response,1,1,2
100,Chris," And I was wondering, like, did they use that to find the water",,,,response,1,1,2
100,Teacher,"Well, I can, if you went to NASA and you actually saw all of those things I could, I can understand why you would think that because there's a lot of things that you probably learned",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,But when we're answering questions we probably should refer back to our the reading that we were given to find out answers that we need,,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher," And it's look at, let's read paragraph number three",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher," The water they found is, what's the word there?",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, Okay ready okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest or driest desert on Earth,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,So if you look at paragraph number three,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, I'm going to read it,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, You follow along,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, If you were looking straight at it,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,Microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher, We're back to number two,,,410.3,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,410.3,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher," Yes, Farrah",,,410.3,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher," There's where Farrah found her answer, but the microscope was just to be able to see the water they found it",,,410.3,remark,1,1,2
100,Farrah,The Lunar Orbiter,,,410.3,response,1,1,2
100,Teacher,"Exactly, exactly",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
100,Farrah," Unfortunately, we have to go to our next class",,,110.1,response,1,1,2
100,Farrah, But we wanted to thank you so much for working with us,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
100,Farrah,And I'm so sorry,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
100,Farrah, Thank you,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
100,Farrah, It was really fun to work with,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
100,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,1,1,2
100,Teacher,Okay Luis So you want to respond really quickly,,,,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher, Go ahead,,,,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, so our second question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,1,2
100,Luis," Like, I think I kind of got all this figured out by now, so I think I'm good",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Luis," Well, I was just gonna say that",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Teacher, But let's talk about this for just a minute,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, I appreciate that, that you that you feel that way",,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, so what was your response Luis?",,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
100,Luis,"So okay, so my response was that water can be split into two parts at the hydrogen and oxygen",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
100,Teacher," And I see why you would say that,",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,but can I ask you another question about that,,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, I understand",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher, So is that convincing me that water would be valuable?,,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"How would you use that answer to convince me that water is valuable, or could be valuable on the moon",,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
100,Luis,So like I didn't,,,420.2,response,2,1,2
100,Luis," Well, I guess like that it would be valuable because you could",,,420.2,response,2,1,2
100,Luis,"Use all those things like hydrogen, you can use for rocket fuel and oxygen",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Luis, You can use to breathe,,,,response,2,1,2
100,Teacher, Were you thinking about that a little differently,,,530.1,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher," So what made you what, how did I change your answer",,,530.1,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher, That's great,,,530.1,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,That's great,,,530.1,remark,2,1,2
100,Luis,"Yeah, well, I think so",,,530.1,response,2,1,2
100,Luis," Like what, like you know like what I'm trying to say",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Luis, So I guess I didn't have like a complete answer,,,,response,2,1,2
100,Luis,"It sounds like I should say like what it does, so that you know people understand",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,Great response,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher," So let's go back to, and I think you pulled that right out of paragraph five, can you read that this the first two sentences on paragraph five, for me, Luis",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
100,Luis, Water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen,,,120.3,response,2,1,2
100,Luis,"Oh yeah, absolutely",,,120.3,response,2,1,2
100,Luis, Okay so paragraph five moon water could be useful in other ways,,,120.3,response,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, and what else does it say about it",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
100,Luis,"Um, well, it says that like get astronauts could read the oxygen and then oxygen and hydrogen",,,120.3,response,2,1,2
100,Luis," Oh, they use both for rocket fuel",,,120.3,response,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, so you said they could use it for rocket fuel",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher, But what other thing didn't say right there that you just read,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
100,Luis,They could breathe it,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, so, Jazmin, what would you like to add",,,,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,They could breathe it,,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
100,Jazmin,"And I just, I'm still kind of confused about how to how to structure the answer so that it's a better answer",,,110.4,response,2,1,2
100,Teacher," Tell me what your answer was, again,",,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,Okay,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher, So your answer,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
100,Jazmin, You can't survive without water,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
100,Jazmin,"Yeah, so my answer was that yes there's convincing evidence because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"I see where you get that answer,",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,So we could drink it,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,but does is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"Luis said we could break it down to oxygen, hydrogen, we could breathe it",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"So okay, so are those reasons that it could be valuable",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher, We could use it for rocket fuel,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
100,Jazmin,I think it's valuable,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
100,Jazmin, Like how do I structure like my answer it,,,,response,2,1,2
100,Jazmin, Did I do it right or do I need to adjust it?,,,,response,2,1,2
100,Jazmin,"Yeah, I think I was just wondering, like, if, if I know that it's valuable",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Jazmin, How do I say the answer so that it uses evidence? You were reminding us to use evidence,,,,response,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, so if we look back to paragraph four, it says that water on the moon would be a valuable are very important resource you see the very first sentence on paragraph four, okay",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,It could be useful in a lot of ways,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,So I think you would have your sentence was great,,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher," Perhaps you could have worded it by saying, water is valuable, or could be a valuable",,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher," Um,",,,,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,I'm trying to find my question,,,,remark,2,1,2
100,Jazmin,I can read it to you is that helpful,,,,response,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"Yes, please",,,,remark,2,1,2
100,Jazmin,"Of course, the question",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Jazmin,Was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,,response,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, um, Chris",,,,remark,2,1,2
100,Chris,"What I was ok so i was i read that they were possibly going to have a base on the moon by 2024 which, I think that could be really useful",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Teacher, Did you hear that somewhere else,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,Okay art,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher," So did you read that in our paragraph, or did you listen",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
100,Chris,"Oh, I, I heard that somewhere else",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"Okay, so you might be confusing your prior knowledge that you may have gotten somewhere else with with what we read in our paragraph",,,430.3,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher, So let's think about what we just read in our paragraph to answer our question,,,430.3,remark,2,1,2
100,Teacher,"So Oliver, did you want to add something to that, just a second ago",,,,remark,2,1,2
100,Oliver," But before we go, I really wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Oliver,"Um, well, I actually unfortunately we have to go to lunch",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Oliver,"I really wanted to thank you for making sure that we were using evidence and really helping us to clarify, like what we were thinking and and like what kind of ideas, perhaps",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Oliver, You helped us to make like such better answers and like,,,,response,2,1,2
100,Oliver,"Like you really help us to sort of think about, like, like how did we come to this answer, and by thinking about like that",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Oliver,"I think that everybody had a deeper understand like, don't you agree, guys, like I think everybody agrees that like everybody like, you know what I mean, understand better",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Oliver,"And like, especially with like Chris just now",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Oliver," Like, it was really cool how you were asking him like",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Oliver, So I think Chris like understand even more,,,,response,2,1,2
100,Oliver, And I know that I like was really interested in that conversation,,,,response,2,1,2
100,Oliver,"You know, like how did he come to his answer",,,,response,2,1,2
100,Oliver, So thank you so much for working with us,,,,response,2,1,2
101,Teacher,Hello everyone,,,,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,How are you guys today,,,,remark,1,1,4
101,Jazmin,We're really excited to see,,,,response,1,1,4
101,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,Awesome,,,,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, So we're going to go ahead and get started with our class today,,,,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, I am so excited to see everyone to,,,,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,1,1,4
101,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Luis," So I was just gonna say, I don't think I have to be in this group because I already corrected my answer",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Teacher,Yes,,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, Okay,,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher," And so everyone corrected their answer, but we're going to talk about that today",,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,We're going to talk about our,,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,Stick around,,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, so who can tell me what they did to correct their answer",,,530.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher," Yes, we're going to talk about our corrected answers",,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, So how did you go about correcting your answer,,,530.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,Who can share that,,,,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, Farrah",,,,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, What did you do,,,,remark,1,1,4
101,Farrah," Nope, sorry",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah,"Okay, so basically what I did",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah, You need a scientist tool for the microscope,,,,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah," So, good my initial answer was, scientists use the Lunar Orbiter",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah,To look really looks,,,,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah," I said, scientists use the Lunar Orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah," And then I said, after after class with you",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah," So after we work together, I realized that it was the lunar orbit that helped to discover",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah,And so I did that because you help me understand that the scientific tool that it with the microscope was not the equipment they use to discover the walk,,,,response,1,1,4
101,Teacher,"Yes, so we look really closely at those key words in our question",,,510.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,So we looked at discover because that was one of our key words because there was a lot of tools that the scientists used that they talked about in our text,,,210.2,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, So what does discover mean,,,210.2,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, Okay,,,510.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,"Jazmin, what is discover mean",,,210.2,remark,1,1,4
101,Jazmin,"I'm discovering like when you find them, but like, it's when you find them for the first time",,,210.2,response,1,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, so what words, did we find in our text that helped us answer our question",,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,"So remember when we are reading our question we have to look really closely at those key words, those words that we need to look for in our text",,,510.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,"Yeah, so when you find something for the very first time",,,110.4,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,There any words that we circled or underlined in our text,,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, Jazmin, what word",,,,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, Did you underline or circle,,,,remark,1,1,4
101,Jazmin,I started a couple things like I changed my answer to,,,,response,1,1,4
101,Jazmin, So I'd said basically that like,,,,response,1,1,4
101,Jazmin," So basically, I was like, at first I said this small ship for NASA and option, but then you helped us look at, like, how we needed to use the question and like use that to answer it",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Jazmin,"Scientists for NASA us the lunar orbit to discover water on the because the lunar orbiter is the equipment that takes, you know what I mean, like, and that was more accurate like I kind of had it right but I didn't",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Jazmin," I didn't say the actual equipment and they were asked, like the name",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Teacher,So remember when we are looking at our question we always have to look for those important words,,,510.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,"Yes, so we had to be very specific with our answer because they use the specific name in our text",,,420.2,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, so let's look in our text for a minute",,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,And then we have to look in our text for the same words so that we can try to find our answer,,,510.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, The Lunar Orbiter,,,130.2,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, What are some words you think we could underline or circle that might help a friend someone sitting next to you,,,130.2,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, So if you got the right answer,,,130.2,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,And let's see if there are any other words in our text that might help maybe someone else in our group,,,130.2,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, What might help your friend,,,130.2,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,"So what is a word in our texts that might help someone else answer the question, what do you think Farrah",,,130.2,remark,1,1,4
101,Farrah, So I was thinking about what word is like,,,130.2,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah,So I basically,,,130.2,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah," Okay, so it says, like, in paragraph two, it says, NASA set this ball",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah,Discover so i i found that the word,,,,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah, She called the Lunar Orbiter to best which is kind of like dis discover,,,,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah," And so I thought, investigate was important because basically like, you know what I mean",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah," It says, like, that's what they",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah,"Yeah, don't let go and find something",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah,"That that's what they discover, and then when I was looking at the microscope",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Farrah," Originally I was like, oh, that's because they had to look really closely, but they had to look closely, like after they found right",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Teacher,Yes,,,110.4,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, Awesome job,,,110.4,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,Is there any other words that are important,,,210.3,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, Chris,,,210.3,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, Yes,,,210.3,remark,1,1,4
101,Chris,"Well, I actually have a question",,,110.4,response,1,1,4
101,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,1,4
101,Chris,"My question was like, okay, so I know because I went so with like that that scientists use oxygen tanks and stuff",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Chris, You know what I mean equipment like that,,,,response,1,1,4
101,Chris,"Because I was wondering, like, that's not in the reading like did they leave it out or you know what I mean, like, Is that, is that right or is that just like I guess I don't want to understand",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Teacher,"Yes, that is a very good question",,,210.2,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher, So they were focusing more on what they used to find the water specifically,,,210.2,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,They weren't really thinking about what they use to actually get to space,,,410.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher," So yes, you're right, they did use the oxygen tanks and things like that, because there is no oxygen in space, but they were focusing more on the water piece versus what they use to get to space",,,410.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Chris,Because it's it's not in the right so even if it was true,,,410.1,response,1,1,4
101,Chris,"Right, okay",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Teacher,"Yes, I'm make sense",,,,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,Sometimes they don't put everything in the reading because then we would be reading forever,,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
101,Teacher,"Yes, Oliver",,,,remark,1,1,4
101,Oliver, So thank you so much,,,,response,1,1,4
101,Oliver, It was really awesome to have a chance to talk,,,,response,1,1,4
101,Oliver," But we have to go to lunch, but we just wanted to thank you for working with us",,,,response,1,1,4
101,Oliver,I'm so sorry,,,,response,1,1,4
101,Teacher,Hello everyone,,,,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher,"So yes, Luis",,,,remark,2,1,4
101,Luis,"Oh yeah, I just wanted to remind everybody that my dad is an astronaut just pretty cool",,,,response,2,1,4
101,Teacher,So we answered our last question,,,150.1,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher,That is awesome,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher, So we're going to move on to a new question,,,150.1,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher, Thank you for sharing that,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher," Okay, so what do we think valuable means",,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher,"So we know that there is water on the moon that the scientists had discovered it, but our question says, Is there evidence that the water could be valuable",,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher,What do you think that means,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher,"What do you think, Oliver",,,,remark,2,1,4
101,Oliver,I think valuable means like useful,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Oliver, It can also mean like,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Oliver,"You know, like something that costs a lot like it could be really expensive",,,,response,2,1,4
101,Teacher, So this is asking could water from the moon be useful,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, awesome so valuable means that it's useful",,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher, Okay,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher,So do we think that water from the moon could be useful to our scientist,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher,You think yes or no,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher,Okay Luis What do you think,,,,remark,2,1,4
101,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,2,1,4
101,Luis," So basically, well,",,,,response,2,1,4
101,Luis, Okay,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Luis," So yeah, I think it's us",,,,response,2,1,4
101,Luis, So you're asking is it useful well water can be split into two parts into hydrogen and in oxygen and those are both really useful in space,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Luis,I guess,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, what are you going to use the hydrogen and oxygen for",,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
101,Luis,"Um,",,,230.1,response,2,1,4
101,Luis,"I'm like, whoa okay didn't say it",,,,response,2,1,4
101,Luis," Mike, my dad uses it or something",,,,response,2,1,4
101,Luis," Did he say, oh, oh, oh, you could you could breathe, breathe the oxygen",,,,response,2,1,4
101,Luis, Okay,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Luis,I don't remember,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Teacher,"Jazmin, what do you think",,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, so that could be one thing that's useful",,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
101,Jazmin," Is it the answer to the question, or like, why are you",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
101,Jazmin,"Um, to basically we",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
101,Teacher,Yes,,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher, So do you think water could be useful,,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
101,Jazmin," Also, you could use the order that they have and you could grow a garden all over the moon",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
101,Jazmin,"Oh yeah, I think it would be really because astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
101,Teacher,"Oh, that would be awesome",,,110.2,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher," What do you think, do you think water could be valuable from the moon",,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher,Chris,,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher, That is very good thinking,,,110.2,remark,2,1,4
101,Chris,I'm yeah i mean,,,120.4,response,2,1,4
101,Chris, They don't have to carry it in the ships like they don't have to carry any water they could just go to the moon and get the water there,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Chris, And so it's good,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Chris,"Yeah, like water is heavy",,,,response,2,1,4
101,Teacher," So it would be good, that if they didn't have to carry it on the ship",,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher," So that is very good thinking,",,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher,That is very true,,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher,Oliver,,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher, They could have room for other things,,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher," Yes, water is heavy",,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher, What do you think,,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
101,Oliver,"Um, okay",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
101,Oliver, So I was thinking that no and mostly because it's not it's not ready,,,120.4,response,2,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, what do you mean by that",,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
101,Oliver, You have to do all this stuff to to get it and it's like it's in just like these like small amounts you know we were saying from the last question,,,230.1,response,2,1,4
101,Oliver, It's like microscopic,,,230.1,response,2,1,4
101,Oliver,"Um, well, I guess the waters, not like it's not like immediately ready to use like they were saying in the reading",,,230.1,response,2,1,4
101,Oliver, And you have to,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Oliver,"So like, it seems like it would be really tricky and and I guess the other thing is that because it's ice like you have to collect that",,,,response,2,1,4
101,Oliver, So I it's not ready to us,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Oliver, You know what I mean like you have to do all that stuff wall like before you can use,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Oliver,"You know, you have to like, like I guess melt it",,,,response,2,1,4
101,Oliver,Why don't think it's a very useful,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, Farrah",,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher, What do you think,,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher,I like your thinking that is awesome,,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher, You use details from our text to support your thinking,,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher," So, that's awesome",,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
101,Farrah," Okay, so my answer is also know and that I guess I feel a little different from Oliver is like, it wouldn't be useful for a long time",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
101,Farrah,"Um, so basically I thought that",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, what do you mean by that",,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
101,Farrah,"Well, okay, so you know how they were saying in the reading, kind of like what I've said like they need like all this",,,230.1,response,2,1,4
101,Farrah, So I do think that it might be useful,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Farrah,There's all these processes to to break it down and do stuff with it,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Farrah," I bench, but like right now like",,,,response,2,1,4
101,Farrah," Now, I don't think it's very good until we figure out how to how to make it useful",,,,response,2,1,4
101,Farrah, And we haven't done,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Farrah,"I don't think the evidence is very fancy because it's like saying, you know, can you use it",,,,response,2,1,4
101,Farrah, Can you use it,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, I see what you're thinking too so awesome job using evidence from the text as well",,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher," Yes, Chris",,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
101,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,310.1,response,2,1,4
101,Chris, So I just basically was just thinking also that,,,310.1,response,2,1,4
101,Chris,That like water can be broken down into arts I virgin and oxygen,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Chris, I agree with with Luis I think there's lots of reasons why it would be useful,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, awesome",,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher, So in our text it says that it is in small amounts,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
101,Teacher,Yes def,,,,remark,2,1,4
101,Oliver, But before we go to our next box,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Oliver, I really wanted to make sure that I was able to share with you,,,,response,2,1,4
101,Oliver,"So unfortunately, we have to go to our next class",,,,response,2,1,4
101,Chris,Hi,,,,response,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"Hi there, how are you all doing",,,,remark,0,1,4
101,Oliver,We're doing okay,,,,response,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"All right, so you just read this text about the moon is a desert",,,,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher," So, um, do you know what equipment means? Do you know what that word means?",,,210.2,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,And so we want to answer this question together what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"So when you are reading this text, you're looking for an equipment that this text is discussing",,,210.2,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,1,4
101,Luis,"I do, I do",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, yes",,,,remark,0,1,4
101,Luis," And actually, so I kind of know what equipment is like it's stuff that you",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Luis," So, okay, my name is Luis",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Luis," So, like, I don't think I need to be in this group",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Luis, I don't need any help,,,,response,0,1,4
101,Luis,It's like machines and tools and things that you use,,,,response,0,1,4
101,Luis, And I know like everything there is to know about space,,,,response,0,1,4
101,Luis," But my real question is, like, I don't think I should be in this group like I know already all about space",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Teacher, Not just one person answering okay,,,220.1,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,Okay,,,220.1,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher," Um, well, we are going to work together as a team to answer this question, this is a team effort",,,220.1,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher, It is like a tool that scientists use when they are discovering things,,,310.1,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"So, that was a really good explanation and definition of what equipment is",,,310.1,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"So in the third paragraph, it's talking about a microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher, Microscope,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,Does anyone know or have you heard that word before,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, Farrah, would you like to describe what a microscope is?",,,,remark,0,1,4
101,Farrah," So in the text, it said a microscope is a scientific tool and it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Farrah," OK, so a microscope is okay",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Farrah,Yeah,,,,response,0,1,4
101,Farrah,"So it's like something that you look at something that's really small, but I have a question like, why is my answer wrong",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Farrah, Like I feel like my answers right because like you have to use like like microscope to see the water,,,,response,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"Yes, that is correct",,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,And no one's answer is wrong,,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher, Okay,,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,Why do you think a scientist would need a microscope to see the water,,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"We are just diving deeper into the text as a team, so that everyone is on the same page",,,220.1,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"OK, so the equipment that is scientists use is a microscope to discover the water on the moon",,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher, Why do you think the scientists would need to use the microscope to see the water,,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher," Yes, Oliver?",,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,She said a microscope is used to see things that are really small,,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
101,Oliver, So basically you need a microscope to see the water because there's not much water on the like moon surface and you you have to look really closely to find it and see it,,,230.1,response,0,1,4
101,Oliver,"Um, okay",,,230.1,response,0,1,4
101,Teacher,Great job,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher, Good,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"All right, also in the first, let's see",,,,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,Says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher, So you would need to use a microscope to see the water,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"It tells you in paragraph three, does everyone see that",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,Yes?,,,,remark,0,1,4
101,Jazmin,"I can see it, but here's the thing that I was thinking",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Jazmin,"Is the, I thought that thesmall machine that NASA sent was the thing that discovered the water",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Jazmin,Is it the microscope? But like I think that they discovered it with the machine,,,,response,0,1,4
101,Teacher,Machine was sent to investigate,,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits,,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,Let's see,,,,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,So they used the machine that you're talking about the Lunar Orbiter to investigate the water,,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,and the ice deposits,,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher," That makes sense? And then they used the microscope to look more at it, to discover",,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"Yes, sir?",,,,remark,0,1,4
101,Chris,"so I was just kind of wondering like, okay, so I went to NASA with my dad and we like went and looked at places and we looked at like exhibits and stuff",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Chris," So I'm wondering, like, maybe that's the equipment that they used to discover water",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Chris,"So, Like, I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff, but they don't, I don't know, like I already know that",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"Okay, so whenever the astronauts have to go into space, there's no oxygen in space",,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
101,Chris,Yeah,,,,response,0,1,4
101,Teacher, So they have to have an oxygen tank and a mask and things like that to be able to survive when they go into space,,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher, Does that make sense?,,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher, They're using it more to survive while they're discovering those things,,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"So they're not, they're not using the mask and things to discover the water",,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
101,Chris,Okay,,,130.3,response,0,1,4
101,Teacher,But that's really cool that you've been there,,,,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher,"Yes, sir?",,,,remark,0,1,4
101,Luis," Unfortunately, but I just wanted to take a moment and like I just wanted to thank you for like spending this time with us like",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Luis, So we have to go to lunch,,,,response,0,1,4
101,Luis,"Um, okay",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Luis,You really took the time to listen to all of our ideas and you really like helped us to listen to each other's ideas and like,,,,response,0,1,4
101,Luis,"Even though I didn't really read the text like you were very patient with me and still brought me into the conversation, which was pretty cool",,,,response,0,1,4
101,Luis, So I just wanted to thank you and um yeah I hope that we work with you again,,,,response,0,1,4
101,Teacher,I hope so too,,,,remark,0,1,4
101,Teacher, Thank you,,,,remark,0,1,4
102,Teacher,Hello,,,,remark,0,0,2
102,Oliver,"Hello, how are you",,,,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher,"I'm good, how are you Oliver",,,,remark,0,0,2
102,Oliver,I'm good,,,,response,0,0,2
102,Oliver, We're working on this question about what scientists what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher,"Yes, I see that",,,,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher,"Yes, Luis?",,,,remark,0,0,2
102,Luis,"Okay, so I have a question like, I know all the stuff about space like practically all you can possibly know like I don't think I should be in this group, because I don't think I need any help with this",,,,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher,"Well, maybe you can help the others",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
102,Luis,"Okay, I can do that",,,110.3,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher, Why do you think that the scientists used on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher,"Why don't you start with what it, what",,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
102,Luis," So here's what I know is like probably they had to use like I'm like spacesuits and oxygen tanks and they had to use, like, stuff like that",,,120.2,response,0,0,2
102,Luis,"Well, okay",,,120.2,response,0,0,2
102,Luis, Like gloves and like helmets and things,,,120.2,response,0,0,2
102,Luis, I think that's what they had to use,,,120.2,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher, It was in our reading,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher,But what special machine did they use,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher,"Well, yeah, that's what they all have to use just to be there",,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher,Does anyone know?,,,,remark,0,0,2
102,Luis,well,,,,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah?",,,,remark,0,0,2
102,Farrah, I think it's the microscope,,,,response,0,0,2
102,Farrah,Oh yeah,,,,response,0,0,2
102,Farrah," So I think it's, I think it's the microscope",,,,response,0,0,2
102,Farrah, Okay,,,,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher,All right,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher, Where did you see that,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
102,Farrah, So I'm not totally sure like why my answers not right,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
102,Farrah,"Um, okay",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
102,Farrah," So I saw it in paragraph three, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher, Can someone see what they brought,,,420.3,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher,"Why don't we go ahead and look at paragraph two, to see if there was a special machine that they brought to investigate",,,420.3,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,0,2
102,Jazmin,"So what I said, what I saw is that NASA send a small machine and it's called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher,"Yes, that is what they sent",,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher," And Chris, what did they investigate when they got there?",,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
102,Chris," So I think like they investigated the craters and they found them all full water, which was pretty cool",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
102,Chris,Oh well,,,230.1,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher,"And Oliver, what happened",,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher, How did they study that the small ice deposits,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
102,Oliver,"Um, so they basically used the microscope that Farrah mentioned and basically they use the microscope to study the the tiny little pieces of water like that you couldn't really see necessarily with with just your eyes",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher, Do you see now why your answer needs to go a little bit further,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher,Very good,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher," So, Farrah",,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
102,Farrah,"Um, I think I began to see, but I'm still kind of confused because so if they use the Lunar Orbiter to to find it, they couldn't see it without the microscope, like they had to go out and look at the crystals, right?",,,110.2,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher,"That's true, but they couldn't get the crystals to investigate without the small machine, right?",,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
102,Farrah,"Oh, so okay so they had to use this small machine to like find it in the first place",,,130.1,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher,Yeah,,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher, So first they had to find it,,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher, And then they could investigate using the microscope,,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
102,Farrah," Okay, that, that, that makes a little more sense",,,130.3,response,0,0,2
102,Farrah," Um,",,,130.3,response,0,0,2
102,Farrah,Gotcha,,,130.3,response,0,0,2
102,Farrah," I think, I think that makes sense",,,130.3,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher, It will tell us what happened first and then what happens next,,,510.1,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher,Yeah,,,510.1,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher, So often when we read it will tell us a sequence,,,510.1,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher, So it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story,,,510.1,remark,0,0,2
102,Chris,"Yes, Chris?",,,510.1,response,0,0,2
102,Chris, And we looked around at like all the exhibits and all the stuff and I kind of like,,,,response,0,0,2
102,Chris,"Yeah, okay",,,,response,0,0,2
102,Chris, So I think like for okay I went to NASA with my dad,,,,response,0,0,2
102,Chris,"I know from my own like reading and from my like visit that you have to use all this equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like what Luis said so, like, I don't know, like that, does that fit into the answer",,,,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher,"It ties, because sometimes our personal experience helps us  to understand what we're reading",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher, And so that's a great thing to share with the class,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher," And so Chris when you are reading, if you've seen these things at NASA, itt helps you to visualize them and to know more about them",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher, Does anyone else have an experience that similar?,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher, Luis?,,,,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,0,2
102,Luis," Like, I guess it didn't really think about that",,,,response,0,0,2
102,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,0,2
102,Luis," So I guess like for me, it's like, um, I didn't really read it because I kind of knew all this stuff",,,,response,0,0,2
102,Luis, So like the stuff about the Orbiter and the microscope,,,,response,0,0,2
102,Luis, But I guess there's more in the reading,,,,response,0,0,2
102,Teacher,Good,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher," Maybe they don't know it, and they need your help",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher, So sometimes if you if you already know something I think we can always learn more about it,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher, Or maybe you could see if your classmates,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
102,Teacher,Yes Oliver?,,,,remark,0,0,2
102,Oliver,"Um, so we have to go to lunch in just a second",,,,response,0,0,2
102,Oliver, But I wanted to just thank you for working with us today because I'm sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher,,,,response,0,0,2
102,Oliver,"Because we don't always work together, but today you really asked us to think about each other's answers and really kind of listen to each other and and be patient with each other and kind of",,,,response,0,0,2
102,Oliver, So I just wanted to thank you for that,,,,response,0,0,2
102,Oliver,Like even Luis Like didn't do the reading like you were like really nice to him and I just wanted to thank you because it felt really safe to like put out our ideas,,,,response,0,0,2
102,Bennett, Welcome back,,,,,0,0,2
102,Bennett, So how did that feel,,,,,0,0,2
102,Bennett,All right,,,,,0,0,2

102,Teacher, Thanks for for helping us out,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,"Alright, so let's just go ahead and see and let's talk about some of the things that you've done",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,and that is one of the tools that was used to do some observation and some research,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,"And let's see, Farrah, you talked about needing us scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,"Do you remember what that was, or maybe where you could look to find that answer",,,120.1,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,"But there's another tool that was used to discover the water and so that looked more closely at the water, but it wasn't what was discovering the water",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
102,Farrah,"Oh,",,,120.1,response,1,0,2
102,Farrah,I don't remember where it is,,,,response,1,0,2
102,Farrah,"I mean I guess I could just, I could look back at the story again",,,,response,1,0,2
102,Teacher,Yeah,,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher," Who knows, have a strategy that we can use",,,220.1,remark,1,0,2

102,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,You're a resident,,,,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,Or maybe you could help us out,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
102,Luis, So I was thinking that maybe Farrah needs to watch more more science videos,,,110.3,response,1,0,2
102,Luis,"Well, I was thinking that you know how I learned a lot about science is by I'm watching YouTube videos and and and watching the show on on on Nova show on PBS",,,110.3,response,1,0,2
102,Teacher,"Well science videos, my family",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher, We love to watch science videos and documentaries and those are great places to learn,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,So we can go ahead and go back,,,120.1,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,"And it's a great place to learn more about what we're talking about,",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,but an excellent place to look is in our text,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher, I'll look at that and if you give me a minute to this kind of pull it up,,,120.1,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,We can look at the text and we can look for clues,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,So let's see,,,,remark,1,0,2
102,Farrah, I'm looking at the text and,,,,response,1,0,2
102,Farrah,"Okay, I'm working",,,,response,1,0,2
102,Farrah,I still don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,1,0,2
102,Teacher,"Oh I'm sorry, I missed two who asked that question",,,,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher, Can you ask again,,,,remark,1,0,2
102,Farrah, I just looked at the text,,,,response,1,0,2
102,Farrah,"Oh yeah, it's me, Miss Bailey",,,,response,1,0,2
102,Farrah, I still don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,1,0,2
102,Teacher, What do you think,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,And while I talked to some of the others,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2

102,Teacher,"OK, let's see if we can put it together",,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,"All right, let me see",,,,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher," Let's see, we're looking for some scientific terms",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher, Who remembers what term,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,Let,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2

102,Teacher,so Farrah,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,So what are the key words we already talked about water discover and equipment right,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher, Water is important,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher, Let's look back to your answer you answered,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2

102,Farrah, I got that I'm in the third paragraph,,,210.2,response,1,0,2
102,Farrah,"I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,210.2,response,1,0,2
102,Teacher,"Okay, you do need it to look closely, but that means you already found it right",,,210.3,remark,1,0,2

102,Farrah,"Oh yeah, yeah, to look at it",,,210.3,response,1,0,2
102,Teacher,So let me see,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher, So we want to find it,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,So that's the next step,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher," First, we can look at it until we discover it or find it",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher," Um, let's see what other answers we have that we could talk about and work this out together",,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher, Let's see,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,And jab,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2

102,Teacher,"Yes, those are some things from your personal experience, and we do get information from our personal experience",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,"That's true, but we want to focus on the text",,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,"I'm Jazmin, you wrote that NASA send a small machine",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher, That's very good,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2

102,Teacher,What you did a great job finding the first part of the sentence,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,"If we look at, paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine, which is what you wrote what comes next",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher, What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher, So let's look at our question again and see if that answers,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,"Okay, so NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
102,Teacher,"What do you think, then",,,,remark,1,0,2

102,Teacher, I'll read it again so you can hear them ready is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher, What are the key words in that question,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,There are key words,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,2,0,2
102,Chris,I think water again is the key word and may be valuable,,,,response,2,0,2

102,Jazmin,"Um,",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin,I think that,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin,"Um, is a key word",,,,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin," And the second one, and maybe moon because we're talking about water on the moon",,,,response,2,0,2
102,Teacher," Good thinking, because we are talking about water",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"Okay, that's good",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2

102,Luis,Evidence as one,,,210.2,response,2,0,2
102,Luis," You know, it can't be something that like you think but you gotta be able to prove it",,,210.2,response,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"See that I'm glad you're still staying with our group, because that is some good insight",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"Because we want to we want to prove and even we're just reading, we want to use evidence to find evidence",,,510.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher, That's what we're going to do,,,220.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher, So let's take a look at your answers,,,220.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,And so in this case,,,220.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"All right, let's see",,,,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,Oh my answers this,,,,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,Hold on just a minute,,,,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher," Let me find your, your work",,,,remark,2,0,2

102,Teacher,Was a very helpful,,,,remark,2,0,2
102,Jazmin,"Okay, well, I'll go, I'll go first, cuz I'm still kind of confused",,,,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin, I said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin, Okay,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin, You can't survive without water,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin,"It's me, Jazmin",,,,response,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"Okay, just a good piece of evidence that we can use water and specifically that the astronauts could use water",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,He said evidence and,,,,remark,2,0,2
102,Jazmin,Why is it wrong,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"Well, it's not wrong",,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,I think we just need some more to it,,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher," Okay, so what is a strategy that we can use to look back at the text and to know where to look in the text",,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,So one strategy we could use let's let's work together with Jazmin,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher, Let's help her her figure out what we could add to this,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
102,Jazmin,"Well, I know, I know that I'm supposed to look for the keywords and the text",,,420.2,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin, And I guess that's why I'm confused because I feel like I did that,,,420.2,response,2,0,2
102,Teacher,All right,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher," Well, let's look at it together",,,120.3,remark,2,0,2

102,Jazmin," I said, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated",,,120.3,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin, Okay,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin,Cuz my answer,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin, You can't survive without water,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin, And then in the paragraph number four,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin, It says future astronauts could drink this water,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin, You said that I needed to add more details,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin,"I added on another detail because I know that's another strategy, we're supposed to do is is because the last question",,,,response,2,0,2
102,Jazmin, And so I,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Teacher," Well, I appreciate it, that you added that detail for us",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,Okay,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher, So let's see,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher, Water is a valuable resource right,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,One place we can look is exactly where you look so you found the right spot to look under the section,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,Because that has the words we were just talking about,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher, So that was just the right place to look for that,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher," And you did find some evidence, didn't you",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,so let's see who can add to that,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
102,Chris,"Okay, it's me, Chris, I talked about the water to I said I'm water is heavy",,,130.2,response,2,0,2
102,Chris, So it's good,,,130.2,response,2,0,2
102,Chris, They don't have to carry it in the ships anymore,,,130.2,response,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"Um,",,,,remark,2,0,2
102,Oliver,I read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Teacher, But we're looking for convincing evidence that it could be valuable,,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"Wow, that's very possible and Chris, you did find some good information because water can be very heavy",,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher, That is true,,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,Huh,,,,remark,2,0,2
102,Chris,Okay,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Chris,It,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Chris,Takes,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Teacher, So it's good,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher, But does that convince us that water on the moon can be valuable,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,It says it's good,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher, I don't have to carry on the ships anymore and that's that is some good information,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
102,Chris,No,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
102,Chris," No, I guess not",,,210.3,response,2,0,2
102,Teacher,So maybe there's something that you can go back to that text and see if you could find some more,,,130.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher," So if we put Jazmin's information with your information and we work together, we can come up with a full and more complete answer",,,130.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher," And you said, not for a long time, or it's not ready yet",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,I'm jab and Farrah you both wrote no to this answer,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"All right, let's see, when you guys are doing a great job with talking through this and working through it together and you know where to find the right place to look",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,But I want us to go back and look at that again,,,120.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,To see if there is convincing evidence because,,,120.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,Jazmin has given us some good information of why it could be good and why it could be valuable and and,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"And then Chris's answer follows up to that is, if they had water there so they wouldn't have to carry it around so that would be valuable because we all need water to drink",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher, I want you to go back to the section that talks about water as a valuable resource and see if you can come up with a different answer,,,120.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,And so let's look back and see,,,120.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher," So, Farrah and Oliveron",,,120.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"Look at paragraph five,",,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
102,Farrah,Is me Farrah,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
102,Farrah," It says, having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things",,,120.3,response,2,0,2
102,Farrah, So is that the right answer,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
102,Farrah, I see the last sentence kind of after Jazmin and Chris's,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
102,Teacher,What would that be valuable,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Farrah,"Oh yeah, having more room would be valuable",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"Okay, so that's that's part of an up",,,130.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher, The answer is that we could have more space having more room,,,130.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher, And let's see,,,130.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Oliver,I agree what Farrah,,,130.1,response,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"Well, what I do agree",,,510.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher," What can you we don't want to just say we agree and it's good to agree with people, but it's also good to know why we we think something",,,510.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Oliver,"Okay, I agree with some out because I do think that um well the thing that I'm so after Jazmin said a thing about drinking the water and then Chris, to think about the water being heavy",,,510.1,response,2,0,2
102,Oliver," And so if I had more room in my, in my room than I would think that would be valuable",,,,response,2,0,2
102,Oliver,I'm done,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Oliver, It does say more room,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Oliver, I mean I have to share a room with my two brothers,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Teacher," All right, let's see",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"Um, I think that would be valuable to",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
102,Teacher,And,,,,remark,2,0,2
102,Chris,"Okay, um,",,,,response,2,0,2
102,Chris,"Let's, let's, really",,,,response,2,0,2
102,Chris, I did want to say,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Chris," Um, but it's me Chris",,,,response,2,0,2
102,Chris, I was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go again,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Chris,"Thanks for for for hearing our ideas like I feel like you, you listen to everybody's ideas and make us feel like valued",,,,response,2,0,2
102,Chris," Oh, like the water",,,,response,2,0,2
102,Chris, And I think that was helpful too,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Chris, So we could find more evidence and build on each other's ideas,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Chris, Yeah,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Chris,But also that you had me and Jazmin kind of look back at at the story,,,,response,2,0,2
102,Teacher,"Well, I appreciate your response",,,,remark,2,0,2
102,All,"Okay, bye",,,,,2,0,2
103,Teacher,"Okay guys, so yes, Luis",,,,remark,2,0,1
103,Luis,"Yeah, I just wanted to say",,,,response,2,0,1
103,Luis," I just wanted to remind you, and everybody that my dad is actually an astronaut",,,,response,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"Alright, so let's look at the question, right",,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, And let's look at your answers,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,That's pretty cool,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,So Luis Can you remind you what was your answer for this question,,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"So the question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,110.1,response,2,0,1
103,Luis, So I said that water can be split into two parts into hydrogen and oxygen,,,110.1,response,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"Okay, good",,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, So that's a good start on your answer,,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"Um, so do you",,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher," What do you think, do you think that that's partially convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?",,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
103,Luis,"Um, you know, I think it's pretty convincing because those two things are so important in space and like for space travel , that I think it's convincing that they have, like, you know what they talk about with whay you can do, yeah I think it's convincing",,,130.1,response,2,0,1
103,Teacher, So with your answer,,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher," Why, why when you split those the reasons that they're valuable",,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,Good,,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher," What I want you to do is to you've got a really great start on your answer, but I also want you to describe what oxygen, hydrogen",,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, Luis,,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Luis, Yeah,,,430.2,response,2,0,1
103,Luis," Yeah, that makes sense",,,430.2,response,2,0,1
103,Luis,"Oh yeah, like using the evidence",,,430.2,response,2,0,1
103,Teacher," Okay, so that's what you do to re evaluate your answer",,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,Now Chris,,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,Yes,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher," Can you tell me what your answer was, again,",,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, Good,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Chris, They don't have to carry it on the ships anymore,,,150.1,response,2,0,1
103,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,150.1,response,2,0,1
103,Chris, So it's good,,,150.1,response,2,0,1
103,Chris, So I said that water is heavy,,,150.1,response,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"Okay, so that's a good story they talk about the water being heavy and that could be a positive thing that they're not having to carry on the ships,",,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"but let's see, can you find some other reasons and other evidence that's just one thing",,,120.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, Can you find some more evidence that supports water being valuable on the moon,,,120.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, Does that make sense Chris?,,,120.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Chris, I'll see what I can find,,,120.1,response,2,0,1
103,Chris,"RER: Yeah, I'll try",,,120.1,response,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"Okay, Oliver",,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, Can you tell me what your answer was,,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
103,Oliver, So I said that,,,120.4,response,2,0,1
103,Oliver," Um, no, like, I didn't think the evidence was very convincing because it's not ready yet",,,120.4,response,2,0,1
103,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,120.4,response,2,0,1
103,Teacher, But as they were as time goes on It could be,,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, I think that it could be valuable,,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, Does that make sense Oliver?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"Okay, so it's not written about it not might not be completely ready yet",,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"Can you find some reasons in there so far that eventually, it could be valuable",,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
103,Oliver, Like it would take such a long time to be useful,,,210.4,response,2,0,1
103,Oliver, Cuz it's not ready yet,,,210.4,response,2,0,1
103,Oliver,"Um, yeah, I could try to look for reasons, um, I just think that like it just seems like it's not, you know what I mean",,,210.4,response,2,0,1
103,Oliver," You know what I mean, so it didn't seem very convincing, because it seems like we'd hav to use",,,210.4,response,2,0,1
103,Oliver, But yeah I can look and see,,,210.4,response,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"Okay, Jazmin",,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"Yes so basically, I was just gonna say, like, one thing that I thought of was that you can use water to grow things, so we could have a garden on the moon",,,,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,Okay,,,130.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"can you remind me, Jazmin, what was your answer to this question",,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher," So eventually I think should go along with what Oliver said I don't think we're quite ready for that yet, but I do think that maybe a long, as we research and in the future, that could be a possibility that",,,130.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"but I do think that maybe a long, as we research and in the future, that could be a possibility that",,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Jazmin,I said that it definitely would be useful because the scientists can drink water and and people can't survive without water,,,110.2,response,2,0,1
103,Teacher,So you and Jazmin you and Luis work together and see if y'all can work to combine your answers and help each other out,,,130.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,Luis had a good start on his too,,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"Um, Farrah what was your answer to this one",,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, So you think that you could work with Luis?,,,130.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"So, that was one of the things that was evidence was that you could drink the water from the moon",,,130.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,and see if you can figure out some other evidence that water would be valuable on the moon,,,120.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Farrah,"Um, so my answer was, I guess no, that it wasn't very convincing, because kind of like what Oliver said like, we wouldn't be able to use it for space for a long time, you know,",,,120.1,response,2,0,1
103,Teacher," Um, well, just because we can't use it right now, at this moment, does that mean that in the future It wouldn't be valuable? What do you think",,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,Okay,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
103,Farrah, I guess it could be valuable in the future,,,210.3,response,2,0,1
103,Farrah,I guess that's a good question,,,210.3,response,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"Okay, so",,,,remark,2,0,1
103,Farrah,You certainly have more spaceships,,,,response,2,0,1
103,Teacher,So see if you could find some evidence to support that it may be valuable in the future,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,Yeah,,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,See if you can look in your text and you and Oliver can work together because you guys are kind of on the same page too,,,130.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher," So let's think of it as, you know, maybe it's not great right now, but in the future",,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, It can be valuable,,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, yes Chris,,,130.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Chris, What was I gonna say,,,130.2,response,2,0,1
103,Chris," I was gonna say that, well, I guess what I found was that water can be broken down into two parts",,,130.2,response,2,0,1
103,Chris, So hydrogen and oxygen,,,130.2,response,2,0,1
103,Chris,"Um, yeah, I guess I was thinking like, Well, let's see",,,130.2,response,2,0,1
103,Chris," So I guess I was going to say that, like, yeah, that's stuff that also is useful",,,130.2,response,2,0,1
103,Teacher, And can you also see if you can find what you can use the broken down oxygen and hydrogen for and that can go along with your evidence,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, Chris,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"Good, so you're right, it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen",,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher, Now let's go a little bit further with that answer,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
103,Chris,"Oh, yeah, yeah",,,420.2,response,2,0,1
103,Chris, Okay,,,420.2,response,2,0,1
103,Teacher,"So, Luis, and Jazmin",,,120.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Teacher," You guys have been working together and Jazmin, are you able to re-evaluate your answer and maybe provide some more evidence?",,,120.1,remark,2,0,1
103,Jazmin,Yet so basically so and Luis was sharing his answer about how water can be split into two parts into oxygen and hydrogen,,,120.1,response,2,0,1
103,Jazmin," And unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,,response,2,0,1
103,Jazmin, And then you can also use hydrogen,,,,response,2,0,1
103,Jazmin,"so I guess like that was something that just says, like it was even more useful than just using the water like you can use water and then you can use oxygen",,,,response,2,0,1
103,Jazmin,"I just really wanted to thank for working with us and, like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you for like hearing all of our answers and really taking the time to listen to what each of us was saying",,,,response,2,0,1
103,Teacher, Yes,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher, Luis,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher,"Okay guys, so let's go ahead and review your answers",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Luis," So, um, I just wanted to say that, like, I don't think I need to be in this group because I already know",,,120.4,response,1,0,1
103,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,120.4,response,1,0,1
103,Luis, Like all about space,,,120.4,response,1,0,1
103,Teacher, Can you repeat your answer for me,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher," So, Luis I noticed that you when you answered",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher,"Well, let's review some answers",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher, Okay,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher, And then we'll see about that,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,120.4,response,1,0,1
103,Luis," So basically what I said was, um, Let's see, what did I say I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,120.4,response,1,0,1
103,Teacher,So the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher,"Okay, so you're right, they do use equipment and that was part of the question",,,110.2,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher, Luis,,,430.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,430.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher, Let's see if you can find the equipment that helped scientists to discover the water on the moon,,,430.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher, So instead of oxygen tanks,,,430.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher,Could you go back and look in your text and see if you can find a different kind of equipment,,,430.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,430.3,response,1,0,1
103,Luis, Is there somewhere I should be looking,,,430.3,response,1,0,1
103,Luis, Is there somewhere that because I'm not sure where to look,,,430.3,response,1,0,1
103,Teacher, Let's take a look at Section three and see if you can find it,,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher,"So, um, the sections are labeled 12345 and six",,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Luis,Okay,,,420.3,response,1,0,1
103,Teacher,"Okay, I'm gonna while you look, I'm going to go to Jazmin and look at Jazmin's answer so Jazmin",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher," Can you repeat your answer for me, please",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Jazmin,Yeah so i said NASA sent a small machine,,,120.4,response,1,0,1
103,Teacher," See ifyou can find equipment that helped scientist, the piece of equipment that scientists use to discover water",,,430.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher, That's a key word in the question is equipment,,,430.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher," This time, can you also look and see if you can find the equipment",,,430.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher, Does that make sense?,,,430.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher,"Okay, so you are right NASA did send a small machine, but instead of looking for the machine",,,430.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher, So we're looking,,,430.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher,now Chris,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher,So if you look back through your texts and see if you can look for that keyword equipment and then see if you can find the answer to the question,,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher, Can you repeat your answer for me,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,420.3,response,1,0,1
103,Chris," So I said, scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,420.3,response,1,0,1
103,Teacher, Can you find what equipment they use to find that water on the moon,,,430.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher," Okay, can you look back in your texts and see if you can actually find the equipment",,,430.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher, The same thing applies for yours,,,430.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher,"Okay, so they did that is true, they did find water on the moon, but now",,,430.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher,Yes Farrah/,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Farrah,On,,,120.4,response,1,0,1
103,Farrah," I was just wondering, because I guess I'm still not sure why my answer's wrong",,,120.4,response,1,0,1
103,Teacher,"Um, can you repeat your answer for me",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Farrah,"Yeah, so my answer was basically that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close",,,120.4,response,1,0,1
103,Teacher,"Um, yeah, I think, I think you have pretty good answer",,,110.1,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher,"What, we're going to look at the question",,,120.2,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher,So can you read your response,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher, The question was what equipment good scientist use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher, One more time Farrah a please,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Farrah,"Yeah, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close",,,120.4,response,1,0,1
103,Teacher,"Maybe instead of using the word tool we could use a different word, what would be another word that you can use",,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Farrah,"Well, I guess, like, I mean, I guess you could say, like, you know, you said equipment like definitely microscopes, you know, it's in a piece of equipment that they looked at, because the water was was microscopic right",,,210.3,response,1,0,1
103,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,130.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher,So maybe instead of tool you can use the word equipment to answer your question,,,130.3,remark,1,0,1
103,Farrah,"Yeah, I think so",,,130.3,response,1,0,1
103,Teacher,"Okay, so, Luis, did you discover how to, did you discover the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon?",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
103,Luis,"Um, well, I just kind of kept looking around and look what I was like I i looked in paragraph three",,,120.4,response,1,0,1
103,Luis," Like, it seems like there's a lot of equipment that they used",,,,response,1,0,1
103,Luis,"Looking but I was like, it looks like they use the microscope, but like, I don't know, like, did they use it to discover",,,,response,1,0,1
103,Teacher,"Okay, I'm Chris",,,110.1,remark,1,0,1
103,Chris, So I know that the scientists use like a lot of equipment that wasn't in the reading,,,110.1,response,1,0,1
103,Chris, But oxygen tanks and masks and suits and things like that,,,110.1,response,1,0,1
103,Chris,"Yeah, I, I kind of had that like because I went to NASA",,,110.1,response,1,0,1
103,Teacher,"So they do use a lot of things, but I was just wanting guys to look for these specific equipment that the scientists use to discover the water",,,410.2,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,410.2,remark,1,0,1
103,Chris,"Yeah, I think so",,,410.2,response,1,0,1
103,Chris," I guess I was wondering, like, did they did they not use suits or like, I guess I was just wondering, like, should we say from what we know or you know what I mean",,,410.2,response,1,0,1
103,Teacher, But I was just looking for a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon,,,410.2,remark,1,0,1
103,Teacher,"Yeah, so I mean you do have a point there that they used other things too",,,410.2,remark,1,0,1
103,Oliver, But thank you so much for working with us,,,410.2,response,1,0,1
103,Oliver,We unfortunately have to go to lunch,,,410.2,response,1,0,1
103,Oliver,"Hi, how are you",,,,response,0,0,1
103,Teacher,"Good, how are you",,,,remark,0,0,1
103,Oliver, We're excited to work with you,,,,response,0,0,1
103,Oliver,We're doing well,,,,response,0,0,1
103,Teacher,Excited to work with you too,,,,remark,0,0,1
103,Teacher,"Okay, so, Jazmin",,,,remark,0,0,1
103,Luis, And can I just kind of see just like one thing real quick,,,,response,0,0,1
103,Luis,"Oh, oh, I have a question",,,,response,0,0,1
103,Teacher,Sure,,,,remark,0,0,1
103,Luis,"Okay, so I like, I don't think I should be in this group because I already know all about space, like I know everything, practically, there is to know that I don't really need any help",,,,response,0,0,1
103,Teacher,"Well, I think that you can learn something from any of these four other students that you have in here",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
103,Teacher,"So, Jazmin with your answer",,,,remark,0,0,1
103,Teacher," Can you hear me, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,0,1
103,Jazmin,"Yes, I can hear you just fine",,,,response,0,0,1
103,Teacher,So you said that NASA sent a small machine,,,,remark,0,0,1
103,Teacher,Can you figure out what the name of that small machine is,,,230.2,remark,0,0,1
103,Jazmin,"Okay, so in paragraph two, NASA scientists small machine called Lunar Orbiter",,,230.2,response,0,0,1
103,Jazmin, So it says lunar orbiter right?,,,230.2,response,0,0,1
103,Teacher,Yes,,,110.4,remark,0,0,1
103,Jazmin,Great,,,110.4,response,0,0,1
103,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah?",,,,remark,0,0,1
103,Farrah,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,0,1
103,Farrah, So I don't really understand why I'm why my answer is wrong,,,,response,0,0,1
103,Farrah, So here's my question,,,,response,0,0,1
103,Teacher,"Well, it's not completely wrong",,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
103,Teacher,"Just, um, can you go into more detail about what else, what other equipment might be used, other than just a microscope?",,,230.2,remark,0,0,1
103,Farrah,"Well, I mean, I, I guess",,,230.2,response,0,0,1
103,Farrah," Yeah, but it seems like the microscope is like they can't see the water without the microscope, you know, like they have to be able to see it in order to study it",,,230.2,response,0,0,1
103,Teacher,Right,,,230.2,remark,0,0,1
103,Teacher," Um, but what did NASA have to send in order to use a microscope",,,230.2,remark,0,0,1
103,Farrah," It sounds like Jazmin, just like the Lunar Orbiter",,,230.2,response,0,0,1
103,Farrah,"Oh, well, they sent up",,,230.2,response,0,0,1
103,Teacher,"Right, so maybe include that with your answer in the microscope",,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
103,Teacher,Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
103,Teacher,"Yes, Oliver?",,,,remark,0,0,1
103,Oliver,So does that mean that they use both of them to discover the water or did the one of them discover it and one of them did something else? I'm a little confused,,,,response,0,0,1
103,Teacher,Alright,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
103,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,0,1
103,Jazmin,"Does that mean that my answer is wrong, like did the microscope do the discovering or was it the lunar orbiter?",,,,response,0,0,1
104,Teacher,"Okay, I'm ready",,,,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, Start simulation,,,,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,Hi everyone,,,,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,Hi,,,,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,1,1,3
104,Luis,"Yeah, I already know a lot about space",,,,response,1,1,3
104,Luis, So I should be honest,,,,response,1,1,3
104,Teacher, So how did scientists discover water on the moon,,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,"Okay, well do you know the answer to our question that we are talking about today",,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Luis," Um, well, they need like oxygen tanks and spacesuits in order to roll up to the moon",,,120.4,response,1,1,3
104,Luis,"Oh yeah, sure",,,120.4,response,1,1,3
104,Teacher," Yeah, they did",,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,Okay,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,"But how did they discover water on the moon, what things did they need to find the water",,,120.1,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, They need a lot of tools,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, They didn't need a lot of equipment to get up there because there's not a lot of oxygen,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
104,Luis,Hmm,,,230.3,response,1,1,3
104,Luis,I'm not sure,,,,response,1,1,3
104,Teacher,"Okay, so maybe if we look at the first few paragraphs",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher," So paragraphs one and two, you will find something specific that they used it was a type of machine",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, Did they use to find that water,,,120.1,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, It's kind of like a desert,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,So what machine,,,120.1,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,That they sent up there so that they can find water because the moon is very dry,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Luis,"Um, I don't know",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
104,Teacher," Let's look at paragraph two, we see in paragraph two, there's a Senate's about how NASA send a small machine called a",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,"Okay, let's see",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,What is that machine called,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Luis,Lunar Orbitre,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
104,Teacher, They had a hard time finding water unless they use that machine to help them search for it,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,"Yeah, so they sent that machine to investigate it will land on the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, So those ice deposits are made out of water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Luis," It's the same thing, right",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
104,Luis," Yeah, ice and water",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
104,Luis,"Right, yeah",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
104,Jazmin,Okay,,,,response,1,1,3
104,Jazmin,I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,1,1,3
104,Teacher,Okay,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, So you did have the small machine is what you said,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, Your answer was actually really close,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, So your answer was right on it to you just wanted to add some more detail to it,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,"But looking more specifically, you want to see if you can find the exact name of that machine and kind of be able to explain what that machine does",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
104,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.2,response,1,1,3
104,Teacher, Are there any more questions,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,Great,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
104,Farrah," So, um, I guess",,,150.1,response,1,1,3
104,Farrah," I don't know why my answers wrong, too",,,150.1,response,1,1,3
104,Farrah,"Well, um, I mean, I think that I had the right answer",,,150.1,response,1,1,3
104,Oliver," Um, I had the same answer as Farrah",,,,response,1,1,3
104,Oliver,Okay,,,,response,1,1,3
104,Teacher,"Yeah, so I understand",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher," And I feel like you guys were all around the answer, but we are we're looking more for specific answer",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,so like Farrah and Oliver you guys said that you needed a scientific,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,tool called a microscope,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,the microscope was actually to use just to see closer the water because the water was so tiny that they couldn't see it with their own eyes,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, The lunar orbiter was used to find the water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,But the microscope was used for something different,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, The small machine,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, So there's two different machines and equipment things that they used,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Oliver, Any other thing was used for something different,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
104,Oliver, One was used for to find the water,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
104,Oliver, Right,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
104,Oliver,Okay,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
104,Oliver, Which which one is the right one,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
104,Teacher,So the lunar orbiter was the correct one,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher," That is the small machine that they use to find the water, the microscope was used to look more closer to the water",,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
104,Farrah,"Oh, but I guess",,,130.3,response,1,1,3
104,Farrah, So how do you figure that out,,,130.3,response,1,1,3
104,Farrah," Is it just because you're the teacher, you know, you know,",,,130.3,response,1,1,3
104,Teacher, That's what the most important thing is so you need to read and be able to find your answers in the text,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, So I looked very closely to find the details that we were looking for,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,"Well, I look back at the paragraphs that you have to find your answer in the reading",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
104,Chris,Okay,,,150.1,response,1,1,3
104,Chris," Well, I went to NASA",,,150.1,response,1,1,3
104,Chris, And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,150.1,response,1,1,3
104,Teacher,"Yes, you're right",,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
104,Chris,"So, I mean, that feels like that could be like some tools that they would use to somebody equipment, you know,",,,110.4,response,1,1,3
104,Teacher,"Yes, and you are exactly right",,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, They do need a lot of those equipment tools to use to get up to space because without on they wouldn't have been able to get on the moon,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, So all those equipments,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher, But we was looking for the tool for water,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher," But remember, the question was just specifically asking how they discovered water",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher,"So yes, you're right",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
104,Teacher," Yes, they are very important to them so they didn't need them",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
104,Oliver,"Okay, okay, okay",,,210.2,response,1,1,3
104,Oliver, Thanks for working with us,,,210.2,response,1,1,3
104,Oliver," So thanks, teacher, it's time for us to go to lunch",,,210.2,response,1,1,3
104,Teacher,"Okay, thank you",,,,remark,1,1,3
104,All,Bye,,,,,1,1,3
104,Teacher,Hey guys,,,,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,"Alright, so",,,,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,What do you guys have questions about so,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,"What do you have to say, Luis",,,,remark,2,1,3
104,Luis,"Oh,",,,,response,2,1,3
104,Luis, I just wanted to remind you that my dad is an astronaut,,,,response,2,1,3
104,Luis,Not so much a question,,,,response,2,1,3
104,Teacher,"Oh really, that is awesome",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Luis,Yeah,,,110.1,response,2,1,3
104,Luis,That's why I know so much about space,,,,response,2,1,3
104,Luis, Okay,,,,response,2,1,3
104,Teacher,"Well, I am glad that you know a lot",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,What do you guys think about that,,,120.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Luis,Um well for me I dont know,,,120.1,response,2,1,3
104,Luis,convincing evidence?,,,,response,2,1,3
104,Teacher, So if you look at your passage you want to use the passage,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher," The second half, which is paragraphs four, five and six and find the details in the text that tell you that there's some actual evidence that water could be useful",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,So what do you guys think about that,,,230.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, Where is the evidence that might help you with this question,,,230.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,So why did you guys think that what was your opinion about that,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, You guys said know that you didn't think that there was any evidence to find water valuable,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,So I see that Oliver and Farrah,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher," Well,",,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Farrah,"I was just kind of thinking you know about the fact that, um, that it said that they need to come up with a plan for extracting the water so it seemed like",,,230.1,response,2,1,3
104,Farrah," So it seems like they got they there it's it's nowhere near ready, you know, there's got to be a lot of time left, since I got to have a plan and a study",,,,response,2,1,3
104,Farrah,And they need to study it,,,,response,2,1,3
104,Teacher,"Yes, and I completely agree",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, And that's what the passage said that it's going to take a long time but,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, It will take a long time,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher," For instance,",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher," It says, Is there convincing evidence that it could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,So how is the water in the passage like let me give you an example,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,In the question,,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,So when I'm looking for my answer you want to look for details that will tell you how the water is going to be valuable,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,"Like in paragraph five, there are a lot of examples about how the water could be valuable",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, How could it be used,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Jazmin,"Well, I thought that you know that they could, like, make them own garden, you know, and so they could grow vegetables and pinks",,,210.4,response,2,1,3
104,Teacher, You said how it was definitely important to have the water because they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, You definitely can't,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,"Yes, that's a good idea and I seen in your answer",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, That is very true,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, So it is very valuable to have the water,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, And he said that it was heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,"Also see where Chris, he added, kind of onto your answer",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,That is true,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, It explains how hydrogen and oxygen could be split apart and they could use hydrogen for rocket fuel,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher," Also, because in the passage",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, Yeah,,,110.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,"And they can use the water for other things like a garden, like you said, so yes",,,110.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,So it is very valuable and you guys are all giving me good answers on that,,,110.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Oliver," And it says,",,,110.4,response,2,1,3
104,Oliver,"I was in paragraph one, it says, water is heavy",,,110.4,response,2,1,3
104,Oliver,That future astronauts could drink this water,,,,response,2,1,3
104,Teacher," And you're right, and then also Luis also explain how the hydrogen oxygen can be split",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,So you guys are all given really good details,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,Yes,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,But we want to say give like an a yes or no question,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, If you think that it is valuable and all of your details put together does say yes it is valuable because they can use it for surviving,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,So you guys are given really good details for that,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,"They can use it for rocket fuel, it can be split apart",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Jazmin,So my answer is right?,,,310.1,response,2,1,3
104,Teacher,but you guys were right there at it so so,,,110.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, So you want to say yes it's valuable because of all the things that you were saying,,,430.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,You guys are all close but you want to get an exact answer,,,430.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, So you want to expand your answer a little bit,,,430.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Chris,"What I say yes it's valuable cause it's heavy, and they don't have to carry it in ships",,,110.2,response,2,1,3
104,Teacher, And you can also say how it's important that it will help them be able to survive because they need that water,,,130.3,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,Yes,,,130.3,remark,2,1,3
104,Jazmin,So I would say yes it's valuable because you need water to drink,,,130.3,response,2,1,3
104,Teacher,"Yes, and you need water to survive",,,110.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher," Yes, you're right",,,110.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Chris,"Yeah, I also know, like you said that water splits into oxygen and hydrogen",,,110.4,response,2,1,3
104,Teacher," That was a detail from the text, but the reason that they split it apart is so that oxygen can be used",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, And you're right,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,Yes,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,For other things,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, So they split that up apart so that they can use it for different things,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, And then the hydro Jen can actually be used for rocket fuel,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, So they breathe the oxygen,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Farrah,"Oh wow, okay",,,210.4,response,2,1,3
104,Farrah,I guess,,,,response,2,1,3
104,Farrah,I hear what you're saying about why Chris and Jazmin are right,,,,response,2,1,3
104,Farrah,But I guess I don't know where they found the answer,,,,response,2,1,3
104,Farrah, Okay,,,,response,2,1,3
104,Farrah, How did they do that,,,,response,2,1,3
104,Teacher,So I feel like it's more of your opinion based on the details and the facts that are in your passage,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,So you guys you in depth said no and then Jazmin and Chris said yes,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, And then Luis kind of gave some details,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,So it's more of your opinion based on what they gave you in the passage,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,So you have to use all those details,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, So about hydrogen and oxygen about how water is you can serve can't survive without water,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,So they're using all those background knowledge tips in order to help them find the answer to,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Farrah,So they're using their background knowledge so me and Oliver get it because we don't know as much about space as then,,,150.1,response,2,1,3
104,Teacher,"Maybe, but you can also use the passage",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher,So if you read and you look for those details and you can also get the answer to,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, Remember to so you can use your reading passage to help you figure out how it would be valuable,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
104,Oliver,All,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
104,Oliver," OK, I think, I think I understand",,,420.2,response,2,1,3
104,Oliver," Oh, OK",,,420.2,response,2,1,3
104,Oliver," Well, I guess, all of us that we should um",,,,response,2,1,3
104,Oliver,"So it's time for us to go to lunch, but I did want to say thank you for kind of explaining what me and Farrah need to work on",,,,response,2,1,3
104,Oliver,"Keep reading the passage course I'm even though we don't know as much about spaces Chris and Luis, they weren't right either because they needed to put all their ideas together",,,,response,2,1,3
104,Teacher,"Yes, and just expand your answers",,,,remark,2,1,3
104,Teacher, That's the best that you can do,,,,remark,2,1,3
104,Oliver, Okay,,,,response,2,1,3
104,Oliver," Okay, thank you so much teacher",,,,response,2,1,3
104,Oliver,"Okay, expand our answers",,,,response,2,1,3
104,All,Bye,,,,,2,1,3
104,Teacher, And then I feel like the rest of you did find pieces of the passage that made sense,,,,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher, But we couldn't seem to find the exact same answer,,,,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"Alright, so I noticed that Farrah and Oliver you both had pretty close answers",,,,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher," So you were close also, but there that small machine had a name, and we need to find that exact name in the passage",,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"It was a small machine, Jazmin",,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"So if you all would look at paragraph two, it has a two labeled",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"In the first sentence, it actually says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher, This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher, So this is the machine that actually went and explored,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,Does everybody see that sentence,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
104,Luis," I have a quick question, though",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
104,Luis,"Ah, yeah, I see it",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
104,Teacher, Luis?,,,,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,1,3
104,Luis, I don't think I should be in this group because I already know like so much about space that I don't really think I need like any help with this,,,,response,0,1,3
104,Luis,"Um, okay",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Luis, So here's the thing,,,,response,0,1,3
104,Luis," I think I already know, like a lot about this stuff",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Teacher, Did you know the name of this orbiter?,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher," That was a really cool answer that you gave, but as you see there was more information that we always can learn that we didn't know before",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher," I did notice that you you pointed out, the oxygen tanks",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,Yeah a lot,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
104,Luis," But, um, so I guess no",,,110.2,response,0,1,3
104,Luis,"Well, I guess I didn't really like do the reading exactly",,,110.2,response,0,1,3
104,Luis, I kind of just like had my knowledge,,,110.2,response,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"Yeah, well, we always have a good background knowledge of space",,,220.1,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher," And that's really cool that you're interested in it, but we can always learn new names for machinery and things like that",,,220.1,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher, So that's why we read this passage together in hopes that you would learn more,,,220.1,remark,0,1,3
104,Luis,"Okay, gotcha",,,220.1,response,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"Um, so does anybody remember what the name of that machine was called",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"Jazmin, do you remember the name",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
104,Jazmin, I saw that in paragraph two NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,120.4,response,0,1,3
104,Jazmin,"Yeah, okay I think so, when we were rereading",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"Yes, perfect",,,,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher, Good job,,,,remark,0,1,3
104,Jazmin,"So, um",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah?",,,,remark,0,1,3
104,Farrah," Um, so it I was saying that it was the microscope that discovered the water",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Farrah, I'm not sure like what my answer is wrong,,,,response,0,1,3
104,Farrah,"Okay, so here's the thing though",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"Okay, yeah, I understand you were really close",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,I've seen that you remembered a detail from the passage,,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,but it wasn't the exact answer that was to the question your answer would have been so there was a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water,,,410.1,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"So, you were almost right, but the machine itself that they used was called a lunar orbiter",,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher, And that's what they used to see the ice deposits,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
104,Farrah,"Oh, so like they like found it using the Lunar Orbiter and then they used the microscope like like to see it",,,130.3,response,0,1,3
104,Teacher," Um, so yeah, good job",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"Yeah, they looked at it really close with the microscope",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher," So you weren't exactly wrong, there was just a more specific answer",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,Chris?,,,,remark,0,1,3
104,Chris," So like, here's my thinking, like man, like so",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Chris," My dad like took me to NASA and we checked out like all these different exhibits and stuff like that, which was awesome",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Chris," But like, here's the thing",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Chris," Like, um,",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Chris," They have to use like oxygen tanks and um like,",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Chris,"Like, like what Luis was saying like, so I know that they have to use like the astronauts when they go out on the moon",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Chris," So like I guess I'm wondering, like, isn't that what they used to discover the to discover the the the water",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Chris,"You know, like spacesuits and fuel",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Teacher, So you have to have those tanks to help you breathe,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"Well, it definitely helped them because you know in space",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher, So that was one equipment that they did use,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher, There's not a lot of oxygen,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher, And you using context clues to find that exact name for that equipment,,,430.3,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,But they also had to use the more specific tool to look at the water itself,,,430.3,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher," So yeah, you guys all had similar good answers, but you wanted to dig a little deeper to find the exact answer",,,430.3,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,Jazmin?,,,,remark,0,1,3
104,Jazmin,"Yeah, so I was wondering, with my very first answer, when I said it was the small machine, why was that not right?",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Teacher,but again you want to use context clues to find the exact name of that small machine,,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"Well, that was right too",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher," When we find,",,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher, Oliver?,,,510.1,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"When we're given questions we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are, the more sense that they make later on",,,510.1,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher," So yeah, you were partially right you want to look for that name",,,510.1,remark,0,1,3
104,Oliver, I just wanted to thank you for working with us,,,510.1,response,0,1,3
104,Oliver," So, um, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,510.1,response,0,1,3
104,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,510.1,response,0,1,3
104,Oliver, Like sometimes,,,510.1,response,0,1,3
104,Oliver, But before we went to lunch,,,510.1,response,0,1,3
104,Oliver," He says, we give him stress hives and you were so thoughtful",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Oliver," In the way that you like, um like Luis I'm not sure he did the reading",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Oliver,We really frustrate our science teacher,,,,response,0,1,3
104,Oliver,And I feel like I'm you really were were kind with his answer and really helped like all of our answers,,,,response,0,1,3
104,Oliver, So it was really neat to like listen to each other's answers,,,,response,0,1,3
104,Oliver,"Like worked on one another tp kind of get a group answer together, which was pretty cool because like sometimes we don't always listen to each other",,,,response,0,1,3
104,Oliver, Thanks to the way you were teaching us,,,,response,0,1,3
104,Oliver, So just wanted to thank you,,,,response,0,1,3
104,Teacher,"Well, thank you guys",,,,remark,0,1,3
104,Teacher, You guys did a great job,,,,remark,0,1,3
105,Oliver,Hi,,,,response,0,1,3
105,Teacher,Hello,,,,remark,0,1,3
105,Oliver,How are you,,,,response,0,1,3
105,Teacher,"I'm good, how are you",,,,remark,0,1,3
105,Oliver,"We're good, we're discussing um what equipment ID scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Teacher, And what equipment did they use,,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher,Perfect,,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher,Luis?,,,,remark,0,1,3
105,Luis,"Um, okay",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Luis, So I don't think I really need the help,,,,response,0,1,3
105,Luis, And so like I kind of like have all this knowledge,,,,response,0,1,3
105,Luis, So here's the thing,,,,response,0,1,3
105,Luis," Like, I basically know like all about space",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Luis," Um, I think that um I should really be in this group, because I don't really need any help",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Teacher,"Well, you might not need help, but you might be able to help me help the rest of the group",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
105,Luis,Okay,,,,response,0,1,3
105,Teacher,and you'll be able to share all your knowledge,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
105,Luis,That sounds good,,,110.3,response,0,1,3
105,Teacher,"Alright, so let's see",,,,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher," Like, how did you come up with your answer",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher,"Jazmin, could you explain your answer to the rest of the group",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
105,Jazmin,"Okay, so my answer was the NASA scientists small machine and I noticed that in the reading",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
105,Jazmin,That they they had that that was a piece of equipment that was used to discover water,,,,response,0,1,3
105,Jazmin, Like they uses the the machine to go in like to find the water,,,,response,0,1,3
105,Teacher,"All right, Farrah",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher," I noticed you said that the scientists were using a microscope, um, could you and Oliver try and explain why you picked microscope?",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
105,Farrah," Okay, so basically the microscope",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
105,Farrah,"Um, yeah",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
105,Farrah," So I, I thought you have to be able to see the water in order to discover it",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Farrah,"So I was looking at paragraph three, and they said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Farrah, So I said the microscope,,,,response,0,1,3
105,Teacher,"That is, that's a very interesting take and it's actually my first read through and answering the question, I thought the same thing",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher,"But I kind of agree with Jazmin and saying that they just they brought the machine from the second paragraph to the moon and that machine, helped them look into those craters",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher, But then the microscope helps you more analyze the water that they already found,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
105,Farrah,"So, um, yeah, it's it's speaking to me since I think, but I'm not quite sure why my answer is wrong because didn't they have to use the microscope to discover it?",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
105,Teacher,So the way I looked at it was NASA send their small machine out to the moon and they analyze those craters and they found water,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher," And I think the piece of using the microscope was for if I traveled to the moon with them and wanted to see the water for myself, I would have to check under the microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher,But the small machine did it without having to send people out there,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
105,Farrah, Okay,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
105,Farrah,"Oh, gotcha",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
105,Teacher,Chris?,,,,remark,0,1,3
105,Chris," Like, I'm kind of thinking like, um, so I went to NASA with my dad and we went and looked at all the equipment and stuff",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Chris," So, like, here's the thing",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Chris,"Yeah, okay",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Chris, So I guess like did they not use those things?,,,,response,0,1,3
105,Chris," So I know that there's a lot of, there's like a lot of equipment that they use like spacesuits and oxygen tanks and masks and stuff",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Teacher,That is very,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher,A very good way to look at that,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher,Teacher:I feel like the way the question was phrased,,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher,"Because yes, they would use all of that  but",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher," They were specifically talking about the Oliverice that discovered the water, not the behind the scenes like um",,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher, Um like a refrigerator,,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher,Kind of how I think about it,,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher,"If somebody asked you what keeps your food cold use that you would say like the refrigerator, you wouldn't say the plug that plugs into the outlet that supplies the power",,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
105,Chris,"Okay, okay, I think",,,140.1,response,0,1,3
105,Chris,"Oh, I should probably read the the reading like a little closer maybe",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Teacher,"Yeah, the reading and the question",,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher, I feel like is a little bit more specific on what discovered the water because you could also argue that the astronaut discovered the water,,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher,Because the question,,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
105,Chris, You know what I mean?,,,210.2,response,0,1,3
105,Chris,"Yeah, yeah, I guess you could like, and I guess it's like, um, I guess just wondering, like, did the astronaut go or was it like an unmanned probe",,,210.2,response,0,1,3
105,Teacher,"Right, exactly",,,,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher,"All right before our little time is up and we need a good clear, concise answer",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher, Anyone have one that they would like to share?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
105,Teacher,Jazmin?,,,,remark,0,1,3
105,Jazmin,Yes,,,,response,0,1,3
105,Jazmin," Okay, so, the question was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Jazmin,"And the scientists used a small machine to discover the water on the moon, and they use the microscope um, wait, Oliver can you help?",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Oliver," So basically,",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Oliver,"Yeah, so, um, yeah",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Oliver,"They, they use the small machine to discover the water and they use the microscope to like study it",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,0,1,3
105,Jazmin,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Jazmin,"Basically, we have to go to lunch, but I just, I just wanted to thank you really quickly for working with us today, and specifically like you really were patient with everybody",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Jazmin, Like sometimes,,,,response,0,1,3
105,Jazmin,We give like our science teacher like he says they're stress hives and I feel like,,,,response,0,1,3
105,Jazmin, So do you think thank you so much,,,,response,0,1,3
105,Jazmin,You were really patient with us,,,,response,0,1,3
105,Jazmin," And you also they were really interested in our answers like even when we weren't like totally correct or like we were sort of figuring it out like you really listen to all of us, which is kind of cool",,,,response,0,1,3
105,Teacher,You're very welcome,,,,remark,0,1,3
105,Luis, I already know all about space,,,,response,1,1,3
105,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group",,,,response,1,1,3
105,Teacher,"Sorry, who was talking?",,,,remark,1,1,3
105,Luis,"That was me, Luis",,,,response,1,1,3
105,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,"Well, Luis if you already know a lot about space",,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, Can you go ahead and explain why you pick the answer that you did,,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
105,Luis, And so they're gonna need oxygen tanks to go on the moon to do,,,230.1,response,1,1,3
105,Luis," Okay, so I was talking about how scientists need a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, you know, cuz they can't breathe on the moon",,,230.1,response,1,1,3
105,Luis,"Yeah, sure",,,230.1,response,1,1,3
105,Luis,"Any type of exploration, you know,",,,,response,1,1,3
105,Luis,"Um, did you hear my answer teacher or do you want me to say it again",,,,response,1,1,3
105,Teacher, So we need oxygen,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,"I heard up until where you said the, you know, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, because they can't breathe in space",,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
105,Luis, You can't go to the Mon without an oxygen tank,,,230.3,response,1,1,3
105,Luis,"Yeah, exactly",,,230.3,response,1,1,3
105,Teacher,"You're, you know what, you're not wrong, but I'm a little confused on how the oxygen tank helped them discover the water on the moon",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher," Because to me, they knew the oxygen tanks to get to space and to be able to survive in space",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, I don't see how oxygen tanks discovered the water,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Luis,"Well, I mean they can't walk around on the moon without oxygen tanks to breathe",,,410.2,response,1,1,3
105,Teacher, I think the question was a little bit wanting more specifics on what Oliverice actually discovered the water,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,Right,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, I don't think the intention is for it to discover water,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,The point of the oxygen tank is to supply oxygen to the astronauts,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Luis,Yeah yeah now,,,410.2,response,1,1,3
105,Luis, Okay,,,410.2,response,1,1,3
105,Jazmin,Teacher,,,,response,1,1,3
105,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,1,3
105,Jazmin,I don't know why my answer is wrong,,,,response,1,1,3
105,Teacher,NASA sent a small machine,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, It's just a little bit incomplete,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,So I don't know How it was really marked wrong because I think to me,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,Because they did send a small machine called think I was a probe Or something,,,110.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, It was lacking a just I'll just a small detail on what specific machine they sent,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,So I would say that your answer was just a little bit incomplete,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Jazmin,"Okay, I guess I thought we were all here cuz our answers were wrong",,,410.2,response,1,1,3
105,Jazmin, I thought that's why the teacher told us to come to this small group,,,410.2,response,1,1,3
105,Teacher,"Okay, I think we just wanted to have just a deeper discussion",,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, So what equipment did scientist us to discover a water feel like we just wanted to have a just a discussion on what we all thought the answers were,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,"And the, the question",,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,"Because some of us are, you know, technically correct, but not not super correct like Luis over there said oxygen tanks",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher," Now that is equipment and it did help them, you know, get to The moon to discover the water, but he needed to be a little bit more specific on the actual equipment that discovered the water",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, We just need that extra bit of  I guess what specific machine,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,And your answer said they sent a small machine which is true,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, It's a little bit more detailed than Luis's,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,"And I'm sure that Farrah and Oliver might be thinking, well, I picked a specific tool",,,130.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,They said that they wanted a microscope,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,"Yeah, Chris",,,,remark,1,1,3
105,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,1,1,3
105,Chris,I went to NASA,,,,response,1,1,3
105,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, And could you discover water with that specific tool,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, Could you go into space,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,I think that they're wanting a specific like like I think they're trying to get the very specific tool like if they handed you a tool right now,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,"You might have all that equipment and you might need all that equipment to get there, but I think the question is actually asking for, if I was holding that tool in my hand right now, would it discover water",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, So my suggestion to all of you would be to maybe,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,"So, back to you",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher," Svannah and Oliver the microscope helps them look closer at the water, but the microscope itself didn't actually discover the water",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,"Okay, sorry",,,,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, It keeps cutting out,,,,remark,1,1,3
105,Oliver,You were about to tell us your suggestion to all of us,,,,response,1,1,3
105,Teacher, Is that I would read the questions first,,,420.1,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,Yeah,,,420.1,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, Then I'd read the passage,,,420.1,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, So my suggestion when you are reading a prompt and answering questions,,,420.1,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,"You read the read the question first, maybe look at some key words",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher," And then I'm going to read the passage and maybe highlight or circle any equipment that I see as I am reading, and then go back to the question and read it again",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, So equipment,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher," So, all right, I'm looking for equipment when I go to read",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, So like this question,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher," So go back to all the circle answers that you pick and pick which one you think best answers the question,",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher, This help discover water on the moon,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,So what equipment,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher,I think,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Teacher," I think everybody had you know, good effort on answering the question, but I think we all could have answered the question better and more specific",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
105,Oliver, Oh,,,410.2,response,1,1,3
105,Oliver,Okay,,,410.2,response,1,1,3
105,Oliver," Um, but thank you for taking the time to work with us",,,,response,1,1,3
105,Oliver,"I just looked at the time, and it's time for us to go to lunch",,,,response,1,1,3
105,Teacher,Hello,,,,remark,2,1,3
105,Luis,"Hi, I just want to remind you, my dad is an astronaut",,,,response,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"Well, that's really cool",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,Yeah Luis,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Luis,I know a lot about space,,,110.1,response,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"Oh, that's really cool",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"Well, fun fact, when I was in first grade",,,140.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, I wanted to be an astronaut,,,140.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher," But, you know, that was my goal",,,140.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, So obviously I didn't live up to that,,,140.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Chris,RER: You're a really good teacher,,,140.1,response,2,1,3
105,Teacher," So real quick, I'm just clarifying what the question is really asking",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"because the question said is there convincing evidence that, you know, water is valuable and",,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,Okay,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, You know why its valuable,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher," It says, water is a valuable resource and then they list a whole bunch of reasons",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,In the actual passage,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher," So I think the question is really asking is, are you convinced that there that is valuable",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"And I think that three of you Chris Jazmin and even I think you all had said yes it's valuable and you gave one of their reasons, and I think that was great",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, So I want to know from either of you why you say there was not enough to convince you that the water is valuable,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"But I'm a little concerned with Farrah and Oliver on your responses, because you both said no, there was not convincing evidence",,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Oliver,Okay,,,230.1,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver,But it's not,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver," It's not ready yet, because I'm one you look in paragraph paragraph six it says making this plan will take a lot of time and money",,,,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver," Do you think it would be a good investment, you'll decide, well, no, it's not ready cause it'll take a lot of time and money",,,,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver, It's my answer,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver,"Um, they need to study the moon surface and built new equipment",,,,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver," So, so, no",,,,response,2,1,3
105,Teacher,I like that you said no because it's going to take a lot you know of time and money,,,410.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher," The question was, is water valueable",,,410.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, But the question you answered was do you think you would be a good investment,,,410.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"Because I agree with you that no, maybe it's not a good investment",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,because one,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, We have a lot of water here on Earth,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, So why do we want water from the moon and to um,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, But I do think water is valuable,,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"And two, that's a lot of time time and money and as a, as a teacher, and we know we don't have a lot of money",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, Nancy Jazmin,,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, Why would we want to spend extra money on something we already have,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, Yes,,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,So I would agree with you say that's not a good investment,,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,2,1,3
105,Jazmin,"Well, I also think that he could use water to grow things so we can have a moon garden on the moon",,,,response,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"We could, and then I guess you would say that it would be a good investment because they would could grow things out side of the planet, but",,,110.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"Would it be on me, I guess, what kind of space plant would it be because Earth plants need oxygen to or, I guess, carbon dioxide that we give off",,,130.3,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, So I'm not sure if that's a space for them to grow,,,130.3,remark,2,1,3
105,Jazmin,"Yeah, that's a good point",,,130.3,response,2,1,3
105,Jazmin, I didn't think of how the heck,,,130.3,response,2,1,3
105,Teacher,Let's see,,,,remark,2,1,3
105,Jazmin,I don't know if you still wanted to talk to Farrah and Oliver,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Jazmin," But, well, I think that my answer was a good answer",,,,response,2,1,3
105,Teacher,Your answer was what?,,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
105,Jazmin, I think I had the right answer,,,120.4,response,2,1,3
105,Jazmin,Good,,,120.4,response,2,1,3
105,Jazmin, So why am I in this group,,,120.4,response,2,1,3
105,Jazmin, I said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated,,,120.4,response,2,1,3
105,Jazmin, You can't survive without water and and that's true and they talk about in the first paragraph that astronauts could drink the water,,,120.4,response,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"Um, well, as I said for the first question I think we were put in a group, just to have some discussion because everybody's answer was different",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, So I think that you justified your answer and,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"So I think that you and Chris and Luis All said that, yes, it's valuable and then you gave a reason why you thought it was valuable",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"So I mean he's not wrong,",,,110.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,but he could have been a little bit more specific to the question he was answering,,,420.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,And I spoke to Oliver,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, So he justified his answer,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher," I don't think you may answer the actual question of water being valuable, but I think we all had",,,410.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"Because he answered, whether it was a good investment",,,410.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, So I wouldn't say that you are wrong because it says one are valuable,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher," You said yeah and then you pulled your evidence from the text, so I would asy that your answer is right",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"Um, I think we all had our reasons and justified our reason",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,Chris?,,,,remark,2,1,3
105,Jazmin,"Great, great",,,,response,2,1,3
105,Chris," Okay, from the story",,,,response,2,1,3
105,Chris,I just thought of something else,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Chris, Hydrogen and Oxygen,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Chris,Water can be broken down into two parts,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Teacher, Now he could have extended his answer a little bit more,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, He said it could be useful because it can be broken down,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"Yeah, and that's what Luis said",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,And said what is valuable about breaking it down,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,And the text says that it can be used as rocket fuel,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
105,Oliver,I don't think I saw that part,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
105,Chris,I don't remember that part either honestly,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Chris,rocket fuel,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Chris,Oh yeah it does it says it right here,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Chris, You're right,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Jazmin,Where do you see that Chris,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Chris," It says, oxygen, hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel",,,,response,2,1,3
105,Chris,Middle of the paragraph,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver,"Oh, OK",,,,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver, OK,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver,So I just have to add that sentence to my answer,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver, And then my answer is OK?,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver,All I have to do is add the thing about rocket fuel to my answer,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver, That's it?,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver, Water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and they make rocket fuel,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Teacher,That's the only thing I would have done,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"I mean, the question was really yes or no and you just gave like yes, it can be broken down",,,430.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, And if I were reading it Or grading the question I'd want to know what's valuable about the water being able to be broken down,,,430.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, I think that was a pretty good and complete answer because she gave the value,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"But I think that Jazmin's answer, And she said,Yeah, because they can drink the water and they can stay hydrated",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher, So that's the only thing I would add to your answer,,,430.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,"and you gave it how it could be valuable, but maybe not so much how it was used",,,430.2,remark,2,1,3
105,Teacher,Of the water and how the water could be used,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
105,Oliver,"Okay, okay",,,310.1,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver," Um, but even didn't answer the question, but he needed more details and his answer",,,,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver," Um, I did want to say all thank you for explaining what all of us need it to work on",,,,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver," I'm like, I know that I didn't answer the right question",,,,response,2,1,3
105,Oliver,It's time for us to go to lunch,,,,response,2,1,3
105,Teacher,No,,,,remark,2,1,3

106,Oliver, If you were looking like right at it so that made me think that you had to use a microscope to find the water that to discover the water,,,,response,1,0,2
106,Oliver, Okay,,,,response,1,0,2
106,Oliver,You wouldn't even be able to see the water,,,,response,1,0,2

107,Luis, I don't need any help with anything,,,,response,0,0,2
107,Luis, So here's the thing,,,,response,0,0,2
107,Luis," So, like, I don't think I really need to be here",,,,response,0,0,2

107,Luis, If you're going to go up into space and like you're out,,,110.1,response,0,0,2
107,Luis," Okay, so what I know from my like understanding and like my reading and everything I know about space is that you have to have like an oxygen tank and you have to have a space suits and like all that stuff",,,110.1,response,0,0,2
107,Teacher,"Right, you do have to have those things are question is about what the equipment, the scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher," If they're on the moon we know that they're using the oxygen tanks and stuff like that, but what did they need to use to find out about the water on the moon",,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher,Can you tell me a little bit more about that,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
107,Luis,Maybe I didn't,,,230.1,response,0,0,2
107,Luis, Maybe I didn't really read the text very much because I kind of knew about space,,,230.1,response,0,0,2
107,Teacher,"Okay, so do you see why it's important to make sure to read all of the information before we try to answer the question",,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
107,Luis,Yeah,,,420.2,response,0,0,2
107,Luis,"Yeah, I think so",,,,response,0,0,2
107,Teacher,"Okay, so let's go back and talk about it",,,,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher,"It said that scientists found that there's evidence of water really deep in them, in the moon's craters, but that when they sent the machine up there to look for those ice that it was tiny, tiny little droplets that you can only see with a microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher,So what can you tell me from that information that I just gave you what other tools they might be using to learn about the water on the moon?,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher,"Farrah, can you help him out there?",,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
107,Farrah,So I think that they they use the microscope to discover the water like that's how they they found it,,,130.2,response,0,0,2
107,Farrah," So I'm not really sure like why is my answer, like um not right",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
107,Teacher,"Um, but can you tell me why they needed a microscope to find this water",,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher,Your answer is very right they did use a microscope,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
107,Farrah," So, in paragraph three, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,110.2,response,0,0,2
107,Farrah, Okay,,,110.2,response,0,0,2
107,Farrah,Oh yeah,,,110.2,response,0,0,2
107,Farrah, You can't see it without microscope,,,110.2,response,0,0,2
107,Farrah, So you have to see it,,,110.2,response,0,0,2
107,Teacher, And you look back in the text to find your answer and to get all the information,,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher,Very good,,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher, That's absolutely right,,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher,"Can anybody else answer that question, though, why did they need a microscope to see the water",,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher," Was there a lot of water in the craters, or was there, just a little bit of water in the craters?",,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
107,Chris,"Yeah, so I thought",,,210.3,response,0,0,2
107,Chris," So I think they, um, they just wanted to study more closely because there's a bunch of water",,,,response,0,0,2
107,Chris,I think there's a lot of water in the craters,,,,response,0,0,2
107,Teacher,"Okay, so let's go back to our text",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher,"And in paragraph two, the very last sentence, it says these icy deposits are very small",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher, Does it seem like we have a lot of water or a little bit of water?,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher,"So, I see deposits are very small",,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
107,Chris, So maybe it's not like full of water,,,230.2,response,0,0,2
107,Chris,I guess maybe not very much water,,,230.2,response,0,0,2
107,Teacher, We just need to make sure what we're looking back in our information to make sure we can find the right answers,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher, You're absolutely right,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher,Right,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2

107,Teacher,Can you tell me why you thought it was a small machine,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
107,Jazmin," Okay, so in paragraph two, in the first sentence, it says a NASA sent a small machine called a lunar oribtor to investigate",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
107,Jazmin,Yeah,,,230.1,response,0,0,2
107,Teacher,Good job,,,110.4,remark,0,0,2

107,Jazmin,"That's what, that's what I think cuz is like investigate's like discover",,,110.4,response,0,0,2
107,Teacher, And so we can also collaborate and talk about what that small machine did right?,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
107,Jazmin,"Yeah, yeah",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
107,Teacher,So that's one thing that they used,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2

107,Chris, And when I went to NASA with my dad like I saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that,,,,response,0,0,2
107,Chris," So, um, did they not use those things?",,,,response,0,0,2
107,Teacher,"Just because it's not in the text doesn't mean that it wasn't being used because we kind of know, like you said, you saw that they use those things to be in space and so it talks about that NASA sent a small machine",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher,That NASA sent a small machine,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher, Does that make sense?,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
107,Teacher, It didn't say that it sent the astronauts to space,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2

108,Teacher,Yes?,,,,remark,0,0,2
108,Farrah,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but I don't understand why my answer's wrong",,,,response,0,0,2
108,Teacher,"Let's figure answers Farrah, so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, you are correct Miss savanna, you need a microscope to look very closely",,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
108,Teacher,But what did they use to discover it with before they saw the microscope,,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
108,Farrah,Before they saw the microscope?,,,210.3,response,0,0,2
108,Teacher,"Yeah, before they had the microscope they have to use what to discover it?",,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
108,Farrah,"Well, normally use the microscope to see the things, um,",,,210.3,response,0,0,2
108,Teacher,"Yeah, let's look at number two, that paragraph number two again read that first sentence for me",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
108,Farrah,Um NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
108,Farrah,Keep reading or stop there?,,,,response,0,0,2
108,Teacher,Stop right there,,,410.1,remark,0,0,2
108,Teacher," So although you're, you are correct with you need a microscope to look at her really closely, what it equip-- They're asking what equipment do the scientists use to disover it",,,410.1,remark,0,0,2
108,Teacher, But did they discover the water with the microscope?,,,410.1,remark,0,0,2
108,Teacher,"So they use the microscope, microscope isn't equipment that they looked at really closely with the water",,,410.1,remark,0,0,2
108,Chris," So I know that like scientists use a lot of equipment like um oxygen tanks, well Ehtan said that one, and like masks",,,410.1,response,0,0,2
108,Chris, They have to wear a mask because they can't breathe in space,,,410.1,response,0,0,2
108,Chris,"Um, I went to NASA with my dad",,,410.1,response,0,0,2
108,Chris, So that's all like the stuff that they wear is equipment too,,,,response,0,0,2

108,Oliver,"It said, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
108,Teacher,So what is it asking us,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
108,Oliver,For the kind of equipment that the scientists used,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
108,Teacher,"Yes, it's asking for this equipment the scientist use but not just the equipment, the scientists use, but the equipment the scientists used for what?",,,210.1,remark,0,0,2
108,Oliver,"Um, equipment scientistis used to discover water on the moon",,,210.1,response,0,0,2
108,Teacher,So it's using the equipment to do what?,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
108,Oliver,To discover the water,,,230.2,response,0,0,2
108,Teacher,All right,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2

108,Oliver,Um,,,230.2,response,0,0,2
108,Oliver," Oh yeah, I guess it says that you use a microscope to look at the water",,,,response,0,0,2
108,Oliver, All right,,,,response,0,0,2
108,Oliver,"Oh, okay",,,,response,0,0,2
108,Oliver," And it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch, but I do want to say thank you for helping me to look really closely at the question, cuz I didn't, I didn't realize I missed part of a question",,,,response,0,0,2

108,Teacher, Did you find that in the text Jazmin,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
108,Jazmin,"Hmm, I guess, well, I was just thinking about what you could do with water, and seeing it's not really in there, I was just thinking that if you could use the water that's one thing",,,210.2,response,2,0,2
108,Jazmin, I was looking at,,,210.2,response,2,0,2
108,Jazmin,Um lets see,,,210.2,response,2,0,2
108,Teacher,"I like how you're thinking about that how you're thinking about what you could use on the moon, even thought it's not in there, that's a very good pull from what you read, Jazmin",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
108,Teacher, I want you to underline two things and raise your hand,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2

108,Chris," Okay, um, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen, which is a big deal",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
108,Teacher," How, what can I use the hydrogen and oxygen for",,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
108,Teacher,And why is that a big deal,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
108,Chris,"Well, you could show you can breathe oxygen and you can drink the water that's a big deal",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
108,Teacher,That's right,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
108,Teacher," Where did you find that in the passage, show us where you found that",,,230.2,remark,2,0,2

108,Chris,"It says, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts could breathe the oxygen",,,,response,2,0,2
108,Chris," Oh, and you could use it as rocket fuel",,,,response,2,0,2
108,Teacher,"Right, so they can use the oxygen to breathe and then they can use the hydrogen as or do you want to add to that Oliver?",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2

109,Luis, And then I also know that there isn't any oxygen in space,,,,response,0,1,3
109,Luis," Okay, well, I know that in order for the astronauts to go up into space they have to be on a space shuttle",,,,response,0,1,3
109,Luis,um okay,,,,response,0,1,3
109,Luis,And then I also know that there isn't any oxygen in space,,,,response,0,1,3
109,Luis," So will the the astronauts have to work spacesuits until that some of the kind of equipment that they have to wear a spacesuit, so that they can breathe and then we're trying to figure out if we can, like, do a mission to Mars and if there's life on Mars, where we can read them live um",,,,response,0,1,3
109,Jazmin,"Because if we destroy this planet, then we might have to move to Mars",,,,response,0,1,3
109,Teacher,Right,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher," Alright, so let's draw our attention back to that",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher,But you focus on the article,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher,"We're getting a little bit off topic here, but Luis you said that astronauts have to use oxygen tanks in space shuttles, and those are types of equipment so you're right about that",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher,"Mainly in, let's see, paragraph two",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher,Right?,,,,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher, This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small,,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher,"You remember that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher,"And that means the moon is still the driest desert on Earth, the water that is found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher,"Alright, so they use oxygen tanks but what other things do they use in the article",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
109,Farrah,"Um, they use microscopes, because that was that was in my answer",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
109,Farrah, And I don't understand why my answers wrong,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
109,Teacher,"Okay so Farrah, they do use microscopes right?",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher,"But do they use the microscopes on the moon, or would they have to maybe collect the samples, and then we'll get back to Earth?",,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
109,Farrah,"Um,",,,210.3,response,0,1,3
109,Farrah,"Well, in the story it says that, well it's talking about the moon",,,,response,0,1,3
109,Farrah, So there they are talking about the water on the moon,,,,response,0,1,3
109,Farrah, And then it says the water they found is microscopic you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,0,1,3
109,Teacher,Right,,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher, They are and you're using her deep reading skills to really engage with the text and that's awesome,,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher,But is that the type of equipment that they used to discover or investigate the water?,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher,Or is there a better answer?,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
109,Farrah,"[Reads to herself] The moon is still the driest desert on Earth, the water that is found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,210.3,response,0,1,3
109,Farrah,I'm not sure,,,,response,0,1,3

109,Teacher,Not sure,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
109,Farrah, The lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
109,Farrah,"Okay, [reads to herself] NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
109,Farrah, The ice deposits are very small,,,210.4,response,0,1,3

109,Farrah,Okay,,,,response,0,1,3
109,Farrah," I mean, it talks about a machine",,,,response,0,1,3

109,Teacher, Right,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher, So could the lunar orbiter be the type of equipment the scientists used?,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher,looks for ice deposits,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
109,Teacher,You guys think so?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3

109,Luis," So, like, I don't think I need to do this",,,,response,1,1,3
109,Teacher, But you have kind of missed the answer about what equipment we need to discover the water on the moon,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher,"Well, so even though you know a lot about space and you know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and microscopes and things like that",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, It's really cool,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3

109,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,1,1,3
109,Oliver,"Um, I thought the most interesting thing that I saw was the idea that like there was like water up there that like, even though it's like very like microscopic that that may be, um, it could still be used or it could still be something that like is enough that we could do something with it",,,,response,1,1,3
109,Teacher,Awesome,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, And I love your use of the vocabulary term microscopic that's really good,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3

109,Farrah, Like I was thinking a lot about it and I still don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,310.1,response,1,1,3
109,Farrah, I was not sure,,,310.1,response,1,1,3
109,Farrah,"Um, so me",,,310.1,response,1,1,3
109,Teacher, So you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to close to look really closely,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, So let's go ahead and get into those answers,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher,"Okay, well that's perfect Farrah",,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher,look really closely at what?,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
109,Farrah,I'm really closely at the water,,,230.3,response,1,1,3
109,Teacher,Water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, Right,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher," But the question is, how do we find the water",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, So what was used,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, What are the scientists used to find the water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
109,Farrah,"Oh,",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
109,Farrah," Did you have to see it, or was there another way maybe to detect",,,,response,1,1,3
109,Farrah," If you, I guess",,,,response,1,1,3
109,Farrah, So the way I was thinking was like that,,,,response,1,1,3
109,Farrah," So, okay",,,,response,1,1,3
109,Farrah,That's interesting,,,,response,1,1,3
109,Farrah," Okay, so if you had to find the water",,,,response,1,1,3
109,Teacher," So to answer your question, further, let's go ahead and look back in the article so paragraph one talks about how scientists thought the moon was a desert",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher,That's a really good point,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher," Okay, but now I know that's not true",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher,"Because in paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher,"These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that when ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water",,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher,"So using the information in paragraph two, what equipment",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher,That's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day,,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, Did the scientists use to find that water to investigate if there was water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Farrah,"Okay, so to investigate that was the lunar orbiter right",,,120.3,response,1,1,3
109,Teacher,"Right, right",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, So we use the Lunar Orbiter to find the water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher,"So it's really important when we are answering questions, even though you found part of the question stem and your answer",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher,"Okay, and we have to use the microscope to look at it",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, Chris,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, You've got to look around it to make sure that's the total,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Chris,So I went to NASA with my dad and I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
109,Chris, And I guess I was wondering like did they use that to discover the water as well?,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
109,Teacher,They would have to use a combination of all those things,,,410.3,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, But this article is mainly about the lunar orbiter that they use,,,410.3,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, And what we can do with the water once they found it,,,410.3,remark,1,1,3
109,Chris,Oh,,,410.3,response,1,1,3
109,Teacher,"Yeah, you got it?",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, You're right,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, Okay,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, So your answer is almost there,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, So NASA send a small machine,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, It was a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher,Jazmin your answer,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, You just need to add a little bit more information to it,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Jazmin, So I just have to say like the full sentence,,,420.2,response,1,1,3
109,Jazmin,That's it,,,420.2,response,1,1,3
109,Teacher," So yes, it is a small machine and the small machine may answer a question, because we have to also ask a small machine that did what? okay",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher, But sometimes we have to look around too,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher,"Yeah, sometimes that works",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
109,Jazmin,"Um, it discovered the water",,,420.2,response,1,1,3
109,Teacher,"Right, and what was that machine called?",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
109,Jazmin,"It was, it was called the lunar orbiter",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
109,Teacher, That's right,,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
109,Teacher,The lunar orbiter,,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
109,Jazmin,Which unfortunately we have to go to our next class,,,110.4,response,1,1,3
109,Jazmin, Thank you so much,,,110.4,response,1,1,3
109,Jazmin," But before we go, I just wanted to thank you for working with us a lot of fun",,,110.4,response,1,1,3
109,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,2,1,3
109,Luis, So I think I'm good,,,,response,2,1,3
109,Luis, So I think I got all this stuff figured out pretty good,,,,response,2,1,3
109,Teacher, I loved your answer you really use the details in the article you went back and re read so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, You are good,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, That's exactly right,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,You are good,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, Don't you guys,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, I think that's really interesting,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,And the article talks about how the hydrogen might be able to be used for a rocket fuel which is awesome,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
109,Luis,"Oh yeah, it's awesome",,,210.4,response,2,1,3
109,Luis," Yeah, it's really cool that that's a possibility",,,210.4,response,2,1,3
109,Teacher, So for us to talk about the question just for a minute before we really dive into those answers,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,It is cool,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,So is there convincing evidence,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher," So remember, convincing evidence means that we're looking for details are in the article",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, Okay,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, That water on the moon could be valuable,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, What it says directly,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,Now this is a tricky question,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher," Because valuable, we have to use the definition that they gave us in the article for that word",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, Okay,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,"Okay, so let's look back to paragraph",,,120.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, So it says water on the moon would be a valuable or very important resource,,,120.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, Let's see,,,120.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher," Paragraph four right we're under this heading where it says, water is valid, a valuable resource",,,120.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,So what is the meaning of valuable there?,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,2,1,3
109,Oliver, Yeah,,,,response,2,1,3
109,Oliver,Important like something that's useful or important,,,,response,2,1,3
109,Teacher, So something that is useful or important already so something that is useful or important,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,Exactly right,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,"Now taking that in mind, I would like to talk about your answers just for a second so",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,"Let's see, Farrah and Oliver, you both said, It's not ready yet, or it would take a long time for the scientists to get it and even those both of those things are true",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,"They're both true, it doesn't really encompass how water on the moon might be valuable",,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,So what are some things all of you that water could be used for on the moon like it says in paragraph four and five,,,230.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,Can we look back for some details? Chris,,,230.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Chris," Well, okay",,,230.2,response,2,1,3
109,Chris," So we know that, like, there's a few things that you could do",,,230.2,response,2,1,3
109,Chris,Some details,,,230.2,response,2,1,3
109,Chris, There's a lot of stuff you could you could do with it,,,,response,2,1,3
109,Chris,Because you could like you could use it to make like rocket fuel you could drink the water,,,,response,2,1,3
109,Teacher,"Yeah, you can drink it can make rocket fuel everything else Jazmin?",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Jazmin," Oh, you can breathe it, they said that you can breathe it if you make oxygen",,,230.3,response,2,1,3
109,Jazmin,"Reach Every Reader:You can drink it, you can make rocket fuel",,,230.3,response,2,1,3
109,Teacher, So like you said your answer,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, And it looks like you've done that in your answer,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, Okay,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher," Jazmin, the water is valuable, but we really need to discuss why",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, So great job,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, Farrah?,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,That's exactly right,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Farrah,"I think I just, I'm still a little confused",,,310.1,response,2,1,3
109,Teacher,"Okay, well let's go back and reread so water on the moon will be a valuable or very important resource, it can be useful in a lot of ways",,,120.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,"For example, future astronauts could drink this water",,,120.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, Water is heavy,,,120.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, And it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things,,,120.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,"Moon water could be useful and other ways, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts can breathe oxygen, hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel",,,120.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,"So do we have evidence there of what could be used what it could be used for because that's, I think that's what you're struggling with Farrah, is that you want it to be right now and not look for it",,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Farrah,It seems like it would take a lot of money and time,,,410.2,response,2,1,3
109,Farrah,It seems like it would be really hard to get everybody to work together and make it happen,,,,response,2,1,3
109,Farrah," But I do think I see what you mean that it is like valuable in theory, like no matter when it is",,,,response,2,1,3
109,Teacher, So remember back to our question,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, We just have to find convincing evidence for its value,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,That's right,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher," And like you said, we've done that",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, We have tons of ways that it can be used,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, Right,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, So it might not be worked at,,,110.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,"But you're right, it will take a lot of time and a lot of money",,,110.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, Oliver,,,110.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Oliver,"Um, well, I actually read somewhere that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so maybe it would be useful faster than Farrah and I thought",,,110.2,response,2,1,3
109,Teacher, That's really interesting that I'm glad you brought that into the discussion,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,That's true,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher," I haven't read that, but I'll be sure to look it up",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,",",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher," Um, let's see",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, So those are very important things,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, You can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, Luis You said water can be,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,"See, um, let's talk about sorry I have to keep looking back at my picture",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,However Is that the best piece of evidence that we can grab from the article to use?,,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Luis, Like when you say the best the best evidence like what do you mean exactly?,,,210.3,response,2,1,3
109,Luis,"Well, I guess I'm not sure",,,210.3,response,2,1,3
109,Teacher,"Okay, so if I just told you water was split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen, did that tell you any information about it on the moon, or about astronauts?",,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
109,Luis,"I see like I gotta say, like, I gotta say the whole sentence like, you like work with Jazmin when she needed to say like the whole thing about the Lunar Orbiter and the small machine like I need to say like what my opinion is, and then I need to say like what it could be used, is that right?",,,210.3,response,2,1,3
109,Teacher, Because whenever we have an explanation or whatever we have evidence from article,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, Oliver,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, So say we have one sentence of evidence we have to have two sentences of our explanation,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, So we have to describe that,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher,Exactly,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
109,Oliver," I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you for helping us to",,,420.2,response,2,1,3
109,Oliver, Before we go to lunch,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
109,Oliver,"Um, well, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,420.2,response,2,1,3
109,Oliver,"Create much more complete answers and, like, in particular, you really asked us to like use evidence from the text and to make sure that we work on",,,,response,2,1,3
109,Oliver,"Yeah, backing up our statements with with like actual evidence and things",,,,response,2,1,3
109,Oliver, And I think that like everybody's answers got a lot better,,,,response,2,1,3
109,Oliver, And you also really made us feel valued by making sure that we all like felt like,,,,response,2,1,3
109,Oliver, That's the discussion,,,,response,2,1,3
109,Oliver,Because of the way that you lead us through that,,,,response,2,1,3
109,Oliver, And that was really cool and it was really interesting like to learn new stuff and and to talk about it as a group,,,,response,2,1,3
109,Oliver,You know like what we were sharing was worthwhile,,,,response,2,1,3
109,Oliver, So thank you so much,,,,response,2,1,3
109,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,2,1,3
109,Teacher, I appreciate that,,,,remark,2,1,3
110,Teacher, So look back in paragraph 3,,,120.1,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher,OK,,,120.1,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher," So Farrah, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.1,remark,0,0,1
110,Luis,Excuse me,,,120.1,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher,Yes?,,,,remark,0,0,1
110,Luis,I shouldn't be in this group,,,,response,0,0,1
110,Luis, I already know all about space,,,,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher, Wrong student,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher, I said the wrong name,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher,"Oh, yes",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher, Sorry,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher,Chris,,,120.3,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher," Look back into paragraph 3, and can you read that aloud for me? About what they use to find the water in space, on the moon",,,120.3,remark,0,0,1
110,Chris, That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth,,,120.3,response,0,0,1
110,Chris,"Yeah, sure",,,120.3,response,0,0,1
110,Chris," OK, paragraph 3",,,120.3,response,0,0,1
110,Chris," That means the moon is still drier than the rest of-- oh, sorry",,,120.3,response,0,0,1
110,Chris," The water they found is microscopic, meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it",,,120.3,response,0,0,1
110,Chris, You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,120.3,response,0,0,1
110,Chris, OK,,,120.3,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher,Right,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher, So would you be able to see it with your regular eye? Would you be able to look down at it?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
110,Chris," No, you need a microscope to look at it",,,210.4,response,0,0,1
110,Chris,No,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher, So can you now answer what type of equipment they needed to discover water on the moon?,,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher,Exactly,,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
110,Chris,"Well, I had said that they could do it with the craters",,,120.2,response,0,0,1
110,Chris, I said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,120.2,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher,Right,,,210.3,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher, But did they? After reading that last paragraph we just read?,,,210.3,remark,0,0,1
110,Chris,"Well, in that one, it was talking about a microscope, and how it said the water is microscopic",,,210.3,response,0,0,1
110,Chris, Meaning you won't be able to see it,,,210.3,response,0,0,1
110,Chris, You need a microscope to look really closely at it,,,210.3,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher, So the question is asking us what type of equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher, So what type of equipment did they have to have in order-- if it was there to see it?,,,210.2,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher,Right,,,210.2,remark,0,0,1
110,Farrah,"Oh, excuse me?",,,210.2,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher,Yes?,,,,remark,0,0,1
110,Farrah,I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher, So what did you say for your answer?,,,120.4,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher,"You're right, Farrah",,,120.4,remark,0,0,1
110,Farrah, But I don't understand why mine has a partial response,,,120.4,response,0,0,1
110,Farrah,"I'd say-- I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.4,response,0,0,1
110,Farrah, But the teacher said that we were all over here because we had partial responses to the question,,,120.4,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher, Because--,,,,remark,0,0,1
110,Oliver,Yeah,,,,response,0,0,1
110,Oliver," I mean, not on purpose, but I did",,,,response,0,0,1
110,Oliver, And I had the same answer as Farrah,,,,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher," So if you look back at that third paragraph, can you read that first sentence for me, Farrah?",,,120.3,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher,Right,,,120.3,remark,0,0,1
110,Farrah,Yeah,,,120.3,response,0,0,1
110,Farrah," It says, That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth",,,120.3,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher, So is there any water on the moon?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher,Right,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
110,Farrah," No, it's dry",,,210.4,response,0,0,1
110,Farrah, It says dry,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
110,Farrah, No,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
110,Farrah,Oh,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher,Right,,,230.2,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher, So did they actually discover that water was on the moon?,,,230.2,remark,0,0,1
110,Farrah,The water they found? Yeah,,,230.2,response,0,0,1
110,Farrah, So they did find some water,,,230.2,response,0,0,1
110,Farrah," Yeah, because in the next sentence it says, the water they found is microscopic",,,230.2,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher,But what does the first sentence say?,,,120.3,remark,0,0,1
110,Farrah,It says that it's really dry,,,120.3,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher," But when they were able to discover some, how did they discover it?",,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher,Right,,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
110,Farrah,They said that you need a tool,,,120.2,response,0,0,1
110,Farrah," Well, this was my answer",,,120.2,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher, But what else did you need to know?,,,120.1,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher,Right,,,120.1,remark,0,0,1
110,Farrah,Where the water is?,,,120.1,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher,Yes,,,110.4,remark,0,0,1
110,Chris,"I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, and masks, and suits",,,110.4,response,0,0,1
110,Teacher, But does it mention that in the paragraphs?,,,230.2,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher,Right,,,230.2,remark,0,0,1

110,Teacher,OK,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher, So let's look back in the text,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
110,Teacher," It says, Scientists have found evidence that water can be found within the moon's polar craters",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
110,Chris, That was my answer,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
110,Chris,In the polar craters,,,210.4,response,0,0,1

111,Teacher,It lets your teacher and it lets people know like you fewer,,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher,Question,,,210.3,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher,lets people know what you're talking about,,,410.2,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher, Because if you just put Lunar Orbiter,,,410.2,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher, We're not going to which question,,,410.2,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher, It goes to,,,410.2,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher,What will know by the number but like if somebody that didn't know what we were what this passage was even about how could they read the answer to this question and know that we're taught what we're talking about,,,210.3,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher, How could we restate that question,,,210.3,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher,I know,,,,remark,1,0,4
111,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to invest ticking,,,,response,1,0,4

111,Teacher,We need to restate that question in our answers,,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher,But we also our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher," Well, and he's the text, so I can use the text, but can you can fit it into this question, maybe just a little more more clear into the question",,,420.2,remark,1,0,4

111,Chris,That,,,,response,1,0,4
111,Chris,"Teacher, it's me, Chris",,,,response,1,0,4
111,Chris,I was thinking about the equipment,,,,response,1,0,4
111,Chris,Because you talked about equipment in the question and I wouldn't have NASA,,,,response,1,0,4

111,Teacher,"Oh, you're right, they do do a lot of equipment",,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher, So that's one reason that we need to be very specific in our answer isn't it,,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher,Because we need to know which,,,120.2,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher,Equipment did the scientists sees to discover the water right to discover the water so,,,120.2,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher,They use the,,,,remark,1,0,4

111,Teacher,And that was the orbit,,,130.3,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher,"So what if we said something when you restate it question, you kind of take some some some words from the question and put it in your answer",,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher, So we could say,,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher, Does that sound good,,,150.1,remark,1,0,4

111,Teacher, They're not going to what we're talking about,,,410.2,remark,1,0,4
111,Teacher, What if we put,,,410.2,remark,1,0,4

111,Teacher,"Like say that those things were, say that time and money wasn't a problem and it could, you know, think about",,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, Okay,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"Um, you know, trying to think about if those were issues, how it could be important",,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher," Yes, Jazmin",,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, Now try to think about that next time,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Jazmin,I'm still kind of confused,,,210.3,response,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"What's your quick what's, what are you, I'm sure",,,230.1,remark,2,0,4
111,Jazmin," This time, and I added more detail to my answer",,,230.1,response,2,0,4
111,Jazmin,"Well, I think I, I think I answered the question",,,230.1,response,2,0,4
111,Teacher, Yeah,,,420.2,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher," And yeah guys, I do want some of you did add more details and others, and definitely make sure to add details and",,,420.2,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"You did, and quite a few details",,,420.2,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"Make sure you back things up, it takes like Farrah Farrah, you know, like in your answer",,,430.2,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, You didn't really back it up,,,430.2,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"Okay, and then Jazmin, back to you",,,,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"In the original time but it's, I want you to work on that next time",,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, That is exactly right,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, We do need water to survive,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher," And stay hydrated and you can't survive that water, that's exactly right now in our text you know how it said",,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, Right,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, The astronauts,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,You said yes is astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, You can't survive without water,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, And that's a good response so,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,So let's think a little bit deeper about that,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher," Maybe not leaving, but at least be in there longer and spaceships can't really carry heavy",,,210.1,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"Say there it says that, you know, one day, you know, they'd like to have people living on the moon and being there for longer periods of time",,,210.1,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,I can't really can't carry,,,210.1,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"enough amount of water to subside people for a long time, right, because waters really heavy",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, So do you think it,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, And it's hard,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher," You know, it takes up space on the spaceships",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"Yeah, yeah, go ahead and go ahead, Chris",,,,remark,2,0,4
111,Chris, I didn't mean to interrupt,,,,response,2,0,4
111,Chris," I was just gonna say, that's what I said in my answer",,,,response,2,0,4
111,Chris,"Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry",,,,response,2,0,4
111,Teacher, You said water is is heavy,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, So it's good,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"Yeah, I was trying to get to that",,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher," So, but they still have to carry it and ships because they have to get there",,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, They don't have to carry it and ships anymore,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, Correct,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, That's good,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, Yes,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, They are being able to inhabit the moon right now,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, We're not leaving,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,And and kind of back to Space and you know we're not,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,They hope to one day in the future,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, So that's one reason it's it's really valuable that,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, But so right now if they went to the main the ships would have to carry it,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, So how can that make it valuable,,,230.1,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,We can be able to find water there,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,and Luis Can you tell me a little bit about your answer,,,230.1,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, You said water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen,,,230.1,remark,2,0,4
111,Luis,"Wow, I mean you that that's okay",,,230.1,response,2,0,4
111,Luis, So I saw that in a story and that seemed like that was important,,,230.1,response,2,0,4
111,Teacher,It was important,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher," So let's, it was very important, because you can do so water is made up of hydrogen, oxygen, and you can take those things that",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"Lead them and then you can use the oxygen, hydrogen for other things",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, Let's see if you guys can reread and find what,,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"So let's look back at our tix and say, there's a couple of things",,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher," And he says,",,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"What oxygen can be good for and what how'd you drink, we get four or what I can be put back together",,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Oliver,I read I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,420.3,response,2,0,4
111,Teacher,So let's say so in order to follow my advice or to found that base and be able to be able to what's some things that if orders split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"Oh, that would be neat when it that that that's only four years away",,,110.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher," It's in your text and about paragraph five,",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"The oxygen just it's in, it's in here",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Luis, Yeah,,,210.4,response,2,0,4
111,Luis,I'm okay,,,210.4,response,2,0,4
111,Luis, So I read I read that sentence after,,,210.4,response,2,0,4
111,Luis,"After the one that I said, and it says",,,,response,2,0,4
111,Luis," So, I mean, it seems like that's pretty crucial",,,,response,2,0,4
111,Luis,That astronauts could breathe oxygen,,,,response,2,0,4
111,Teacher, Yes,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"Yes, it is",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, So we can split the water,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, You're right,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, Breathing is very crucial,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, So with the hydrogen and oxygen and use the oxygen for air and that's very valuable and very important,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, Correct,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, Great,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher," What's another I really, I'm really glad you found that",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, What's another thing in that paragraph that you could use,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,We cannot live without oxygen,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"The oxygen and the hydrogen are not as same as water, but what's something else that they can be used for",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Farrah,"Oh, it says, oxygen, and it could also be used as rocket fuel",,,210.4,response,2,0,4
111,Teacher, And what much Nate rocket fuel for here on the main,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,Yes,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
111,Farrah,"Um, so that you can like go up to the moon",,,210.4,response,2,0,4
111,Farrah,Out like you're on the moon,,,,response,2,0,4
111,Farrah,"Oh,",,,,response,2,0,4
111,Teacher,We're not you and get back on the moon,,,,remark,2,0,4
111,Farrah,"Oh, yeah, yeah",,,,response,2,0,4
111,Farrah, They use it to go home,,,,response,2,0,4
111,Teacher, They have to right now they have to have enough fuel to get them somewhere and to get them back and that takes up space on the own the,,,210.1,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, That's right,,,210.1,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher," Yeah, because they have to get NASA has to be really careful",,,210.1,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"Yeah, they used to go home",,,210.1,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,Spaceship so down here later in our take to talk about how,,,210.1,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"In paragraph five, it says, imagine the moon could serve as a stop for spacecrafts to refill their gas tanks before heading out into the solar system, so they could visit further white areas of the solar system, or they could come back home with the fuel that they yeah",,,120.3,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,"Yeah, that's cool",,,,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher, So,,,,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher,We met his,,,,remark,2,0,4
111,Teacher," And so, so we've decided and",,,150.1,remark,2,0,4

112,Luis,High up,,,,response,1,1,2
112,Luis,Excuse me,,,,response,1,1,2
112,Luis,Don't I shouldn't be unless I have already know all about space,,,,response,1,1,2
112,Teacher,"Well, I bet you do know a lot about space specifically and what you said, Why did you talk about oxygen tanks as the equipment",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
112,Luis,"Because I know that I'm TO GO TO THE MON astronauts have to use oxygen tanks, because they can't breathe on the moon without it",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
112,Teacher,"Good, so I'm glad that you recognize that just have to have oxygen when they're in space",,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, So in the question asks us,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher," But if you look at the title, we're talking about water in space",,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher,What equipment do they use to find the water,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, So while I'm talking to,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher,"Chris, I want you to look through the text and find equipment that helps them find water",,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, Okay then,,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher,"All right, Chris",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, So you talked about,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, Why did you talk about craters on the moon,,,,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, Yeah,,,,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher,Craters,,,,remark,1,1,2
112,Chris," Well, cuz the question asked about water on what you were saying, Luis, and I, I saw in the first paragraph",,,,response,1,1,2
112,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,1,2
112,Chris," So, um, yeah",,,,response,1,1,2
112,Chris,That they said that they found water deep in the craters,,,,response,1,1,2
112,Chris, So that's why,,,,response,1,1,2
112,Teacher, I'm glad that's what we're talking about in the question,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher,"Good, I'm glad you were looking specifically that they found those the water in the craters",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, It says what equipment,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, Where did they find it so,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, Did they use not,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher,But in the question,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher,I want you to look at what equipment they used to find the water in the craters not were to you,,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher,and Jazmin,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher," Why did you, why did you look for",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2

112,Teacher, Why did you say that they use small machines,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, So you specified that they use small machines,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
112,Jazmin, I know his equipment,,,230.1,response,1,1,2

112,Jazmin, The story but machine,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
112,Jazmin, So that's how I figured that the one in paragraph two was the right one,,,,response,1,1,2
112,Jazmin,"And then they say a microscope at the end, but I know that that one wasn't like to discover the water, they were they were saying you could use it but they didn't say you they did use it",,,,response,1,1,2
112,Teacher," So you look a couple lines over and see if you can find the name of that Jazmin aright, Farrah and Oliveron",,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher,But if you read a couple ones over I think you'll find the name of it,,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, You found exactly where you should be looking at by that word machine there,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher,Good,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
112,Jazmin,I don't,,,310.1,response,1,1,2

112,Jazmin,I don't understand why my answers wrong,,,,response,1,1,2
112,Teacher,"Okay, so let's let's think about your answer",,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, So you said they use Microsoft's correct,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
112,Jazmin,All,,,230.3,response,1,1,2
112,Teacher,So why did you say they use microscopes,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
112,Jazmin,Because that's what they used to look for water,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
112,Teacher, So I agree,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher,Okay,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, They used to look at water is it what they find the water with,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher,So you keep you look down and you read about the,,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher,Microscope and tell me what they say about microscope,,,,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher," Is that right,",,,230.3,remark,1,1,2

112,Luis," Um, so, in paragraph two, they talk about the Lunar Orbiter and then paragraph three, they talk about the microscope so",,,150.1,response,1,1,2
112,Luis," Um, there's a bunch of there's two different things where they're talking about equipment in here",,,150.1,response,1,1,2
112,Luis,"That's equipment to but um and they both talked about water, though in both of the paragraphs",,,,response,1,1,2
112,Teacher, All right,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, And you also found that they both talked about water,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, Now what did the question ask us to find about water,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher,Good,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher," You found exactly both of the equipment they talked about, really, really good",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2

112,Jazmin,"Oh, it wasn't a question",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
112,Jazmin,It says they be such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,1,1,2
112,Jazmin, So yeah,,,,response,1,1,2
112,Jazmin, I'm vulnerable at them and South Pole and look at it,,,,response,1,1,2
112,Teacher,How,,,,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher,Does the rest talk with Luis about because he's trying to find which one discovers the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter,,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher, I think you have the answer,,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
112,Teacher," So, talk with Luis and help him discover which one it is",,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
112,Jazmin, OK,,,130.2,response,1,1,2

112,Teacher,Is awesome,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Farrah,"Okay, the question was, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,110.1,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"Okay, very good",,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, Why did you say not for a long time,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, You said no because not not for a long time,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Farrah,"Because it's gonna take a while for us for the astronauts to be able to find out if it's if it is valuable, or not",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher, Very good,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,but is the question asking is it right now,,,410.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher," They did say that it will be a long time because they still haven't been able to access the water,",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,That is true,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Farrah,Let me look at it,,,310.1,response,2,1,2

112,Teacher, You said that water can be split into two parts,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher," Why did you tell me, water can be split into two parts",,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, I'm gonna go back to Luis because I'm pretty excited that his dad is a astronauts,,,140.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,Is a while you're looking at it,,,140.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Luis,"Um, because I found it in the story and I know you told me last time that I have to look into it",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
112,Luis, And so,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
112,Luis, Look in the text for my answers and not just because I know it already,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
112,Luis,It comes right after the first sentence that says water could be useful,,,,response,2,1,2
112,Luis," So I figured that's probably where you get the answer is, after the first sentence",,,,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher,Good,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher," I'm glad that you're looking into the text, instead of just going off of what you know",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, So right after that the paragraph,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher," We want to be in, you're exactly right",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"Because it's asking us directly about the text, so yes",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"But the question says, is it convince if we have the convincing evidence",,,210.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,Is the fact that water can be split telling us anything about if it's good or not to have in space,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, Does that tell us,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
112,Luis,Is this convincing,,,210.3,response,2,1,2

112,Jazmin,Yeah,,,,response,2,1,2
112,Jazmin," Well, I was thinking about the water on the moon and well it could be valuable for us to have like a moon card",,,,response,2,1,2
112,Jazmin,"You know, so we could grow things on the moon",,,,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"Yeah, that would be awesome if we could do that",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"But, and I want to specifically look at what you wrote on your answer",,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, You said that you could,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"Stay hot, they need to stay hydrated and you can't survive without water",,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,You are exactly right,,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"Now, why did you, why did you choose to tell me about that when answering this question",,,230.1,remark,2,1,2

112,Jazmin,"Well, they were talking about it",,,230.3,response,2,1,2
112,Jazmin,Oh,,,,response,2,1,2
112,Jazmin, I don't remember,,,,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher,Go ahead and read rethink about your answer there for,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,For me while I talked to Chris,,,,remark,2,1,2
112,Jazmin,I see it,,,,response,2,1,2
112,Jazmin, Oh,,,,response,2,1,2

112,Teacher,Good,,,,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"Okay, good",,,,remark,2,1,2
112,Jazmin," So then I was thinking, okay, like we need water to drink in order to live",,,,response,2,1,2
112,Jazmin,"Well, it's a future astronauts could drink this water",,,,response,2,1,2
112,Jazmin," So, um, so, yeah",,,,response,2,1,2
112,Jazmin, That's why I said,,,,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher," It says, Is there convincing evidence",,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"What did you say before you told me that what was the first part, you just read there",,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,And I want to specifically look at the question,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,And you're right we so we do need that,,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
112,Jazmin,"Um, that future astronauts could drink the water",,,110.4,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher, What it is that does that convince you that it would be good to have the water,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, So that would be good,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2

112,Jazmin,"Oh, yeah",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"Chris, you talk to me about water being heavy",,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, Why did you choose to talk to me about that,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Chris,"Well, all because that was in the",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
112,Chris,"In the first the first part and the, the teacher our English teacher said that usually the first paragraph is where you're going to find the important information",,,,response,2,1,2

112,Teacher, When you said that,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, Right,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, So you said water is heavy you found that in the first paragraph,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"And I, I want to ask another question",,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,Where it is that water at when they say it's heavy,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, And while you're reading it,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,So read that sentence again for me,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, I'm going to talk with Oliver,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, So read that sentence again for me,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"So, Oliver",,,,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, Why did you say they're not ready yet,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,They you said they're not ready yet,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Oliver," So, I mean, they don't have all of that stuff yet so so clearly they they are not ready for for getting water off the moon",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
112,Oliver,"Um, well, because at the end, it says, making this plan will take a lot of time and money, they will need to study the moon surface and build new equipment",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher," So, you made a really important",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"Good, I agree that they're not ready",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"Insight there,",,,,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"but I really want to reiterate how important the question is, and really reading it, it's asking you if you have enough evidence to say that it would be valuable",,,410.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, Not that they're ready,,,410.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, Would it be valuable to,,,410.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,Have water,,,,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, Do you think it would,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,So what is valuable mean maybe that's what we need to ask ourselves,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,So re rethink about that,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher, So what does it mean to be valuable Farrah,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
112,Farrah,Valuable means like something that's really important,,,120.1,response,2,1,2
112,Farrah," Like, um, um, yeah, something that's important",,,120.1,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher,So do you think it would be,,,120.2,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,Important to have water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,2,1,2
112,Farrah,"Um, yeah, I mean like like Jazmin said out people need to be able to drink water",,,120.2,response,2,1,2
112,Farrah, Um so yeah that's valuable,,,120.2,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"Yeah, and and what it Chris say",,,,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,So here's an did you find specifically where that waters heavy at,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2

112,Chris,Your research be heavy on the spaceship,,,,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher,Good,,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher," So, Farrah",,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher," So what did Chris, you say about the water",,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
112,Farrah,"Um, he said the waters heavy if it's on the space of the spaceship",,,130.2,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"Right, so they're having to take up this water in the space and its way in down that spaceship",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"So then Luis Would it be valuable to have this water and in space, so we don't have to lug it from Earth to the Moon",,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
112,Luis," Yeah, that'd be great because you know if I have to carry water might my arms and be tired",,,130.2,response,2,1,2
112,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,130.2,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"Yeah, so we're saving saving some energy for that space shuttle",,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
112,Oliver,Was harrowing,,,230.3,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,,remark,2,1,2
112,Oliver,"It's time for us to go to lunch, but I",,,,response,2,1,2

112,Oliver,Understand now because you kept telling us to look up a word in the question,,,,response,2,1,2
112,Teacher,"All right, well, you guys have a good lunch",,,,remark,2,1,2
112,Teacher,Hey guys,,,,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"Oliver, do you have a question?",,,,remark,0,1,2

112,Teacher,"Hey,",,,,remark,0,1,2
112,Luis," Um, I don't think I should be on this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,2
112,Luis,"I actually, I do have a question",,,,response,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"Well, you know, I liked your response, the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,",,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,but does that mean you know everything about what scientists using in space? How does an oxygen tank work?,,,140.1,remark,0,1,2
112,Luis," I mean there isn't gravity in space, but they're also isn't any oxygen and trees and carbon dioxide",,,140.1,response,0,1,2
112,Luis," So the site, so the astronauts have to wear these oxygen tanks in order to breathe when they're up in space, so they have, they have a whole a whole space suit",,,140.1,response,0,1,2
112,Luis,"Okay, because there isn't any gravity",,,140.1,response,0,1,2
112,Luis,And then in their space suit they have like a helmet and then breathe out carbon dioxide can go out and then oxygen can come in,,,,response,0,1,2
112,Luis, So that they don't like suffocate in space,,,,response,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"Well, can you tell me what the title of this was",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"That's really cool, Luis",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2

112,Luis," Yeah, water on the moon",,,110.1,response,0,1,2
112,Teacher," Does, does that sound like, I agree that they do use oxygen tanks when they're in space and in the moon, but I think what we're trying to figure out was",,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,Yeah,,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher," And let's see, I wanted to talk with with um",,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher, And so that's a little bit more in depth than just the oxygen tank,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,We're talking about water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher," Jazmin, you said that NASA send a small machine to the moon",,,,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,With Jazmin,,,,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"What is this, what was the small machine called",,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
112,Jazmin,I'm not sure,,,230.2,response,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"So I think that's in paragraph two,",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"Why don't you look at the first sentence and paragraph two,",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
112,Jazmin, The small machine is called a lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
112,Jazmin,"Okay, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
112,Teacher,Good,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2

112,Jazmin,Um investigate,,,230.2,response,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"It does, it does investigate what does it investigate read that second sentence again",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
112,Jazmin,"Okay, this will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
112,Jazmin,I still don't understand why my answers wrong,,,,response,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"No, you're answers great it you caught on to the fact that NASA did send a small machine, but you didn't tell me what this small machine did and I wanted to know",,,310.1,remark,0,1,2
112,Jazmin,"Oh, oh, okay",,,310.1,response,0,1,2
112,Jazmin, This lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,310.1,response,0,1,2
112,Jazmin,"Well, it's going to land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,,response,0,1,2

112,Jazmin,it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,230.2,response,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"Okay, good",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"Um,",,,,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"So Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,Yeah?,,,,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher, How much water did they find,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,Um you so talk to me about that,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2

112,Chris,[Rapidly rereads paragraph one to himself],,,210.4,response,0,1,2
112,Chris, Because it says a water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters and so it's like you know like deep,,,,response,0,1,2
112,Chris,"Oh, yeah",,,,response,0,1,2
112,Teacher," That means that, so think about um think about if you dug a really big hole so they found it deep within the moon's craters, they found it really far down",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"Right, so they found it deep",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,But it just says that they found evidence that there was water,,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher," Not that they found a lot of water, they just not evidence, meaning that they seen water there",,,210.3,remark,0,1,2

112,Chris, If it's just evident to not the water,,,210.3,response,0,1,2
112,Chris," And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like how Luis was saying, but also masks and suits too",,,210.3,response,0,1,2
112,Teacher," I want you to read that last paragraph for me, Chris",,,430.2,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher," Right? So let's keep to that topic, to read",,,430.2,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"They do use a lot of equipment, but we're talking about water on the moon",,,430.2,remark,0,1,2
112,Chris,Number three?,,,430.2,response,0,1,2
112,Teacher, Very good,,,,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,,remark,0,1,2
112,Chris,"Let me see, number three",,,,response,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"So that start with that means, very good",,,,remark,0,1,2
112,Chris,That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth,,,,response,0,1,2
112,Chris," The water, they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it",,,,response,0,1,2
112,Chris, You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,0,1,2
112,Teacher,So what does that--,,,,remark,0,1,2
112,Farrah,That was my answer,,,,response,0,1,2

112,Teacher, Can you tell me what that means,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
112,Oliver,"Yeah, I can because they're talking about how you need a microscope to look really closely at the water",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
112,Oliver," And so, and a microscope is basically a scientific tool, but the scientific tools also equipment",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
112,Teacher,"Okay, so it is an equipment",,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
112,Teacher," What does this equipment do? If I put something under a microscope, what does it do?",,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
112,Oliver,It helps you look at stuff,,,230.1,response,0,1,2

112,Oliver,"Oh, oh, I'm sorry, teacher, I just heard the bell",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
112,Oliver, That means that it's time,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
112,Oliver,It's time for us to go to lunch,,,,response,0,1,2
112,Oliver, I know this was really short,,,,response,0,1,2
112,Oliver," And we just met, but I really appreciate how you took time with with everybody to kind of ask questions and listen to everybody's ideas, um",,,,response,0,1,2
112,Oliver," Wasn't really cool, y'all?",,,,response,0,1,2
112,Teacher,I didn't hear the bell,,,,remark,0,1,2

113,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,1,0,3
113,Luis, I don't think I need to be in this group,,,,response,1,0,3
113,Luis, So I just wanted to say like I already know all about space,,,,response,1,0,3
113,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher,"Well, I wanted to call you back here, because even though you know a lot about space in your answer that you gave to my first question, tells me that you know that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks",,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,"we want to really focus on what it says and our article today, we want to learn more details about scientists especially on the moon",,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
113,Luis, Sounds good,,,220.1,response,1,0,3
113,Luis,Okay,,,220.1,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher, Our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,So let's look at our question,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher, I want to talk about your answer real quick how you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher, How did you get to that answer,,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,Alright so Miss Farrah,,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,So when you are listening and answering this question,,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
113,Farrah,okay,,,230.3,response,1,0,3
113,Farrah, I thought that would be what you'd have to use because they say that the water is microscopic,,,230.3,response,1,0,3
113,Farrah," So when I looked at was, I was thinking, okay, so what equipment did they use to discover the water right, so what I saw was like microscope",,,230.3,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher, They do say that and that's great text evidence to use,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher," They say that this especially specifically in the text, but let's look back at our question",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher, Do you have any really important words in that question,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,Our question specifically says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
113,Farrah,Like other than other than equipment? Like discover,,,210.2,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher,Any other?,,,,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,"Yes, discover",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher, So when you discover something you're looking for it,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,"So did I need, um, you said that they needed the microscope to look really closely",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher," So did they use a microscope to find it, or just a look at it",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
113,Farrah,"Um, I guess",,,210.2,response,1,0,3
113,Farrah, So how could they discover if they didn't see it,,,,response,1,0,3
113,Farrah,I still understand why my answer is wrong because they,,,,response,1,0,3
113,Farrah, It sounds like they had to use the microscope to see it,,,,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher,"Well, they, they have to find it first",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher, They use it once they find it,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher, So they don't even know where to look for it on the microscope,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
113,Farrah,"Oh, so they have to find the first",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher,They have to investigate,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher, Let's all look at our text,,,120.3,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,and in our text when we look at our texts,,,120.3,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,1,0,3
113,Chris,"Oh yeah, I think you answered my question",,,,response,1,0,3
113,Chris, Thank you,,,,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher,"Okay, so in our text on the second paragraph, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher," Um, well what machine, what piece of equipment did they use?",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,So they used,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,Let's use evidence from our text,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,1,0,3
113,Jazmin,"They sent this small machine, so it's this small machine",,,,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher,Said  they sent a small machine does that small machine have a name,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
113,Jazmin,"Yes, it's the lunar orbiter",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher,So what machine was used to find the water,,,120.3,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,"Yeah, it's the Lunar Orbiter",,,110.4,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,The Lunar Orbiter,,,110.4,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,"So when we're going to, and when we answer questions like this again, what's something that we need to make sure we do when we're answering the question",,,520.1,remark,1,0,3
113,Jazmin,"Well, I guess, I'm not sure, I guess think about it",,,110.4,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher,"Well, we did think about it, but what did I ask you to do with your text with your paper",,,510.1,remark,1,0,3
113,Oliver,"Um, well, you asked us to look closely for the equipment",,,510.1,response,1,0,3
113,Oliver, And like look at what was using to discover the thing,,,510.1,response,1,0,3
113,Oliver, Right,,,510.1,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher, So we looked very closely at our text we looked for those key words,,,510.1,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,510.1,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher, Yeah,,,510.1,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,1,0,3
113,Luis, But I guess I'm not totally sure like what are the key words,,,,response,1,0,3
113,Luis,"Um, yeah, I guess I was gonna say kind of the same thing",,,,response,1,0,3
113,Luis, Right,,,,response,1,0,3
113,Luis, Like we look for the keywords,,,,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher," Did you find in the tip and not in the text, the question",,,510.1,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher, Who thinks that they they can explain to Luis What what keywords,,,510.1,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,"Alright, so let's look back at our question",,,510.1,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,"Alright, Farrah",,,,remark,1,0,3
113,Farrah,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,0,3
113,Farrah, So I guess what I found is that the keywords were equipment and like you had to also look at discover and see like that those were the important words we eventually had to find,,,,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher,"Does that answer your question, Luis",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
113,Luis,"Yeah, I guess, you know, how do you find them?",,,150.1,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher, Do you want to answer,,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher, Luis's question,,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher,Chris,,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
113,Chris,"Oh, I'm kind of had a different idea",,,130.2,response,1,0,3
113,Chris, So I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like masks and oxygen tanks and suits,,,130.2,response,1,0,3
113,Chris," I was just thinking like you, I went to NASA",,,130.2,response,1,0,3
113,Chris,"So like, why wasn't that maybe an answer?",,,,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher,"Well, that wasn't an answer, because I'm in our text",,,410.2,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher, It didn't talk about that,,,410.2,remark,1,0,3
113,Chris,Oh so it's just stuff that we read not stuff that we knew,,,410.2,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher,Exactly but you can also use the things that you know to kinda help you look for the answers,,,420.3,remark,1,0,3
113,Chris,"Oh, that makes sense",,,420.3,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher,Oliver?,,,,remark,1,0,3
113,Oliver,"Yeah, unfortunately, we have To go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you for being with us",,,,response,1,0,3
113,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,1,0,3
113,Teacher, So remember the discussion question is-- yes Luis?,,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"All right, so I see that you have all, um, did your best and answering the question, and some of you really went into detail pulling out specific sentences from the text, but we want to get this specific answer",,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
113,Luis, So here's the thing,,,220.1,response,0,0,3
113,Luis," I don't really think I need to be in this group, because I know all about space already so I don't really need any help with this stuff",,,220.1,response,0,0,3
113,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,220.1,response,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"Okay, well, maybe you can help us",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher," Have, help us with the other students understanding of space and we can pull from details from the text just to reaffirm your knowledge and what your prior knowledge is",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
113,Luis,"Okay, that sounds good",,,110.3,response,0,0,3
113,Teacher," So, um,",,,,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,Great,,,,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher, So it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,Let's start off with rereading the question,,,120.2,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"Alright, so, um, can anyone tell me what paragraph, did they think that gave the most information about finding water on the moon?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"Alright, Farrah, what would you say?",,,,remark,0,0,3
113,Farrah,"Um, so I would say that, um, I think it's the third paragraph",,,,response,0,0,3
113,Farrah,In the third paragraph,,,,response,0,0,3
113,Farrah, They say that on the water they found this microscopic and you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,0,0,3
113,Teacher,That is correct,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"And it does say that, um, does it",,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher, So are we using the microscope to find the water or to just look at the water that has been found?,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
113,Farrah,"Um, well okay so I I'm not really sure why my answer might be wrong, because I think the answer is that the microscope is what they use to to find the water you know what I mean? Tey had to look at the water to see it",,,110.2,response,0,0,3
113,Teacher," They do, they do need to use the microscope to look at the water to see it",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"Well, you're right",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher," What if they looked at, um, how did they know where that water is?",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"But we're trying the, we're trying to find how did they find all that water because it",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
113,Farrah,"Yeah, I think that sort of makes sense",,,210.2,response,0,0,3
113,Farrah," I feel like, well, so how did they, how did they find the water if they didn't use the microscope to find it",,,210.2,response,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"Um, what about in the first paragraph there? Do we see anything about any type of machine that they used to find it?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"Okay, well let's ask your other classmates",,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
113,Farrah,"Um, well, let's see, uh,",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
113,Farrah,"No, I don't think there's anything about a machine",,,,response,0,0,3
113,Teacher, So let's look at the second paragraph and see if it mentions any type of machine,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,Right,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,Did any of you find anything about a certain machine or equipment they used?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,0,3
113,Jazmin,So what I saw that NASA used small machine,,,,response,0,0,3
113,Jazmin," And so I think that's something that they said that they were using to find like to discover the water, you know what I mean, like, that was something that they looked at",,,,response,0,0,3
113,Teacher, That's awesome,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher," And I say that you, you basically rephrase the first sentence",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"So does this whole machine, is it given a name? Do we see any place where it's given a name at?",,,230.2,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"Yes, that was very good",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
113,Jazmin,"Yeah, so it's the Lunar Orbiter",,,230.2,response,0,0,3
113,Teacher, Okay,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,Yes,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher, Now investigate means to?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher, It's a small machine to investigate,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher, So it says the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
113,Jazmin,"Like it means to like find something or like, yeah, like to find something or to see something or to study something",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
113,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher," So, um,",,,,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher, So let's look at the second sentence in that paragraph,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"Well, we don't know for sure yet what they're going to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,Let's read it together real quick,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher, This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"Alright, Chris",,,,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher, Did you have a question or a comment?,,,,remark,0,0,3
113,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,0,3
113,Chris," So I kind of got like I was sort of thinking, um like, I was wondering, um,",,,,response,0,0,3
113,Chris," Did they use like spacesuits and stuff? So I feel like that might be missing from the, from the the reading or something like because they have to use like spacesuits to go out and space",,,,response,0,0,3
113,Chris,"Well, I feel like I like",,,,response,0,0,3
113,Teacher,They do have to use those spacesuits but well yes they do have to use them,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher, And that's the only way they can be out there in space looking,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher," Do you think that the spacesuit could help you find water or is it just a tool, the that the astronauts had on them to protect them?",,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,But the whole the whole thing that this article is about was about water on the moon,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
113,Chris,"Oh, so like so, like what it's used for so like the spacesuits are just like to protect but they use other stuff to like find it and study it",,,210.3,response,0,0,3
113,Chris, Is that right?,,,210.3,response,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"Yes, exactly",,,,remark,0,0,3
113,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,0,3
113,Jazmin," But before we go, I just wanted to thank you",,,,response,0,0,3
113,Jazmin,So we have to go to lunch,,,,response,0,0,3
113,Jazmin,"for taking the time to work with us today, and especially like I really wanted to thank you for being so patient with us and our answers and like",,,,response,0,0,3

114,Luis,"I don't think I should be in this group like I already know all about space, like all this stuff",,,,response,1,1,2
114,Luis, And I don't think I really have any problems like figuring it out,,,,response,1,1,2
114,Teacher,Okay well let's just worked work together for a little bit,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher, Okay,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher, And let's just see where we get,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Luis,Okay,,,150.1,response,1,1,2
114,Teacher, Right?,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher, And we want to know what the scientists use to find water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher,All right,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher, The question was we read our story,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher, Okay,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher,"Okay, so let's go over some of our answers Farrah",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher, Do you want to give your answer,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
114,Farrah, Okay,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
114,Farrah," So I said, that a scientist, would need to use a microscope",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
114,Farrah,Oh yeah,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
114,Teacher,Microscope,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher,Would you like to share how you found that or why you chose microscope,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher, I love how you found that in the reading,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher, Very good,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Farrah," So I know that you have to use them, and it says microscopic in the reading, it says that things are really small, so you'd have to use a microscope",,,110.1,response,1,1,2
114,Farrah,Yeah,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
114,Farrah," Um, so when I was looking at, like, when I was looking at the beginning I was thinking like what equipment, the scientists use right and microscope jumped out as, like, I know what I use microscopes in class",,,110.1,response,1,1,2
114,Teacher,Oliver would you like to give your answer to the reading into the question,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher,Very good,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher, I love how you are reading very closely and paying attention to those very big words very good,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Oliver, So I guess that could be the only answer,,,310.1,response,1,1,2
114,Oliver," I Farrah, so I thought it was the microscope, and I guess for me I guess it was kind of the same thing",,,310.1,response,1,1,2
114,Oliver," I figured, when I read through the microscope was the only piece of equipment that I saw like when I was reading",,,310.1,response,1,1,2
114,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,310.1,response,1,1,2
114,Oliver, So I have the same answer,,,310.1,response,1,1,2
114,Teacher,"Okay, well, can you tell me why you might have chose that answer",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher, What made that microscope stick out to you,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Oliver," Like I feel like I guess it's just because it's a piece of equipment and I know that, like we're we're working on the small group",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
114,Oliver,I'm not really sure,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
114,Oliver," So we can we can kind of get the right answer, but I'm not really sure why my answer is wrong",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
114,Teacher,and Chris,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher," Well, that's what we're working towards trying to see where everybody's at and we'll get there",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher," Can you tell us what you think the answer is, and what you found in the text",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher,Okay,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher,"Okay, but I'm glad reading the text and you notice microscope was in there",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Chris,So I was saying basically that there were craters like full of water on all this water,,,150.1,response,1,1,2
114,Teacher, And what made you think about the craters on the moon,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher,Very good,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher,But why did you choose that out of the out of the tags,,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
114,Chris,I guess because when I looked at the text,,,230.2,response,1,1,2
114,Chris," I was like, well, there's the water",,,230.2,response,1,1,2
114,Chris," What I was thinking was basically like I was seeing that they were saying that there was all this ice in the craters, and so I thought like, well, that's all the water so when they we were asking about finding water",,,230.2,response,1,1,2
114,Teacher,"Jazmin, what did you find in the text",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher," I love how you were reading closely to the tax Jazmin, what did you find in the text",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2

114,Jazmin," And that was what was like, what found all the water",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
114,Jazmin,"Basically, NASA sent this small machine",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
114,Teacher, Then what did you find out that NASA used?,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher,"Okay, very good",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher, I bet you really enjoyed this reading,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher,and then Luis You said that you knew a lot about space,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher, I love how you are also reading very closely and looking at the details in the story,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
114,Luis,"Um, well I guess I mostly was thinking like about what I already do, so I guess I didn't read it that closely",,,110.1,response,1,1,2
114,Luis," So I know that they use like oxygen tanks masks and suits, like to go to space",,,,response,1,1,2
114,Luis,Because I was like I already know this,,,,response,1,1,2
114,Luis, Like they use like space suits and gloves and I've been to NASA,,,,response,1,1,2
114,Teacher,Okay,,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher," Alright, well I'm glad you know all of that information",,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher," They talk about NASA as Jazmin was talking, they do send a small machine",,,130.3,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher,"Okay, but in the top of the reading",,,130.3,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher,"And they do talk about sending that you might need a microscope, which Farrah brought up and Oliver",,,130.3,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher," In the story, which Chris brought up so that everybody had a little part in the story, but we want to talk about what they found",,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher,But the microscope is used to see the little particles of water,,,130.3,remark,1,1,2
114,Teacher,And they also talk about craters,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2

114,Teacher,"Okay, let's see, some of us are finishing okay while you're finishing up",,,,remark,2,1,2
114,Teacher,Could have been something different than what you were thinking about,,,,remark,2,1,2
114,Teacher, While you were reading,,,,remark,2,1,2
114,Teacher,"If your answer is different, or if you think is still the same Farrah, did you see something different",,,,remark,2,1,2
114,Farrah,"Um, I guess I was looking really close, but I guess I still kind of see that it's a microscope, because that was what I saw",,,,response,2,1,2
114,Teacher,That is fine,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
114,Teacher,"Oliver, what did you see why you were reading",,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
114,Teacher, That is okay,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2

114,Chris,"And so instead of i realized my, my answer was like about like the water so i i was looking at was like, okay, so like what equipment and",,,,response,2,1,2
114,Chris, I didn't know,,,,response,2,1,2
114,Chris,I couldn't decide I thought maybe it was the microscope or maybe it was the Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,2,1,2
114,Teacher, Good job Chris,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2

114,Teacher,"Okay, while you were reading near the top, it does talk about a small machine that help NASA find water and it is called a lunar orbiter",,,130.3,remark,2,1,2
114,Teacher, Okay,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
114,Teacher,and as you're reading a lot of times you need to use a finger pointer to help you point as you're finding your words,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
114,Teacher,And that's what they helped find water,,,130.3,remark,2,1,2
114,Teacher," Yes, Chris",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2

114,Luis,"Um, okay",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Luis," Like, I don't think that I should be in this group because I already know like all about space",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Teacher, Okay?,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,"Okay, well, there may be somebody here that does so let's all just take our turns and we'll see where it goes",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
114,Luis,Okay,,,110.1,response,0,1,2
114,Teacher, It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,"All right, so let's talk about the question",,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher, Everybody gave a different answer,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,So I think we all need to reread the passage,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher," Okay, one more time",,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher, I'm going to give you about two minutes to read over it and then we're going to come back and look at our answers again,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher, Okay,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
114,Farrah,We can read super fast,,,120.3,response,0,1,2

114,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher, Is everyone done,,,,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,What equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon?,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,"Now, yes, Farrah?",,,,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,What is your answer?,,,,remark,0,1,2
114,Farrah,"Okay, so I think, um, I think the answer is the microscope",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Farrah,"They said that in, in paragraph three, you need a micro-- a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Teacher,"Good job, Luis",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher," So once you reread it, you found a different answer correct?",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
114,Farrah,"Well, that was, I'm sorry",,,110.1,response,0,1,2
114,Farrah, This was Farrah,,,110.1,response,0,1,2

114,Farrah,"And I'm not sure like why, my answer might be incorrect",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Teacher,"Yes, it was the microscope",,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher, Does everybody see where Farrah found that in paragraph three?,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,"Okay, it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher, You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher, The water they found is mcroscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you weren't looking straight at it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,Has anyone ever use a microscope before?,,,140.1,remark,0,1,2
114,Oliver,"Yeah, we've used it in science class before",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
114,Teacher,"Wow, what were you using it to find?",,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
114,Oliver,"Um, we were looking at DNA, like we did a, like a like a swab of our cheek and we were looking at like DNA cells",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
114,Oliver, It was really interesting,,,230.1,response,0,1,2
114,Teacher,Wow,,,,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,What else do you think they would use be looking for on the moon?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,"Do you think of anything else, Jazmin",,,,remark,0,1,2
114,Jazmin,"I think that they would use, I think that the answer is that they're using the small machine",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Jazmin," I'm not sure if the microscope is what they're discovering with so I'm not quite sure if Farrah's right, or if I'm right",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Jazmin,And the small machine is what they're using to discover the water,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Teacher," Well, let's look at page, paragraph three, okay? Do you see where they're numbered each paragraph has a number beside of it",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher, All right,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,Okay,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher," Can everybody take their finger and put it on number three, find the number three, paragraph 1, 2, 3",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,You see it?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,"Do you? Yeah, okay",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher," Let the rear end of that paragraph, it talks about what kind of small tool, scientific tool that they would use",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,Do you see it Jazmin?,,,,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,Does anyone need help finding it,,,,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,Does anyone need help,,,,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,"Chris, you need some help?",,,,remark,0,1,2
114,Chris,"No, no, I don't need help, but I did have a question",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Teacher,"Yes, sir",,,,remark,0,1,2
114,Chris,Okay,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Chris," So I was thinking that, um, I went to NASA with my dad and we studied like all of these like different things that, like um",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Chris,Like the astronauts use like oxygen tanks and spacesuits,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Chris," Well, I mean, know my answer was about the craters, but like I think that like maybe we could use the oxy-- like they could use oxygen tanks to find it also",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Chris," And like I was wondering, like, like, that was my answer",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Teacher, But what does it tell us in the story?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,"Okay, but what does the reading tell us? You possibly could use oxygen tanks",,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
114,Chris,"Um, I guess it doesn't really say anything about like I'm like really about like the um using like space suits and stuff",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
114,Chris, I guess that was like from like my understanding,,,230.2,response,0,1,2
114,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,,remark,0,1,2

114,Teacher,"Anybody like to volunteer to read? Oliver, would you read paragraph one for us",,,,remark,0,1,2
114,Oliver," However, they used to believe that there was no water on the moon, now they know this is not true",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Oliver, Scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Oliver, These craters are dark places where the sun never shines,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Oliver, Scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on Earth,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Oliver," Okay, so",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Oliver,Um sure,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Teacher,"Okay, who would like to read the second one",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2

114,Jazmin,"So it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigat",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Jazmin, These ice deposits are very small,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Jazmin, The lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crator,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Jazmin,Scientists said that one of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Jazmin, That's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Teacher,Very good,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2

114,Luis,"Okay, okay",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Luis,"So okay, so yeah",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Luis, This means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Luis," Like, um okay",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Luis," The water they found is microscopic many wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,1,2
114,Teacher,"Right, who heard in that story what they use",,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher, What was the name of that scientific tool,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
114,Teacher,Jazmin?,,,,remark,0,1,2

114,Jazmin, And you were really thoughtful,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Jazmin,Like you were very patient with us as we were all giving our answers and we all had very different answers,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Jazmin, So thank you so much,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Jazmin,About like listening to us and helping us be able to say our answers about what we thought like sometimes we stress out our science teacher and you were so patient and it really made us feel confident to like share answers,,,,response,0,1,2
114,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,1,2
115,Oliver,Hi,,,,response,0,0,2
115,Teacher,How are you guys,,,,remark,0,0,2

115,Teacher,"So you read the text, the water on the moon already",,,,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher,So what are some thoughts that you've had on the text prior to answering any of the questions?,,,140.1,remark,0,0,2
115,Luis," Um, I already kind of know like all about space and like I kind of like know like all this stuff",,,140.1,response,0,0,2
115,Luis,"Um, so I just wanted to say",,,140.1,response,0,0,2
115,Luis, So I don't think I need to be in this group,,,140.1,response,0,0,2
115,Teacher,"Well, that's a very big statement because I don't even know all about space, space is so broad and there's so many unanswered questions that I think that you have be eager to learn about",,,220.1,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher, I'm sure there's something new that you might could gain from it,,,220.1,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher, So this though you might think that you might know some of this stuff,,,220.1,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher, I didn't even know about water on the moon,,,220.1,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher, So I think it's very beneficial that you're in this group,,,220.1,remark,0,0,2
115,Luis,"Yeah, that's, that's a good point",,,220.1,response,0,0,2

115,Teacher," Now, have y'all already thought of your answers for this question?",,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher,It said what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
115,Jazmin,"Yes, we did, we all, yeah",,,120.2,response,0,0,2
115,Teacher,"Okay, who wants to share their answer with me",,,,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah?",,,,remark,0,0,2
115,Farrah,"Okay, so basically, um, I think that the answer is they used the microscope",,,,response,0,0,2
115,Farrah,"Because they, that's the science tool they talk about in paragraph three",,,,response,0,0,2
115,Teacher,That was a wonderful answer,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher, Does anyone else want to add their answer to it,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,0,2

115,Teacher, Okay,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher,Wonderful,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher," Now textual evidence is when you have a question and you refer back to your passage to find the exact answer, or as close as possible",,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher, So I want to talk about these two responses for just a moment,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher," So whenever we're looking at passages, we really want to focus on textual evidence",,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher, Does that stand to say anything about any equipment?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher, These craters are dark places where the sun never shines,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher,"So if we look at our passage right here in the first stanza it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
115,Farrah,"No, I guess not",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
115,Teacher,"No, I don't see anything in there either",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher," So let's move on to our second one, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher, These ice deposits are very small,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher,This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher, Was there anything in that stanza that might have referred to equipment being used?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
115,Jazmin,"Yes, that's where they talk about the small machine that they sent to the moon",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
115,Teacher,Correct,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher," So we already seen stanza to that we can support our answer to the question, because we have found it",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher," Yes, Farrah?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
115,Farrah,"Okay, so here's my question",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
115,Farrah," I'm, I'm trying to understand, like, why my answer might not be correct to say thought they use a microscope to see the water",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
115,Teacher,Your answer is correct because the microscope is a tool,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher, Now equipment is is very broad when comes two machines and tools and what you refer to them as,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher,"So the scientists needed to use tools and equipment to discover the water on the moon, and they use that by starting with the small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher, Does that make sense?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher, So you had to have both forms of equipment to figure out the answers that we were looking for in this passage,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher,"So once we investigated the moon, we could then use our tool to discover more about it",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher,"Yes, Chris?",,,,remark,0,0,2
115,Chris," So I was just wondering, like, my dad took me to NASA and we went and studied like and looked at all like the stuff that people wear there and like the spacesuits and like oxygen tanks and all this stuff",,,,response,0,0,2
115,Chris," Like, don't we need that stuff to find the water? Like I think that maybe we need that stuff too",,,,response,0,0,2
115,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,0,2
115,Teacher,There's a lot of things that we need to have whenever we go into space,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher, Now that's very fascinating that you were able to visit NASA,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher,That's a great cultural experience and it gives you a little insight into having some prior knowledge as you move forward in your science classes,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher,Now astronauts and scientists have to use all kinds of equipment and certain materials that they have to wear when they go into space because it's such an unknown area and we want to be as safe as possible,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher,"So when you got to see all of those things that NASA you were able to see some of the space suits, some of the tools and equipment that they use",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher,And that's probably helped you a little bit with reading this passage and being able to connect some of the experiences that you had back to this packet passage,,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,0,2
115,Jazmin," I just wanted to take a moment, I just wanted to thank you for working with us today",,,,response,0,0,2
115,Jazmin,"So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,,response,0,0,2
115,Jazmin, But before we could lunch,,,,response,0,0,2
115,Jazmin," It really makes us feel like we can share our ideas with you, like, because you were so like",,,,response,0,0,2
115,Jazmin,You are so patient and so positive with all of us,,,,response,0,0,2
115,Jazmin, So I just wanted to thank you so much for that,,,,response,0,0,2
115,Jazmin," And he says, we give him stress hives and you were so just like calm and and just very thoughtful",,,,response,0,0,2
115,Jazmin,Helpful with like the different answers that we had,,,,response,0,0,2
115,Jazmin, And sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher,,,,response,0,0,2
115,Teacher,You're very welcome,,,,remark,0,0,2
115,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, So today we have I've looked at some of your responses to our reading and some of the questions and what you guys came up with,,,,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,Hi everyone,,,,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,1,0,2
115,Luis,"Okay, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,2
115,Teacher, And you might find out that you'll learn some new strategies that might help you with other prompts or stories or questions that might help you in the future,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,"Well, we might can look just a little bit closer",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, Would that be okay?,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,So I think it might be good for you in the group and listen to some of the strategies I want to share with you guys,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, Hopefully we can find some strategies that work for you and you can use,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,Okay,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,So we're going to look at some of your answers that you have and ways that we could improve some of them and some strengths that many of you did have in your answers,,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,So our question that we have first is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,So before we even look into our text we want to look at our question,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, The question is specifically asking what equipment did scientists use to discover the water,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher," Oh, text evidence is something I wanted to talk to you guys about",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, We know that we want to look for some sort of equipment and based around water,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,So right there,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,So text evidence is going to support your answers and pull it straight from the text so that you always know that your answers are close or semi correct,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,"So, in the very first paragraph",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, If you all look at your text it says that scientists have found evidence,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, Did they use to discover water,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, So we want to find proof to the question of what equipment,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,So evidence is a really important word because it means that there's going to be proof in our passage,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,Now our first person that we're going to talk about is their response is Chris,,,,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,"Okay so Chris, you said in one of your responses that scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher," So, you are correct on finding where the water is now we just have to look a little deeper and figure out how we discovered where this water is",,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,"And you are absolutely right that is straight from the text, they did find water in these craters",,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Chris,"So I did a good job in finding out where the water is I, I gotta find out what what discovered the water",,,410.2,response,1,0,2
115,Teacher,Exactly,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher," That's exactly what I want you to start looking for and we're gonna keep going and keep going a little deeper into the rest of the group's answers and see what we can find out, but you are on the right track",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher," Now, Jazmin",,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, Yes,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,So as we continue into paragraph two it states NASA sent a small machine,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
115,Jazmin,My answer came from paragraph two,,,120.3,response,1,0,2
115,Jazmin, I still don't understand why my answers wrong,,,120.3,response,1,0,2
115,Teacher,"So, Jazmin",,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, But what you have is a great start,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher," Your answer is not necessarily wrong, but we can go just a little bit deeper and to make your answer more detailed and just a little bit better than What we have right now",,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, And that is correct,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,So you said that NASA sent a small machine,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher," The, you have to send your small machine in order to discover the water,",,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,But look in your text Jazmin,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher," And look, just a few more words",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, What did they call this small machine,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
115,Jazmin,Called the lunar orbit Jupiter,,,420.3,response,1,0,2
115,Teacher, So what machine discovered water,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,A lunar orbiter,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Jazmin,And the Lunar Orbiter?,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
115,Teacher, But we could have made it just a little bit more detail,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,Absolutely,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, So do you understand how your answer was right,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Jazmin,I just have to add called lunar orbiter?,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
115,Teacher,Yes Chris,,,,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,"Yes, you need to be just a little more descriptive in your response",,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher," But once you add that little extra bit of adding the official name of what equipment was used, then you're going to be on the right track",,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Chris," I'm in the story, but I just heard you tell I'm Jazmin, what it was",,,,response,1,0,2
115,Chris," So no, I know that it was the lunar orbiter",,,,response,1,0,2
115,Chris,I didn't see it in the story,,,,response,1,0,2
115,Teacher,It is the Lunar Orbiter and we're just gonna keep going and talking about our answers and figuring out where we came up with these answers and how we could have got them better,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
115,Chris, Okay,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
115,Chris," Teacher, I went to NASA",,,150.1,response,1,0,2
115,Chris,Better,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
115,Chris, Okay,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
115,Teacher,Right,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, And they do use a lot of equipment such as that but our question specifically wants to know what equipment they use to discover water,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,"You're right, NASA does use a lot of equipment but we just got to be very specific and identifying which equipment we do",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
115,Chris,Yeah yeah,,,420.2,response,1,0,2
115,Teacher, So we're going to move down to paragraph number three,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, Can you all find paragraph number three,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,"Okay, awesome",,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, Yeah,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,"So I noticed Farrah that you talked about a microscope in your answer, that right",,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, So let's talk about that just a little bit,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,Yeah,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, So what made you choose that as your answer,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Farrah," I know his equipment and also I was looking for where they talked about water and in this paragraph, they talk about the microscope",,,230.1,response,1,0,2
115,Farrah,The question was asking about equipment and so I was looking for where the worst equipment and so the microscope,,,230.1,response,1,0,2
115,Farrah,As a scientific tool to look at the water,,,,response,1,0,2
115,Teacher," But then we have to go back to our question, figure out what it's asking specifically",,,410.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher," So, you are correct tool and equipment their words that go hand in hand together",,,410.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,"Yes, very good",,,410.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,"So your answer talked about a microscope being the tool use, but what did the microscope do did it discover water or was it used to look at the water",,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
115,Farrah,Used it to look at the water,,,210.3,response,1,0,2
115,Teacher, They use it to examine the water,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,"Yet, that's right",,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, So if they're using a microscope to examine the water is that our equipment we used to discover it,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
115,Farrah," No, I guess not",,,210.3,response,1,0,2
115,Farrah,I guess,,,210.3,response,1,0,2
115,Teacher, Does that make sense now,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher,"Right, so our microscope is used to look at our water, but we've already discovered our water with the Lunar Orbiter",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
115,Farrah," So I feel like, oh yeah cuz discover is different from look at",,,150.1,response,1,0,2
115,Farrah,"Yeah, I guess, I guess",,,150.1,response,1,0,2
115,Teacher,"Yes, it's just a little bit different",,,,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher," Yes, Oliveron",,,,remark,1,0,2
115,Oliver,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just looked at the clock and it's time for the next group",,,,response,1,0,2
115,Oliver, So we'll have to see you again later,,,,response,1,0,2
115,Teacher,"Okay, we'll see you later",,,,remark,1,0,2
115,Oliver,Alright,,,,response,1,0,2
115,Teacher,Bye guys,,,,remark,1,0,2
115,Teacher, So we're going to look at our second question that we have from the passage in the question states is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, Luis,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"All right, you guys",,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, Yes,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Luis,"Okay, I think I got this all figured out",,,120.2,response,2,0,2
115,Luis, So now I'm all good,,,120.2,response,2,0,2
115,Teacher, Thank you,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,Okay you,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, You're good to go,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, But we're going to talk just a little bit more about text evidence and how it can help us with our questions,,,220.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, So I want you all to look at question number two,,,220.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"Yeah, wonderful, buddy",,,220.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, Can you name one of the words in this question that might be important,,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,There's two words that are very important in this question,,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Luis,Okay,,,420.1,response,2,0,2
115,Luis,"Um, I'm going to say, water is a big important word",,,,response,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"Okay, water could be one",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, Do you see any other words that could be important,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,How about the word evidence and the word value,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, So will there be convincing evidence or will there not we'll find out,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"Evidence means that we're going to prove our answer that in this passage, it tells us the answer to this question",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, So now what I want you to do is look into your text before we talk about the responses to the question,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, Do you see the word valuable when we look at the subheading water is a valuable resource,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,Also says the word valuable,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"I see some nods yes, it says in the heading that that that water is a valuable resource",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher," So we already know, sort of, the answer to our question that it is a valuable resource",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,Now let's look at some supporting details that prove why it's a valuable resource,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"So when we look at the very first sentence, it says water on the moon would be valuable",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher," But do you see in our heading and in our first line, how we can already start identifying that it is a valuable resource",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,So it's already telling us it's valuable now Farrah and Oliver,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, I know that you saw on here that you weren't quite sure if it was a valuable resource or not,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
115,Farrah,But I'm still kind of confused,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
115,Teacher," And now the reason that you could be confused is because it says it, but we haven't proved it",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"Okay, so we'll keep going",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,You always want to prove your answer so that you always know that it's right,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"Okay, so it says in here that water can be used for astronauts to drink",,,130.3,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, So that's a valuable way that we could use water now,,,130.3,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,It then says water is heavy,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher," So when you're if you are going up into space, would you want to carry all these loads of water in your spacecraft or would it be really convenient if the water was already at the moon",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Chris, So I think I'm right,,,,response,2,0,2
115,Jazmin, So I think I'm right too,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
115,Jazmin,"Well, I said that thing about them not being able to drink it",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
115,Chris,"Yeah, so that's why I put that one as my answer",,,,response,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"Okay, so in this article right here or in these paragraphs",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, There's a few reasons as to why waters valuable,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,So you are right in the fact that it is heavy,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, And so that is one reason that water on the moon would be a valuable resource,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"So really good job, you guys, but there are some more that we can look at",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, It takes up a lot of room,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, Now we have to,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"So if we keep going into paragraph five, it says, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Luis, I said that one,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
115,Luis,That's the thing I said,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
115,Teacher, Would that be a important and valuable resource to have on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, Good job,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, Luis,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,Yes,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,Now I'll continue we have to use oxygen in order to breathe,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, So if water can provide oxygen,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Luis,I mean yeah cuz you know everybody needs to breathe,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
115,Luis," That's, that's, that's, like, the most important thing that you can have in life is breathing",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
115,Teacher, If you're able to create hydrogen and oxygen in the moon versus having to take it all the way up into space,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, We can also look at it goes into further and says that hydrogen and oxygen can be used as rocket fuel,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, So that could be a possible reason that it's a valuable resource,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,  So that would also take some weight off your spacecraft,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,Very important,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,So do you see that there's a few possible answers to this question because the text gives us some examples,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
115,Chris,I read that there could be a base on the moon in 2024,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
115,Teacher,Possibly,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,Possibly,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, Do you guys understand how important text evidence is and how it can help you answer your questions and to more importantly justify your answers,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, Who knows but that would be really cool now,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Farrah,"Reacher Every Reader: Well, I mean, that's why I'm still confused because I did you something from the text",,,,response,2,0,2
115,Chris,"Yeah, it looks like you know me and Jazmin and Luis add some stuff from the text",,,420.2,response,2,0,2
115,Farrah, But you told me it was wrong,,,,response,2,0,2
115,Chris, I don't know where y'all were talking about Farrah and Oliver,,,420.2,response,2,0,2
115,Teacher,Now we can pull things from the text but there can always be the possibility that there might be a more detailed answer that we could have given that would have been closer to what the questions asking,,,430.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,So we want to be as detailed as possible when we answer our questions so that we have all the information that we need in our response,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"So, Farrah and Deb you you did look in the text and you were on the right track",,,430.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, But we could have just went just a little bit deeper into it and got more of a descriptive answer,,,430.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,430.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Oliver, So all I have to say no it's not ready,,,430.2,response,2,0,2
115,Oliver," Chris, hmm",,,430.2,response,2,0,2
115,Oliver,"Okay, so I guess what you're saying is that, me and Farrah were right too",,,430.2,response,2,0,2
115,Oliver," Um,",,,430.2,response,2,0,2
115,Oliver," Um, but we just have to add more words",,,430.2,response,2,0,2
115,Oliver, So there you go,,,430.2,response,2,0,2
115,Luis, I got enough,,,,response,2,0,2
115,Luis,They would need to study the multiverse and build new equipment,,,,response,2,0,2
115,Luis," Okay, so I added more details, is that as a good answers",,,,response,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"Well, our answers are kind of what we just went over on how we use some of the texts supporting details to prove why Our answer is what it is",,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,So when I talked about how you could break it down into hydrogen and oxygen that talked about a way that makes your water valuable,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"And another way is when we talked about it being too heavy to carry it also makes it very valuable to have on the moon, so that we don't have to carry it",,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, Does that help better explain it to you Oliver,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,So we want to make sure that we're answering the question as fully and descriptively as possible,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Oliver," Okay, thanks",,,420.2,response,2,0,2
115,Oliver,Okay,,,420.2,response,2,0,2
115,Oliver," I just, I guess you're saying I'm not like I'm but i i used I added more stuff from",,,420.2,response,2,0,2
115,Oliver," Um, yeah",,,420.2,response,2,0,2
115,Oliver," And my answer, but I didn't answer the question",,,,response,2,0,2
115,Oliver,The text,,,,response,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"Correct, you got to make sure that you answer the question",,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher," You got to make sure you add all of your details, does that help?",,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, And when you answer your question,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
115,Oliver,Okay,,,420.2,response,2,0,2
115,Teacher,We're gonna be doing a lot more practice with these questions so that you feel comfortable with it,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"But what we need to do is definitely go through your passage and then highlight important details you always want to highlight your headings, or your sub headings",,,510.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, So that's what you need to do want to read your question is to find details that go along with your question and could possibly support your answer,,,510.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher,Because those are a lot of key details in there that could give you some really good text evidence,,,510.1,remark,2,0,2
115,Oliver,All thanks Teacher,,,510.1,response,2,0,2
115,Oliver," It looks like a time for us to go to lunch, but I do appreciate how you you asked me a lot of questions to help me think about",,,510.1,response,2,0,2
115,Oliver,"Well, how I I came to my answer and and and how you explain what what i need to work on, which is like looking highlighting some of the arm but the headings and more details throughout the whole story, I think, to find more evidence to match the question",,,,response,2,0,2
115,Teacher,"That's right, Oliver and then you'll get the hang of it",,,,remark,2,0,2
115,Teacher, He's gotta keep practicing and you guys all did great with your questions,,,,remark,2,0,2
115,Oliver,Okay,,,,response,2,0,2
115,Oliver, Bye,,,,response,2,0,2
116,Teacher,Hey guys,,,,remark,1,0,2
116,All,Hi,,,,,1,0,2
116,Luis,I'm,,,,response,1,0,2
116,Luis,"Excuse me, Master Clement",,,,response,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"Yes, even",,,,remark,1,0,2
116,Luis,"Be on this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"Right, you, you probably have an extensive knowledge of outer space through you know TV and stuff, but we're in this group so that we can focus on",,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, So I suppose I will start with,,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, So that's the main goal of what we're working on together,,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,extracting information from from informative text,,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"And you said, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,Will you tell me what what,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"With your with your answer to, number one, which says what equipment did scientists, you discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,How did,,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher," Where did you pull oxygen tanks from the text for them, discovering water",,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,your thought process was for answering that,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Luis, And I know that you can't breathe on when you go to the moon,,,230.1,response,1,0,2
116,Luis, So they need oxygen tanks in order to breathe on the moon,,,230.1,response,1,0,2
116,Luis,"Well, well, like you said, you know, I know a lot about space",,,230.1,response,1,0,2
116,Teacher,But I'm in the text,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,That's good,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, They do need that,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,So the oxygen tank maybe used to breathe,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, There's a focus on what machine actually they which I actually used to discover the water on them,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,It,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"So, what you should be looking for in the Texas something more specific about what they're using to discover the water",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,But that isn't necessarily the equipment they use to discover the water,,,130.3,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,Hmm,,,,remark,1,0,2
116,Luis,"Um, okay",,,,response,1,0,2
116,Luis," Well, I don't know",,,,response,1,0,2
116,Luis, I don't know that one,,,,response,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"Could you look closer at the text at the at the forefront of text, maybe, and",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,Figure out what what what other equipment or machines were used in the in the process that might help you a little bit better,,,120.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, Okay,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,specifically looking for examples of how they discovered the water,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
116,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.3,response,1,0,2
116,Jazmin,I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"Okay, well, we'll go over yours too",,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, So you mentioned a small machine,,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,but your answer sort of just summed up the fact that they sent a small machine and what you should be looking for is maybe an answer that,,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"Which is which is good because they did use a small machine and it does say small machine,",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,answers the question better,,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"So it says what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon, but a small machine could mean anything",,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, What was the small machine called it wouldn't be maybe a more solid answer than just the small machine,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,So you could be looking for something more specific,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, So when you're reading,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, So it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, You could you should name that machine,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,And looking for a specific question,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,In the correct response like just just if you were having a conversation with someone and like as if you are super excited about the moon and they asked you what kind of machine do they use discover water on them and then your answer should be more specific to,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,To answer them,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, So that's kind of the answer you should be looking for in answering these attacks,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, If you're having a conversation like you would name the machine and tell them how they used it,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,And I'll go to Chris,,,,remark,1,0,2
116,Chris,Yeah yeah i i went to NASA,,,,response,1,0,2
116,Chris, So I know that time does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"Right, I'm super jealous that you had NASA but",,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
116,Chris,Me and my dad went,,,110.3,response,1,0,2
116,Teacher,Science is a your answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, Invite me,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,To the next time,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,And so it looks like you should you need to focus on the question more as well as the text,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"Okay, so they did find",,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, So you're going to be looking for our,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"Craters water on the moon,",,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"but the question is asking what equipment that scientists use discover water on the moon and so on and saying, equipment, it's looking for what types of machines or technology",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, Did they need to discover that water,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"When, when a text is talking about discovering the water, you're going to be looking for the types of machines they used to do that",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher," The informative text does list some of the machines, it says the names of the machines",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher," And right before they talk about the discovery of, okay, so that would be a more solid answer",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,And the text,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, Okay,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,And it answers the question better,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,And I'm a to Farrah,,,,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"Okay, and you put you would need a scientific cool tool called a microscope to look really closely, so",,,,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher," You were headed in the right direction, you would definitely need a microscope, because the water is so",,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,Your answer is not incredibly wrong,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"So scarce and so microscopic on water and found you know only unlike little trace amounts and you would need a microscope to look at it, but",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,That isn't what they used to discover it,,,130.3,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"Okay, so you're when you're reading the informative text, you should be looking for words that jump out to you about",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"About discovering something you know like what they actually used to find it, not what they used to look at it",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher," But before that, how did they find it so it would help you better to understand the question and understand",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, And then what happened,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,Maybe like a chronological timeline of events in a text,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, You might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher, So if you broke down the text and circled like what happened first and then what happened,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,2
116,Teacher,"Yes, Deb",,,,remark,1,0,2
116,Oliver," CLEMENS I know it's been a short time, but I was just looking at the clock and it's time for the next group",,,,response,1,0,2

116,Teacher,Doing well,,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,I don't really understand how I'm gonna do this but I'll start with Farrah I suppose,,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Farrah,"Okay, yeah, you can just pretend like we're real students in the classroom and you can call on us, or have us work however you like",,,,response,0,0,2
116,Teacher," Luis, why you raising your hand",,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,Or even raising his hand,,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,Do you have a question,,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Luis," So, like, I don't really think I need to be in this group, because I don't really need the help",,,,response,0,0,2
116,Luis, So I actually like I know all about space,,,,response,0,0,2
116,Luis, Okay,,,,response,0,0,2
116,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,0,2
116,Teacher,Well you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen when responding to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher," Where did you find your answer from the text, which paragraph?",,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Luis,"Um, well, I didn't really get it from the text, a kind of just knew it",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
116,Luis, So I didn't really like get it from the reading,,,230.2,response,0,0,2
116,Teacher, But let's take your knowledge of outer space and focus in on this paragraph,,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,"Okay, that makes sense",,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher," Yeah, kids do that all the time",,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,"So in the text, you should be focusing on what would answer that specific question not not pre knowledge",,,430.1,remark,0,0,2
116,Luis,"Okay, that, that makes sense",,,430.1,response,0,0,2
116,Teacher,"So what from the text, how can you work, how can you focus to see when when you've got the question what equipment did scientists you discovered water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher," What, what are you looking for?",,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Luis,"um like, we're looking for like machines or tools like in the text",,,210.2,response,0,0,2
116,Teacher,Okay and machines and tools that do what?,,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Luis,um discover discover the water,,,210.2,response,0,0,2
116,Teacher," So when you're looking for what type of machines or stuff they use to look for the water when you're looking at the three paragraphs, where, where would you find that information, one of the paragraphs specifically",,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,Right,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,do you see a word that you would use in of those paragraphs just by skimming,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Luis,"Well, I can I, yeah, I can look it up and try to see, um,",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
116,Luis,I gotta kind of read it through,,,,response,0,0,2
116,Luis, I didn't read it very carefully,,,,response,0,0,2
116,Farrah,"I have a question, it's Farrah",,,,response,0,0,2
116,Teacher, What's your question,,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Farrah,"Okay, so I was wondering, um, I said that the the the the tool used, the equipment used to discover the water was a microscope, but I'm trying to understand what my answer might be incorrect",,,,response,0,0,2
116,Teacher,"but what it says is, you need a scientific tool called a microscope microscope, you look really closely",,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,"So you you just used a, one sentence from the paragraph that had a piece of equipment in it",,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher, It doesn't answer the question exactly what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,There's a better answer in the text that's saying what did the scientists use to find the water on the moon,,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Farrah, OK,,,410.2,response,0,0,2
116,Farrah,"Oh, OK",,,410.2,response,0,0,2
116,Teacher,And Oliver,,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,"You, you just said I circled the same as Farrah, but you should voice, your own answer is not just piggybacking off of one of your fellow classmates, so that I can help you better and also if you circled the same as to then you're still looking, you still just caught a glimpse of a piece of equipment, but you're, you didn't really read what that piece of equipment was for or what it did",,,430.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher, So you also need to figure out what the scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,430.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Oliver,"Ah, OK",,,430.2,response,0,0,2
116,Oliver, I can do that,,,430.2,response,0,0,2

116,Teacher, You didn't really read and do your underlining and highlighting,,,410.3,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,"And Chris, your answer was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher, They did,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher," In the article did say they found craters with some water on the moon, but they didn't say, full of water",,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,You should be looking for a tool or equipment or maybe machine that they used to discover the water,,,420.3,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher, Something they used,,,420.3,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,Okay?,,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Chris," I didn't, well, because I was thinking like I was thinking about, well, okay, this is a little bit of a different thing, but it makes me wonder if like",,,,response,0,0,2

116,Chris,"Like, like we're kind of like a, like we we like have to use spacesuits",,,,response,0,0,2
116,Chris," So I guess I'm wondering, like, did they not have to use that equipment to discover the water?",,,,response,0,0,2
116,Teacher, They sent a machine up there,,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,"Um, I don't think so",,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,"So they sent a piece, they didn't send humans up there, so no one would need the oxygen",,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,That's a good question there,,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher, I would wonder the same thing,,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,And then Jazmin,,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,"Your answer was, NASA sent a small machine",,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher, So you're in the ballpark,,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher, So you found the equipment,,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,"But there's, it's more descriptive",,,430.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher, But what was the machine called and what did it do?,,,430.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher," And you're right, it is a small machine",,,430.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher, They talked more about the machine and we're trying to look at more at the detail of the machine,,,430.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher, So what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon,,,430.2,remark,0,0,2
116,Jazmin,"It was the, in the same sentence as this machine it says, the Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,430.2,response,0,0,2
116,Teacher,"Okay, that's good",,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Teacher,And a little bit more detail,,,,remark,0,0,2
116,Jazmin," So, so it does say pretty clearly like that's the thing that that found the water, right?",,,,response,0,0,2
116,Jazmin,"The Lunar Orbiter, it lands at the South Pole and it looks for ice deposits",,,,response,0,0,2
116,Jazmin, Yes,,,,response,0,0,2

116,Oliver, But before we went to lunch,,,,response,0,0,2
116,Oliver,"Because sometimes we can get really kind of wrapped up and confused about the answer, but you were really clear in what you are saying and asking us to look at specific parts of the reading",,,,response,0,0,2
116,Oliver,"And also, um, you were very positive with us so we felt like we could still give an answer, even if it wasn't correct",,,,response,0,0,2

117,Luis,"I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be on this group, I am already know all about space",,,150.1,response,1,1,2
117,Teacher," That you like hearing about like learning about space, but maybe,",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,"Oh, well, there's so much more to learn",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, Space is so expansive right and so there's so much more to learn,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, That's awesome,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,maybe you can help your partner's out Luis I think you would be a great addition to our group,,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Luis,All okay,,,150.1,response,1,1,2
117,Teacher, So the question is asking us,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher," So you've all shared your responses and they're all I can see that they're all maybe a little bit different, but I think we need to relook at this question",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,All right,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,"Okay, so I want you to look at your paper and I want you to circle the key words in this question so circle, maybe two key words from this question, I'll give you about 10 seconds to do that",,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,What equipment is used to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, When you've circled your two key words,,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,If you will just look up at me when you're finished,,,420.1,remark,1,1,2

117,Teacher, What do you think,,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher," Okay, so which which were the most two most important words in this question, the two key words",,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,That's all right,,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Jazmin,"I said, and discover",,,420.1,response,1,1,2
117,Teacher,So you might have circled water as well,,,130.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, But I think that we are looking for the equipment used to discover the water,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,Okay,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, I think a equipment and discover and you may have circled other words as well,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher," And I agree with you, Jazmin",,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, Yeah,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Farrah,"I did, yeah",,,130.3,response,1,1,2
117,Farrah,And moon to,,,,response,1,1,2
117,Teacher," Yes, those are important as well",,,110.4,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,"Oh, and move",,,110.4,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,So the two verbs here where,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,Discover and equipment,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher," Okay, so let's take about",,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,10 seconds to think of some synonyms or words that are similar to each of those words,,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, So let's,,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, What's another word for equipment and what's another word for discover,,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, Those above,,,,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, Looks like we're finished,,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,Right,,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher," Um, so what do you guys think what is another word for equipment",,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,What might you say,,,,remark,1,1,2
117,,"I said that equipment is a tool, but I don't understand my, my answer is wrong",,,,,1,1,2
117,Teacher,Yeah,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher," Your answer is not, I wouldn't say that it's wrong",,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,I think that you just need maybe a little bit more clarity on it,,,410.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, I think you need to add a little bit more,,,410.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,"So, so which tool or gadget or technology even or machine is was used to discover or identify or reveal or find the water",,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher," Um, yeah, I don't think that it's wrong",,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,Cute,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,So let's look back at,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,paragraphs three and four specifically,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,So let's break it up into groups Farrah and Oliver if you will be a group of two AND THEN Chris Jazmin and Luis,,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,Let's i'll give you guys,,,,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher," Okay, so let's look back at paragraphs three and four for about a minute",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,and see if we can add to our answer or maybe even change it,,,120.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,"A minute to look back at paragraphs three and four, and then I'll give you about two minutes to talk",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Farrah,"So, um, when I read it, I read the thing where it talked about the microscope, because I thought microscope was a tool just like Jazmin",,,120.3,response,1,1,2
117,Oliver," Um, so that's an appointment",,,,response,1,1,2
117,Oliver," Um, so that's what I saw, and most true",,,,response,1,1,2
117,Oliver, True,,,,response,1,1,2
117,Oliver,"Um, yeah, and I saw that an arm and in paragraph four, they talked about a spacecraft",,,,response,1,1,2
117,Jazmin, So I saw that they talked about a microscope in paragraph three,,,,response,1,1,2
117,Jazmin,"Well, okay",,,,response,1,1,2
117,Jazmin,"With the water and I didn't really, I saw a machine",,,,response,1,1,2
117,Jazmin, I guess the spacecraft,,,,response,1,1,2
117,Chris,Yeah yeah,,,,response,1,1,2
117,Luis," Um, yeah, and microscope is, is it my turn",,,,response,1,1,2
117,Luis,Spacecraft machine,,,,response,1,1,2
117,Luis,"Okay, I think we're done",,,,response,1,1,2
117,Teacher,"Now, if all five of us can agree upon one response",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, Chris,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,"Alright guys, I've heard some really great responses",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, Yes,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher," Um, let's see",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, You guys are doing a great job working together,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Chris,I want to NASA,,,150.1,response,1,1,2
117,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to,,,150.1,response,1,1,2
117,Teacher,"Yeah, and paragraphs three and four",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, Let's look at specifically what the text is telling us though,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,"Yeah, they do",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher," They, they have to use a ton of equipment",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,Although might have some other knowledge,,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher," Let's see if, now we can come up with a whole group response",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,So all five of us,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,So let's take about 10 seconds each person is going to share,,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, Let's look at specifically at the reading,,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, We all have I heard some really great answers,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,Let's take about 10 seconds and,,,,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,"Group members, while the first person is sharing",,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher," So we're going to start with Farrah, you will be our first person to share",,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,You are just listening to them,,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,"Debbie will be the second Chris, you'll be the third Jazmin forth and then Luis last so each person, you're going to have about 10 seconds to share your answer",,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher," And then, Oliver",,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher," So, Farrah, if you will go first",,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher, I'll tell you when when to start,,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,"After that, okay, so you'll share with the group Farrah",,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Farrah," We said that you know the Microsoft the microscope is his equipment and then we said that we also saw in paragraph four, they were talking about a spacecraft and we said that that was equipment to",,,130.2,response,1,1,2
117,Farrah,"Well, me and depth kind of set the same stuff",,,130.2,response,1,1,2
117,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher," Um, so",,,,remark,1,1,2
117,Teacher,Both pieces of equipment which one was used to discover the water or to find the water,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
117,Oliver, I just looked at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch,,,210.2,response,1,1,2
117,Oliver,"Hey, oh, are you know teacher",,,210.2,response,1,1,2
117,Teacher,"Hey, so you all have just shared your answer to the question",,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,So the question is asking us what equipment did scientists used to discover the water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, And it asked you to circle the evidence in the text,,,120.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher," So, Luis, what did you",,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,That we can use to answer this question,,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"What did you circle, Luis",,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
117,Luis,"Well I, I wanted",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
117,Luis, I'm sorry,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
117,Luis," I just wanted to say I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
117,Teacher, That you know all about space,,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"Oh, well that's really great",,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, Maybe you can add to our conversation,,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher," That's, that's awesome",,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
117,Luis,Okay,,,110.3,response,2,1,2
117,Luis," Okay, so what I I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,110.3,response,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"Okay, so let's",,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, Did you circle in the text,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher," Um, what, what did you what kind of evidence",,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Luis,"Oh, um, I didn't actually circle anything because I already know a bunch of stuff about",,,230.2,response,2,1,2
117,Luis,equipment that they use,,,,response,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"Okay, well, you know, this is this is asking specifically based on the reading",,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher," Let's see what they thought, and then maybe we can",,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,So let's um let's talk to our the rest of our classmates,,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,So you although it's really great that you have a lot of background knowledge we have to look at the the paragraph,,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, How's that sound,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"As a group, look back at paragraphs three and four",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
117,Luis,Okay,,,120.3,response,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"Okay, so",,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"You said that they sent a small machine, what, um, what piece of evidence",,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, Did you circle,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Jazmin,Circle that at the beginning of paragraph to,,,230.2,response,2,1,2
117,Teacher, Okay,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter landed on the moon South Pole to look for ice deposits and a large polar crater,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"The beginning of paragraph two, okay",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"All right, Chris, um, what was, what was your response",,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
117,Jazmin,Excuse me,,,120.1,response,2,1,2
117,Jazmin,I still don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,2,1,2
117,Teacher," You said they sent a small machine, but I think you might need to be a little bit more specific",,,430.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,It's just I think you need to maybe add a little bit to it,,,430.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, I like that you,,,430.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"Your answer is not wrong, Jazmin",,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"You know you've, you found the piece of equipment that they used, but we have to be a little bit more specific here",,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.2,response,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"So Chris, you said that they found craters full of water on the moon",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"But we, I think we didn't",,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,See at we didn't,,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,Know why they found Craters of what they use to discover define Craters of,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,Water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,And,,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, It looks like you guys kind of work together as a partner or as a group in partners,,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,Oliveron Farrah,,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,And you said that they use a microscope so,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
117,Oliver,"Yeah, I, I found it on my own but since you had asked Farrah",,,110.1,response,2,1,2
117,Oliver," First, I was just trying to say that I had the same answer, but I didn't like copy off for her talk to her to find it",,,110.1,response,2,1,2
117,Teacher," Yeah, okay",,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"Oh, okay",,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher," Yeah, you just you found it",,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, I want us to do is I think that I see that,,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, Yeah,,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher," Okay, so what I want",,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, I wasn't sure if you work together as a group where or not,,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, You found the same one as her,,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher," Sometimes I feel like it, it's helpful to put a question in our own words to understand what it's really asking so",,,420.1,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"We are close, but I think we might need to look at the question a little bit and maybe rephrase it",,,420.1,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,What I want you to do is I want you to circle the two action words in this question,,,420.1,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, The two main action words,,,420.1,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,Or verbs in this question,,,420.1,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, So I'll give you about,,,420.1,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,10 seconds,,,420.1,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, And I want you to take your pencil and just circle,,,420.1,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, The two action words in the question,,,420.1,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,And if you will just put your pencil down when you're finished,,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"Alright, so",,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,What,,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Chris,I circled us and discover and that made me think about that,,,,response,2,1,2
117,Chris, I went to NASA,,,,response,2,1,2
117,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks and suits,,,,response,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"Yeah, and it was similar to what Luis said",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,but what what kind of equipment do they use to discover water,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"That's I think that's the key part is, what did they use to discover the water or what did they use to find the water or maybe we could even say identify the water",,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, What did they use to find that,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,So when they were first going into space on the moon when they first got to the moon,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,but what did they use it first to discover it so,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"We see that they used after the fact, after they found the water they used a microscope to look closely at the water like Farrah said,",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, Let's look back individually,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"Let's look back, I'll give you guys about a minute or so individually",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, Those are the ones I think we need to look at again,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,At paragraphs three and four,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
117,Jazmin," So I still think it's in paragraph two,",,,210.4,response,2,1,2
117,Jazmin,I still think that the small machine,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
117,Jazmin," Is that what they used because you said discovery is like define and well, it says that they used it to investigate and like a detective kinds of discovers things, you know, and they investigate",,,210.4,response,2,1,2
117,Teacher, So this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole to look for ice deposits,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,"Okay, yeah",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher," Let's look, paragraph two, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, Okay,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,In a large polar crater,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher," It's in a small machine, but specifically the small machine was caled, what",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher, So you were right,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
117,Oliver,"Yeah, I was a lunar orbitre",,,210.4,response,2,1,2
117,Teacher, Yes,,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,Exactly right,,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher," Um, so",,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,And exactly,,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Teacher,Mark,,,,remark,2,1,2
117,Oliver,"Yeah, sorry to interrupt you, but it's time for us to go to lunch",,,,response,2,1,2
117,Oliver," I, I wanted to say thank you for helping us understand some of the",,,,response,2,1,2
117,Oliver,important words in the question,,,,response,2,1,2
117,Oliver,"And to try to see if I can help us find that in the text, and I like how you valued everybody like I felt like you understood at least that I we all kind of we're trying to find the answer and that felt good",,,,response,2,1,2
117,Teacher," And yes, what's your question, Luis?",,,,remark,0,1,2
117,Teacher,You all responded and with some answers that really talked about the scientist and you talked about NASA and you talked about tools that they might use,,,,remark,0,1,2
117,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,1,2
117,Luis," Um, so I know like all about space, like I know all this stuff about space, like, I don't really think I need any help",,,,response,0,1,2
117,Luis, So I'm not really sure,,,,response,0,1,2
117,Luis, So here's my question,,,,response,0,1,2
117,Luis," Like, why am I in this group",,,,response,0,1,2
117,,So in the texts in front of you called The Moon is a Desert,,,210.4,,0,1,2
117,Teacher,"Oh well, our discussion question today was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
117,Teacher, What equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,410.1,remark,0,1,2
117,Teacher,"You can answer that question by reading it and you've given some great answers,",,,120.1,remark,0,1,2
117,Teacher,but we didn't exactly answer the question about equipment,,,410.1,remark,0,1,2
117,Luis," Because like like that like seems like something they'd have to use, but maybe they don't",,,410.1,response,0,1,2
117,Luis,"Well, I guess, like I was wondering, like, do they use like oxygen tanks and do they use like that kind of stuff",,,410.1,response,0,1,2
117,Teacher,All right,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
117,Luis,I didn't really read very closely,,,110.1,response,0,1,2
117,Teacher,"Okay, well what paragraph",,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
117,Teacher, Do you think we can find that in,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
117,Teacher,Let's look back at the text,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
117,Luis,"Oh, um,",,,120.3,response,0,1,2
117,Luis, I should probably look at it,,,,response,0,1,2
117,Luis,"Yeah, I didn't really read too closely",,,,response,0,1,2
117,Teacher,"Okay, let's see",,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,Luis Do you have a question,,,,remark,1,1,2
118,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,1,2
118,Luis," Well, I guess it's more of like kind of a comment",,,,response,1,1,2
118,Luis, I already know,,,,response,1,1,2
118,Luis, Like all about space,,,,response,1,1,2
118,Luis, So I think I even need to be in this,,,,response,1,1,2
118,Teacher,"Well, I think there's always room",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher," To learn more, and sometimes we can learn from other people's responses and also maybe what I has to add to those responses",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher," So, Farrah,  can you read to me your answer about the question that was asked",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,So I would appreciate it if you would just kind of listen and maybe you will learn something new,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
118,Farrah,Yeah,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
118,Farrah," OK, so my answer was basically",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
118,Farrah,You need a scientific tool called a microscope to really close,,,,response,1,1,2
118,Teacher, What made you choose that word,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,Okay,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, And I like that you use that wording scientific tool,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,What made you choose the word microscope,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
118,Farrah,"Okay, so I looked at the key words in the question and I thought the key word for equipment and discuss and when I looked at the reading",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
118,Farrah," What I saw was that the microscope was something,",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
118,Farrah," So I was like, well, then you have to use the microscope, you know what I mean?",,,,response,1,1,2
118,Farrah,They said that the water was microscopic and you couldn't see it without a microscope,,,,response,1,1,2
118,Teacher,"Well, you are correct on that",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher," It talked abou the water that they found on the moon was microscopic like you had said, and that's that the word microscopic means that you can't see it Without looking through that microscope",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,In our story,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, Can you tell me how you would answer that question,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,I like that you use that word scientific tool,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher," Great, great job there,",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,Oliver,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, So in your words,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, I did see that you put you answered the same as Farrah,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
118,Oliver," So I would say, I guess it was sort of similar, but basically what I would say like in my own words",,,310.1,response,1,1,2
118,Oliver, Is that like,,,310.1,response,1,1,2
118,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,310.1,response,1,1,2
118,Oliver," How could you find it if you can't see it, you know?",,,,response,1,1,2
118,Oliver," So I was thinking that, like, how could you find the water or the, I guess the ice that's like the frozen water",,,,response,1,1,2
118,Oliver,You use the microscope to see the water and like kind of what she said that it's microscopic,,,,response,1,1,2
118,Teacher, And I really appreciate you explaining your answer,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,I do understand what you mean,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher," Like Farrah, or a neighbor",,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher," Jazmin, I see you have a question",,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, I want to hear what you found,,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,"So next time when we are asked a question instead of saying, I answered it",,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, Make sure you write an answer out instead of saying I found the same thing as my friend,,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Jazmin,"Well, I guess my question is that it still don't quite understand why my answer is wrong and I just was trying to figure it out",,,420.2,response,1,1,2
118,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,"So our question is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,And what was your response,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, What did you put,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
118,Jazmin,A small machine,,,120.2,response,1,1,2
118,Teacher," Well, I don't think that you're wrong",,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, Can you tell me why you put NASA send a small machine and nothing else,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,A small machine,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,I think that we can add some more to your answer to make it a little bit stronger,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
118,Jazmin, I saw that,,,110.2,response,1,1,2
118,Jazmin," Okay, so when I was reading",,,110.2,response,1,1,2
118,Jazmin,"So yeah, so well",,,110.2,response,1,1,2
118,Jazmin,"Oh, okay",,,,response,1,1,2
118,Jazmin," So yeah, I just looked at it again",,,,response,1,1,2
118,Jazmin, So are you seeing like I should say what the machine is?,,,,response,1,1,2
118,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher," We can provide with our answer, the better or the stronger answer can be",,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, We can answer,,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,"Well, it's always good to add detail to our answers",,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, And so the more detail,,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher," I mean, the more detail",,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,"Okay, Chris",,,,remark,1,1,2
118,Chris, We saw that scientists use masks and suits and oxygen tanks,,,,response,1,1,2
118,Chris," I was wondering, I'm like, it's not in the reading, like did they use those to find the water",,,,response,1,1,2
118,Chris,I went to NASA with my dad and when we were there,,,,response,1,1,2
118,Teacher,"Well, let's remember that the title of our story ways water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, And if they didn't wear those they could die,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher," So yes, astronauts do wear those as a protective measure",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher," So when they're on the moon, they can survive because it's a really cool place",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,When you went to NASA you seen their outfits and those things,,,410.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,410.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher," So they were in our story wearing those outfits, but they just didn't talk about that they really focused on water on the moon because that was the title of our story",,,410.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Chris,"Yeah, that does so like I need to use the evidence not like background knowledge",,,410.2,response,1,1,2
118,Teacher,"Right, you need so because our, our question and what was what equipment it scientists use to discover water so they're asking the question is asking what scientists use",,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,"So specifically, what do they use not their suits",,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, But what they use to find the water,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, Does that make a little bit more sense,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
118,Chris,Yeah okay that actually,,,210.2,response,1,1,2
118,Chris, That makes sense,,,210.2,response,1,1,2
118,Chris, Okay,,,210.2,response,1,1,2
118,Chris, So like it's,,,210.2,response,1,1,2
118,Chris, Yes,,,210.2,response,1,1,2
118,Chris, That makes a lot more sense,,,210.2,response,1,1,2
118,Teacher,"Okay, perfect",,,,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, Do you have a question,,,,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher, Oliver,,,,remark,1,1,2
118,Oliver,"Um, unfortunately, we have to go to the next class, which were bummed about because we're having a lot of fun working with you",,,,response,1,1,2
118,Oliver," But, um, thank you so much for working with us",,,,response,1,1,2
118,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,1,1,2
118,Teacher,Luis Do you have a question,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
118,Luis, I think I got this all figured out,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
118,Luis," Well, it's kind of more of like a thought, I guess",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
118,Luis, So I think I'm all good,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
118,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
118,Teacher,"Okay, so we're gonna kind of review what the question was",,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, And your responses,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher,So the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher,"And because Luis just responded with, he thinks he knows just about everything about this",,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher," And so, Hey Luis I did want to tell you that I really enjoyed reading your answer because you talked about the way water is split and you said to split into two parts, hydrogen, oxygen, that is correct",,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, To discuss how there is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,430.2,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher," Can you think about that, and I'll come back to you",,,430.2,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, So can you come up with a new way,,,430.2,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher,"However, if we were talking just about our reading passage",,,430.2,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, Those are not necessarily in there,,,430.2,remark,2,1,2
118,Luis,"Yeah, absolutely",,,430.2,response,2,1,2
118,Teacher," All right, Jazmin",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher,"Okay, perfect",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, I really enjoyed reading your response,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, How did you find that answer,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher,"And you talked about astronauts can use the water to stay hydrated and I did like how you said you cannot survive without water, um, where did you come up with that answer",,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
118,Jazmin," And let's see it's in the second reading, the water is a valuable resource",,,230.2,response,2,1,2
118,Jazmin,"Okay, so basically, okay",,,230.2,response,2,1,2
118,Jazmin, The astronauts could drink this water,,,,response,2,1,2
118,Jazmin,"And I said, in paragraph four, It could be useful in lots of ways",,,,response,2,1,2
118,Teacher,Great job,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, Is it just astronauts that need to survive with water or do we all need to survive with water,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, Right,,,,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher,We all do,,,,remark,2,1,2
118,Jazmin, All living things need water,,,,response,2,1,2
118,Jazmin,Yeah,,,,response,2,1,2
118,Teacher,That is correct,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, They don't have to carry it in ships anymore,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher," All right, Chris Chris you your response says water is heavy",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, So it's good,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher,So that is true,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher," It does talk about water being heavy, how come you responded with that",,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Chris,So I was thinking when I was looking at it that well,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
118,Chris, Okay,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
118,Chris, So I was thinking the waters heavy and you have to take it on the spaceship,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
118,Chris,"But maybe you could could get the water on the moon, you wouldn't have to take as much water with you, although I have to say, I'm still a little confused about kind of like you and I mean like how it didn't quite answer the question",,,,response,2,1,2
118,Teacher,"Okay, well let's um let's remember kind of what we read",,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher," So really we wouldn't have to bring water from earth it would be discovered on the moon, and they would be using that water from the moon",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher,"The whole reading, she is talking about water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, Does that make a little bit more sense,,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, So their ships wouldn't have to carry it,,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher," Yes, but in your response to you talked about the ships carrying it",,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher," So really, it wouldn't be coming off of the moon",,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher,So is it heavy,,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
118,Chris,"Yeah, I think it does",,,410.2,response,2,1,2
118,Chris," Yes, thank you",,,410.2,response,2,1,2
118,Teacher,Sure and Luis I saw that your hand was up,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, Do you have a question,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
118,Luis,"Um, I forgot",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
118,Teacher,"Okay, all right, Oliver",,,,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher,You kind of both have very similar responses,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, It's not ready yet,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher," So Luis Oh no, sorry, Oliver, you talk, you said no",,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher,So we need to figure out yours and Farrah's,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, So what do you mean by that,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Oliver," So I when I mean it's not ready yet, like the water that's on the moon isn't really ready for us to do yet",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
118,Oliver," So, um, it's kind of like, it seems like it would be really hard like so they asked if there was convincing evidence",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
118,Oliver,"Um, so I guess it's kind of, it's kind of interesting",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
118,Oliver, And even though I read that we're going to try to have a moon base on the moon by like 2024 or around then,,,,response,2,1,2
118,Oliver,And I thought it wasn't as convincing because it seemed like it would take a long time to work,,,,response,2,1,2
118,Oliver," And so I was thinking that, like, even though it might be valuable like Maybe I don't think it would be for a long time",,,,response,2,1,2
118,Oliver,"I kind of don't think that's gonna happen because they always say that you're going to like put stuff in space, or we're going to go to Mars, but then it never happened",,,,response,2,1,2
118,Teacher,"Well, I do like that you shared your opinion in your answer",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, And sometimes it's hard for us as students and even sometimes as teachers because we're not scientist to understand how long it takes for them to figure out how to get things right,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, And so that I can understand a little bit more because I do,,,520.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher,I agree with you,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher," Like right now, it's not ready and I do like that you shared your opinion, good job there",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher,"And so I do like that you shared your opinion and next time when you share your opinion, just put it just how you told us",,,520.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher," I think that you are correct, that sometimes it's not going to be ready",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher,"Alright, Farrah",,,,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher,"You had responded similar and you had said no, not for a long time",,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, Do you care to kind of explain your answer a little bit more?,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Teacher, So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable and you responded with no not for a long time,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
118,Farrah,"Yeah, absolutely",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
118,Farrah," So I, I wish I could unfortunately because you have to go",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
118,Farrah," I really wanted to thank you for working with us and I, in particular, there were so many cool things that",,,,response,2,1,2
118,Farrah,But before we go over,,,,response,2,1,2
118,Farrah,You were doing with us,,,,response,2,1,2
118,Farrah,"We were working together, like, first off, you have to make sure that we were using evidence from the text, whenever we gave an answer which was really cool",,,,response,2,1,2
118,Farrah,"And you asked us, like all the time",,,,response,2,1,2
118,Farrah," You asked, like all of us like what what our thinking was, like, to the answers we have and I like everybody had really",,,,response,2,1,2
118,Farrah,thought processes that they were able to share and you let us have time to explain,,,,response,2,1,2
118,Farrah, Like what her ideas for and that really,,,,response,2,1,2
118,Farrah," And like I think meant something to everybody, right, guys",,,,response,2,1,2
118,Farrah,"made us feel valued and you, you said that really thoughtful things to us that I think we're really true",,,,response,2,1,2
118,Farrah,"Yeah, I think that like it was really cool, working with you because I think we learned a lot about how to respond like more effectively questions like this",,,,response,2,1,2
118,Farrah, Thank you,,,,response,2,1,2
118,Farrah, So thank you so much,,,,response,2,1,2
118,Teacher,Good morning,,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Farrah,"Hi, how are you",,,,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"I'm good, how are you",,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Oliver, Thank you,,,,response,0,1,2
118,Oliver,We're doing well,,,,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"Alright, so we're going to go over a few things",,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher," Do you have a question, Luis?",,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, We read the water on the moon,,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Luis,"Um, yeah, I guess it's kind of a question like, um, so I know all about space, like all this stuff and I don't really think I should be in this group, because I don't think I need any help",,,,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"Well, sometimes we feel that way, but you're, you might have some knowledge that wasn't really covered inside of the texts that maybe your other friends in the group can learn from",,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,So work on all learn from each other and kind of discuss what we've read and if you have questions at the end [teacher name] will gladly to answer those,,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, Okay?,,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Luis,"Okay, that sounds good",,,220.1,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher,Awesome,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, So we're going to go over our reading passage that you all did water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, How come you do that,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"So Oliver, I see that you had circled the same answer as Farrah",,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, And so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Oliver,"Well, we came to the same answer, basically",,,120.2,response,0,1,2
118,Oliver,Because she she was right,,,,response,0,1,2
118,Oliver, I think I circled the same answer,,,,response,0,1,2
118,Oliver," So like you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, I agree with Farrah",,,,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher,So did you find that on your own prior to Farrah writing that or did you kind of just copy that?,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Oliver," Um, but I found it on my own",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
118,Oliver,"Oh, that's a, that's a fair question",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
118,Oliver,"We are, we're kind of both looking separately",,,,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher, It's probably best to put your own words down inside or instead of just saying that you circled the same answer,,,430.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher," A Farrah, because maybe Farrah wasn't pulled into the same group and [teacher name] wouldn't essentially know what you're, what Farrah had wrote",,,430.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher," Just right exactly what your answer is, whether it's the same as someone else's",,,430.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, So next time,,,430.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, OK?,,,430.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"Okay, so next time",,,430.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Oliver,"OK, I can do that",,,430.2,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"Okay, um,",,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"A lot of you have really great responses, but the reason why we're kind of in this small group is to kind of build off those responses",,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher," So although it asks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, there's a little bit more that we could probably add to our answers to help you better",,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, Does that make sense?,,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Farrah,"Yeah, I have a question",,,220.1,response,0,1,2
118,Farrah," Like, I was wondering why my answer might be incorrect",,,220.1,response,0,1,2
118,Farrah," Um, I was wondering if um like, so my answer",,,220.1,response,0,1,2
118,Farrah," Like, if we're all in the group to work together on getting the more correct answer",,,220.1,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"Which one is talking, can you raise your hand?",,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Farrah,"Oh yeah, this is Farrah",,,,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher, There we go,,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher," I'm sorry, Farrah",,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher," I'm sorry, I can't see your hand",,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"Oh, I can't see",,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, I see you now,,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Farrah,No problem,,,,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"but um let's pretend that we took away the reading passage and maybe we had read it the day before, and maybe [teacher name] was out that day",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"And so it's not that your answer is incorrect,",,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, Do you think that we could have wrote our question differ answer differently to include the question,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, And so maybe the substitute didn't have that,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Farrah, I think I know what you mean,,,110.2,response,0,1,2
118,Farrah,"Yeah, definitely",,,110.2,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher, Correct?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher," I'm not saying that your answer is incorrect, but maybe you could have put on because you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,Do you know how you could have,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Farrah,Yeah,,,,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher,But what are we looking closely for?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Farrah,We're looking for water,,,230.2,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"Okay, and in our texts did it talk about using a microscope that those astronauts or rather those scientists use?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
118,Farrah,"In paragraph three, it says, um, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher," So what you could also include is that scientists use a tool called a microscope to discover water on the moon,",,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,Right,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"Not that your answer is incorrect because I see in the third paragraph that it states exactly what you said, but maybe adding exactly what they're looking for can also help your other friends",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, Maybe if you working in partners of two,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Farrah,"Yeah, thank you",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Jazmin,"So basically, I was just gonna ask the question, like, so when I looked at it, I thought, okay, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,,response,0,1,2
118,Jazmin,And I guess I guess I should have said Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,0,1,2
118,Jazmin,"And I guess I'm wondering, like, is it the microscope or is it the lunar orbiter that found the stuff?",,,,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"Well, so in in here, it talks about the water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, Do we all remember reading that part?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"So we know that that the planet or essentially what is being discovered is one, the water, but the water on the moon specifically, right? So, in the first paragraph that talks about scientists that found evidence that there can be water deep within the moon's polar craters",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, Do you not remember reading that part,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,Chris,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Chris," I do remember, um, I thought that there was like a bunch of water in the craters",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
118,Chris," Um, but I did have a quick question",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
118,Chris,"No, I do",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"Okay, can I answer Jazmin's question and then I'll answer yours next, is that okay?",,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Chris,"Yeah, yeah, of course",,,,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher," So then in the second paragraph, it talks about NASA using this small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"Okay, perfect",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
118,Jazmin,"Yeah, I think so",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, So what they're doing is that they're using the Orbiter to investigate the evidence that they found deep within those craters,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,Okay,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher," And then what they did was, in the third paragraph, they talked about the microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,And so the water that they found is microscopic,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, Do we know what the word microscopic means?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher," Jazmin, do you know what microscopic mean? No?",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,Everybody,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
118,Jazmin,"Well, I think it means something really small",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher,Yes,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher," And so you have to look at it under that microscope, and that's where what Farrah was talking about",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,And it also says in the last sentence is that they looked at a scientific tool called a microscope really closely,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, So all of those tools that they've used helped discover that,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, Then I'll get to you next,,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, OK?,,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher," All right, Oliver, I see you, but I'm going to get to Chris's question",,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher,Does that make sense or look at that evidence,,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Chris, I should probably let have I should probably let Oliver have this turn,,,,response,0,1,2
118,Chris,OK,,,,response,0,1,2
118,Oliver,"And yeah, we just because, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,,response,0,1,2
118,Oliver, Before we had to leave,,,,response,0,1,2
118,Oliver,I just wanted to thank you,,,,response,0,1,2
118,Oliver," Sometimes our science teacher, he says that we give him stress hives and you are so",,,,response,0,1,2
118,Oliver,"Thoughtful and friendly in the way that you're asking us, our questions and",,,,response,0,1,2
118,Oliver,I think that I can speak for everybody and say that like I don't think anybody felt like,,,,response,0,1,2
118,Oliver, So I just wanted to thank you for really like paying attention to us and being so kind in in thoughtful,,,,response,0,1,2
118,Oliver,"um felt bad, like if they had the wrong answer, which is really important",,,,response,0,1,2
118,Oliver, Like sometimes we all feel really bad if we if we don't have the right answer,,,,response,0,1,2
118,Teacher,"Well, thank you",,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, And just remember just because you're in a small group doesn't mean that you're not smarter than the rest of the class,,,,remark,0,1,2
118,Teacher, Sometimes you just need additional help or you guys have really good ideas that you can learn from each other,,,,remark,0,1,2
119,Teacher, I hope everybody's doing well today,,,,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,"Good afternoon, everyone",,,,remark,0,0,3
119,Farrah,"Yes, we are",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Teacher, So what we're going to do today is look at the article that you all previous you read called water on the moon,,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,Well good,,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher, And we're going to look at the discussion question in regards to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher, If you just raise your hand,,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher, I'll call on you,,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher," So, if you will, just kind of raise your hand and I'll call on you",,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher, And then we can look at your response and kind of figure out where you came up with that response and see if we're saying is correct or if it could use a little work,,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,So what we can do is just kind of go around the room,,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,"Alright, Luis, what did you put buddy?",,,,remark,0,0,3
119,Luis," And um like, I don't really know",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Luis,"Um, so I was talking about like using like oxygen tanks and like, stuff like that",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Luis," Like if I should be in this group, because I know all about space",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Luis, So I kind of feel like I know a lot of stuff about this,,,,response,0,0,3
119,Teacher, So the scientists would have to use an oxygen tank to breathe up in space,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,"Okay, yeah, you're right",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,But if we're looking specifically at a question it's asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,"So they didn't technically need to use their oxygen, oxygen tank to discover the water",,,130.3,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,"So that, if you go back into the text and plot the evidence, that's more while we're looking for",,,420.3,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,"But like you said, scientists do have to use oxygen up in space, so they can survive",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,"If you look back in your text, it says specifically that they sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
119,Luis,I guess I didn't really like read it as closely as I could have,,,420.3,response,0,0,3
119,Teacher," And your response to just didn't specifically, answer the question",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,"Yeah, maybe just pay a little bit more attention to the exact question, but you were correct",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,Does anybody else?,,,,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,"Alright, Chris",,,,remark,0,0,3
119,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Chris," So I kind of was, um, so my answer was, um, you would find, that the scientists found like craters full of water on the moon",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Teacher,They did find craters of water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher, And that's kind of why they went up to space,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher, They wanted to see if there were water in these craters,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher," They did discover that, in fact, there are water in the craters",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher, Want to know what did they use to find that water,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,"But like I said, we're if we're looking at the specific question is",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,And if we look in number two in the article the machine that they use what's called the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,So rather than saying they found the water when you do go back into the text and see what machinery they use to find that water,,,430.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,"But like you said they did find water, but we need to look specifically other question on how they found that water and it was with the machine called the Lunar Orbiter",,,130.3,remark,0,0,3
119,Chris,Okay,,,130.3,response,0,0,3
119,Chris, Okay,,,,response,0,0,3
119,Chris,Gotcha,,,,response,0,0,3
119,Teacher,Farrah?,,,,remark,0,0,3
119,Farrah,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Farrah," So basically, um, I was just wanted, I was just gonna ask like, so my answer was, um, you know, you need a scientific tool called a microscope, which was in the in the reading",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Farrah," But, I'm, I'm not quite sure what my answer, it isn't right",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Teacher,Your answer is correct,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher," But if you look at number three, it says to look closer to actually see it, you would have to use a microscope",,,210.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,What they used in space to find the water was a lunar orbiter,,,210.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher, So your answer actually would be correct,,,210.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher," But what they, the machinery, they use what's called the Lunar Orbiter, but you'd also need a microscope, like you said, to be able to view the water molecules deep in the craters",,,210.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,You would need a microscope,,,210.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,Jazmin?,,,,remark,0,0,3
119,Jazmin,"So my question is, then, so I said that, NASA sent a small machine and did I just like, why was my answer, not quite right?",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Teacher,"Uh, your answer is technically correct",,,410.2,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher, The only thing I would change about your answer is if we look back into the text and find more specific evidence that machine that you're referring to what's called a lunar orbiter,,,410.2,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher, So you're not very far off just a little bit more specific,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher," What you put was was correct, but your teacher may want you to be a little more specific",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher," So you could just name the actual machine, and it was called the Lunar Orbiter",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,So that's the only thing I would add to yours,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,Chris?,,,,remark,0,0,3
119,Chris," And I was kind of thinking about Luis's answer and like so, my dad and I, we went to NASA",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Chris," So I was just, I was just thinking about like what you need in space",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Chris,"So I know that like if they're astronauts up there, they have to use equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and spacesuits and all that kind of stuff",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Chris," So, um, I was just curious like did they, did they not have astronauts?",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Teacher,They did,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher," And those astronauts didn't have to oxygen, oxygen tanks like Luis said",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,"But the, the question specifically wants to know what equipment they had to use to find the water in the craters and so they didn't necessarily have to use the oxygen tank on their back for find the water, they have to use oxygen tank so they can continue breathing and live",,,210.1,remark,0,0,3
119,Chris,"Oh,",,,210.1,response,0,0,3
119,Chris,Okay,,,,response,0,0,3
119,Chris," So like you you to maybe they had to use like the equipment, but it's not what they used to like find the water",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Chris,"Yeah, that makes sense",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Teacher,"Correct they did have to use the equipment so Luis and you are both correct that they did have oxygen tanks, but that's not specifically what they hadn't used to find the water and the craters",,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,Jazmin?,,,,remark,0,0,3
119,Jazmin,"Actually, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we went to lunch",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Jazmin, I just wanted to thank you for working with us and,,,,response,0,0,3
119,Jazmin,"I also wanted to say like to thank you for being so clear, like with your response to our answers like sometimes we can frustrate our teachers, a little bit",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Jazmin,"Because we're still working out, you know, like the answers as we go",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Jazmin," So just wanted to thank you for that, because not everybody does that",,,,response,0,0,3
119,Jazmin, But you were very patient and you also were very clear and helping us understand like what we were trying to say,,,,response,0,0,3
119,Teacher, I thought everybody did a really good job,,,,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,Thank very much,,,,remark,0,0,3
119,Teacher,Hello everyone,,,,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, How are y'all doing today,,,,remark,1,0,3
119,,We're excited to work with you,,,,,1,0,3
119,Teacher,Good Luis You got a question money,,,,remark,1,0,3
119,Luis,"Um, yeah, I just wanted to say that like",,,,response,1,0,3
119,Luis,I don't think I should be in this group because I already know all about space,,,,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher," But in this room, we're just gonna learn a little bit more",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, Okay,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"Well, I'm glad you you have a basic understanding of it",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, And you can broaden your knowledge on everything that involves space,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Luis,"Okay, yeah, I can do that",,,150.1,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher, I hope y'all thought it was pretty interesting,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,All right,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher," Well, first off, I want to say thank you for for y'all guys reading water on the moon",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, I noticed we kind of had a,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"Uh, I looked at your responses to the first question of what equipment designs is used as discover water on the moon",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"But today, what I hope to do is kind of come together, work on some strategies that we can kind of hone in on the answer that, that is specifically wanting",,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,Very in range of responses,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, Okay,,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, Some of y'all kind of understood the question some of y'all are a little off,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"All right, so what I think we should do, after looking at those answers is kind of look at the question itself and kind of determine some keywords that are in that question",,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,That we can pull out a highlight that we can use to look for the evidence back in the text,,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, So if y'all looked at that question,,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, The first question I answered a,,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher," Where do you think, what do you think are the, the key words in that question",,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,And anybody can tell me,,,,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, What do you think,,,,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,1,0,3
119,Farrah,"Um, I think the key words are and discover",,,,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"Good, because we are wanting to know what specific equipment, the scientists used to discover all right there",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, What do you think buddy,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Oliver," I said, equipment and discover as well",,,210.2,response,1,0,3
119,Oliver,"Um, yeah, actually, I agree with Farrah",,,210.2,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"Okay, Jazmin",,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher," Also, do you have something else to say",,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, Do you agree,,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Jazmin,"Yes, I see",,,130.2,response,1,0,3
119,Jazmin,Discover a different answer than them and,,,,response,1,0,3
119,Jazmin,I'm confused why my answer is wrong,,,,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher, Like I said all of y'all did a decent job,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, Hang on one second,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher," Let me ask Chris, what do you, what do you ever say, buddy",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"Well, looking at your answers",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Chris,"Um, well, I was just gonna say like I i only underlined",,,110.1,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher, In this question the equipment is to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,Okay well equipment is the key word,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher," Okay, does that make sense",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher," But we got to figure out what's, what is the whole point of the equipment",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, Okay,,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"Yeah, okay",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, So looking at your responses,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher," I will say this, Jazmin",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, You were probably the closest and getting the correct answer with your response,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,I'm not going to say your response was wrong by any means,,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher," Now,",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"Uh, so, for example, a Farrah, you put that you need a scientific tool called a microscope",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,That is,,,,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"A piece of equipment, but in the text, it didn't really mention that the microscope helped discover water on the moon",,,410.3,remark,1,0,3
119,Farrah," Okay, so in a text",,,410.3,response,1,0,3
119,Farrah," They said that they couldn't see the are acceptable microscope, because it was so small, but, um, I thought, like how could they find it if they couldn't see it",,,410.3,response,1,0,3
119,Farrah,"Oh well, I guess, like what I thought about the you know about the microscope",,,410.3,response,1,0,3
119,Farrah, Is that like they couldn't,,,410.3,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher," They do have to use the microscope to see it because it is so small, but to find the water itself",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, So they can actually view it,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,Okay,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, And that makes sense,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher," They didn't necessarily use the microscope, when they found the water, then the microscope came into play",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
119,Farrah,"Oh, so they like something like studied the water",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher,The water,,,,remark,1,0,3
119,Farrah,And another,,,,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher, And then I noticed that you put the same answer as Farrah,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, So does that make sense to you,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,Yeah,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher," Also, buddy",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Oliver, So like they use something else to find the water and then they studied the water using the microscope,,,150.1,response,1,0,3
119,Oliver,"Um, yeah, that makes sense",,,150.1,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher,Correct,,,110.4,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"Chris, you put sounds is filming craters full of water on the moon",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher," Okay, they did find craters with water",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,But do you see how and the question is wanting to know what equipment they used to discover that water so,,,410.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher," You did put that they found water which is correct, but you need to describe what equipment they specifically used to find that water",,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"In that sense, your answer doesn't fully answer the question",,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Chris," Like, I guess my question is, I went to NASA with my dad and I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that",,,430.2,response,1,0,3
119,Chris,"Yeah, I think, I think it does",,,430.2,response,1,0,3
119,Chris,"And I guess like if I know that, like, even if it's not in the meeting like is that the answer to",,,,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher, And it will help you,,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,Not necessarily,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,I'm glad you do know stuff about oxygen tanks and things like that,,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, And that wouldn't necessarily be like oxygen tanks and things like that,,,410.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, It's want to know what specifically they used to find that water,,,410.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,A little bit,,,410.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, But for this specific question,,,410.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"However, having that knowledge does help you with this overall topic, but it's not specific to that question, if that makes sense",,,410.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Chris,"Yeah, I think, I think that makes sense",,,410.1,response,1,0,3
119,Chris," Like, so I'm supposed to like pull from the reading answer the question",,,410.1,response,1,0,3
119,Chris,Not from like,,,,response,1,0,3
119,Chris,What I what I knew before,,,,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"Yeah, we want that specific evidence from the reading that we want to pull that straight out that shows we found the answer to that question",,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, Okay,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Chris,Gotcha,,,420.2,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"All right, now Jazmin, you put NASA send a small machine and you're almost 100% right",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, Did you happen to go back and see what the name of that equipment they used was was the name of that small machine small machine,,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,but if we look back in that text we wanted to get a little more specific,,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
119,Jazmin,But I can do that,,,130.1,response,1,0,3
119,Jazmin,She,,,,response,1,0,3
119,Jazmin, The lunar orbiter was with the,,,,response,1,0,3
119,Jazmin,was caught the lunar orbit,,,,response,1,0,3
119,Jazmin, So is that was it,,,,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher," Now, does everyone see where she found that out because that is the specific name of the equipment they use to find the water",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,Correct,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, So does that make sense where we got that from,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher," And like you said everybody told me that were the key word was the equipment to discover and then up in the text it specifically says NASA send a small machine called a lunar Order, order to investigate",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,Okay,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
119,Chris,"Yeah, I think, that doesn't make sense",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
119,Chris," So okay, so that's the answer",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
119,Chris," That's the equipment that you to find the what, like to discuss",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher," Now there's other equipment that's talked about in this text, but specifically to find the water they use the Lunar Orbiter",,,130.3,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"Yet specifically to find the water they use the equipment, called the Lunar Orbiter",,,130.3,remark,1,0,3
119,Jazmin,So we have to go to our next class that is so much for working with us,,,130.3,response,1,0,3
119,Teacher, You have a good day,,,,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher, You're welcome,,,,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,1,0,3
119,Teacher,"Hey guys, I'm back",,,,remark,2,0,3
119,All,Hi,,,,,2,0,3
119,Teacher,"Luis You got a question, buddy",,,,remark,2,0,3
119,Luis, So I think I'm all good,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Luis,"Um, yeah, I guess it's more of a statement",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Luis," Now, like, thanks to the first thing that we covered",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Luis, So I think I got this all figured out,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Teacher, So we can find the evidence from the text way say sound good,,,220.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, But I think with we go through this second question will be able to make sure that we understand how to kind of really dive deeper into a question,,,220.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,"Well, I hope you're right",,,220.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Luis,"Yeah, I can stick around for that",,,220.1,response,2,0,3
119,Teacher,"All right, I appreciate it",,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher," Alright, so the second question, we're going to look at is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, What do you think are some key words in there that we need to pull out before even worry about answering this question,,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,Okay,,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher," So within that question, just like we talked about in our first session",,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, What do you think buddy,,,,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,There,,,,remark,2,0,3
119,Oliver,"Um, okay",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver, So when I look at it I think that convincing,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver,Evidence and valuable,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Teacher,I agree with you,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, What do you think buddy,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, Those are all very important words Chris,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
119,Chris,"Um, okay",,,210.2,response,2,0,3
119,Chris," So for me, I thought, well, I thought, water and value",,,210.2,response,2,0,3
119,Teacher,"Okay well valuables and very important word, but we also need that convincing evidence on why water is valuable",,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, Okay,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher," OK, so the convincing evidence is also very important",,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, Does anybody have anything else say thanks important or is everybody else agree that convincing evidence and valuable role very important words,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,All right,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,Luis what do you think buddy,,,,remark,2,0,3
119,Luis,"Um, yeah, I think for me when I was looking at it like I kind of thought that, um,",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Luis, So I kind of think water might be important,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Luis,"Well, I guess I wasn't totally sure I thought maybe because I thought like what you could do with the water",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Luis, I guess I'm not sure,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Teacher,"Well, water is very important because we're wanting to find out, you know,",,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, So we need to really find the evidence in the text on why that water is valuable,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher," So water is an important word, but we want to find the evidence on why it's valuable if that makes sense",,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,How can water be valuable,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, Okay,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
119,Luis,Yeah,,,210.2,response,2,0,3
119,Teacher," Okay, so",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, And then we can kind of talk it through,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,I think that makes sense,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher," Alright, so I just want to kind of look at some of your responses",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,"Farrah and Oliver, both of y'all kind of said no it's not ready",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,"Okay, now if you go back into the into the text",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,There's no real evidence on why it's valuable this time,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher," Do you see anywhere in there that talks about, you know, how it could be valuable",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Farrah,"Yeah, I mean,",,,230.3,response,2,0,3
119,Farrah,Just,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Farrah, We have a question,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Jazmin,"Oh yeah, well, I guess",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Jazmin,I'm sorry to jump in,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Jazmin, So I guess we can wait like,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Jazmin," I just was still kind of confused about like, actually, we haven't really got to my ticket",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Teacher," Yeah, we'll go around the room and when I get to you",,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, Okay,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, I'll let you ask your specific question,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,"Okay, that's fine",,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,Alright so this event and Divya What do y'all think is all kind of had the same answer,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,So if you go back into the text,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,You see anywhere that specifically talks about how water couldn't be valuable,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Farrah, And the very first sentence right there,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
119,Farrah,"Yeah, there's, um, let's see",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
119,Farrah, Yeah,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver,"Yeah, like, and the very first sentence of the fourth paragraph",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver, It says water on the moon would be a valuable are very important resource,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver,"I guess I think like we probably did the same thing, like when we were talking about it",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver," Yeah, because I don't like",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver,"I think what we were thinking was that, well, at least for me, like, I don't think that the water would be valuable",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver,I don't think that we can use it yet,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver, And so when they asked like is our convincing evidence like it,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver, It sort of made me think like,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver,It's not very convincing because we don't really know like how to use the technology,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver," Exactly, to wit, so I kind of thought like, you know what I mean, like, maybe it wasn't valuable yet",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Teacher,"No, no, I understand what you're saying, but at the same time, if you're able to find water on the moon",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,"Moving forward, this could be very valuable",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher," It could, you know, for example, what you like the text says you can drink the water, they could use the water",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,because if you go on the read further,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, The implications of finding that water moving forward could be very beneficial to our astronauts and the spacecraft and everything of that matter,,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,Eventually for like fuel for this spaceship,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,So even though we're not using the water right now,,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
119,Oliver,"Yeah, I guess that's true because I read that like there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and like they would definitely need water",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver, If I did that,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
119,Teacher, So,,,110.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,I agree,,,110.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher," So moving forward, yeah that's that's very important",,,110.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, So it's good,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,And I'll see yourChris and you put water is heavy,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, They don't have to curate in the ships anymore,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, So I guess with your answer,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, They found water,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher," That way they don't have to bring it back and forth, which it talks about in the text, so",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,You're kind of saying that it's important,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, So by you saying they don't have to carry water,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,Let me just kind of build off that,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher, What does that essentially mean they can you do with the water that's already there,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Chris,"Well, they can pick it up on the moon and use that water than to fly around or like they don't have to take it from Earth",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
119,Chris,"So,",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Chris,I guess it would be by,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Teacher, I know what I mean,,,110.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,"Good, good, good",,,110.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher," You know, because they can use it for fuel and they can also drink it",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,"Yeah, so they don't have to carry it",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,"So that's less stuff they have to care or, you know, to bring with them on the spaceship, so they can have room for more people, more supplies and things like that",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher," So that's a very good response they have you got a question, buddy",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
119,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver, But before we go to lunch,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver, I really wanted to thank you for working with us,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver," Well, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver,"And like there was a couple things in particular that were really cool, like for example you really helped us to understand, like, what the question was asking for each of the questions",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver,"And you really make sure that we use, but that's like from the text when we were talking about our answers",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver,And like even more like you made us feel really valued and you explain like what we needed to work on,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver,"Like, you know what I mean, so that we could get a better or more complete answer and you gave us ideas for like",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver,"You know what I mean, what your concerns were and then like helped us to kind of find our way to to understanding it",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver," So like, thank you so much, because I think like everybody in the class like feels like you know what I mean, like we all understand it really well at this",,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver,Which was really cool and like that's not always the case,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Oliver, So thank you so much,,,,response,2,0,3
119,Teacher," I'm glad I could help, y'all",,,,remark,2,0,3
119,Teacher,We're good,,,,remark,2,0,3
120,Teacher, How are you,,,,remark,1,0,2

120,Teacher," Luis, what can I do for you",,,,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,Good,,,,remark,1,0,2
120,Luis, So I was just gonna say like I already know all about space,,,,response,1,0,2
120,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,0,2
120,Luis, So I don't think I need to be in this group,,,,response,1,0,2
120,Teacher,"Well, maybe you can help some of us understand things better by being in this group then",,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher," Yeah, we're not just looking at space we're looking at how well we read this text, and we're just working as a group to kind of share our knowledge with each other",,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, Okay,,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,Because we're not just,,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Luis,I can stick around,,,220.1,response,1,0,2
120,Teacher," So you guys have all shared your responses with us and that's been really, really good",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, I really liked that you guys tried to pull your evidence from the text,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, Okay,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,Awesome,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher," So does anybody want to volunteer to go first, where we can kind of critique and go through our answers and look and see how we can find maybe some more detail to support our answer",,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,I saw bits and pieces of that in there,,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher," For me, okay",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher," Oh, and Chris awesome Farrah, you go first",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,"Farrah, you want to go first",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Farrah, So my answer was basically that you need a scientific microscope to look really close and,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
120,Farrah,Okay,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
120,Farrah," So, all right",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
120,Farrah,"I was looking in paragraph three, that's where I got my evidence because they talk about a microscope here",,,,response,1,0,2
120,Teacher, Sorry,,,,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, It went out,,,,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,In Paris which paragraph,,,,remark,1,0,2
120,Farrah,It's three three,,,,response,1,0,2
120,Teacher, Okay,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, So if you look at our original question,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, Let's go back and Decode that question,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,Perfect,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher," But if you look at it, it says what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, So our key word here is equipment,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,So hopefully you'll remember us talking about that,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,So our key word here is equipment and discover,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,"Alright, so let's go look",,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher," Let's say at your paragraph three, where does it talk about discovery in there",,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah go ahead and say it",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Farrah,"Okay, so actually I guess it was really about looking like discover",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
120,Farrah,It doesn't really say that it just says you need it to look really close,,,,response,1,0,2
120,Teacher," Okay, good",,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,Right,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,"So Def, do you have something to add to this? You had your hand raised",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, So maybe the microscope isn't what we used to discover it,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Oliver, I don't quite understand,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
120,Oliver,"No, I was gonna say the same thing as Farrah, but I'm still kind of wondering why our answer is wrong like why the two of us is our answer is wrong",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
120,Teacher,Okay well so Farrah just had a really good point,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, Farrah,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, Can you repeat that for Oliver for me,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Farrah, Like it doesn't say discovery to we're supposed to match up,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
120,Farrah,"Yeah, so that basically like when you look at it, the third paragraph",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
120,Farrah,"With what the question is asked, it says, you could look really closely, but it does it match like the word discover",,,,response,1,0,2
120,Teacher,Chris?,,,,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, Okay,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,Right,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher," And so let's go back and look and see what's the word that goes with that word discover, so we know discover means to what somebody does anybody can answer",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Chris,Chris: Find,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
120,Teacher,To find right so if we're looking to find something,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher," What are some of those words, maybe in those first couple paragraphs 1 through 3 that go with finding something",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,"Jazmin? What do you say again, can you say again",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Jazmin,"Yes, i was going to say investigate",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
120,Teacher," Alright, so what, what did they use to investigate",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,"Yes, investigate",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,Oliver,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, What do you think they used to investigate if you go back and look at the text,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Oliver,"Well, I guess I'm not sure if it's not the microscope might take me a moment",,,210.4,response,1,0,2
120,Teacher,That's okay look back through those first couple paragraphs,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
120,Oliver,I'm not sure,,,120.3,response,1,0,2
120,Teacher,You're not sure,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher," Okay, we'll keep looking Chris, what, what can I help you with, what do you think you know the answer",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
120,Chris," But I know that they use, you know,",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
120,Chris,"Well yeah, I was gonna say, I went to NASA with my dad and I know that scientists lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and that's not in the reading",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
120,Teacher," Um, it's always good when we have that background knowledge that we can pull in",,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,That's awesome,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,But let's look back at this specific article because this is about water on the moon,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher," Okay, so let's look at paragraph two,",,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,"Because if you look, if we listen and look at all of your answers Chris, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, But they did find water in some of those places,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher," It says, NASA send a small machine",,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,That's not entirely true,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, What was the name of that small machine,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,And then if you look at Jazmin's answer,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,Jazmin's,,,,remark,1,0,2
120,Jazmin,RER: Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,1,0,2
120,Teacher," Okay, so one of the things I would say is that you guys did a really good job trying to pull things you found Out of the text ",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,Very good,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, That is one thing I think that will help you if you really try to pull that answer out of what you're reading,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,Oliver,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher," So you could still say I agree with Farrah, but then tell me that reason why you agree with her",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, What is it that she picked that I agree with,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,"Instead of just agreeing with Farrah, maybe think about why do I agree with Farrah",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Oliver,"Oh yeah, I could tell you",,,420.2,response,1,0,2
120,Teacher,"Yeah, okay",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, Go ahead and think about why you might agree with Farrah,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, So if we rewrote our answers,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,"Okay, Farrah you learned and you saw that you were looking for a piece of machinery",,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, Right,,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, If we might do that in a minute,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher, You just picked the wrong one,,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
120,Farrah,"Yeah, I can see that, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,420.2,response,1,0,2
120,Farrah,Thank you so much,,,,response,1,0,2
120,Teacher,You're welcome,,,,remark,1,0,2
120,Teacher,"Okay guys, so we've already discussed that question and we're gonna get into the next question that you guys just answered",,,,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, Luis What can I help you with,,,,remark,2,0,2
120,Luis,"Um, I just wanted to remind everybody that my dad is an astronaut, that's pretty cool",,,,response,2,0,2
120,Teacher," Once we've talked about it some more, um,",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,That is pretty cool,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, You'll have to go home and show him this article,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,Awesome,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, Maybe in one of the headings or sub headings,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,So look back on your article and look for that word valuable,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, Do you see it anywhere in there,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, We talked about what is is there considerable evidence to show that water is valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,"Alright, Chris, you see it",,,,remark,2,0,2
120,Chris," I's a subheading, at the top, it's water is a valuable resource",,,,response,2,0,2
120,Chris,"Oh yeah, I saw it",,,,response,2,0,2
120,Teacher,Perfect,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher," So do you think that might be where we look for our answers, guys",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, Alright,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Chris,Yeah,,,210.4,response,2,0,2

120,Teacher,"Okay, so do you think that's a good place with are looking for answer about water being valuable",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,"Yep Okay perfect, so let's go down to that section",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,All right,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2

120,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,2,0,2
120,Jazmin,You can say it's expensive,,,,response,2,0,2
120,Teacher, Okay,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, Good,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher," Okay, so something that's expensive is considered valuable",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2

120,Farrah,I was gonna say the same stuff,,,210.2,response,2,0,2
120,Teacher,You're gonna say what,,,,remark,2,0,2
120,Farrah,Mostly the same stuff,,,,response,2,0,2
120,Teacher,Mostly the same stuff,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,Though the paragraph that you guys read did it tell you what they meant by valuable,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher," All right, good",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
120,Farrah, Yeah,,,210.4,response,2,0,2

120,Farrah,Yeah,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
120,Teacher,Did what did it say valuable meant,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Farrah,It says water on the moon valuable are very important resource,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
120,Teacher,Let's underline very important,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, I didn't mean to cut you off,,,,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,I'm sorry,,,,remark,2,0,2
120,Farrah,"No, it's okay",,,,response,2,0,2
120,Farrah," I was just gonna say, yeah, very important",,,,response,2,0,2
120,Farrah, And then in the next line it says useful,,,,response,2,0,2
120,Teacher,And so I'm going to pull back up your responses,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,Good,,,110.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, Okay,,,110.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, It could be useful in a lot of ways,,,110.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,So it says if they're convincing evidence that water on the moon Could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,and you put it out perfectly,,,110.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, It could be useful in lots of ways,,,110.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, This question is,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, So it could be very important,,,110.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,Another way to say or state,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, It's just asking,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, Right,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,"Why would water on the moon, be very valuable or very important right so what, in what ways so that word convincing evidence",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,Let's go back in the text and see what makes water valuable if it comes from the moon,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,So I want you guys to turn and talk and share and pair for about 30 seconds and look through there and see if you can find some places that Show through the text that water is a valuable resource,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, Okay,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher," So, Oliveron Farrah",,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, You guys and Chris can work together and Jazmin and Luis You can work together,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,So just paragraph four or five and six,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, Okay,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,So make sure you're using the the text to look for answers too,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Oliver,"Yeah, we had a chance to look at and have the conversation",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
120,Teacher, Perfect,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,You did,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher," Alright, so let's start with Jazmin's group",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, What are some of the things that it said make water a valuable resource from the moon Chris,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, Okay,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Chris,"Yeah, okay",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
120,Chris, And it says that,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
120,Chris, So one thing is that water can be broken down into two parts into hydrogen and oxygen,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
120,Chris,In the reading,,,,response,2,0,2
120,Chris," You said to look at the at the beauty and it says, you could do that",,,,response,2,0,2
120,Chris,"And that, I think that would you really use",,,,response,2,0,2
120,Teacher, That is an excellent point,,,430.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,Why would that be useful,,,430.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher," So you've given me a really good piece of evidence, but you need to validate that with the next, I would say the next sentence",,,430.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, So what is that next sentence say,,,430.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, But I want you to think about why that would be useful,,,430.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,Anybody can answer,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Jazmin,"For example, future astronauts could drink this water",,,130.2,response,2,0,2
120,Jazmin,"  You can drink it and do other stuff, right?",,,130.2,response,2,0,2
120,Teacher,water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher," So you could have the water to drink, but if you look back at the sentence Chris gave us",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,"Right, okay",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher, So that's one way that the water is helpful or valuable right,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,astronauts could breathe the oxygen right so they could use the water to be broken down and to make oxygen,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
120,Luis, My dad would totally need that,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
120,Luis,"Yeah, yeah",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
120,Teacher, Okay,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,How about Farrah and Oliver show us another way that water could be useful and tell me the paragraph that you're in and start read the sentence that it comes from as well,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
120,Teacher,He would um what is another one,,,,remark,2,0,2
120,Farrah, I just wanted to share with you how awesome it was to have you with us today,,,130.2,response,2,0,2
120,Farrah,"So unfortunately, we have to go to our next class, we go to our next class",,,130.2,response,2,0,2
120,Farrah,"And in particular, you like really helped us to remember to use evidence in our reading and in our",,,,response,2,0,2
120,Farrah,In our answers like so that didn't just say stuff without using evidence and like even more like you help us understand the meaning of words,,,,response,2,0,2
120,Farrah, So we,,,,response,2,0,2
120,Farrah,"Also, they helped us to think about, like, how did we get to the answer",,,,response,2,0,2
120,Farrah, So it was really cool because we were able to explain like what we were thinking about and I feel that you are really this Luis Luis just says stuff sometimes,,,,response,2,0,2
120,Farrah, It was really fun to work with you,,,,response,2,0,2
120,Farrah,Thank you so much,,,,response,2,0,2
120,Teacher,Bye guys,,,,remark,2,0,2
120,Farrah,Bye,,,,response,2,0,2

120,Farrah,Doing good,,,,response,0,0,2
120,Farrah, It's good to see you,,,,response,0,0,2
120,Teacher," Yes, Luis?",,,220.1,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher," Um, so I have seen your responses to our discussion question and I wanted to talk to you about how you came to know those answers",,,220.1,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher,It's good to see you too,,,220.1,remark,0,0,2
120,Luis," And, um, I don't really think I need to be at this group, you know,",,,220.1,response,0,0,2
120,Luis,"Um, yeah, so like here's something that's kind of on my mind",,,220.1,response,0,0,2
120,Luis, Like I know like a lot about space,,,220.1,response,0,0,2
120,Teacher," We're not talking about space, though",,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher, So let's see if we can use some of our reasoning skills to do that,,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher,Well that's good that you know a lot about space,,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher, Right now we're looking at how we answered this question using the text,,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
120,Luis,"Um, well, okay, so",,,420.1,response,0,0,2
120,Luis,Equipment,,,,response,0,0,2
120,Luis,And scientists and um,,,,response,0,0,2
120,Luis,Water and moon,,,,response,0,0,2
120,Luis,"Yeah, um",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
120,Luis,Jazmin,,,,response,0,0,2
120,Jazmin,"Okay, so basically, and another word that I saw was discovered",,,,response,0,0,2
120,Jazmin,"It's like when you find something, or when you when you when you find something",,,210.2,response,0,0,2
120,Teacher, What did it send the small machine to do?,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher,Everybody look back with us and Jazmin read that sentence that you found NASA sent a small machine,,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher, Okay,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher, So you talked about NASA sending a small machine,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher, If we look back at the text,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher,Good,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
120,Jazmin,"Okay, so in paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,120.3,response,0,0,2
120,Teacher,"Good, so we could underline that sentence to support this discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, right, because investigate is something you do to discover something, right?",,,420.3,remark,0,0,2
120,Jazmin,"Right, okay, so I underlined it",,,420.3,response,0,0,2
120,Teacher,"All right, everybody, underline that sentence, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher,Or how did you come to that conclusion,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
120,Chris,"Um, so I kind of was like, um,",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
120,Chris," No, no, no",,,,response,0,0,2
120,Chris, Was it,,,,response,0,0,2
120,Chris,"Let's see, uh, well is like in paragraph one, I think",,,,response,0,0,2
120,Chris,"Paragraph one, yep",,,,response,0,0,2
120,Chris, Scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters,,,,response,0,0,2
120,Chris,"Um, well, I guess I'm not sure",,,120.2,response,0,0,2
120,Teacher," So you've all read this once through, right?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher,So let's look back at the text,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
120,Chris,"Um, well, okay, so there's a couple places on paragraph two, they said on the lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and then paragraph, paragraph three, the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
120,Teacher, Okay,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher, Can you explain what you mean by that,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher," Now, Oliver, you said you circled the same response as Farrah",,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher,Good,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
120,Oliver," So basically, Farrah, and I both thought that that the microscope was the thing that they used to discover the water",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
120,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
120,Teacher,"Okay, how would they be able to use a microscope to discover water in your opinion",,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
120,,"Um,",,,230.1,,0,0,2
120,Oliver, You had to look in the microscope,,,,response,0,0,2
120,Oliver,"Um, well, they would use the microscope to look at it and it said that in the in the reading it said that the water they found is microscopic so it's like really small, like you couldn't see it",,,,response,0,0,2
120,Oliver,"Um, yeah, I guess so",,,210.3,response,0,0,2
120,Teacher,So what tool in here does it say they use to find it?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
120,Farrah,"Oh, oh, oh, so I just, this really",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
120,Teacher,"Savanahh, hold on, let Oliver finish, but that's okay",,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
120,Oliver,"Um, well, I guess, I guess I'm not sure because like you have, you have like the microscope, but you would study it and then you have like Jazmin, said the Lunar Orbiter",,,110.1,response,0,0,2
120,Oliver,And so you would use maybe both of them,,,,response,0,0,2
120,Farrah,"Yeah, so I was just going to ask like,",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
120,Farrah,"Although I'm not sure now, but it seemed like maybe the microscope wasn't the answer",,,,response,0,0,2
120,Farrah, So I was just wondering why it was the Lunar Orbiter and not the microscope,,,,response,0,0,2
120,Farrah,It's like finding something,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
120,Teacher,Right,,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher, It's like finding something so finding it versus looking at it closely are two different things,,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher, So the question is asking what equipment did they use to find the water,,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher,"And if you need help getting started, you could say the equipment and the scientists used to discover water was the what? And then write out your response",,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,0,2
120,Jazmin,"Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but I just before we went to lunch, I wanted to just thank you for working with us and, especially, I just wanted to thank you for",,,,response,0,0,2
120,Jazmin, And so it was just really nice because,,,,response,0,0,2
120,Jazmin,You were really careful about making sure that like we all had a chance to speak and sometimes that doesn't happen in the class,,,,response,0,0,2
120,Jazmin,"We all had a chance to speak and we all had a chance to share our thoughts and also you were really patient, even though we weren't like totally sure like what each piece was so I just wanted to thank you for doing that",,,,response,0,0,2
120,Teacher,"Oh, you're welcome",,,,remark,0,0,2
120,Teacher, Y'all did a great job,,,,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, Did you enjoy lunch today,,,,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"Okay, we're back for lunch",,,,remark,2,0,2
121,Oliver, But then we had a chocolate chip cookie for  desert that was mm mm mmmm,,,,response,2,0,2
121,Oliver,"Oh, it was delicious",,,,response,2,0,2
121,Oliver, We had some noodles,,,,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher,I like chocolate chip cookies too,,,,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, Luis Did you have a question?,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,Yes,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
121,Luis," Yeah, I just want to remind you that my dad is an astronaut",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
121,Luis,Teacher? Yes,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"Well, congratulations, you should be very proud of your dad",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, So the second question that we had was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be value,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,Okay,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"And so, Farrah, you've mentioned that it will be a long time",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,Why do you think that,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Farrah,"Okay, well in the last paragraph",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Farrah, So it sounds like that,,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Farrah, They don't have the money and it'll take a long time,,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Farrah, It says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money,,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher," It will take a long time to do it and will take a large investment, a lot of money will be spent to get the water",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher," In other words, it's not available right away",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"Yeah, and that's certainly very true",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,But if they could get to it,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, What do you think,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher," And after a while, with the water evaluable once they were able to get to it",,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Farrah, Yeah,,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Farrah," So I guess if they could get to it, it would be",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Farrah,"I mean all yeah cuz water, it's definitely important",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"Okay, so it'll just take them a while but it'll be important",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, And why do you think that,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, Right,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"Jazmin, you mentioned that That the astronauts would need water to drink and to stay hydrated",,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, Why is that true?,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Jazmin," Um, and I feel like I read it in my book I read it in the story where they talked about that they need water to drink",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Jazmin,"Okay, because, well, you know, like we need water to drink",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"Yeah, so it's it's certainly mentioned that",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Jazmin," Okay, it's in the beginning, it says future astronauts could drink this water",,,110.1,response,2,0,2
121,Jazmin,"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I see it",,,110.1,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"Yeah, and so that would make it valuable right",,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Jazmin,Yeah yeah cuz you need to drink,,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher, Astronauts have to carry it in space,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,That's right and Luis mentioned that that water is is very -- sorry Chris,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher," And actually, you mentioned that water was very heavy and that right now",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher," But if they could get water on the moon, that would certainly be viable",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"Why do you think it would be valuable if they can get water on the moon, rather than taking it with them?",,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Chris," Okay, so I said it was heavy",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Chris,How could it be soluble if they could take water on the arm instead of waters,,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Chris,Oh well because,,,,response,2,0,2
121,Chris," Okay, so I know about when when the rockets take off that they, they, it's already heavy right because they have all this fuel and so then maybe you would burn less fuel if if it was less if they didn't have to carry as much water",,,,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher,Yes Jazmin,,,,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,Very good,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, So that's very useful,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, So that's a very good observation on your part Chris,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, And then if they didn't have to carry all the water with and they had room to carry other things whether that's fuel or other equipment or more people,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Jazmin,"I was just thinking, um, you can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon",,,,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher, What are your thoughts on that,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, That's certainly another great use for water is that you could use it to potentially grow your food,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, And so now that's less things that you have to carry with you,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,That's a great idea,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"What else do you think would make water valuable, Oliver",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
121,Oliver,"Well, I had read the same thing that Farrah was talking about in the last paragraph",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
121,Oliver," Yeah, I mean not I was like arm",,,,response,2,0,2
121,Oliver, Someone want ours to come up with a plan for extracting are getting out of the poor,,,,response,2,0,2
121,Oliver,Machine to you,,,,response,2,0,2
121,Oliver,"They need to study the moon's surface, and sounds like it will be really hard because I need to study the moons surgace build new equipment",,,,response,2,0,2
121,Oliver," I mean, it's not valuable because it's too expensive",,,,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher,Okay,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher," It has no value, right",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher," So certainly, if it's very expensive and hard to do that may or may not be able to get to the water and so unless you can get through it",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,Say that we do have enough money,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, And we do have enough time to get the water from the moon would then it be valuable?,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Oliver,"I mean, yeah",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Oliver," Cuz, cuz you know water is valuable",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Oliver," Yeah, okay",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Oliver, Water is valuable,,,230.1,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"OK so Luis what's another way that water could be valuable, what's another thing they could use water for?",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
121,Chris,"Excuse me, Mr",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
121,Chris, I just thought about something from the story,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
121,Chris, Teacher,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"Okay, Chris",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, Go ahead,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
121,Chris,Water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher," That's a claim that Luis said, right Luis?",,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,Very good,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
121,Luis,"Yeah, that's what I was gonna say that was, that was the answer that I sent for the question",,,130.2,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher, And it can be broken down into those two elements oxygen and hydrogen,,,210.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher," And so if you can break it down into those two elements, then you can use it for other things",,,210.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"Yeah, that that was a very good answer",,,210.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher," You've probably heard water all through maybe have H2O, The H stands for hydrogen and oxygen",,,210.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,What are some things you can use oxygen for? What do you think Luis?,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
121,Luis,To breathe?,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher, So you have to take action with you or if you can use the water to make oxygen you take advantage there about hydrogen,,,210.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,Exactly the room you're in now you're breathing oxygen,,,210.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher," And because we have it in our atmosphere, the moon has a very Limited atmosphere and there's not enough oxygen to breathe",,,210.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,What can hydrogen be used for?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, What do you see there?,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"Hey, you want to take a quick look at your article that you read",,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, You could look at the sentence,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,What do you see there that that hydrogen can be used for?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
121,Luis,rocket fuel,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher, That's right,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,rocket fuel,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Farrah,rocket fuel,,,110.1,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher,Exactly right,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, Everybody see that,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,It says rocket fuel,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Farrah,"I don't, I don't see what you're seeing",,,120.3,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher, It's paragraph number five starts off moon water can use one other ways,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, The second part where waters valuable resource,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,The part of the paragraph,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, The article,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
121,Farrah,"Okay, yeah, yeah",,,120.3,response,2,0,2
121,Farrah," Oh, I see that I see",,,120.3,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, You have a question,,,,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"Okay, so I mean like rocket fuel and the moon, I would that be by valuable",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
121,Oliver,"Well, I was just gonna say I was looking at the clock out, it's time for the next group",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
121,Oliver," Um, but I did want to say thank you so much Mr",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
121,Oliver, Teacher for,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
121,Oliver,helping us think about,,,,response,2,0,2
121,Oliver," But then, because you kept on asking us to think about it and to look at the story I I feel like I kind of maybe get it a little bit more baby",,,,response,2,0,2
121,Oliver,"Like what what we needed to find an Ma ma ma ma ma story, cuz I thought that you know I had read the story pretty well",,,,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher, And we talked about,,,,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"Well, that's how we learn we look at things again and we talk about it",,,,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher, And then I really appreciate you keeping time for today so that we didn't miss lunch,,,,remark,2,0,2
121,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,2,0,2
121,Oliver,"Okay, bye",,,,response,2,0,2
121,Teacher,"You guys, take care",,,,remark,2,0,2
121,Farrah,Hi,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin,Hello,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin, How are you,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Teacher,"Hey, I'm doing fine, how are you",,,,remark,0,0,2
121,Jazmin,We're doing well,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin, Thank you,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Teacher,"Okay, so we've had a chance to take a look at the discovery of water on the moon",,,,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher," Yes, Luis do you have a question?",,,,remark,0,0,2
121,Luis,"Um, yeah, it's a question, but it's well",,,,response,0,0,2
121,Luis, I know a lot about space,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Luis, So I don't think I really have to be in this group because I already know all this stuff,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Luis, So here's the thing,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Teacher," But what I'd like you to do, you can help other students learn more to, would you like to do that?",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,That's great that you know that stuff,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
121,Luis, Yeah,,,110.3,response,0,0,2
121,Luis,"Yeah, that sounds like fun",,,110.3,response,0,0,2
121,Teacher,Sure it will be,,,,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,"Okay, so the question at hand is what equipment to the scientist use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, So have all you thought about that?,,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,"Farrah, what do you think?",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Farrah," It says you need a microscope, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
121,Farrah,"Um, so I think that the um the equipment was the microscope, like in the reading",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
121,Teacher,Okay,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, And so when you look at that word,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher," Let's look at that word again where it says that, it says the water they found is microscopic and so do you think microscope and microscopic are the same thing?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Farrah,"Um, well, it's like, I think if it's microscopic like it's small and that's how like you see small stuff with like a microscope",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
121,Teacher," And it's called microscopic because often it is very small, and you wouldn't need a microscope to see it",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,Well certainly you can see some small things with a microscope,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher," But there's other ways to measure things that may be very, very small",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,They were simply describing the size of the water as being microscopic,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, That makes sense?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher," So in this case, they didn't",,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, It doesn't look like they said they actually use a microscope,,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,But there's other ways to detect it,,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
121,Farrah,"Oh yeah, that doesn't make sense",,,130.3,response,0,0,2
121,Farrah, So they didn't actually have a microscope on the moon?,,,130.3,response,0,0,2
121,Teacher,That's correct,,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, What did,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, What did the reading tell you?,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,"So Chris, what do you think they used to determine the water was on the moon",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Chris,"Well, so here's the thing, like I kind of thought that, like, um, well I've been to NASA with my dad and like we really",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
121,Chris,Like we had a really good time like walking around and like we saw all these like exhibits and stuff,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Chris, So I guess my guess is kind of like Luis's like I think that they must have used like spacesuits and like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Teacher,"Yeah, that certainly makes sense from having gone to see that type of stuff",,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, That's great that you had a chance to see some other things that have happened in space,,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,But if we look at the the information that was actually provided,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, And the first statement that it says there,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, So everyone look look at it together,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, Let's go back to that for just a minute and take a look at it where it talks about water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin? Jazmin? Go ahead",,,,remark,0,0,2
121,Jazmin," So I was just wondering if, like if the answer was what, well I was just a little bit confused like why my answer might not be right",,,,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin,Yeah,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Teacher,"Jazmin, can you hear me?",,,,remark,0,0,2
121,Jazmin, I'm sorry,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin,"I'm sorry, it cut out for just a second",,,,response,0,0,2
121,Teacher,I can hear you now,,,,remark,0,0,2
121,Jazmin,"So basically I was saying that, um, I was just wondering like why my answer, maybe wasn't right",,,,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin," So I'm just trying to find out, like, like why my answer might not be right",,,,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin," Like, because I think we were just saying that the the the machine was gonna like see everything",,,,response,0,0,2
121,Teacher, So you answer that that NASA send a small machine,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,Maybe your answer is right,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher," And so if we look at what was written, actually, you can look at number two on there",,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,"See how it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate? Jazmin, what do you think a lunar orbiter would be?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Jazmin,It's like a spaceship that goes up to the moon and can study things,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin,The moon?,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Teacher,"That's correct, because if you look at the name Lunar Orbiter and look at what each of those words mean",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, Lunar refers to what? Do you know?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, Lunar means something dealing with the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,That's right,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, And so what would an orbiter be? What does orbit orbit mean?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Jazmin,"Orbit's like when something's like flying around something or like circling something so like like I guess, like maybe like the spaceships like flying around the moon",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
121,Teacher,That's exactly right,,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,"Because Lunar Orbiter means orbiting, flying around the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, And so they have a small machine,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,It's not actually on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,So the other the other students that looked at that gave different answers,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, It's simply flying over the moon around the moon to take a look at that the possibilities of water,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,So that's a great job be able to identify what that means,,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, Does that make sense?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,"For example, Farrah, do you now understand with what microscopic means and they didn't have a microscope, but they actually had a spaceship that orbited around the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Farrah,"Yeah, I think it does make sense that they like might study the water with a microscope, but they they might find it with something else, with the machine",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
121,Teacher,That's right,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, That's very good,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, And if they were able to get a sample of that water then they could certainly look at it with a microscope,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher," But in this case, they haven't actually landed on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,Go ahead,,,,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, They're simply using the Lunar Orbiter to study the moon from a distance,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher," So, so Oliver",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
121,Jazmin,I--,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin, But before we did,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin, I just wanted to thank you for working with us,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin, And specifically I wanted to thank you for being so patient,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin,I'm so sorry,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin, We have to go to lunch now,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin," And also, like, even though our answers were kind of muddled at first, like you helped us be very clear about what we were trying to say",,,,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin,Sometimes we our science teacher says we give him stress hives and you were so thoughtful and very patient,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Jazmin, So thank you so much,,,,response,0,0,2
121,Teacher, Enjoy your lunch,,,,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher, I appreciate it,,,,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,"Well, thank you, Jazmin",,,,remark,0,0,2
121,Teacher,"Alright, let's start the simulation",,,,remark,1,0,2
121,Bennett,"Okay, let's bring up the student",,,,,1,0,2
121,Teacher,Alright,,,,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"Um, and so, yes",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"Together, because I just want to go over a few of the things that we read in the article",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, Luis Do you have a question,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Luis,"Oh, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"Yes, but you can help some of the other students",,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher," So let's, uh, we'll use your contribution to help help the other students as well",,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, Could you read the first question that we were supposed to answer,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,I've got your answers that you that you wrote down and so Chris,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
121,Chris, It says what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,response,1,0,2
121,Chris,Uh huh,,,120.3,response,1,0,2
121,Teacher,Very good,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, What did you read in the article about the equipment that they used,,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,Teacher:But what equipment do you think they used to find it,,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,You didn't find where the water is located and you said it found craters with the water,,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
121,Chris,What equipment they used to find it,,,230.2,response,1,0,2
121,Chris,I don't remember,,,,response,1,0,2
121,Teacher,Okay,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"Well, let me, let me ask Jazmin, a question, Jazmin, you mentioned that NASA sent a small machine",,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, What kind of machine did NASA send? Maybe you can help Chris with that one,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
121,Jazmin, That's the small machine,,,130.2,response,1,0,2
121,Jazmin,"Okay, let me look",,,130.2,response,1,0,2
121,Jazmin, It's the lunar orbiter Chris,,,130.2,response,1,0,2
121,Jazmin, I don't remember,,,130.2,response,1,0,2
121,Jazmin, That's a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,130.2,response,1,0,2
121,Teacher, Do you know what a lunar orbiter is,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,Exactly,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher," And so, Chris",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, They sent a lunar orbiter have up there,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Chris,"Oh no, I mean I've been a NASA and I saw the Mars Rover, but I don't know what a lunar orbiter is",,,210.4,response,1,0,2
121,Teacher,Okay so Luis You know a lot about space,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, Can you tell us what the Lunar Orbiter is?,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
121,Luis,"Okay, well, so I know a lot about like what astronauts wear and what they use, and I know that there isn't gravity, but I actually never heard of a lunar orbiter before, so this is news to me",,,130.2,response,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"Well, let me show you a picture of a lunar orbiter",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,This is a lunar orbiter simulation picture of it flying over the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,Like satellite flies in space,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, So it's orbiting the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, So around the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, It was launched on a rocket from Earth transition to the moon and then it can circle around the room,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,And so that's why it's called a lunar orbiter lunar means moon and so lunar orbiter means something orbits around goes around the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, That makes sense,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Jazmin, I don't understand why my answers wrong,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
121,Jazmin,But Mr,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
121,Jazmin, Teacher,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
121,Teacher,I didn't say your answer was wrong,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"I'm just clarifying what kind of machine that they sent and the machine that they sent is called a lunar orbiter atoms, okay does that make sense?",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, So your answer was right,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,That they said that small machine a lunar orbiter is a type of machine,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
121,Jazmin, I thought we were all here because all of our answers are wrong,,,110.2,response,1,0,2
121,Jazmin,"Yeah, yeah",,,110.2,response,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"Who told you that, that's not true",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, I just wanted to clarify your understanding of the art,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,We just want to understand better Exactly what you're trying to say,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, We were able to clarify that,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,It's not that your answers are wrong,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher," That's the lunar orbiter, we're going to get into more information",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, That makes sense? Okay,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, And when you said a small machine,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Jazmin,Yeah yeah,,,110.2,response,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"So, Luis",,,,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,You know a lot about some of the equipment NASA uses,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"Any ideas about how they might detect water on, from the orbiter?",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Luis, Now that I've seen a picture of it,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
121,Luis,"Hmm, okay",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
121,Luis," Um, I feel like maybe maybe the camera just kind of look for it",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
121,Luis, And if they see some puddles of water and then that's how they find it,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
121,Luis," Um, I think that, let's see, how would they detect the water",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"So, Farrah, what, what did you mention in terms of the ability to find the water",,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, You mentioned you would use a scientific tool called a microscope,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, Why would they need to use a microscope,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"Yeah, so that was certainly one, one way to do it",,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Farrah,"Well, what I mean",,,230.1,response,1,0,2
121,Farrah, Cuz it said that in the story that was like the last sentence of the stories you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,230.1,response,1,0,2
121,Teacher,and so Luis You mentioned that you can see water puddles,,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"Okay, well a microscope is used to look at something really, really closely because the water on the moon is is there's so little of it and it's so small",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"Certainly if you saw a water puddle, you know, that was water on the moon, the water is much smaller",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher," In fact, if you had a sample from there, you wouldn't be able to see it without a microscope",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, So it's very hard to see,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher," Yes, yes",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Chris," So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, that stuff",,,,response,1,0,2
121,Chris,"I was just gonna say, since we're talking about the scientific tools that, um, I went to NASA",,,,response,1,0,2
121,Teacher,That's a use all those things because the environment in space requires him to have been extra equipment right? There's a lot of things that they need to do,,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"But what we want to talk about today is, is what they did to discover the water on the moon, and then try to figure out what would be the value of having water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,Any thoughts about that?,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,"Well, why would finding water on the moon useful",,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher, Go ahead,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,Chris,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher," What do you think, Farrah, go ahead",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Farrah,"Well, I was just, I was thinking that you know if I'm, if, if, if the astronauts got, like, you know, thirsty or something, then they could just like drill a hole in the moon, maybe, and then they could drink the water like that maybe",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
121,Teacher,And so certainly being able to drink water and using it for other things,,,210.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher," For the most part, astronauts will take the water they need with them, but if they could find a way to get water from the moon, and that would save them having to bring it",,,210.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher," Maybe brushing their teeth and simple things like that, or to cook with water, it's very, very important to have",,,210.1,remark,1,0,2
121,Teacher,So Oliver what do you have,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
121,Oliver,"Well, I was just looking at the clock and I i see about it's time for us to go to lunch",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
121,Oliver, So I just wanted to let you know before we call,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
121,Teacher," Okay, thank you",,,,remark,1,0,2

122,Teacher,"So, Sabina, do you care to share your response with us",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,And so I just wanted to kind of get your input and let you guys share with me your responses on the question,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,So I'll read the question again for you guys but it was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
122,Luis,"Excuse me, a teacher",,,150.1,response,1,1,2
122,Luis," I hadn't been on this group, I already know all about space",,,150.1,response,1,1,2
122,Teacher, And maybe you can learn from your friends to okay,,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,"Right, Luis, so you'll be able to share some information with us",,,110.3,remark,1,1,2

122,Farrah,"Okay, Farrah",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
122,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,1,1,2
122,Farrah,Sure I sit on that scientists could use the microscope to find the water,,,,response,1,1,2
122,Teacher, So do you guys think that you can use a microscope to find water on the moon,,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,That's great,,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,Guys think Chris Jazmin,,,,remark,1,1,2
122,,I have a same thing,,,,,1,1,2
122,Teacher,"Okay Oliver or Sabina, what do you guys use a microscope for",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
122,Oliver,Us to look at small stuff,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
122,Oliver," So, um, have you used a microscope in your other science classes",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
122,Oliver,That's right,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
122,Oliver,"Yeah, yeah",,,,response,1,1,2
122,Oliver, Smith's clash,,,,response,1,1,2
122,Oliver," Well, you're stomping Mr",,,,response,1,1,2
122,Teacher,We're so we use microscopes to discover things just like you guys said it is a tool that we can use to help us to discover things,,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,"But if we go back in the text, and we just need to clarify",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,But what did they use on the moon to discover water,,,120.1,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher, Do you know what that that tool was called,,,120.1,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,"What tool they this, the scientists used so you can use a microscope",,,130.1,remark,1,1,2

122,Chris,Yeah,,,120.3,response,1,1,2
122,Teacher,Very first in its,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
122,Chris,NASA send a small machine on the lunar orbiter to investigate,,,120.3,response,1,1,2
122,Teacher," So, Oliveron Farrah",,,120.1,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher, What was the tool that they used on the moon,,,120.1,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,Oh,,,120.1,remark,1,1,2
122,Farrah,And,,,120.1,response,1,1,2
122,Farrah,Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,1,1,2
122,Teacher," So they use a machine a tool, similar to the microscope, like you guys said to discuss to investigate and discover, and that was called the Lunar Orbiter",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,That's right,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,Does that make sense to you all,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2

122,Oliver,Chris read it,,,,response,1,1,2
122,Teacher,"So I think both of you were, you were right in the fact that they do use the scientific tool, but we just need to clarify what that tool",,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,So you guys did a really good job at using your past knowledge on a microscope,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,but they use a different tool on the moon to discover,,,130.3,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,Chris,,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher," What did the scientists, fine",,,130.2,remark,1,1,2

122,Jazmin,Ice deposits,,,110.4,response,1,1,2
122,Teacher,but we have to be a little bit more spits specific in naming what that machine was,,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher, So great job,,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,So you were right in that it was a small machine,,,130.1,remark,1,1,2

122,Teacher," Jazmin,",,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher," So what they use was the Moon, lunar orbiter",,,110.4,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
122,Jazmin,I think so,,,150.1,response,1,1,2
122,Teacher, And what did that lunar orbiter do so,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,So if we go back and read this sentence that I'm Chris read in the name of this small machine was a lunar orbiter,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,"Luis Can you read the second sentence and paragraph two,",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
122,Luis,I'm sure,,,120.3,response,1,1,2
122,Luis," Okay, this loan or what, oh well land damone South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater",,,120.3,response,1,1,2
122,Teacher, So what did the lunar orbiter do Jazmin,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,Good job,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
122,Jazmin,Look for ice deposits,,,210.4,response,1,1,2

122,Teacher, And what did they discover in those ice deposits,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,So I'll read this in it for said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in about 32 ounces of water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,So those ice deposits held what,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
122,Jazmin,Water,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
122,Teacher,Water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher, So by using the Lunar Orbiter to decide to investigate the ice deposits those ice deposit sores,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher, What was holding the water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,1,1,2
122,Chris,"Um, well, I went to NASA",,,,response,1,1,2
122,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,1,1,2
122,Teacher, Luis What was something that you said that scientists use,,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,"Your right and so, Luis, said the same thing, right",,,110.3,remark,1,1,2

122,Teacher,"Right, so they",,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher, Those are different types of equipment that scientists use,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher," So you guys are right and that they use oxygen tanks and space suits do do those equipment does that equipment, help them discover water",,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
122,Luis,"Um,",,,110.2,response,1,1,2
122,Luis, I mean it and helps them breathe,,,,response,1,1,2

122,Teacher,So Chris,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher, You did a really good job at stating that scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,So what made you think that that was the type of equipment that they used,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
122,Oliver,I'm teacher,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
122,Oliver, Thanks for taking my time to work with us,,,230.1,response,1,1,2

122,Teacher,You're welcome,,,,remark,1,1,2
122,Teacher,"Hey guys, welcome back",,,,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher,And,,,,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher,We're gonna follow up with the question of is there convincing evidence that water on the name could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher,So we think of convincing evidence,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher," What does that mean to you, Farrah",,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
122,Farrah,"Oh, it means that like",,,120.2,response,2,1,2

122,Luis,Yeah,,,140.1,response,2,1,2
122,Teacher,So we're talking about convincing evidence,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher, Evidence means information that supports the statement being made,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher," So we're going to look at the evidence, the information that supports",,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher,That water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher," It can be of use for the astronauts so Jazmin, you stated that there was not convincing evidence is that correct",,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
122,Jazmin,"Well, I just, I mean, I do think there's convincing evidence because like they could drink the water and they could stay hydrated and you need water",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
122,Jazmin, So that seems to be convincing the have water,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
122,Teacher, And so you looked back at the tech stuff on if there was convincing evidence that water can be valuable,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher,Good job so you may be redirected and rethought your answer,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher,And one way,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher,astronauts could do what with the water,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
122,Jazmin,We can drink it,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
122,Teacher, And that's something that's valuable to them because we all have to have water to stay hydrated,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher,You're very good drink it,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher, Right,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2

122,Oliver,"Um,",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
122,Oliver, So I don't think that I'm convinced that arm but we could we could get water from there because we can't live there,,,,response,2,1,2
122,Oliver,"Well I, I know that",,,,response,2,1,2
122,Oliver," Um, I know that the mo0ns not ready to live on",,,,response,2,1,2
122,Teacher,"Oh, so you're looking at it from the fact that the moon is not ready as a whole to be lived on right",,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher,"What else, what else do we mean Oliver besides water",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
122,Oliver,Air,,,210.4,response,2,1,2

122,Teacher, Did they have air on the moon yet,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher, So it's the moon isn't ready for us to live on yet,,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher, So you're absolutely right,,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher,"But if there was water on the moon, but that help us",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher,"No, no",,,130.1,remark,2,1,2

122,Oliver," Like, like what",,,130.1,response,2,1,2
122,Teacher,"Your rights right so if there was water on the moon, it would be valuable",,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher,It could be something that we drink it could be something that we could use to stay clean,,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher, Good job,,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher, Correct,,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
122,Teacher,Chris you did a good job for answering and you say to that water can be valuable because it's so heavy and then astronauts wouldn't have to carry it anymore,,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
122,Chris, Yeah,,,110.4,response,2,1,2
122,Chris,I have,,,110.4,response,2,1,2

122,Teacher, And so why don't you go ahead and read the discussion question for us,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Luis,"Okay, um, the discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.3,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"Teacher:Alright, Luis, so without looking at the text, do you know the answer to that question?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Luis,"Um, well, I think that they use like oxygen tanks and that they use like space suits and stuff like that",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"Okay, they do use that in space",,,210.1,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher," But I think the question is asking, what did they use to discover water",,,210.1,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher," So, do you know what specific tool they use to discover water",,,210.1,remark,0,1,2
122,Luis,"Oh, I didn't really read that closely because I thought I kind of knew this stuff",,,210.1,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher, Okay?,,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"Okay, so how about we go back in the text and look a little bit more closely, so that we can learn more information about space",,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Luis,Okay,,,420.3,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"All right, Farrah, and what was your answer to the discussion question",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Farrah,So my answer was that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher,And that is a great answer,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"And, but let's",,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher, Can you find that in the text? Is there any way you can go back in the text and see where you found that?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
122,Farrah," So, in paragraph, paragraph three",,,110.2,response,0,1,2
122,Farrah,"Yeah, absolutely",,,110.2,response,0,1,2
122,Farrah," Um, okay",,,110.2,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,0,1,2
122,Farrah,You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely after it talks about the water,,,,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher, And that is a great answer,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,Okay,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher, Can anyone help me explain what the word discover means?,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher," But if we look at what the question is asking, it's asking what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon? That word discover is really, really important",,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,Chris?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Chris, So I think like discover is like how you you find something or you kind of like um like you,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
122,Chris,"Yeah, okay",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
122,Chris, You like find something,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher,So back to Farrah,,,230.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher," And I think, Oliver, you said you had the same answers her",,,230.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher," Find, is a perfect word",,,210.1,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher, So when you discover that means you're finding something for the first time,,,210.1,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,That's absolutely right,,,210.1,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"When they use the microscope, that wasn't to discover the water, that wasn't to find the water on the moon",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher, But that's not the tool that they use to find it for the very first time,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,Okay? Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,That's when you get on the moon and you you have to use that microscope to look really closely,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Farrah," So like my answer wasn't quite right, but it was like that they they have to use something else to discover the water",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
122,Farrah,"Yeah, I think so",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher," And so once they discovered the water on the moon, then the scientists can use the microscope to look at it really closely",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,Right,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher, Yes,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,But that's not what they used to discover it,,,430.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"Alright, Jazmin, you kind of want to explain your answer for us?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher," Okay, so what we need to do is we need to go back in the text and find what the scientists used to discover that there was water on the moon",,,430.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Jazmin, So basically what I said was that that NASA used a small machine,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
122,Jazmin,Sure,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
122,Jazmin, And that's like the machine that they sent to the moon,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher," And so what did that small machine do? Chris, can you look in paragraph two and tell us what this small machine did?",,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"Okay, yeah",,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
122,Chris,Yeah okay so small machine um,,,130.2,response,0,1,2
122,Chris,NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,,response,0,1,2
122,Chris,This lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher," And so what that lunar orbiter does, that's the small machine, Jazmin, that they sent and the small machine, you were talking about is called the Lunar Orbiter",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,Okay,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,And what does that lunar orbiter do?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
122,Luis,"Um, so like the Lunar Orbiter, I guess, like, okay, so it flies around the moon and maybe it lands on the moon and and it might do things like",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"Alright, so, Luis, we want to make sure that we're going back to the text to find our answer",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"Okay, so Chris, can you help him out and tell us what the lunar orbiter does?",,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
122,Chris,"Yeah, so I could do that",,,130.2,response,0,1,2
122,Chris, But I like first,,,130.2,response,0,1,2
122,Chris," I just wanted to ask, like, um,",,,130.2,response,0,1,2
122,Chris," So, like, I guess I'm a little confused like is Luis wrong or like I'm not quite sure?",,,,response,0,1,2
122,Chris, So like with my dad and we saw that like the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that,,,,response,0,1,2
122,Chris,I went to NASA,,,,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"No, and so why don't we, why don't we answer my question first, and then I'll get right back to what you asked, okay?",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"So my question was, can you tell us what the lunar orbiter does? So I want you to read the second sentence in paragraph two",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Chris,The lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for the ice deposits and a large pool crater,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher," So then, paragraph three goes on and talk about how the moon is still drier",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher, Okay,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"OK, so the lunar orbiter, Jazmin, the small machine that they sent, it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher," Now these ice deposits are very, very, very small",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"Well, that means if we go back to paragraph two, what did they use to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher, What did they use to investigate?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher," So when we investigate something, we're normally discovering something",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,The Lunar,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"What is it, Jazmin",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Jazmin,So they used the lunar orbiter to investigate,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher,To investigate and what did they discover when they used that small machine to investigate? What did they discover?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"Farrah, what did they discover",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Farrah,"They found lots of um, well they found water, they found amounts of water",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"Okay, so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?",,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,"Yes, so they found very, very small amounts of water, those ice deposits",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,Jazmin?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
122,Jazmin, And so we have to go in just a moment,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
122,Jazmin," But before we went, I just wanted to thank you for",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
122,Jazmin,So they used the Lunar Orbiter to discover water,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
122,Jazmin,"teaching the class and I especially wanted to thank you for, like, really spending time with us too",,,,response,0,1,2
122,Jazmin,and being really patient with our different answers like sometimes we give our science teacher,,,,response,0,1,2
122,Jazmin," He says, we gave him stress hives and I'm really, really patient and also like",,,,response,0,1,2
122,Jazmin,I think that you really helped us to like work as a group to something like don't get along and you really helped us to work strongly as a group,,,,response,0,1,2
122,Jazmin, So thank you so much,,,,response,0,1,2
122,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher," Jazmin and Chris, I want to answer your question, real fast before you leave",,,,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher," And no, you are not wrong",,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,Chris and Luis I think you both did a great job at may at using your outside resources,,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher, And I think that that's awesome,,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher, So different things that you've experienced in your life related to this,,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher, Okay,,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,Those are all tools that scientists use but just make sure you're reading the question of what specific equipment did they used to discover water on the moon,,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
122,Teacher,Great job,,,,remark,0,1,2
123,Teacher,"Yes, Luis?",,,,remark,0,0,3
123,Luis,Yeah,,,,response,0,0,3
123,Luis," Um, I don't really need to be in this group, because I know all about space",,,,response,0,0,3
123,Luis, So I don't think I really need to be here,,,,response,0,0,3
123,Luis, So here's the thing,,,,response,0,0,3
123,Teacher,"Well, perhaps you can help us all learn more about space as we continue going forward in a group",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
123,Luis,"Okay, yeah, I can do that",,,150.1,response,0,0,3
123,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,0,3
123,Farrah,So we were just talking about our answers to the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,response,0,0,3
123,Farrah,And you can ask us anything you like,,,,response,0,0,3
123,Teacher,"Okay, um",,,,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,"Farrah, you believe that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely when you are trying to look at water on the moon",,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
123,Farrah,Right,,,230.3,response,0,0,3
123,Teacher,But,,,,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,Within within the actual text,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher, What does NASA send to the moon to actually investigate for the water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher," Does anybody else have another aspect, what they may have also sent with the astronauts",,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,Yes,,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,Chris?,,,,remark,0,0,3
123,Chris,"I think that what they must have sent was um like oxygen tanks and masks and like suits and stuff like that because, um,",,,,response,0,0,3
123,Chris,"They, they have to like breathe in space, like my dad took me to NASA",,,,response,0,0,3
123,Chris," And we saw like that they had to use all this equipment and everything, so like they had to use it if they were going to space",,,,response,0,0,3
123,Teacher," There's definitely no oxygen in space,",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,Okay,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,but this is there anything that they would take with them to possibly try to investigate and sort of study the water on the moon with them,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher, And that would be that would be correct,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,Can anybody,,,,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,Does anybody have an idea,,,120.1,remark,0,0,3
123,Oliver," So basically, um,",,,120.1,response,0,0,3
123,Oliver,Yeah,,,120.1,response,0,0,3
123,Oliver,"I think I had the same answer is Farrah, and",,,,response,0,0,3
123,Oliver,"We thought that it was the microscope, that they had to send to basically like look at the water and see the water",,,,response,0,0,3
123,Oliver,"So, um, I guess what I'm trying to understand is like did is like, um, why my answer is wrong, like efforts, because we're all working together to get a better answer like maybe why is my answer wrong",,,,response,0,0,3
123,Teacher,"you would definitely, they are microscopic so if it was on earth you would definitely need a microscope to visually look at the water,",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher, It's part of the answer,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,"Well, it's part",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,"but within the maybe perhaps the second paragraph, it says, you know what they sent with the astronauts to investigate the water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,Does that,,,,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
123,Oliver," Um, so they, it was the, they sent like a microscope and something else?",,,150.1,response,0,0,3
123,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,150.1,response,0,0,3
123,Teacher,"Perhaps, um, does it talk about anything else within the paragraphs",,,120.1,remark,0,0,3
123,Oliver,"Um, let's see, I guess",,,120.1,response,0,0,3
123,Oliver,"Um,",,,,response,0,0,3
123,Oliver,"Well, they talk about--",,,,response,0,0,3
123,Teacher, What do you believe they may have sent to the moon,,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
123,Jazmin,So I think they sent a small machine,,,120.4,response,0,0,3
123,Teacher,"Jazmin, you haven't spoken yet",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher," Within the second paragraph, it talks about NASA would send, a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,130.3,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,"Okay, yes",,,130.3,remark,0,0,3
123,Jazmin,"So, is that just what I was missing was just the name of it?",,,130.3,response,0,0,3
123,Teacher,"I mean, it is a small machine it, you're, you're still correct",,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
123,Jazmin,"So yeah, I think it was a small machine",,,110.2,response,0,0,3
123,Jazmin," And then I guess it lands on the moon, and then it would discover the water, I think",,,110.2,response,0,0,3
123,Jazmin, The lunar orbiter is what they sent because it was sent up and then they would like fly around the moon,,,110.2,response,0,0,3
123,Teacher,You are correct,,,110.4,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher," Yes, Jazmin",,,110.4,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,Does anybody,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher, Does anybody have any questions,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,0,3
123,Jazmin, We have to go to lunch now but I just take the moment you for working with us and for being so positive,,,,response,0,0,3
123,Jazmin, I think sometimes,,,,response,0,0,3
123,Jazmin,I just want to thank you,,,,response,0,0,3
123,Jazmin, And I just wanted to thank you for that,,,,response,0,0,3
123,Jazmin,Our science teacher says that we give him stress hives and you were very patient with us and you really took the time to listen to our answers,,,,response,0,0,3
123,Teacher,No problem,,,,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher, Enjoy your lunch,,,,remark,0,0,3
123,Teacher,Start simulation,,,,remark,1,0,3

123,Teacher,Hello everybody welcome to class,,,,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,1,0,3
123,Luis,Hi,,,,response,1,0,3
123,Luis,"Yeah, okay",,,,response,1,0,3
123,Luis," So basically what I was gonna say is that, um, you know, I don't think I even need to be in this group because I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,3
123,Teacher," Luis, but it is always best to, you know, sort of, definitely challenge our preconceptions of of science and how we can further our learning",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,And that may be the case,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,and maybe even help others learn more about science and sort of explore their own strengths within that type of knowledge,,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
123,Luis,"Yeah, I could do that",,,150.1,response,1,0,3
123,Teacher,Has everybody completed reading the water on the moon assignment,,,,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,"Okay, I can tell by the way",,,,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher, Some of you are shaking your head that you have completed that,,,,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,I have also looked at some of the answers that you have given for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,"I would like to at least in the beginning, let's let's let Jazmin and Chrise let us know what they got for the first question",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,For What tool was you to discover water on the moon,,,,remark,1,0,3
123,Chris," Um, so, for me, I said that scientists foudn craters full of water on the moon",,,,response,1,0,3
123,Chris,Okay,,,,response,1,0,3
123,Jazmin,"To me, I say that NASA sent a small machine",,,,response,1,0,3
123,Jazmin,"Okay, I was kind of curious like I was wondering like why my answer was wrong",,,,response,1,0,3
123,Teacher,"Okay, well let's um so you're you were able to find out that there was that they used a small machine",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher," That is, you know, very good job, you were able to discover sort of what the answer was",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher," So the question is,",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,If we wanted to explore perhaps more what would be even maybe more correct answer,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,Where did you get the question is what equipment,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher, Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,"So what I'm sort of wondering sort of asked, could you be a little bit more specific, perhaps, and identifying what that small machine could possibly be",,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
123,Jazmin,It says that the small machine,,,420.2,response,1,0,3
123,Jazmin, This machine is the lunar orbiter,,,420.2,response,1,0,3
123,Teacher," So for the most part, that so that, is the small machine the exact same thing is the Lunar Orbiter?",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher, Good job,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,"OK, so the Lunar Orbiter",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
123,Jazmin,It says in the reading that you need NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,150.1,response,1,0,3
123,Jazmin, So the lunar orbiter must be this small machine,,,150.1,response,1,0,3
123,Teacher,Correct,,,110.4,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,"So to be a little bit more specific you would then, you know, want to choose",,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher, But you can't use those to sort of discover water on the moon,,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,"And so, I mean, for example, a small machine could sort of, I mean that could be anything, you know, from maybe even a remote car to even a clock on the wall",,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,So if you were able to look at that the idea or the answer of a lunar orbiter would be a little bit more specific,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher, Perhaps the Lunar Orbiter,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,"And Chris, you are you are you know you were correct to you, you're able to find out where they were able to find the water",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,"But what what tool or piece of equipment, would they actually did the scientists used to perhaps find that water on the moon within the craters",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
123,Chris,"Well, okay",,,210.2,response,1,0,3
123,Chris," So I went to nasa with my dad and when we went there I saw that scientists, a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and and stuff like I i was thinking maybe that was something that that you know what I mean, that's the tools that they're using",,,210.2,response,1,0,3
123,Teacher,"Well, they would definitely use that equipment, especially to You know, breathe and sort of operate within the space around the moon and on the moon",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher," So, good job",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher," Yeah, yeah",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
123,Teacher,"But if you were to look through the sort of the article, a little bit more, you know, sort of try to pick out some key words can you use like that type of equipment to discover water on the moon, or would you need some type of other specialized equipment to find water",,,420.3,remark,1,0,3
123,Chris,That's a good question,,,420.3,response,1,0,3
123,Chris,I guess you might need other equipment,,,,response,1,0,3
123,Chris,Yeah,,,,response,1,0,3
123,Chris," You couldn't just like use the suit and be like, oh yeah, here",,,,response,1,0,3
123,Chris, That's a great question,,,,response,1,0,3
123,Chris, Here's like the water you can use other stuff,,,,response,1,0,3
123,Teacher,"Yes, yes, Farrah",,,,remark,1,0,3
123,Farrah,"Unfortunately, we have to go on to our next group, but we wanted to thank you so much for working with us",,,,response,1,0,3

123,Teacher,Do you know the name of the facility that your dad works at,,,140.1,remark,2,0,3
123,Luis,I yeah he works at that that's Dennis Space Center,,,140.1,response,2,0,3
123,Luis," I'm in Mississippi, and he kind of like commute, so we don't get to see him as often as you know we like",,,140.1,response,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"Well that's that's unfortunate, but does he, uh, are you able to speak to him on a regular basis, perhaps, or some online activity or is hearing stories",,,140.1,remark,2,0,3
123,Luis,Yeah yeah we talk on Skype all the time,,,140.1,response,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"Well that's that's that's really cool, you know, sort of idea that you have that sort of special inroads you know you're a you know first hand knowledge of some of this might actually come, you know, sort of in handy and help somebody goes to kind of understand this material",,,110.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Luis,Awesome,,,110.3,response,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"Okay, so here's what's going you started",,,,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"The, the second question that was asked about the you know how the moon is a desert and how water is a valuable resource",,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher, The second question that you know the second prompt that was given is is that is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,And Oliver,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher, What was your answer to that question,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
123,Oliver," So my answer was no, you know, I'm because I don't think it's ready yet",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
123,Oliver,"Um, OK",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
123,Teacher," Yes, it was in the within the text, it does state that this stuff,",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"Okay, well, you know, good job",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher, Do you need water to live on Earth,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"you know, this technology will, you know, sort of be needed to be expanded upon going forward",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,But let's say for example the do you need,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Oliver,"Oh yeah, you're totally need it and like I i could see that, like, maybe it would be maybe valuable, but",,,310.1,response,2,0,3
123,Oliver,I don't think it's like that convincing the evidence because it seems like it would cost a lot of money and take a lot of time to like we don't even really have spaceship that go to the moon,,,,response,2,0,3
123,Oliver, Very often,,,,response,2,0,3
123,Teacher, Every time that you know you need to go into spaces is pretty expensive,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher," Um, it would be very expensive",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"Okay, well, good job, for sure",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"But if one day we are able to, you know, perhaps, expand our you know space traveling capabilities to be able to actually use the water on the moon might be a little bit more inexpensive inexpensive than actually having to transport it to me",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Jazmin,"And will, and I was thinking like what you could do with all the water is like grow a garden all over the moon like you could make this moon garden",,,,response,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"Well, that would definitely you know really come in handy for any, you know, scientists or astrologers who might perhaps be on the moon",,,110.2,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"I'm not totally sure we could have, like, maybe the entire moon being covered by garden",,,130.1,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher, So that perhaps the scientists could even perhaps grow vegetables and have something to that that they can grow to eat on the moon,,,110.2,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"But it would definitely you know perhaps provide sort of, you know, sort of some greenhouses, that we might be able to construct on the moon",,,110.2,remark,2,0,3
123,Jazmin,"Yeah, that's really cool",,,110.2,response,2,0,3
123,Teacher, They might actually help out astronauts?,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,This can anybody does he might know of another reason that it might actually sort of be beneficial to have water on the moon,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,Let's go with Farrah,,,,remark,2,0,3
123,Farrah,"Actually, I was asking because I, my opinion is that it's actually not very convincing evidence that kind of agree with with Oliver",,,,response,2,0,3
123,Farrah,"So I don't know if you wanted someone who thought it was convincing is because I kind of think it's like not, but I think that it will be valuable, but not for a long time",,,,response,2,0,3
123,Teacher, Just because we don't really have anybody there but,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"Yes, yes, it's so you are correct",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher," Currently, like, like you said, as for right now is, you know, not very valuable",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Farrah,Yeah,,,230.3,response,2,0,3
123,Teacher,  Is there enough evidence,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"But do you think perhaps, like you said, perhaps in the future",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher," You know, you know, at least going forward",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher," If it were to have some type of, you know, human habitation there on the surface of the moon with the water become more valuable than for those who live there",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Farrah," It just seems like people, you know, like it would be hard to build it and yeah i i could see",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
123,Farrah, And I just think it will be valuable,,,210.3,response,2,0,3
123,Farrah," You know, long time",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
123,Farrah,"Oh yeah, I think in like, Sure, it could be very valued",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
123,Teacher," Yes, Luis",,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,Fair enough,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
123,Luis," So actually, um, so what I was thinking is that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and, you know, stuff like that",,,110.1,response,2,0,3
123,Luis," Um, and then also, like, you know, water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen",,,110.1,response,2,0,3
123,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,110.1,response,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"You know, we human beings breathe oxygen",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"Yes, was within the actual document in this state that you can split up in between oxygen, hydrogen and oxygen",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher," Luis you were able to sort of, you know, find those key evident that key evidence, very quickly",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher," Chris, you've had your hand up",,,,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,And perhaps hydrogen can be used for rocket fuel for maybe traveling back to earth from the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,that is very good job,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
123,Chris, And we like you know that in the reading,,,,response,2,0,3
123,Chris,"Yeah, I was just gonna say that so water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen",,,,response,2,0,3
123,Chris, It says that,,,,response,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"Yes, yes it",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher, Good job,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher, Chris you Luis are on the same page,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher, Hopefully soon but maybe you know further along in the future,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"You both have come up with the same evidence that perhaps you know like, like you said, if we were able to ever have someone living on the moon",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,2,0,3
123,Teacher,"And that would provide ample reasoning for us to be able to use that water, even if it is barely sparsely spread out to enhance those astronauts and scientists labs there on the moon",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
123,Luis," And so, like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you for",,,,response,2,0,3
123,Luis, I just wanted to thank you for working with us,,,,response,2,0,3
123,Luis, But before we go to lunch,,,,response,2,0,3
123,Luis,"Um, so we have to go to lunch",,,,response,2,0,3
123,Luis,Asking me so much about my dad and it was really fun to talk in this class and share with everybody about like some of my life,,,,response,2,0,3
123,Luis,"And and it was really cool, like you helped us to understand like that we needed to evidence from the text step we were eating and that that was really important",,,,response,2,0,3
123,Luis,And you really asked us to explain ideas like why we thought that something was,,,,response,2,0,3
123,Luis, So thank you so much,,,,response,2,0,3
123,Luis," So I, I feel like really good about class and I'm really excited to like learn some more from you",,,,response,2,0,3
123,Luis,"You know valuable or not valuable and like Farrah and Deb have different ideas then like Chris and I and you really, I'm like, listen to our opinions",,,,response,2,0,3
123,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,3
124,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"Good afternoon, everyone",,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, I hope everyone's having a good day,,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Luis, Like all there is to know about space,,,,response,1,0,2
124,Luis,"Um, yeah, I just was I just wanted to say, I don't think I should be in this group because I already know",,,,response,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"I'm so glad you know a lot about space because we need all the knowledge to help us, especially with these questions that we have today",,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, I'm glad that you brought that up about space because that's why we're here today,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,To talk about the very question is you might remember the question who could read the question that we have,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, Can I get you to read the question,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,Jazmin,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
124,Jazmin,"Reach Every Reader:Okay, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.3,response,1,0,2
124,Teacher, That's a good point,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"Okay, so, and Luis brought up about space and I'm glad that he did that",,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," Okay, so she brought up",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"Because we're talking about the space in the moon, but the reason we're here today is to find out how that we can answer these questions and look deeper into it",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"What equipment did scientists, use to discovered water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,So what I want you to do for just a couple minutes,,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," Look back at that question and I want you to take your pencil and circle or highlight some important words That you feel that are important to you, or something that stands out to you",,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"Even if you have a questoin, like I'm not sure",,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," So this minute, I'm gonna, we're gonna stop for just a minute, take some time and look back that question and circle that okay",,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, This is confusing to me,,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, Miss Teacher what about this word,,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,So go ahead and do that right now,,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, Is that enough does antone need a little bit more time,,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Oliver,I think we're good,,,,response,1,0,2
124,Teacher, It's something that you're concerned about,,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," Oliver, what is something that stood out to you in that question, or even",,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"All right, all right",,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Oliver,"Um, in the question or in the whole text?",,,,response,1,0,2
124,Teacher," What's to that to you about that question, something about it",,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"Let's talk about the question because we're wanting to first look about what they're asking, and then we'll talk about the text and make connections about",,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," First, I want you to look about that question",,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Oliver,Yeah,,,420.1,response,1,0,2
124,Oliver, So what are the things that I circled in the question was basically you know I circled equipment and I'm water,,,420.1,response,1,0,2
124,Oliver," Um, okay",,,420.1,response,1,0,2
124,Teacher,Equipment water,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," Okay, why did you circle equipment",,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Oliver,"Um I circled equipment, because they're asking in the question they're saying what equipment Did the scientists used to discover the water so it seems like the answer would have to be some kind of equipment",,,230.1,response,1,0,2
124,Teacher,Very good for looking deep into your question and in circle in it,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,did anyone else circle equipment,,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"Do you think when you circle that that helps you to bring you back, because you went even deeper because I just asked you, those two words that Oliver used went in deeper and explained a little bit more that he had a connection with the text and it helps you when he circled that",,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"All right, Farrah",,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," Besides, anything else besides equipment",,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"What else did you, sir",,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," Alright, so, Farrah",,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, What else did you circle,,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, All right,,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Farrah,Yes,,,,response,1,0,2
124,Farrah, So what I did was I said equipment and discover,,,,response,1,0,2
124,Teacher, And why did you circle discover,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, All right,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,Discover,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Farrah,Discover because they were asking like you know what I mean like what they found the water like discovers like something that you like found the first time and asking like what equipment found the water,,,230.1,response,1,0,2
124,Teacher,And I'm glad you did that you know what you're doing,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," You're reminding me like when we look into text will become a detective and looking deep into it, just like Oliver and I'm sure to the rest of you",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, We're looking deep into it and you're trying to find out what they discovered,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," Yes, Farrah",,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,just like Luis brought up about space,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, He knows this is not just about equipment but about space,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,And Farrah,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, The same thing discovers like a verb,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, He's looking into it,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
124,Farrah,"I just I just was wondering like, I didn't",,,150.1,response,1,0,2
124,Farrah, I wasn't quite sure why my answer was wrong,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
124,Teacher,When I looked over your answer,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, It wasn't that it wasn't wrong,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, It is what it is,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, There was some great points you brought about it,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, Did you look at discover,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,It's not that it was the wrong answer,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, It could have been a better choice and we're going to get talk about more about that when we're talking just like you brought up discover before when you look at the question,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Farrah, Well I guess,,,130.1,response,1,0,2
124,Farrah," Yeah, I thought about discover just like Oliver I circled equipment and water",,,130.1,response,1,0,2
124,Farrah,I'm I'm mostly focused,,,130.1,response,1,0,2
124,Teacher," You look at equipment you look at microscope and that is an equipment, but we're looking deeper into the question just like today",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,Okay,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, And once you run it,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, You're sitting there were at school,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"All right, because we're looking at what equipment is just like today, sitting in front of you, okay",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,Now we're not scientist and we're not astronauts and there's some things that we do know,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, So what's an equipment you have right now,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," Thats helping you with your work, Chris",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," But right now, you every one of your student at school, right",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Chris, Well that's a good question,,,140.1,response,1,0,2
124,Chris, Oh,,,140.1,response,1,0,2
124,Chris," But I was gonna say first, just real quick because I went to NASA",,,140.1,response,1,0,2
124,Chris,Oh,,,140.1,response,1,0,2
124,Chris,I know that scientists use like lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and I saw that they weren't in the in the reading,,,,response,1,0,2
124,Chris," But if your question about, like, what do we like, we use tablets and we use pencils and paper",,,,response,1,0,2
124,Teacher,And I'm glad you brought that up too about NASA because you know what today when we're learning you're having to use the tablets,,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," Now, just like when they did their research",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"You may have a pencil in front of you, but things are changing",,,140.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, Now in school right and we're learning differently,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," Alright, so let's go back to our question",,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,It's different,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, Some things are different,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," And you guys have done a great job by looking more into this because you can use some of your knowledge that you have, or you've read about NASA to help you with things like this and help our partners",,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"And we talked about equipment we have, like you said, the tablets and pencils",,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, But what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, And I want you to work together right to look more into what you circled what you have that connects to the text in the questions,,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"So what we're gonna do is, I'm going to break up into even smaller groups because I liked the way I looked at some of Olivers and savannas answers",,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, And then I'm going to work with Chris and Jazmin and Luis Okay,,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," Jazmin, what did you circle",,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," All right, so I didn't get to see what Jazmin",,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Jazmin,"In the, in the question?",,,,response,1,0,2
124,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,0,2
124,Jazmin,I circled equipment and discover,,,,response,1,0,2
124,Teacher, And that's I think that's awesome that you're thinking about that and looking at that and again that's a verb,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,Discover great,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, A lot of you are doing it,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher, It's going to connect you back,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher,"When you're looking at a question, you will get where they're asking for",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Teacher," And that's key points every one of you said equipment and they discovered and then a lot yes event Jazmin, sorry",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
124,Jazmin, So thank you so much for working with us,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
124,Jazmin,It's time for the next group,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
124,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,Glad to see you guys today,,,,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,2,0,2
124,Luis,"Um, yeah, I just wanted to remind everybody that my dad is actually an astronaut",,,,response,2,0,2
124,Teacher,"Oh wow, that's awesome information because you know what that can help us out today about learning about the importance",,,110.3,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,Of you guys are going to look back over questions about convincing the evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,"Thank you, Luis, because I know that you can make some great connections about your dad because I know he has shared a lot of information about things that he has done it work",,,110.3,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,"Alright, so let's go ahead and one thing I was looking at every all the responses that everyone had",,,,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher," Alright, so let's first look at the question again",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,And I was very impressed about how everyone took time to look over and look into the text and had some really deep connections they really you really thought about the things that we were asking,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,All right,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher," Can I get Oliver to read the question for us, please",,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
124,Oliver," So it says, um, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon would be valuable",,,120.3,response,2,0,2
124,Oliver,Sure,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
124,Oliver, Okay,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
124,Teacher,"Okay, so what we're going to do right now we're going to use the same strategy that we've been taught before about how important it is to make these connections and find out what the questions asking and help us to go back to the text",,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher," So first, what I want you to do is do before is get your pencil or highlighter and look back over and find an important word or word that you feel you don't understand okay",,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,Okay,,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, Is there anyone here because I want to make sure we understand the question,,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher," One question I want to ask, is there anyone here that in this question that you found that there's a word that you're not sure about what it means",,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,"Okay, I'll start with Jazmin",,,,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, Jazmin,,,,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,What word is there,,,,remark,2,0,2
124,Jazmin," Evidence, what does it mean?",,,,response,2,0,2
124,Jazmin,"I think I know the word, but I just wanted to check",,,,response,2,0,2
124,Teacher,Evidence,,,,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, Okay,,,,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, Raise your hand if you had that word,,,,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, Did anybody else have that word evidence,,,,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, Evidence,,,,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, All right,,,,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,"Okay, let's talk about evidence",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,"What do you think evidence would be, what do you think evidence would be Farrah",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Farrah,Evidence is like in detective stories like it's like how they proove something,,,210.2,response,2,0,2
124,Farrah, So it's like proof,,,210.2,response,2,0,2
124,Teacher,A that is a great response and I love how you made a connection because that helps some of us out a detective,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, Made a connection and we're studying about space and on the moon,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, You made a connection a detective,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,She used like a Luis use that his dad was an astronaut,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher," Like, we're looking for proof, what are we looking for proof for proof of what?",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,And we're going to discover evidence and proof,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, She's exactly right,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, Very good,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher," Alright, so, Jazmin",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Jazmin," Okay, so is there like good proof I guess they're like strong like convincing proof that the water it's valuable and I think it is and I think you could even grow a garden on the moon",,,210.2,response,2,0,2
124,Jazmin,We're looking to see if the if the like,,,210.2,response,2,0,2
124,Teacher,Oh,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher," So, what makes you think you could grow a garden on the moon",,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Jazmin,"Because they talk about the water and they said, like the astronauts could be able to drink the water eventually and and be hydrated and you can't survive without water",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
124,Jazmin,Water to grow plants,,,,response,2,0,2
124,Teacher," So I loved your response, about the word you used, use the word hydrate, did you use hydrate Jazmin, you said it again?",,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, And that's a good connection,,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,Great,,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Jazmin,You can stay hydrated,,,110.2,response,2,0,2
124,Teacher,I like that response because that's something you're proving to me whenever I asked you about the garden,,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,"Did you tell me that our plants need water to survive, is that correct?",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher," What makes you think you could, and you're telling me",,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Jazmin," So if there was water, you could make a garden you could grow it using the water",,,110.2,response,2,0,2
124,Jazmin,Yes,,,110.2,response,2,0,2
124,Teacher,I love that,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher," So again, there you goin back in when you said you didn't understand about that word, I think, you know, more than what you think evidence you just showed me evidence about how to survive",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher," Chris, you also raise your hand about there was concerned about the question",,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, All right,,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher," All right, is there anything we have here, right",,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, There are some words that you weren't sure about,,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, Was it the same word evidence or did you have a different one,,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,We need water to survive,,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Chris,"Oh yeah, it was mostly the same word evidence",,,420.1,response,2,0,2
124,Chris," And I was thinking that, like, basically",,,420.1,response,2,0,2
124,Chris," Well, I think the evidence is good because water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen plus water so heavy",,,420.1,response,2,0,2
124,Chris, They don't have to carry it in ships anymore,,,420.1,response,2,0,2
124,Teacher,I thought that was a great idea to be you,,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher,How did you know that water's heavy,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher, Look at that,,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Teacher," I'm glad you looked at that detail about hearing the shoes, because it's heavy",,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
124,Chris, And I could tell you that water is like one of the heaviest things they have to carry on a spaceship,,,230.1,response,2,0,2
124,Chris,"Oh well, cuz okay so I actually knew already because, um, well I guess they said it in the reading, but they but like I knew that because I visited NASA and I know all about NASA",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
124,Teacher,"I bet Luis could confirm that about his dad probably has told him too, right Luis?",,,110.3,remark,2,0,2
124,Luis,Yeah,,,110.3,response,2,0,2

125,Teacher, Thank you,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher, Now I did notice Farrah and Oliver had the same response,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, so that sounds good",,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher, So let's go back and look at our responses here,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher, So which one of you would like to explain your response,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher," I see you, I see your hand",,,,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, so, man",,,,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,0,0,2
125,Farrah," So basically, I said that, um, that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I guess what I mean is that, like, in paragraph three, it talks about how you have to be able to use the microscope to even see the water",,,,response,0,0,2
125,Farrah,Yes,,,,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher,Okay,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher," and Oliver, is that where you found your evidence as well?",,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher," And so that's very good, Farrah",,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
125,Oliver," You can't like find it, I guess, unless you can see it",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
125,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
125,Oliver," Um, I think adding to Farrahs answer like I think that you have to use the microscope to see it",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
125,Oliver, So I pretty much have the same place and the same idea,,,230.2,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher, They're using a microscope to see the water,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,So you both are on the right track here in the equipment,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, so they they can't see it without the microscope",,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher," Now, how do you think they originally were able to get the water though? Remember we're seeing how they discovered water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher, Okay,,,420.3,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,Now let's let's go a little further back on our texts and see if we can maybe go a little deeper into how they originally discovered it,,,420.3,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher, Would you like to maybe give it another go,,,420.3,remark,0,0,2
125,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,420.3,response,0,0,2
125,Oliver, So should I go back and read?,,,420.3,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"You, why don't you go ahead you and Farrah, why don't you go ahead and take a moment to read back again starting from paragraph one and see if you can underline what they use to discover water on the moon",,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,And then while you're doing that,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher," Can I hear from some of the people that haven't talked about what about Chris or Jazmin, and when you tell me what  what you read",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher," First, so you were, you're gonna put your hand up",,,,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, let's hear from Jazmin, you were, you were putting your head at hand and let me hear from you",,,,remark,0,0,2
125,Jazmin,Basically what I learned was that that they sent a small machine up to the moon,,,,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher, And where did you see that at?,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, they sent a small machine",,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
125,Jazmin," And I'm wondering, like, what might be wrong about my answer",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
125,Jazmin,"It's in paragraph two, and actually I have a question about that",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
125,Jazmin, So I knew that we're all working together to try to improve our answers,,,230.2,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher, Do you think sometimes maybe it's we can be a little more specific,,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, so when we answer something",,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher, That way there's no confusion,,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"So you, how do you think if we took your answer",,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher, They send a small machine which your correctly did what else how could we make that a little more clear for somebody if they had no idea what you're talking about,,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
125,Jazmin,Like if we could say what the machine is that's like being used,,,210.3,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher,Okay,,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher," So we could say what machine is and what, what was the machine here that was being used?",,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
125,Jazmin,Machine was the lunar orbiter,,,210.3,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher, So why don't you go ahead and circle that and then I'm going to come back to you in just a moment,,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher," Let me hear from Chris Chris, what were you gonna say",,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"OK, so the machine was the Lunar Orbiter",,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
125,Chris," So like I guess I'm wondering, like, is that I guess that's not the answer, but didn't they have to use that stuff to find the water?",,,110.4,response,0,0,2
125,Chris,"Okay, so basically, I was gonna say, kind of like, I guess, kind of like what Luis said before, like I went to NASA with my dad and like I know that scientists have to use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and all that kind of stuff",,,110.4,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher," So maybe there was there's probably more than just one thing used to find this water,",,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, you know what, Chris I",,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"but oftentimes when we're asked a question, we Want to come to the best answer, we can possibly give or the most clear and simplest answer, which in this case, Jazmin was just saying it is in paragraph two, but like you said, you said you went on a trip to NASA with your father",,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher, That sounds like a good point,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"So I think that means you probably have a lot, you could share with the rest of the group about some of your experience with NASA and maybe we could talk about that here in a little bit and you could tell us some more interesting facts",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
125,Chris,"Okay, yeah, that sounds great",,,110.3,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher, Okay,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, so maybe you and Luis could be our two leaders when it comes to some of the having a little more knowledge about space",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
125,Luis,"Yeah, awesome",,,110.3,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher, Have you guys finished I'm rereading the the passage?,,,,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"Now, why don't we come back to Oliver and Farrah",,,,remark,0,0,2
125,Oliver,On yeah we get that we checked and kind of read through everything,,,,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, you read through everything Farrah you as well?",,,,remark,0,0,2
125,Farrah,Yeah,,,,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, and what, what did you find what what do you like to share together as a group",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
125,Farrah,"Well, I guess we were listening to, as you were saying this stuff with with Jazmin",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
125,Farrah," So I guess the, the difference is like what's the best answer",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
125,Farrah,"And like I guess you like you said you have to, you have to find the water before you can use the microscope to see the water so they couldn't have used the microscope to discover the water unless they unless they knew it was there",,,,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher," So they had to discover it first, before they could use the microphone",,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,Exactly,,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, so, and Oliver did you agree with Farrah",,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
125,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
125,Oliver," No, I agree, and I think that makes sense to me",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher, So then that is why sometimes when we're looking at questions we got to be really careful because sometimes they'll try to trick you,,,420.1,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, well I'm very glad to hear",,,420.1,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher," now Jazmin, what's your question?",,,420.1,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher, But you got to be clever and make sure you watch out and make sure you're looking for what could be the best answer you can give,,,420.1,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher,By throwing in a little something that could be the answer,,,420.1,remark,0,0,2
125,Jazmin,"So actually we have to go to lunch here in just a moment, but I wanted to thank you for working with us, and especially I wanted to thank you so much for really having us work with each other and having a sort of think through our answers ourselves",,,420.1,response,0,0,2
125,Jazmin,Sometimes our science teacher says that we give him stress hives and you were so patient with us and also,,,,response,0,0,2
125,Jazmin, So it just to thank you for doing that,,,,response,0,0,2
125,Jazmin,"Sometimes we don't necessarily get along, as a group, but you really encourage us to like work with each other and listen to each other's answers and then come to like a better answer ourselves",,,,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher,"Now, thank you Jazmin and thank all of you",,,,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher, And I think that we're going to get through this together and we're going to do great things in science here,,,,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher, I think you're all great students,,,,remark,0,0,2
125,Jazmin,Reach Every Reader:Sounds good,,,,response,0,0,2
125,Jazmin, Okay,,,,response,0,0,2
125,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,0,2
125,Teacher," Okay, it's good to see everyone",,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"Hi, good afternoon everyone",,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, Looks like Luis has a question,,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,It looks like right here as we get started,,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, What's your question,,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Luis, So I don't think I have to be in this group,,,,response,1,0,2
125,Luis," I, I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,2
125,Luis,"Um, well, it's actually more like a comment",,,,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher," So, what makes you think that you wouldn't want to be part of this group, though",,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, so I Luis so you think are you know a lot about space",,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Luis," Um, so you wanted to talk to us",,,230.1,response,1,0,2
125,Luis,"Well, cuz you know when you're working with us because we we didn't have the right answer",,,230.1,response,1,0,2
125,Luis, So I feel like I kind of know everything,,,230.1,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher, Don't you think that would make it even better for you to be in this group to help the rest of us,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"If you think you have a, you know, if you know a lot about space",,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, And maybe we could learn from each other,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
125,Luis,"That's a good point, okay I'll stick around",,,110.3,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher,So that sounds very good,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher," So, would anyone like to open up with what they thought as far as their response to the first discussion question",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"All right, let's start with okay we got a couple hands going up",,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, How about we start with Farrah,,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Farrah,"Okay, so basically my answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close",,,,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, so that's, that's right",,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, So you said that you would need a microscope to look really closely,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"So I appreciate that you, when looking at the text you notice that the scientists use the microscope",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"Do you think if we went back to the text, could we find anything else that scientists might have used when they were discovering wonder on the moon? Any other equipment",,,120.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Farrah," Okay, so we should look for I should look for more equipment?",,,120.1,response,1,0,2
125,Farrah,"Yeah, because we could",,,120.1,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher, I think for us to build on your answer,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, We'd have a complete full answer to that question,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher," I think if we go back into the text and we look for any mention of equipment, that scientists have used and we underline that that we could then build on your answer",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, So you have a good start,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,I think so,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Farrah,"Okay, I'll take a look",,,420.2,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"And then I noticed the moment ago, we had a couple other hands that are up, I believe it was on Chris and Jazmin have what we hear from Chris first and then we'll let Jazmin chime in",,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Chris,"Um, yeah, okay",,,,response,1,0,2
125,Chris, So basically what I was thinking is like that scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, so you noticed the mention of craters and so with water on the moon",,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, Scientists found on the moon,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"Now I think when we go back and we read, look at this passage I would like for you to pay close attention to the amount of water",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,Teacher:And then also I would like you,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, So can you read back the question for me,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, We need to relook at the question and we need to reevaluate that question,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
125,Chris, What equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,response,1,0,2
125,Chris,Yeah okay,,,120.3,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher, Very good,,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, so what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"You might have made an observation about the scientists finding craters, which is very good that you're noticing the craters, and that's where the water is",,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,But if we when we answer a question we want to be really careful that we're answering the right question,,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"It might be great to build our knowledge and answer questions that might not even be asked but when it comes to being a successful student, especially on any other tests that you might have from other teachers",,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, We want to make sure that we're looking at the question that's being asked and that we're addressing just that in our response,,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Chris,"So yeah, so like the equipment, not the not about, so what should be the answer right?",,,420.1,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"Yes, yes",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, If we stick to that question and we can save the extra information for discussions like when we're having right now,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher," And so, and usually it's best when we, when we answer a question if we just",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Chris, Okay,,,420.2,response,1,0,2
125,Chris,Cool,,,420.2,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher, Thank you very much,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher," We'll check in with Oliver, to see what he's thinking",,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, Chris for sharing,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, So thank you,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, And then after her,,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"Let's uh, let's see, I think, Jazmin was done with their hand up earlier",,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, Thank you for contributing,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, so thank",,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Jazmin,"I said that NASA sent a small machine and but I was wondering like why my answer was wrong, because it seems like the right answer",,,110.1,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher, So I appreciate that you care To get the correct answer,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"So that's very that's, that's very good to ask so you you are you're seeking to know why your answer was wrong",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,but do you think we could be a little bit more specific in our response as because there are lots of small machines in the world right,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,So you you are partially correct so you're right in the sense that NASA did send a small machine,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Jazmin,Yeah,,,130.1,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher, If we go back into the text,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,I but I think NASA,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher," We can see the, the type of small machine that they sent and so we can give that a name, so that when we respond to the question we're being specific with our answer",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher," While that might be correct, that is that's broad in the sense that a small machine could be anything from a cell phone to a toaster",,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, We want to see what they say,,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, So we want,,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,Because if I just say NASA sent a small Machine,,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Jazmin, The Lunar Orbiter,,,410.2,response,1,0,2
125,Jazmin,"I think I know I think I was just, I know what this machine was so is the answer",,,410.2,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"Yeah, so that's that's the small machine",,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"and then do you remember from the text, what the lunar orbiter what it was doing",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, They sent,,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
125,Jazmin, That's what discovered it because it was investigating,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
125,Jazmin,When I looked at it I sadi it investigated because it's small machine,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher," And then we said, Okay, this is, this is what that machine was",,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, I appreciate how you build your answer we got more specific,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, So we went,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher," So, so you built off your answer",,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,Yes,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher," Okay, so you're right, it's exactly correct",,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher," We narrowed down to that core of knowledge, we're looking for",,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, And this is what it was doing,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"So thank you Jazmin,  Chris looks like he has his hand up that I do want to hear from Oliver so Chris, you have something you want to jump in with before I hear from them",,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Chris,"Yeah, I just, I did check on the the text and what I saw was, you know, when I was looking at it",,,,response,1,0,2
125,Chris," I guess I was wondering, like But I've been the NASA",,,,response,1,0,2
125,Chris, I guess I was wondering like why that's not the answer?,,,,response,1,0,2
125,Chris,So I know that like your scientists and astronauts use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"Right, so that's a good point",,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, And you've seen lots of equipment that different astronauts and NASA scientists use,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, So you said you've been to NASA,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, So I do want to address that,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"To address Chris question, I would just like to clarify",,,210.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher," So when we talk about NASA here were first of all two things, you know, we're talking specifically about the scientists here",,,210.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher," So not just not just astronauts that might be actually exploring space, physically, but also the scientist on the ground",,,210.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, It says what equipment that scientists and then can you finish the question,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher," And we're looking specifically at the equipment, if we if we pay close attention to the question I want you to read after me",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"Back, here on earth",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Chris,"Yeah okay so what equipment that scientists use to discover, oh!",,,210.2,response,1,0,2
125,Chris,What equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher,So we're looking for specific equipment and equipment is doing what Harrion?,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher," And much like with Jazmin earlier, we're just, we're trying to we're looking at that question",,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,"Okay, again, so",,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, And we're specifically boiling it down to just its core components,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
125,Chris,That equipment is discovering the water on the moon,,,510.1,response,1,0,2
125,Teacher, So we all get a chance to speak here,,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher," And now, finally, I haven't heard from Oliver yet",,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,I,,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher,Exactly,,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher, It's discovering water on the moon,,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
125,Teacher," So let's, let's hear from them",,,,remark,1,0,2
125,Oliver,"So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us",,,,response,1,0,2
126,Farrah,"Um, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,1,1
126,Oliver,I circled the same thing as Farrah,,,,response,0,1,1
126,Chris,Scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,,response,0,1,1

126,Teacher,"Good, how are you",,,,remark,0,1,1
126,Farrah, We're trying to figure out the answer to this question,,,,response,0,1,1
126,Farrah,We're doing well,,,,response,0,1,1
126,Luis," I'm just wondering, I already know all about space, like, I don't think I need to be in this group",,,,response,0,1,1
126,Luis,"Yeah, and I, I have a question",,,,response,0,1,1
126,Luis, I don't need any help with anything,,,,response,0,1,1
126,Teacher, And I want to have help you have a better understanding of space and exactly why there is water on the moon,,,220.1,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher,So the reason why we're looking back over your answers,,,220.1,remark,0,1,1
126,Luis, Okay,,,220.1,response,0,1,1
126,Luis,Okay,,,220.1,response,0,1,1
126,Luis," Well, that sounds",,,220.1,response,0,1,1

126,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher, I would appreciate it,,,,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher,"So we, we read the text",,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher, Did everybody understand the text water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher,Everybody understand?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher,So our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher,And we all gave really good answers,,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher,"When we look back over the text in paragraph two, um, what, what did it say we're looking for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
126,Jazmin,"Um, I can answer, well basically in paragraph two it says NASA send to small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
126,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,1,1
126,Jazmin,Do you want me to read anymore?,,,,response,0,1,1
126,Teacher,"No, I think that's okay",,,,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher,So what,,,,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher, What did it do?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher,That's one type of equipment,,,230.2,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher, What else did they do with the equipment,,,230.2,remark,0,1,1
126,Jazmin,"Well, they used it to like go and look for ice deposits in the polar craters and that's where they found them",,,230.2,response,0,1,1
126,Teacher,"Good job, Jazmin",,,110.1,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,0,1,1
126,Farrah, I don't really understand,,,,response,0,1,1
126,Farrah,"Yes, so I was kind of wondering like, why, my answer is, is really right or my it might be wrong",,,,response,0,1,1
126,Teacher,"So your, your answer is not wrong",,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher, Does that help you understand more,,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher," I'm in paragraph three, it talks about that the water they found us microscopic meaning that you wouldn't be able to see it",,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher, So I think that's where you were thinking that you would need a tool walk a microscope to see those types of things on the moon,,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
126,Farrah, I need them,,,110.2,response,0,1,1
126,Farrah,"I think so, like, do I need to",,,110.2,response,0,1,1
126,Farrah, They need the microscope to see the water or can they see it in another way,,,110.2,response,0,1,1
126,Teacher,"they they use the small machine, the Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,120.3,remark,0,1,1
126,Farrah,Okay,,,120.3,response,0,1,1
126,Teacher,Chris?,,,,remark,0,1,1
126,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,1,1
126,Chris," Okay, so like basically I think Luis's thing about like, well, like he said before, like",,,,response,0,1,1
126,Chris,Um scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and all that stuff,,,,response,0,1,1
126,Chris," Like, I, I've been to NASA with my dad and like it was definitely um",,,,response,0,1,1
126,Chris," They had the boots and like the oxygen tanks and all this stuff like, um, do you think that like I guess I'm wondering like why that might not be right",,,,response,0,1,1
126,Chris,They had like all that equipment they have like the shuttle,,,,response,0,1,1
126,Teacher,Why it might not be right for what we're talking about right now?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
126,Chris,"Yeah, like why that's not like the answer",,,150.1,response,0,1,1
126,Teacher," NASA does use all types of equipment that these boots, they have special, special articles of clothing that they were, but some some things like the the oxygen tanks those on they use for different things",,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher," So those things, they might use like when they're exploring space around space missions, but for this, they're talking about a machine that they use to find out about, to find out about the ice deposits",,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
126,Teacher,"So, you are correct",,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
126,Chris,"Okay, that makes sense",,,130.1,response,0,1,1

126,Teacher,Let's great Luis Maybe you can share some,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,Some ideas with us about the article,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Luis,Okay,,,150.1,response,1,1,1
126,Teacher,we had our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,"Okay, so I'm happy that y'all are all here today and I was looking over your responses",,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,And so I love that y'all are all thinking about the story and are using,,,310.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,but I want to dig a little bit deeper into the question and let's figure out exactly what they're talking about and see a we can expand on some of the ideas that y'all,,,220.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,"Using the text to help support your answers,",,,310.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, Write down for your answers,,,220.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,"Okay, so our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,"Um, what is the question asking us",,,120.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Luis,"Um,",,,120.2,response,1,1,1
126,Luis,It's asking what equipment do they use to discover water on the moon,,,,response,1,1,1
126,Teacher,"Okay, that's the question",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, And so,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, Does everyone here know what the word equipment means,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Farrah,Okay,,,210.2,response,1,1,1
126,Farrah," Oh yeah, because we will use equipment in PE class",,,210.2,response,1,1,1
126,Teacher,"Okay, that's one type of equipment anyone else know about another type of equipment",,,130.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Jazmin,We also use it in science class to,,,130.2,response,1,1,1
126,Teacher,Correct,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, Those are all types of equipment,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, And so what about the word discover,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, Do we all know what the word discover means,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Chris,I think discover is like,,,210.2,response,1,1,1
126,Chris,When you find something,,,,response,1,1,1
126,Teacher, So our question is asking what equipment did scientists use to find water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,Excellent Harris and that is when you find something,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,Everyone agree,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,"Okay, so look",,,,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, And that's okay,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1

126,Teacher,Yep,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, Okay,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher," Um,",,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, I know that some of y'all had some of the same answers and then some of your answers was a little bit deeper,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, So we're looking over your responses,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,"So when looking at the paragraph, um,",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,I know that there are two words that,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,Students get confused and that's microscope and so microscope is a top of tool that we use to see different,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, And then there's the word microscopic and microscopic just means that it's something that you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking right at it,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher," So, Farrah",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,Different objects,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, Yes,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Farrah, And my answer,,,210.4,response,1,1,1
126,Farrah, So I don't understand why my answers wrong,,,210.4,response,1,1,1
126,Farrah,I use the microscope,,,210.4,response,1,1,1
126,Farrah, It's just that some answers are,,,110.2,response,1,1,1
126,Farrah,So no one's answer is wrong,,,110.2,response,1,1,1
126,Teacher,That we need to expand upon some of the answers,,,210.3,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, Did you have a question or a response,,,,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, Damn,,,,remark,1,1,1
126,Oliver,"Well, I was gonna say about the microscope and I'm so when i thought i thought was the right answer, because they talk about the microscope and the water in that paragraph",,,,response,1,1,1
126,Teacher, The difference is the microscope is the tool that they use to see the microscopic pieces so microscope is the tool that they use,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,They do talk about the microscope and the water in that paragraph,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher," And then microscopic is the, um,",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,The ice,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, It's a form of the microscopic ice,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Oliver,Okay,,,210.4,response,1,1,1
126,Teacher,So when we look at our paragraph,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,If we're looking at paragraph,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,Three,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher," No, excuse me, paragraph to",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, These deposits are very small,,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,It talks about that,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,NASA sent this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for US Department posits in a large polar crater,,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,"And then in paragraph three, it says that means the moon is still drier than the dress desert on Earth",,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher," The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it, you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
126,Jazmin,"Okay, well I got my answer from paragraph to I don't know what's wrong with mine",,,120.3,response,1,1,1
126,Teacher,But nothing's wrong with your paragraph,,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,We just want to be able to give the best answer,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, So looking in the text,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher," Where could we are, what could we add",,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, So I would like for you to tell a little bit more about the small machine,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, You said NASA send a small machine,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,And so your answer,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,To expand,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,"Do you, do you see the name I'm looking through the paragraph",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,And give more details what top of small machine was it,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
126,Jazmin,I'm looking,,,210.4,response,1,1,1

126,Teacher,I had a great time there as well,,,140.1,remark,1,1,1
126,Jazmin,"OK, I see it says that NASA scientists small machine called a lunar orbiter",,,140.1,response,1,1,1
126,Teacher,A lunar orbiter,,,110.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,What did the lunar orbiter do,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,Excellent,,,110.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, So NASA see the machine and it's called a winner orbiter,,,110.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Jazmin,Investigated,,,210.4,response,1,1,1
126,Teacher,Investigated,,,110.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,So we know the lunar orbiter investigated what did it investigate,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Luis,"I'm all right there says, and I was looking for ice deposits and a large polar crater",,,210.4,response,1,1,1
126,Teacher,"Okay, so it looked for ice deposits in a large",,,110.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Luis,Crater,,,110.4,response,1,1,1
126,Teacher,Polar crater,,,110.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, Okay,,,110.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,"So, um,",,,,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher, It's in the large polar crater,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,They saw the US deposit,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,What details that it gave about they asked deposits,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Oliver,"Oh, it set of eyes deposits were really small",,,210.4,response,1,1,1
126,Teacher,So they were really small,,,110.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,"Um,",,,,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,So they use the Lord the Lunar Orbiter to to to,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,Investigate and they found asked deposits that were really small,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher," Oh, yes, Dan",,,,remark,1,1,1

126,Teacher,"Okay, that sounds great will work next time own",,,,remark,1,1,1
126,Teacher,Figuring out what equipment decide to choose to discover water on the moon,,,,remark,1,1,1
126,All,"Okay, bye",,,,,1,1,1
126,Teacher,Hello everyone,,,,remark,2,1,1

126,Luis,I got it,,,,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"Okay, so what we went before we went to lunch we were talking about our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,So anything,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher, Would you like to share,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1

126,Luis,"Yeah, yeah",,,120.4,response,2,1,1
126,Luis,The sentence in a second paragraph,,,,response,2,1,1
126,Luis,And so now I think the answer is NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ice deposit,,,,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher,So I think,,,,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"I think that's a wonderful response, um,",,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"I just, I would like to build more upon your answer",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"So,",,,,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Luis Luis said that NASA sent the Lunar Orbiter to discover,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Faster gate to investigate,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Luis,Asked about because that's what it says on a story,,,110.1,response,2,1,1
126,Luis,"Okay, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbit to investigate and then I added ice deposits from the next sentence",,,,response,2,1,1
126,Luis,You see how I thought,,,,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher,I do and I think you're doing a good job putting that together,,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,1

126,Teacher,What I would like for you to try,,,,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Is I'm,,,,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Reading,,,,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Trying to get my paper to pull up I'm,,,,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,So I would like for you to read the third paragraph so we all to each go and read the third paragraph and see if we can expand upon Luis's answer that he gave us,,,420.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Jazmin," The right answer, because they don't talk about the learner or pioneer in the third paragraph",,,420.3,response,2,1,1
126,Jazmin,To confuse the Lunar Orbiter,,,420.3,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher," They don't talk about the lunar orbiter in the third paragraph, but we have Luis's answer",,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"Jazmin, you are correct",,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher, So I just want us to expand and think a little bit more,,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,That he gave us,,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,We know that we have the Lunar Orbiter and that it's used to,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,That that NASA is using this to form the ice deposits,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"Or to investigate the ice deposits, but",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"I want to talk about, like, I want to challenge you to look and read about the size of the US deposits",,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Jazmin,Okay,,,150.1,response,2,1,1
126,Farrah,This is kind of like with this is where I got my answer from,,,,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher,You did you had that they used,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,That they use a scientific tool called a microscope,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Farrah,"Oh,",,,110.1,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"And they did use a scientific tool called a microscope, but the microscope",,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher, What did it show us,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Farrah,All it showed us,,,210.3,response,2,1,1
126,Farrah,"The water they found is microscopic being you want people to see if you were looking straight at, okay, so you can't see it, you need a scientific tool called microscope to look through the closely",,,,response,2,1,1
126,Farrah, So you need it to look at the water,,,,response,2,1,1
126,Farrah,"Okay, so you need the microscope to look at the water and we know that the water is what",,,,response,2,1,1
126,Farrah,"Oh,",,,,response,2,1,1
126,Farrah,Microscopic,,,,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher, So what does microscopic mean what does it tell us,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Microscopic,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Farrah,"That is really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really small",,,210.4,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher, We can't see it with our,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1

126,Teacher,Correct,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher, And that what the story tells us,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher, Okay,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher," So let's think about putting all of these things that we know together, we know that we're going to use the microscope to look at the microscopic us",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Yeah,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher, We know that the,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher, So we're going to put all of this together,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"Right, that we found on the moon",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Luis said the Lunar Orbiter,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher, Does anybody remember what it was used to do,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Was used,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Oliver,To investigate ice,,,210.4,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"OK, so the lunar orbiter was used to investigate",,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,The water,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,And it was in what form,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Chris," You know, I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024",,,210.4,response,2,1,1
126,Chris,It was in the form of ice,,,210.4,response,2,1,1
126,Chris,"Yeah, okay",,,110.1,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher,So going back to answer our question,,,120.2,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Let's work together to create a sentence to answer that,,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,So why don't we try starting our CNS with we know we all agree that is the Lunar Orbiter,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Maybe,,,,remark,2,1,1
126,Jazmin, I'm trying to think,,,,response,2,1,1
126,Jazmin, I'm still kind of confused,,,,response,2,1,1
126,Jazmin,"Yeah, yeah",,,,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher, Let's see,,,230.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"Okay, so what's confusing you Jazmin",,,230.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,If we can call her,,,,remark,2,1,1

126,Jazmin, I don't know how to do that,,,,response,2,1,1
126,Jazmin,I'm confused,,,,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"That that is a, um, sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together",,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher," And it's called summarizing, so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer",,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"So when we look at, paragraph two,",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher, What was it called,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,We know that NASA sent the small machine,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Jazmin,The Lunar,,,210.4,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Okay,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher, The Lunar Orbiter and what's the lunar orbiter going to do,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Luis,Investigate ice deposits,,,210.4,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"OK, so the lunar orbiter is going to investigate the US deposits",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher, And then if you look in at then at the next,,,120.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Okay,,,120.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,The third and fourth sentence is that information that we really know to answer need to know to answer this question,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"Know, so sometimes we have to realize that when we're looking for answers that just because it's in the paragraph that that might be information that we don't need to answer this question",,,420.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,"Okay, so we know that NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Ever end the end we're going to look at the next paragraph and so,,,120.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,We know that the water they found it was what,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Oliver,I was microscopic,,,210.4,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher,It was my first scoffing,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1

126,Teacher,"We would, we would say",,,130.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,The Lunar Orbiter,,,130.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher, What does it do was,,,130.3,remark,2,1,1
126,Oliver,orbiter was arm,,,130.3,response,2,1,1

126,Chris,Me,,,210.4,response,2,1,1
126,Chris,On the moon,,,,response,2,1,1
126,Chris, So we're going to try to put all of our pieces together,,,,response,2,1,1
126,Chris, Now to answer our question,,,,response,2,1,1
126,Teacher, I don't have a whiteboard that I can write it out,,,,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher," OK, so the lunar orbiter was used to",,,,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,So bad,,,,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher," Okay, that would be great",,,,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,Come right,,,,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher, So we got the Lunar Orbiter,,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,So let's work on formulate this sentence together,,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
126,Teacher,And it was what did it do,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
126,Jazmin,It investigated,,,210.4,response,2,1,1

127,Teacher,"Um, can you expand on maybe your answer of a small machine",,,230.1,remark,0,0,4
127,Jazmin,"Okay, so basically it's like the thing that they sent up to the moon to go in and like to find the water",,,230.1,response,0,0,4
127,Teacher, What is it called,,,230.1,remark,0,0,4

127,Teacher,What do you know about microscopes,,,230.1,remark,0,0,4
127,Luis,"Um, so microscopes are like these things that you use to like study something closely, like if if something's really small, then you like look at it that way",,,230.1,response,0,0,4
127,Teacher,How is it used on the moon,,,230.1,remark,0,0,4
127,Luis,"Um,",,,230.1,response,0,0,4
127,Luis,"Well, I guess I don't really know exactly how it's used on the moon, but I'm kind of imagining like you know, like maybe people look through it",,,,response,0,0,4
127,Teacher,Yes,,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher," Maybe, Farrah, do you think you can help out Luis?",,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
127,Farrah," Um, I actually was thinking that the microscope is is probably the the tool that they use to discover water on the moon, but it seems like that answers not right",,,130.2,response,0,0,4
127,Farrah,Um sure,,,130.2,response,0,0,4
127,Farrah, I'm a little confused about why,,,130.2,response,0,0,4

127,Teacher, So what is the question we're trying to answer,,,120.3,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher,So let's look back at the text,,,120.3,remark,0,0,4
127,Farrah,The question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,response,0,0,4
127,Teacher,"and Jazmin, what did you say that small machine was called again",,,120.4,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher, So we've talked about a couple things we talked about a microscope and we've talked about a small machine,,,230.3,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher,"Perfect, perfect",,,230.3,remark,0,0,4
127,Jazmin,It's called a lunar orbiter,,,120.4,response,0,0,4
127,Teacher,Perfect,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher," First, the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher, So I guess back to Farrahs question,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher, So which one do you want to focus on,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher," So how, so we've identified the equipment",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher, How do they use this equipment to look and discover water,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
127,Farrah,I'm interested in the microscope,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
127,Teacher,"Okay, so if we go back and we look in the text",,,120.3,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher," Do you, can you guys see the text",,,120.3,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher, Okay,,,120.3,remark,0,0,4

127,,"That okay, the third paragraph?",,,,,0,0,4
127,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,0,4
127,Oliver," The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it, even if you were looking straight at it, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,0,4
127,Oliver,"Okay, um third paragraph that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth",,,,response,0,0,4
127,Teacher,"Good job, Oliver",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher," So what in that paragraph Farrah, what is that telling us about the microscope?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher, Good job,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
127,Farrah,Like that the microscope,,,210.4,response,0,0,4

127,Teacher,Perfect,,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher, What does that tell you about the water,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher,And if you need a microscope to see the water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
127,Farrah,It's really small,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
127,Teacher,So what does that tell you about the water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher,Is there a lot of it,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
127,Farrah,"No, I guess not a lot, cuz it um yeah I guess there's not a lot because there's just a little bit to see",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
127,Teacher, Does anyone have any questions about the microscope because that's one of our equipment,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher,Perfect,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4

127,Chris, And like all this stuff,,,120.4,response,0,0,4
127,Chris,"And like I definitely saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that, like Luis was saying",,,,response,0,0,4
127,Chris," So like, do you think they use those things",,,,response,0,0,4
127,Teacher,"That is such a great comment, and it's really great that you're able to tie that in with a real world experience and I would think that they definitely use those things on the moon",,,310.1,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher,"But I don't think that they necessarily, this articles necessarily focusing on those things just because it's focusing more on the moon's climate, rather than specific equipment on the moon",,,410.2,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher, Did you see anything about the moon being like a desert when you were with your dad,,,140.1,remark,0,0,4
127,Teacher,"The question asked about the equipment, but the article is talking about how the moon is like a desert",,,140.1,remark,0,0,4
127,Chris,I'm not really like that wasn't really what was in the exhibit that was that was from like reading,,,140.1,response,0,0,4

127,Teacher,"Okay, good job",,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher, So you're talking about some equipment that they needed or that you knew happen on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,"So, um, do you know anything about a lunar orbiter",,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
127,Luis," And I'm like, it flies around the moon orbits and and it studies the moon from from or is",,,210.2,response,1,0,4
127,Luis,"Um, I know that it's something that like basically goes up to the moon",,,210.2,response,1,0,4
127,Teacher,"This pretty good, but that is definitely one of the lunar orbiter does",,,110.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,Um Let's have someone else talk for a second if anyone has their hand raised,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,1,0,4

127,Farrah,"Well, I don't really know very much about like",,,120.4,response,1,0,4
127,Farrah,This is the first time I like learning about it,,,,response,1,0,4
127,Teacher," So, based on what Luis just read about a lunar orbiter",,,130.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,"Oh, okay",,,130.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher," According to paragraph two, what does it do, again, what's the second sentence say",,,120.3,remark,1,0,4

127,Teacher,Is can you imagine,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,The Lunar Orbiter landing at the moon South Pole and basically looking around for this water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
127,Farrah,"Yeah, I can imagine",,,210.4,response,1,0,4
127,Farrah," I guess I'm still kind of use, like by my answer is wrong because like i think that the lunar orbiter had to use the microscope to be able to see the water find",,,210.4,response,1,0,4
127,Teacher," Can anyone help Farrah, find the paragraph that a microscope is mentioned in Oliver",,,130.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher," So, do you know what paragraph or",,,130.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,But let's see what the point of a microscope is according to the article,,,130.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,"Yeah, that's a really good question and the Lunar Orbiter, it wouldn't need the microscope",,,130.1,remark,1,0,4
127,Oliver," If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a my first go to look really closely",,,130.2,response,1,0,4
127,Oliver, So the paragraph,,,130.2,response,1,0,4
127,Oliver," Let's see, they say in the last paragraph, paragraph three, and they say that the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it",,,130.2,response,1,0,4
127,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,130.2,response,1,0,4
127,Oliver, OK,,,130.2,response,1,0,4
127,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher, And so,,,,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,"Based on what you just read what do you think about the, what is the point of the microscope",,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
127,Oliver," Um, and, like, look at it really closely",,,210.4,response,1,0,4
127,Oliver,"Um, well, it looks like the microscope is there to study the water",,,210.4,response,1,0,4
127,Oliver,"I guess I kind of think the same thing I Farrah, like how could they find the water",,,,response,1,0,4
127,Oliver,If they can't see it,,,,response,1,0,4
127,Teacher,So you're partially right when you kind of say that the,,,130.1,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,"Microscope is used to discover water, but the article is thinking more in general of what equipment would be used along with the microscope",,,410.1,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,So what are you thinking Chris,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher, I haven't heard much from you,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
127,Chris, So I know that like scientists use up like equipment like masks and suits like stuff like even said so,,,120.4,response,1,0,4
127,Chris,"Okay, I have been to NASA with my dad",,,120.4,response,1,0,4
127,Teacher,I guess that's kind of,,,,remark,1,0,4
127,Chris,What I'm thinking about,,,,response,1,0,4
127,Teacher,Are masks and suits mentioned anywhere in the article,,,230.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Chris,"No, that's just what I kind of knew",,,230.2,response,1,0,4
127,Teacher,Before the Arctic,,,,remark,1,0,4

127,Teacher, You can bring in your prior knowledge to the article sort of like Luis,,,310.1,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,"So,",,,,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher," So to answer your question, Farrah and deaf so far",,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,Whenever we're talking about the equipment that scientists use the key word in this question is to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,It's not the question is not asking necessarily about,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,The way they found the water because the water is very small,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher, The key word is,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher, It's asking the machine or the equipment that is used to discover the water,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,"Discover a microscope helps you study the water, whereas the lunar orbiter helps you",,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,Discover the water,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,"Jazmin, what are you thinking",,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
127,Teacher,What are you thinking for number two,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
127,Jazmin,"Number two, which is, which one do you mean number",,,120.4,response,1,0,4
127,Teacher,Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,1,0,4
127,," But unfortunately, we have to go to my next",,,120.2,,1,0,4
127,, Thank you,,,120.2,,1,0,4
127,, Thank you so much for working with it,,,120.2,,1,0,4
127,,"Oh, we can possibly answer that",,,120.2,,1,0,4
127,Teacher,"Okay, I'm ready",,,,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,Hi students,,,,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,"Oh, this actually does anyone want to start and share their opinion again allowed",,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, And I want to start,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, And I saw your previous journal entry,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,So we are going to start talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Luis,Yeah,,,120.4,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher,"Okay, go ahead",,,,remark,2,0,4
127,Luis, So I think I got this all,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,2,0,4
127,Luis, So I think all good,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Luis,Figured out now,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher, So can you remind the class of your answer,,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,"I'm glad you haven't figured out, Luis",,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Luis,I yeah okay so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen,,,120.4,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher, That's very good,,,410.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, It can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen,,,410.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher," But I think you're a little confused as to what the questions asking,",,,410.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,That's right,,,410.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,will you reread the question for me,,,120.3,remark,2,0,4
127,Luis," Um, is there convincing evidence that",,,120.3,response,2,0,4
127,Luis,"Yeah, okay",,,120.3,response,2,0,4
127,Luis,Water on the moon,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher, So let's see what Jazmin,,,110.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, Thanks,,,110.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, Yeah,,,110.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,Could be valuable,,,110.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,"So, Jazmin",,,120.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, Can you just tell me what that question means,,,120.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Jazmin,"Yeah, so to me with the question means is it's asking like to testing our opinion and we have to say like yes or no, the answer is the asking is the evidence convincing and and so I said that, yes, the evidence is convincing, and that's because astronauts wanna",,,110.1,response,2,0,4
127,Jazmin,And they can stay hydrated and and you can't survive without water,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher, And I especially like what you said about an opinion because it is asking for an opinion,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher," Jazmin, and that was perfect",,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,Very good,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, Do you think there's evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,430.2,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,"And Luis What you gave us is a good fact, but it's the fact that water is split into oxygen and hydrogen",,,430.2,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher," So instead, let's focus on your opinion",,,430.2,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, So is there,,,430.2,remark,2,0,4
127,Luis,"Um,",,,430.2,response,2,0,4
127,Luis, Cuz you can take the water and you can like what I was saying you can split it into oxygen,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Luis,"Um, yeah, I mean, I think so",,,,response,2,0,4
127,Luis,And hydrogen,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Luis,"Like, you know what I mean like you can do like some really cool stuff with",,,,response,2,0,4
127,Luis," So yeah, I think it's definitely value",,,,response,2,0,4
127,Luis,It,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher, Can you share your answer again,,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,You can do some cool stuff with it and Chris actually wrote about some cool stuff or another cool benefit of it,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,so Chris,,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Chris,"Yeah, so I said that water is heavy",,,230.3,response,2,0,4
127,Chris, So it's really good,,,230.3,response,2,0,4
127,Chris,That they don't have to carry it in the ship's it,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher, Who's the they that you're talking about,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,"Okay, so that could be a benefit of having water",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, So let's talk more about that,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Chris,The astronaut and like the spaceship,,,210.4,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher, The astronauts and so water is very heavy on,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,You're right,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,and how do you know this,,,230.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,Or it's very cumbersome for astronauts,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
127,Chris,"Um, well, I guess I just kind of know that you know what I mean like that that waters really heavy and it, it's really hard to set it in a spaceship because humans need water, and it makes spaceships really",,,230.1,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher,"I'm glad you know that, but it's also in the text",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, Could you read the first two sentences at the fourth paragraph for me,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Chris,Oh yeah okay um water on the moon would be a valuable was very important we suppress it could be useful in lots of ways,,,210.4,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher,And it can you continue for the next two sentences,,,120.3,remark,2,0,4
127,Chris,"Oh, yeah, yeah",,,120.3,response,2,0,4
127,Chris," For example, future astronauts drink this water",,,120.3,response,2,0,4
127,Chris, Water is heavy,,,120.3,response,2,0,4
127,Chris, It takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft,,,120.3,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher," So yeah, exactly",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,Great,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, You're exactly right,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, And water is heavy,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher," And because that water is heavy, it would definitely be a benefit if you know astronauts could",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,"You know, use what's already there instead of have to take up stuff with him in the spaceships, because it's very heavy and like I said very cumbersome",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,And,,,,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,So what do you think about this Oliver,,,130.2,remark,2,0,4
127,Oliver," So basically, my thinking",,,130.2,response,2,0,4
127,Oliver,"Um, okay",,,130.2,response,2,0,4
127,Oliver,"Is that, like, I don't think it's",,,,response,2,0,4
127,Oliver,It's very like convincing evidence that it's valuable,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Oliver,Because the water is not ready yet,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Oliver," And we don't have like the, like, you know, the equipment to like take the ice and make it into water",,,,response,2,0,4
127,Oliver," Like, I think it would be maybe like in the future, but it's not like useful now",,,,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher," Yes, Jazmin",,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,"I really, I really think that you did a really good job I identifying and separating the fact that the now versus later",,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Jazmin," You know what I mean like this, this, this, do we need like evidence from the text when we're seeing our like our, our speech like RP",,,310.1,response,2,0,4
127,Jazmin,"And it's just another piece about, like, I guess, like the when Chris was saying this stuff about the water play",,,310.1,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher, It's just what you think,,,420.2,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, But it's always best to face what you think off of facts that you read,,,420.2,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,Whenever you get your opinion or your opinion is your opinion,,,420.2,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher," Yes, Chris",,,420.2,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, Most of the time that is just something that you you make up because it's not necessarily true,,,420.2,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,So you don't want to have an opinion,,,420.2,remark,2,0,4
127,Chris,I i was i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,420.2,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher,"I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you",,,,remark,2,0,4
127,Chris, I read that there could be a piece on them like 2020 or,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Chris,"Oh, it's okay",,,,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher," I don't know if that's the truth is, I mean, I don't know, like that's the like a truthful, like a",,,130.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,"Oh, that's really interesting",,,130.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, But if you read it,,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, Where do you read it up,,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,"Like a, I don't know if it's necessarily possible",,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, That's super cool,,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Chris,"Oh, some some article in a magazine",,,140.1,response,2,0,4
127,Chris,"Yeah, I don't know if it's true, either because it seems like that would be really hard to do, but I think if they had a face, they could use the water",,,,response,2,0,4
127,Chris,To survive in the base,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher, Anything could happen,,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher, Yes,,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher," Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if next year, they did something crazy with everything happening",,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher," So I mean, at this point in time and this year",,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Teacher,Possibly,,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
127,Farrah,So I just would surely we have to go to lunch,,,140.1,response,2,0,4
127,Farrah,But before we go to lunch,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Farrah,I really wanted to thank you,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Farrah,"for working with us and, like, in particular",,,,response,2,0,4
127,Farrah,"I wanted to thank you for making sure that you use evidence in our answers because sometimes we just kind of like say our answers, but from what we think that we don't use evidence",,,,response,2,0,4
127,Farrah,"And you really make sure that we were using the evidence, but like, beyond that, like you really asked us about like how we got to our answers",,,,response,2,0,4
127,Farrah,And you listen to us as we explained our,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Farrah," Like,",,,,response,2,0,4
127,Farrah,"Ideas and I think that everybody here for leave value and like even beyond that, like, you like we're really clear with us, like what we needed to work on and like, let us know",,,,response,2,0,4
127,Farrah, I think that was really helpful because I think sometimes we get confused about what we should be answering like from the text or like from our background knowledge,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Farrah, So it was so much fun working with,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Farrah, Thank you so much,,,,response,2,0,4
127,Farrah,"You know, you need to do this and think about this with your answer",,,,response,2,0,4
127,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,2,0,4
128,Luis,I have a question,,,,response,0,1,1
128,Luis, So I think I need to be in this group,,,,response,0,1,1
128,Luis," Um, I already kind of know a lot about space already",,,,response,0,1,1
128,Luis, I don't need help with any of this stuff,,,,response,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"Well, let's focus on the text",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,So the question says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"Let's talk about it, Luis",,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher," So your answer is scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and that may be true, but um let's",,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"So you're, you may know a lot about space, that's, I agree with you",,,310.1,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, You know that answer makes perfect sense,,,310.1,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, Do you understand that,,,410.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, So let's look at the question again,,,410.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, So your answer doesn't really relate to that question,,,410.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,But it doesn't make sense as far as the question goes,,,410.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, I'm going to read it again what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon,,,410.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Luis,"Yeah, I think so",,,410.2,response,0,1,1
128,Luis, I think so,,,410.2,response,0,1,1
128,Teacher," But as far as discovering water, oxygen tanks don't really have anything to do with that",,,410.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"So what do you think may be a better answer as far as, because again, your answer pretty solid as far as a comprehension of space",,,410.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Luis,"Wow, I guess I didn't really read it that well closely",,,410.2,response,0,1,1
128,Luis," So maybe I didn't, I didn't, I didn't really read it",,,410.2,response,0,1,1
128,Teacher,Okay,,,420.3,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher," Well, I appreciate your honesty",,,420.3,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, So maybe you should go back and just read it and look for some specifics on how scientists or what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,420.3,remark,0,1,1
128,Luis,Okay,,,420.3,response,0,1,1
128,Teacher,So let's go with you and we'll just go to the left,,,,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"Jazmin, so your answer is NASA send a small machine",,,110.1,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"So yeah, NASA definitely send a small machine, but we really need to get into the specifics",,,410.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher," The second part, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,So I see first,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, So your answer needs to have something specific from the text about how scientists discover water on the moon,,,430.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, So if you'll go back in and try to find a specific,,,430.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"So, specifically what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,430.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"Okay, Chris, so scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,110.1,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, I can tell you read part of the text,,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, That's true,,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"So again, that's true",,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, And you're talking about water which is the questions asking you to talk about water,,,130.1,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"But again, we're focusing on the equipment, the scientists use",,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,So if you'll just go back in the text and try to find a specific on what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,420.3,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,So the the question itself establishes that there's water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Chris, Sounds good,,,420.3,response,0,1,1
128,Chris, Yeah,,,420.3,response,0,1,1
128,Chris,"Okay, yeah, I can do that",,,420.3,response,0,1,1
128,Teacher," So really, I'm going to encourage you to end your answer",,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, Just be independent,,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher," Not what Farrah found so just go in and read maybe read it and just, again, we're looking for what equipment, the scientists use to find water",,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"And Oliver, I circled the same I Farrah",,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher," Alright, so talk about what you found",,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"And talk about yourself, not another student",,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Oliver,Okay,,,420.2,response,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"And Farrah, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,110.1,remark,0,1,1
128,Farrah,Yeah,,,110.1,response,0,1,1
128,Teacher,That's absolutely true so far,,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"The scientist, it says that they need a microscope to look closely",,,120.3,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"So right now, your answer seems pretty solid",,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Farrah,"I'm wondering, though, because we had to work on it together, is my answer is my answer wrong?",,,110.2,response,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"Excuse me, I could not tell",,,,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher," Oliver, was that you",,,,remark,0,1,1
128,Farrah,"No, it's Farrah",,,,response,0,1,1
128,Farrah," Um, I was just wondering, like, if, if my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,1
128,Farrah, Like why it might be wrong,,,,response,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"So, Farrah, your answer's, I don't think your answer is incorrect",,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, Your answer's your answer is correct,,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Farrah,"Oh, okay, great",,,110.2,response,0,1,1
128,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,Maybe you can just go back over the texts and try to find a way to relate your answer back to the question,,,430.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher," You answer the question, but maybe instead of saying, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, relate it back to the scientists were, relate it back to water just to make your answer just even more solid",,,430.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, I know exactly what you're talking about when we answer,,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"That way, if I had no clue if I've never read the text, I'll read your question",,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Farrah,"Okay, yeah",,,420.2,response,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"Yes, Chris?",,,,remark,0,1,1
128,Chris," So this is the thing that I'm kind of wondering about, like, basically, I'm wondering, like,",,,,response,0,1,1
128,Chris,"Um, okay",,,,response,0,1,1
128,Chris,When I went to NASA with my dad like we went and we saw like all these space suits and all that stuff like the oxygen tanks that Luis was talking about,,,,response,0,1,1
128,Chris,So like did they have to use like this space suits and like the oxygen tanks to like go and like study the water like I'm just a little confused,,,,response,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"Yeah, that's a great point",,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, Chris,,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher," So, um, yes, they would have had to use these oxygen tanks and stuff to go out and actually explore the moon",,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher," So yeah, you would need that equipment",,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"So yes, just like if you can't breathe oxygen, you're going to need an oxygen tank",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"But really, a better answer would be, since it says what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon is what equipment are they actually using to discover water",,,210.2,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,Kind of like if you're playing basketball,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"For an organized sport, you're probably going to need a jersey right to play",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
128,Chris,"Yeah, that makes sense",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
128,Teacher,But the important tool is the basketball itself,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher, Chris?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
128,Chris,"Yeah, it does",,,150.1,response,0,1,1
128,Teacher,"Okay, yes, Oliver?",,,,remark,0,1,1
128,Oliver," I just wanted to thank you for a second for for working with us, especially like you were very patient with our answers and you really listened to our answers and also",,,,response,0,1,1
128,Oliver, But before we go to lunch,,,,response,0,1,1
128,Oliver,"Um, so we have to go to lunch now",,,,response,0,1,1
128,Oliver,We were able to listen to each other better because you were really listening to our answers and I just really appreciate it and wanted to make sure you knew that,,,,response,0,1,1
128,Oliver, Thanks,,,,response,0,1,1
128,Teacher,I really appreciate that,,,,remark,0,1,1
128,Teacher,Start simulation,,,,remark,1,1,1
128,Luis,Hi,,,,response,1,1,1
128,Luis,Excuse me I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher, So that means something that probably interest you a lot,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,I'm glad you said you know a lot about space,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"You said, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher, That's really cool,,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,And that obviously shows your understanding of space,,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"You know that, um, but I'm just going to direct you to the question, which is Scientists us to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Luis,Uh huh,,,110.3,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"We look at that question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon, what are we really looking for",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Luis,"Um, okay, the equipment they use to discover the water?",,,210.2,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher,Absolutely Equipment they used to discover the water,,,110.4,remark,1,1,1
128,Luis,I'm okay,,,110.4,response,1,1,1
128,Luis," It's like when you got a space, you know and and or when you're looking for the telescope and then you see a new a new planet or no star, and you're like, oh wow you know like I discovered her new star, I discovered a new planet like that",,,110.4,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher, So it's a new,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"That's, that's true",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1

128,Teacher, That's absolutely true,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"So now when we look at your answer was oxygen tanks, is that the equipment they used to discover water",,,210.3,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher, It's new to whoever finds it,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Luis, You're right,,,210.2,response,1,1,1
128,Luis,"Yeah, no, no, no, no",,,210.2,response,1,1,1
128,Luis," Yeah, oxygen tanks, we don't we don't discover water with the tanks, we just, we don't need them to breathe on the moon",,,210.2,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher, So now I'm going to help another student,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"And that's cool, you know that",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher, So you're looking for what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,420.3,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher," So just go back and find that, and I'm going to help another student",,,420.3,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"And while I'm doing that, I would like you to go back in the text and find textual evidence To go ahead and circle it that answers that question",,,420.3,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,1,1,1
128,Jazmin,I don't understand why my answers wrong,,,,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher,NASA send a small machine,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,Jazmin your answer is not necessarily wrong,,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,So what equipment that science use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher," We go back into the text, it is called a lunar orbiter",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,So then that that is also true NASA send a small machine,,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"What I would like you to do, though, is instead of just saying, NASA sent a small machine",,,430.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher, We need to make that answer specific,,,430.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"Okay, because as someone that maybe if you were to share your answer with a student that hasn't read the text, would your answer help them very much to understand that piece of equipment?",,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Jazmin,"If they just said, okay, a small machine",,,410.2,response,1,1,1
128,Jazmin," I mean, I guess, I guess no",,,410.2,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher,What would be helpful,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Jazmin," So if you wanted to know the small, um, I guess, to tell you something about it",,,420.2,response,1,1,1
128,Jazmin,"Um, okay",,,420.2,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher," And what else, what identifies that machine",,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"Yeah, tell me something about it",,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Jazmin,"Um, what it looks like or what it size",,,420.2,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher," And then also, um, so when I'm talking to you",,,210.3,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher, I'm gonna say Jazmin,,,210.3,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.3,remark,1,1,1
128,Jazmin,"Yeah, my name",,,210.3,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher, So probably the machines name as well,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"Yeah, your name",,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Jazmin,Yeah yeah,,,420.2,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher, And just make sure your bringing it from the text,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,t's just we need to make it specific so you'll go ahead and do that,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"You're in again your answers, not necessarily wrong",,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"All right, but you're definitely on the right",,,130.1,remark,1,1,1
128,Jazmin,"Okay, so I just have to add more at the name and stuff to it",,,130.1,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher, So instead of just go in and answer what equipment good scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,430.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher, Yes,,,430.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher, Just make it specific that way that and I would bring back the question,,,430.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,Yes,,,430.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,I love when students make the question,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher," Alright, so equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon is and then go into your answer",,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.2,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1

128,Chris,"Yeah, I, I went to NASA",,,,response,1,1,1
128,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks and tanks and suits,,,,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"Well, first of all Chris I would just like to say, that's awesome",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher," Um,",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher, So that's really cool that you have that experience,,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,I've never been the NASA,,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,And then your answer,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher, Scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,And that's definitely true scientists did find craters full of water on the moon,,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,So if we go back to the question what equipment that scientists us to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"Okay, so I'm glad you you've noticed that",,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher, What is that question asking?,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Chris, I didn't write the name of the equipment,,,110.2,response,1,1,1
128,Chris," Oh, yeah",,,110.2,response,1,1,1
128,Chris,"Like you said to Jazmin, the name of the equipment, The name of the equipment that they used",,,110.2,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher," Again, true",,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"So if you will just go back into the text, and I would like you to find which equipment",,,420.3,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"Yes, you, you went right into you said scientists want crater some water on the moon",,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,We're just looking for what equipment led them to finding those Craters of water,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,You do a great job of talking about the question,,,310.1,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher, As far as that goes,,,310.1,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"Now you just need to ask, or find what equipment that is",,,420.3,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher, ,,,310.1,remark,1,1,1
128,Teacher, So you obviously understand the question,,,310.1,remark,1,1,1
128,Chris,"OK, OK, OK, I can do that",,,310.1,response,1,1,1
128,Teacher,"Thank you Chris, hey Oliver",,,,remark,1,1,1

128,Teacher,"Or yes, Luis",,,,remark,2,1,1
128,Luis, So I'm all good,,,,response,2,1,1
128,Luis,"Okay, I think I got this all figured out",,,,response,2,1,1
128,Teacher,"So, water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen",,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, Yeah,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, That's what you said,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Luis,I think I got it this time,,,110.1,response,2,1,1
128,Teacher, That's true,,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,"So again, we're just going to that",,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, So you're picking up on key parts of the text which water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that's important,,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, So this is an argument piece,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,But if we look at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be value,,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher," So you can say yes it is valuable, or no, it is not valuable",,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, So we're going to restate the question we're going to answer the question we're going to cite evidence and then we're going to explain that evidence,,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,So I really like to do is the race format,,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,So right now you have some evidence water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen,,,430.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, : Because we need to put whether it is convincing or it is not convincing evidence that the water on the moon could be valuable,,,430.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, But I would like you to restate the question and then answer the question,,,430.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, So all you have right now is evidence,,,430.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,And then you explain that evidence,,,430.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Luis,Okay,,,430.2,response,2,1,1
128,Luis,"Okay, so I gotta say yes or no",,,,response,2,1,1
128,Luis, Before I write,,,,response,2,1,1
128,Luis," Um, and then I write, then I so I gotta put a couple a sentence before",,,,response,2,1,1
128,Luis, So I just got to like add a couple more sentences first that says yes or no,,,,response,2,1,1
128,Luis,Before my answer,,,,response,2,1,1
128,Teacher, So what you'll do is,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,Yes,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher," So for example, you are going to restate the question",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, Is that true,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher," It sounds like you think, yes",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,From your evidence,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
128,Luis,"Yeah, I",,,230.3,response,2,1,1
128,Teacher," So you're answering the question, and you're reciting that question there is convincing evidence that",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,Would say there is convinced,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, There is convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,"Let me see you again, sorry",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, So there you restated the question you answered the question,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,"Then you would say in the text, what it says",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, And then you would explain why that's important,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, Water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Luis,I gotta write all of that stuff,,,420.2,response,2,1,1
128,Luis,That's a lot,,,,response,2,1,1
128,Teacher," You can do it, I believe you can do it",,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,But then your answer is gonna be awesome,,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Luis,Okay,,,150.1,response,2,1,1
128,Teacher,"So, Jazmin",,,,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, So you already do parts of that you answer the question you provide evidence you explain your evidence,,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,You do a great your answers,,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, Great,,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher," Yes, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated",,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, You can't survive without water,,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,The only thing I would like is just the restate the question,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,"Okay, does that make sense",,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Jazmin,Yeah yeah,,,420.2,response,2,1,1
128,Jazmin,"Okay, okay",,,,response,2,1,1

128,Teacher, There's an exclamation point,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, So you go yes and you're very use think strongly about it,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher," You're saying yes, you're just also bringing the question into it",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,"Right, if you could say there is enough evidence that water on the moon",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, Can you guys and then you're off,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Jazmin, All right,,,420.2,response,2,1,1

128,Teacher," So that's fine that that you think that um, because this is, it's what you believe",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher," So you put no, not for a long time",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, So you're saying no,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,Is there and convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, And it's hard because I like you to have your own opinion,,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, Just go back and reread number four,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher, That might change your answer,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,"what I would really like you to do, though",,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,But if we're just going completely off what the text says if you will read number four,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
128,Farrah," And I did, I did read it, I got mine from I'm from from I think from paragraph number six",,,310.1,response,2,1,1

128,Teacher,"So on there, you can make that on so again",,,120.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Oliver,Your said to Luis that he has to restate the question and an answer the question,,,130.2,response,2,1,1
128,Oliver," Okay, so I guess I can restate the question, but I feel like I answered the question",,,,response,2,1,1
128,Oliver,And give evidence,,,,response,2,1,1
128,Teacher,And then you need evidence to support your answer and then you,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,Found the evidence from number six,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher," That's perfect, just provide that evidence, and then explain",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1

128,Teacher, Water is heavy,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,Really what we're looking for is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,410.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher," Okay, so",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,"Okay, so you are talking about bringing water so that might imply that water on the moon can be very valuable",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher," So now if we'll just restate the question, Answer the question",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,"Yeah, so that that's a good train of thought",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
128,Teacher,"So when we look at yours, you don't necessarily answer the question i can i can tell what you're getting at by reading your evidence, but you don't actually specifically answer the question then provide evidence and then just explain it",,,410.1,remark,2,1,1
128,Chris,Okay so you can't tell that I need more evidence or I have enough evidence right cuz I pulled it from the story,,,410.1,response,2,1,1
128,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,1,1
128,Chris,But I,,,,response,2,1,1

129,Luis," Like, I don't think I need to be in this group",,,,response,0,0,1
129,Luis," So, like, I don't think I need any help",,,,response,0,0,1
129,Teacher,"Well, I'm so glad that you already have some prior knowledge of space",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, But let's talk about the equipment that the scientists have used to discover water on the moon,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, So I can't wait to hear about what you know about,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, You guys are really thinking and I like where you're headed,,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,But let's look back at the question that was proposed,,,420.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,"Farrah and Oliveron, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water on the moon",,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher," So what did the question, what question are we trying to answer",,,420.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, And you guys are both on the right track,,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Would anybody like to reread that for me,,,420.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,"Jazmin, go ahead and",,,,remark,0,0,1
129,Jazmin, Okay,,,,response,0,0,1
129,Jazmin,Let's see,,,,response,0,0,1
129,Jazmin," The question is, What equipment do you use to discover water on the moon?",,,,response,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Thank you,,,420.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, So does anybody have any key words that would help us to look back in the text and determine what exactly are we looking for,,,420.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,"Okay, great",,,420.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, What do you think,,,,remark,0,0,1
129,Farrah,"Um, I just wanted to check what what is a key word?",,,,response,0,0,1
129,Teacher,At key word a key word is an important word that it's going to give us a clue as to what we're going to be looking for to answer our question,,,420.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Farrah, Gotcha,,,420.1,response,0,0,1
129,Farrah,"Oh, okay",,,420.1,response,0,0,1
129,Teacher, What equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon,,,510.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher," I try to think to myself, I try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking",,,510.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,"So for example, when I read",,,510.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,"So for example, I might say, The equipment that the scientist used to discover on the moon would be and then leave that answer blank",,,510.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, And then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment,,,510.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Where are we using yes Farrah,,,510.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Farrah,"Um, so",,,510.1,response,0,0,1
129,Farrah," Okay, so that's really interesting",,,510.1,response,0,0,1
129,Farrah," So like the arm so like the key, the key word would be like what, what, like equipment like equipment",,,510.1,response,0,0,1
129,Farrah, Is that a keyword?,,,510.1,response,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Can anybody give me another word for equipment?,,,210.2,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Does anybody take a second to look back in the text and tell me what equipment,,,210.2,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher," Well, first of all, can anybody tell me what equipment means",,,210.2,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher," So we're going to, let's look back in the texts and see what equipment was talked about",,,210.2,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,"Absolutely, you are on the right track",,,210.2,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher," How about you, what other our could use for equipment",,,,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,0,0,1
129,Oliver,"Yeah, um, I would say, like, like a tool or like yeah like like a tool",,,,response,0,0,1
129,Teacher, What equipment or tools do you see mentioned in the text?,,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, That is perfect,,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher," I love that synonym Oliver, you are spot on",,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Absolutely,,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,A tool,,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, So if you guys could take a second to look back in the texts and find Different equipment or tools,,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, So I see a lot of hands going up,,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, I'm going to give everybody a second to read through the text until they find what equipment or tools that they can see,,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,"Okay, I see some hands going up",,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Chris What equipment or tools did you find in the text?,,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Chris,So I actually had kind of a question,,,420.3,response,0,0,1
129,Chris, And when we went,,,420.3,response,0,0,1
129,Chris," I'm like, I'm basically like a I was sort of wondering like, so my dad took me to NASA",,,420.3,response,0,0,1
129,Chris," So actually, I was kind of wondering because like that seems like like those, would those be tools?",,,420.3,response,0,0,1
129,Chris, We saw like all of these like space suits and equipment like that,,,420.3,response,0,0,1
129,Chris, And I was wondering about that,,,,response,0,0,1
129,Chris,"But I was wondering, but do you think they they use them, but did they did they not use them to to measure things with the microscope, like the astronauts",,,,response,0,0,1
129,Chris," I'm like, I guess it's not in the in the reading",,,,response,0,0,1
129,Teacher," Yeah, yes, that absolutely would be equipment that NASA would use",,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,"Absolutely, absolutely",,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Those are some great observations,,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, But let's refer back to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, And then let's think about how they would be linked to discovering water on the moon,,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,I want you guys to first think about equipment or like Oliver said tools that would be used,,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, So once you to narrow down tools that would be used to discover water on the moon,,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Those space,,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, But let's link equipment and or tools to discover water on the moon,,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher," Oh, we've already get some ideas",,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,Helmets and all the other equipment are absolutely things that would be used to go to the moon,,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Do you see any tools that could be used to discover water on the moon? Let's look back in the text and see if we see any tools,,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher," Jazmin, what do you see what do you think?",,,420.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Jazmin,"What I think is, so it's like what I said was, like, the small machine",,,420.3,response,0,0,1
129,Jazmin," It's like a lunar orbiter right so you would that that's one, two, that you would have to use right like to get there",,,420.3,response,0,0,1
129,Jazmin, And then when I was thinking about like the tool and like how you would pick what this like how you would use this machine,,,420.3,response,0,0,1
129,Teacher, I see,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,"Okay, so let's look back in the text",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Let's read it says let's reread the text quickly,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,"It says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places, wherever, or where the sun never shines",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, That's our key word Jazmin,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Can someone else continue reading for me to see what this lunar orbiter does,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, So a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, There you go,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
129,Oliver, this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
129,Oliver, these ice deposits are very small,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
129,Oliver,"Um, yeah, I can do it",,,210.4,response,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Can you tell us what do you think?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Farrah,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,"Okay, so what exactly do the lunar orbiters do, based on our reading",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
129,Farrah,"So it sounds like rhey look for the ice deposits, but they they go searching for it",,,210.4,response,0,0,1
129,Farrah," Like, they're the thing that finds it right?",,,210.4,response,0,0,1
129,Teacher, So I see that we looked at our question what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,210.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Which answer makes the most sense as to what would be found on the moon Farrah?,,,210.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher," So I see we have our answers are a microscope, A small machine and then we have some other equipment",,,210.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, Let's look at back at some of our answers,,,210.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher,"Yes, absolutely",,,210.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Teacher, So I see that we have,,,210.3,remark,0,0,1
129,Farrah, But we have to go to lunch,,,210.3,response,0,0,1
129,Farrah,"I'm actually, I'm so sorry because we're really enjoying this",,,210.3,response,0,0,1
129,Farrah," I just wanted to thank you like this was really interesting for us the way that you let this class, like we were really able to like think through really clearly like what we were studying and and like able to sort of like understand better and I think like you really led us through that process and it was really interesting",,,210.3,response,0,0,1
129,Farrah," So before we go, though",,,210.3,response,0,0,1
129,Farrah," Like, thank you so much",,,210.3,response,0,0,1

129,Teacher,I think you guys had some really,,,,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,"You guys put some really great work in and had some good answer choices, but I don't feel that we have a complete understanding of what the question is asking, So firstly, what I want to do is",,,220.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Even,,,,remark,1,0,1
129,Luis,Me,,,,response,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,0,1

129,Teacher, Okay,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,"Alright, so first of all, let's look at the question so Chris, would you go ahead and read the question to us",,,120.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher," Alright, well, how about you stick with us for a little bit and see if we can teach you something new",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,You already know all about space,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Luis, Okay,,,120.3,response,1,0,1
129,Luis," It says, oh, what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.3,response,1,0,1
129,Luis,Sure,,,120.3,response,1,0,1
129,Teacher," Okay, so first I want to make sure that we have a clear understanding of what the question is actually asking so",,,220.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Yes,,,220.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, So can anybody give me a synonym for the word equipment,,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,What equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher," First of all, I want to make sure that we know what the word equipment means",,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,1,0,1
129,Farrah,A tool,,,,response,1,0,1
129,Teacher, That's exactly right,,,110.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher," So,",,,110.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,A tool,,,110.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, So give me some examples of tools,,,140.1,remark,1,0,1

129,Luis,"So,",,,,response,1,0,1
129,Luis,"Um, OK",,,,response,1,0,1
129,Luis," So when we go to PE Sometimes it's not a tool, but sometimes a PE teacher when we're playing basketball, you'll be like, Okay, y'all go get the equipment and we have to go get the basketballs",,,,response,1,0,1
129,Luis, OK,,,,response,1,0,1
129,Teacher,So let's look back in the text,,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, I want you guys to focus on some key words,,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher," Yeah, so that's a great example of equipment",,,110.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,That's right,,,110.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,In the texts that are going to talk about equipment,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher," So first of all, we know we're looking for equipment that was used to find what Jazmin",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Jazmin,Find water,,,210.4,response,1,0,1
129,Teacher," So I want you guys to take a second to look back in the text, and I want you to circle the words",,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,To find water that's absolutely right,,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,That are equipment,,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Is related to a tool that's going to help you find water and I'm going to give you a second just to look back and do that,,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,"Alright guys, so",,,,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Now that you've had time to look back what equipment do we see in this passage,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Jazmin, So I don't understand why my answers wrong,,,210.3,response,1,0,1
129,Jazmin,circled to but the one I circled i think is right,,,210.3,response,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,"So, Jazmin that you said that NASA sent a small machine",,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, So what two words did you find what two words or what two pieces of equipment,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, Did you find,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Jazmin,The small machine and the scientific tool,,,210.3,response,1,0,1
129,Teacher, So I think you we're on the right track,,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,And the scientific tool,,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,But let's go ahead and look at,,,,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Let's look at the sentence where you found a small machine,,,230.2,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, Go ahead and read that whole sentence where small machine is included,,,230.2,remark,1,0,1
129,Jazmin,"Okay, this isn't a small machine coated Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,230.2,response,1,0,1
129,Teacher,"Her perfect so Jazmin, you were absolutely on the right track",,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, Can you be more specific,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,But a small machine,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,About that small machine,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, What was that called,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Like,,,,remark,1,0,1
129,Jazmin,The Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,1,0,1
129,Teacher,"Yeah, a lunar orbiter",,,110.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, So you're absolutely right,,,110.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher," So,",,,110.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Let's look at,,,,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, Now the Jazmin has found the sentence that told us the lunar orbiter was the machine that helped the scientists discover water,,,230.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, So we had a couple people think that we were looking for microscope,,,230.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Some of our other answers,,,230.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,can we now see why that makes sense,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,In why microscope wasn't the best choice,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Farrah, So why why I don't know why that's not the best choice because they're both they're both equipped,,,210.3,response,1,0,1
129,Farrah,It makes sense but they still use the microscope to look at the water,,,210.3,response,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Yeah,,,110.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher," No, you're right",,,110.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, Farrah that,,,110.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Let's look back in the text,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, So once we have,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, So let's look in the area where it talked about the microscope,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, Then we want to look and see which one's the best,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Found types of equipment,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher," Would you go ahead and read that paragraph to us, please",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, So we are on the first page in paragraph number three,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher," So, Farrah",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Farrah," If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,210.4,response,1,0,1
129,Farrah,"Yeah, it says that means the moon is still drier than the dry desert on Earth",,,210.4,response,1,0,1
129,Farrah, The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it,,,210.4,response,1,0,1
129,Teacher,"Okay, so are they saying, Is there any evidence in that paragraph that leads you to believe that that's something that was used",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Or something that you would need to use to look really closely,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,It says,,,,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,"Out of water, they found is microscopic meaning you want to be able to look straight at it and that you would need a tool, but is it saying that they've already used a microscope to look at it",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
129,Chris,"Oh, um, you need you need all okay okay you need a scientific tall to look really closely on",,,210.4,response,1,0,1
129,Chris,Yeah,,,,response,1,0,1
129,Chris," Also, Farrah i think i think i guess we didn't read that fully",,,,response,1,0,1
129,Chris," I know, I know, I went to NASA",,,,response,1,0,1
129,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,1,0,1
129,Teacher, You're absolutely right,,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, So a lot of equipment is huge,,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Absolutely,,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, They do,,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, But what we have to do,,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,I think you guys did a great job and you were on the right track,,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Is when we're looking when we're given a question we have to look at the key words,,,420.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,because the microscope was a tool,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,"But I think next time we need to use the strategy of looking at keywords and be really specific,",,,510.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher," In fact, so",,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,"You were on the right track with the word equipment and looking for keywords that related, but we need to make sure that it it fully answers the question",,,430.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher," So another suggestion is, once you have",,,430.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Once you give me just one second tab and then I'll answer the question,,,,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,"Once you have decided on your answer, then you need to",,,420.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, I think you'll be able to better,,,420.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, You can need to look back at that question and make sure that it makes sense,,,420.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, And by looking at for those key words and reading that text really closely,,,420.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,plug it back in,,,420.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher, Make sure that you can restate your answer and that is fully answering that question,,,420.1,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,"So Deb, did you have a question",,,,remark,1,0,1
129,Teacher,"Be able to better answer text and another thing rereading the text, maybe will help get a deeper understanding of the text",,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
129,Oliver," I'm sorry to interrupt, but if I was looking at the clock and it's time for the next group",,,,response,1,0,1
129,Oliver,"Um, no",,,,response,1,0,1
129,Oliver, So we got a gold,,,,response,1,0,1
129,Teacher, All right,,,,remark,1,0,1

129,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,1
129,All," Okay, see you later",,,,,1,0,1
129,All,Thanks,,,,,1,0,1
129,Teacher,Alright guys first phone and say thank you for all of your hard work and for writing down your responses to our first question,,,,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, Luis,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"I think you guys have somewhat of an understanding to what the question is asking, but I don't think we are fully there",,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, Yes,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in that spot",,,150.1,response,2,0,1
129,Luis, I already know all about space,,,150.1,response,2,0,1
129,Teacher, Why don't you stick with us,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"All right, well, Luis",,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"And see if we can teach you something new, even scientists are constantly learning new things about space",,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, So why don't you stick with us and,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,See what you can learn today,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, Alright,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"So first of all,",,,,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"I want to look back at the question so Jazmin, would you go ahead and read the question for us",,,120.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Jazmin,"Okay, it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.3,response,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"Okay, so what can you restate that question, what is that question asking what are the some important words, guys, I want you guys to",,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,turn and talk or take a second to really look at the question and see what exactly how else could you ask,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,what that question is,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, Go ahead,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"Asking, What are those important words",,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Jazmin," I think it's saying like, I'm like, um, what, what kind of things did the astronauts use to find",,,210.2,response,2,0,1
129,Jazmin,Okay,,,210.2,response,2,0,1
129,Jazmin,Water on the moon,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Teacher, You're exactly right,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"Yeah, absolutely",,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher," So specifically, it says, what kinds of equipment",,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,So what kind of things,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher," So first of all, I want to make sure",,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, So can you give me,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, I don't think we fully understand equipment so equipment is what we're going to be looking for equipment that helps the scientists discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"Because I think, judging by some of your responses",,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"Another example of a word for equipment, Oliver",,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"What does it mean, what does it",,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,Mean,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Jazmin," It's a tool, a scientific tool",,,210.2,response,2,0,1
129,Jazmin," So that's how I know the microscope is right, cuz that equipment but but I think it's machine because that's what I had",,,210.2,response,2,0,1
129,Jazmin,"Okay, well, there's another word story",,,210.2,response,2,0,1
129,Jazmin, And that's equivalent to so I don't know what my answer is wrong,,,210.2,response,2,0,1
129,Teacher,So I think you guys,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher," You guys are correct in stating that both of those things, the microscope and",,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,Are exactly right,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher," So, uh, equipment is a tool",,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,So let's look it specifically we want to look through our passage and make sure that we're looking for equipment that helped,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,The small machine are both equipment they are tools,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"So let's look so Jazmin, you said that the small machine",,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,The scientists find water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,So does anybody else see any other equipment,,,130.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, You said the microscope,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,Was the equipment that you think help the scientists and Oliver,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, Any other answers that it could that you possibly had that was related to,,,130.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,Equipment,,,130.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Chris,"I wasn't in my answer, but I went to NASA",,,130.2,response,2,0,1
129,Chris, And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks,,,130.2,response,2,0,1
129,Teacher,They absolutely do,,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher," Let's, let's look at those two",,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher," Yes, that is in fact true, but let's focus on what the question is actually asking",,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,So if nobody has any other equipment,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, And we have a microscope,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,answer choices and see which one makes the most sense and answers our question,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,So we're looking so we've narrowed it down,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,I want you guys to take a second to locate,,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, We have our small machine,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"In the text where you found small machine and microscope, and I want you guys to tell me what paragraph in the text is a small machine in the microscope",,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Luis,"Okay, I'm not a lot",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
129,Luis,Of different equipment,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Teacher,oxygen tanks,,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher," Okay, so go ahead and locate that as well",,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"Alright, Luis",,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, Did you find where,,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,You found oxygen tank,,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"Now,",,,,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"Okay, well I do see oxygen tanks and it's actually in paragraph five, so I'd like everybody to look at paragraph five,",,,120.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"oxygen tanks bed did not help the scientists found water, but I want you",,,410.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, So it says the moon,,,120.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,To look at paragraph and we're going to see why we're going to see why that doesn't work,,,120.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher," Water can be broken down into parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts could breathe the oxygen, oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel",,,120.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,Water could be useful in other ways,,,120.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,And,,,,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, Luis So it does talk about oxygen,,,410.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"No, you're right",,,410.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, But it doesn't talk about oxygen tanks yes oxygen tanks would be a piece of equipment,,,410.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, So we know that one doesn't answer a question,,,410.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,So So Deb,,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, Let's look at microscope,,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, Did you find where we can find microscope and and there,,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,Are past,,,,remark,2,0,1
129,Oliver, The last one and this is where I got my answer,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Oliver,"Girl Yeah, it's in paragraph three, it's that one is the last one",,,,response,2,0,1
129,Oliver, Me too,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"Okay, so go ahead and read that last sentence for us",,,120.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Oliver,"Okay, so it says on your needle scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.3,response,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"Okay, so did it say that they used a microscope",,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
129,Oliver,"Um,",,,210.4,response,2,0,1
129,Teacher,It said you need,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, So you'd a contraction for you would need,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,A scientific tool,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
129,Farrah,Oh yeah okay okay yeah we did learn about that you would need doesn't mean that you you are using it means like me,,,210.4,response,2,0,1
129,Farrah, Yeah,,,210.4,response,2,0,1
129,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, So how,,,,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"So that makes sense that to be able, they're saying to look really closely at the water, you would need that tool",,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, But how did they discover it or another word,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, How did they find that water,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher, So the only other piece of equipment in the text is a small machine called,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,So the only other piece of equipment in the text is a small machine called,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,A lunar,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
129,Jazmin,Orbiter,,,210.4,response,2,0,1
129,Jazmin, I have a day,,,210.4,response,2,0,1
129,Jazmin," Yeah, that was my answer!",,,210.4,response,2,0,1
129,Teacher, So does that make sense as to why,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher," Chris, I saw your hand go up",,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,So does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"I'm sorry, go ahead",,,,remark,2,0,1
129,Chris," No, I was just, I was thinking, okay, I was on a piece of equipment",,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris,No,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris, He said the microscope,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris, The small machine,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris,And then Jazmin said a different one,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris,And,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris,"Since it says, You want me",,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris,You would need,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris,"The microscope, but not that you",,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris,Do need,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris,"Oh,",,,,response,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"Yeah, it said you would if you were to look closely, but how they discovered or how they found out that there was water on there",,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,Was not with that microscope,,,130.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Chris,"Okay, okay, um,",,,130.1,response,2,0,1
129,Chris," Cuz, cuz I like I can hear both of their ideas",,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris,This is this is this is hard to kind of figure out,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris,And I think I feel like the key word is like you would need which says that they they didn't use it,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,0,1
129,Chris," Thanks, Miss Pickett it's time for us to go to lunch, but",,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris,"Okay, okay, okay",,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris, That was good,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris, So we got we got to kind of think about,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris,I do want to say that I appreciate it,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris, How you you really like asked everybody questions about their answers,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris," Um, and, and, like how you ask Luis to like find his answer in the story and um yeah i think i think i'm thinking about now",,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris,Why we made our answers,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Chris,Looking at the story and really trying to find more of the words just looking at more of the words in the story to see if that if that will work for the question,,,,response,2,0,1
129,Teacher, Thank you so much and I will see you later,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,and looking for the keywords in your question as well,,,420.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,Well you guys did awesome today,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
129,Teacher,"Yes, so keep looking for those keywords in the text",,,420.3,remark,2,0,1

130,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,0,3
130,Luis, And I don't think I need to be in this group because I already know all this stuff about space,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Luis," So basically, um, here's the thing",,,,response,0,0,3
130,Teacher, How about you be the one to read paragraph two for us again because it seems like we're a little confused on the correct answer here and I want to see if we can hone in on it,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher,"Well, that's fantastic",,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Luis,"Okay, um paragraph two",,,120.3,response,0,0,3
130,Luis, These ice deposits are very small,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Luis,NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Luis, This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Teacher, I want everyone to take a moment and circle the most important word that they found in that paragraph,,,420.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher, Excellent job,,,420.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher, Thank you,,,420.3,remark,0,0,3

130,Teacher,10 more seconds 987654321,,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
130,Farrah,"So with that, I circled was ice, ice deposits",,,120.4,response,0,0,3
130,Farrah,"And and I circled it because you know you had, one because they say in there that the ice deposits are very small and so like you have to, you have to use the microscope to see the ice deposits and ice water",,,,response,0,0,3
130,Teacher,Very true,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher," So, so we know that ice is the water",,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher,Let me go to Oliver,,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher," Okay, so that's very good",,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher, We're going to keep that in the back of our brains,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher, What did you circle,,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher, We know that the water that we find is very small,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Oliver,"Um, so I circled the part that says very small kind of for the same reason, but like the fact that you have to use a microscope to look at the ice deposits",,,120.4,response,0,0,3
130,Teacher,"Okay, very good",,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher, So where we're thinking about how small the water is,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher,So let's see what Chris has to say,,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
130,Chris," I was looking at, like, um, I guess, Lunar Orbiter",,,230.3,response,0,0,3
130,Chris, So I kind of went in,,,230.3,response,0,0,3
130,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,230.3,response,0,0,3

130,Teacher, Can you tell me why you chose Lunar Orbiter,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
130,Chris,"Well, it just kind of looked like the, you know, man",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
130,Chris," Like it just kind of looked like the other like the machine, you know, they said, like what equipment",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
130,Chris, It seemed like the most machine or equipment looking word,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Chris,"I just, I don't know",,,,response,0,0,3
130,Teacher,Okay,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3

130,Teacher,Okay,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher, So when you say the small machine,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
130,Jazmin,I'm talking about the lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Teacher," Are you talking about the Lunar Orbiter, or the microscope?",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3

130,Teacher,"Okay, so we have lunar orbiter again",,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Luis,"Well, okay, so I didn't really read it that closely",,,230.3,response,0,0,3
130,Teacher,"Okay, so we read it aloud",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher, Right,,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher, You read it for us because you know everything about space already,,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher, Do you know that phrase,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3

130,Jazmin,It said that,,,120.4,response,0,0,3
130,Teacher,Anybody want to--,,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
130,Jazmin,"Yeah, we said that basically that it was the lunar orbiter and it something that went to the moon and it was something like like that was the craft or the spaceship that like went up to the moon and landed and like found the water",,,,response,0,0,3
130,Teacher," If you think something, it needs to be added to that answer",,,130.2,remark,0,0,3

130,Farrah,Yeah,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Farrah," It sounds like maybe the lunar orbiter is the answer, but I'm not really sure why the microscopes, not the answer",,,,response,0,0,3
130,Farrah," So, my question was, like, how do you like I'm not quite sure why",,,,response,0,0,3
130,Farrah," You know,",,,,response,0,0,3
130,Teacher," So, Farrah, why don't you go ahead and read our discussion question to us",,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher,Sure,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Farrah,"Um, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.3,response,0,0,3
130,Teacher, What do you think the most important word in that question is,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
130,Farrah,Equipment,,,,response,0,0,3

130,Teacher,Seems to be where we're at,,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
130,Jazmin, I think that the most important word is discover because like finding it,,,120.4,response,0,0,3
130,Jazmin,"Okay, yes",,,120.4,response,0,0,3
130,Luis,Okay and Luis you had your hand up,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Luis, What would you like to add,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Luis,"Yeah I agree with Jazmin, I, I think I'm around now to thinking that the lunar orbiter is the thing that discovered the water",,,,response,0,0,3
130,Teacher," And so when we look at our text, we're trying to find the thing that helps us discover the water or find the water",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher,Right so discover is our most important word in that question,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher,Right? So the microscope does help us see the water,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher, But what's the thing that helps us get to the water in the first place,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,0,0,3
130,Farrah,"Um, well, it's basically it's the lunar orbiter I think I think that's a lot more clear now",,,,response,0,0,3
130,Farrah, I just wanted to take a moment and I wanted to thank you for working with us today,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Farrah, But before we go to lunch,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Farrah,We actually have to go to lunch,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Farrah,"And especially, I wanted to thank you for really like working patiently with each of us and like drawing out the answers kind of piece by piece and letting us do our own kind of like thinking as we went along,",,,,response,0,0,3
130,Farrah, Since because we don't always get along as a group,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Farrah,and then like connecting with each other's thinking was really cool,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Farrah, Thank you so much,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Farrah, So that was pretty cool,,,,response,0,0,3
130,Teacher,"Thank you, Farrah, and thank you, thank the rest of you",,,,remark,0,0,3
130,Teacher, Welcome back everybody,,,,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,Hello,,,,remark,1,0,3
130,Luis, Thanks Teacher,,,,response,1,0,3
130,Luis,Um,,,,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher,So looking over your responses,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, And it seems like everyone has read the article,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, You had a question,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, Yes,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Luis,Excuse me,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
130,Luis,"I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher, And what is one thing that you know about space that can help us,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Luis,"Okay, so I know that astronauts can't breathe and space",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
130,Luis, So they need to wear oxygen mask so that they can walk around and stuff,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher," And in fact, our article today discusses the importance of oxygen",,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, And I appreciate you sharing that with us,,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,And that is absolutely correct,,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,"Hold your thought we're going to get to your, your comment because you talked about suit scientists using a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and oxygen masks in space",,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,"My question for you is, what other equipment does our article say that scientists use to discover water right because we also need water in order to survive in space",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Luis," Um, maybe they use like I'm a shovel to dig it up",,,210.2,response,1,0,3
130,Luis,Mm hmm,,,210.2,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher,Let's pause and let's let everybody look at the question,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,"And I want you to either circle or star, the word that you think is most important in that question",,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,I think you're on the right track,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, Question number one,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,I'm going to give you about five more seconds 4321,,,,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, Somebody raise your hand,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,"All right, so what did we decide was the most important word in that question",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher," Yes, ma'am",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,So that we can answer,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Farrah,Okay,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
130,Farrah, I think the most important word is equipment,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher,Why do you think equipment is the most important word,,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
130,Farrah,"Um, because it's like the first noun in the question",,,230.1,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher, What do you think the most important word is,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,"Okay, so we have the first noun what equipment and that's an excellent strategy to look at if our if our question is focused on on noun specific things",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,"But let's hold that yes, you have your hand raised",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Chris, I think the most important word is water,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
130,Chris,"Yeah okay, I'm Chris",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher, Why do you think water is the most important question or word,,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,Water now Chris,,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
130,Chris,"The whole the whole story is called water on the moon, so",,,230.1,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher, So we have water we have equipment,,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,And I think you're absolutely right that we need to look at our title,,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,"So can anybody summarize this article and tell me what water and equipment have, how did they work together in this article",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Oliver,  it's me Oliver,,,230.3,response,1,0,3
130,Oliver," Okay, so, um, so like there's water on the moon",,,230.3,response,1,0,3
130,Oliver,"Okay, I can do that",,,230.3,response,1,0,3
130,Oliver,They're looking for the water and then they find some water on but it's not a lot of water,,,,response,1,0,3
130,Oliver, So then they have to use a microscope to see the water,,,,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher,Perfect summary,,,120.3,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, Thank you so much for summer for us but I loved your summary,,,120.3,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher," And you mentioned one piece of equipment that's used, let's go back and look at paragraph one into",,,120.3,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, We know that we have to use oxygen in space,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,And see what equipment we use before the microscope,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher," And so, specifically in paragraph two, we have NASA sending not humans out because they need so much oxygen, but a different tool",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,When you have that tool identified or that piece of equipment,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, Go ahead and raise your hand,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Jazmin,Teacher,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher,"Yes, ma'am",,,,remark,1,0,3
130,Jazmin,I thought I did that so I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher,"So you did point out that NASA a small machine, but a microscope is a small machine, right",,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
130,Jazmin,RER: Yeah,,,210.3,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher, What was the name of the small machine that was used,,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,And we know that microscope isn't the only tool that's you,,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, Okay,,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, So can you give me a little bit more more detail in your answer,,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,See if you can find it,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Chris,If it's Jazmin's I saw that one,,,420.2,response,1,0,3
130,Chris, The name of its Lunar Orbiter,,,420.2,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher,Very good,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, So we have a small machine called a lunar orbiter so Jazmin's answer  Was was right,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, Almost there,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, And then Chris was able to help push that answer a little bit further to identify the Lunar Orbiter,,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,Teacher:,,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,"And we have found out that the lunar orbiter helps us find the water, which, in turn, we use the microscope, because we know that there's not a lot of water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
130,Chris,"You know what, I went to NASA",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher,That I love that,,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher," I wish I could go to NASA, but I'm very far away",,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,But I think that's really cool and and i love that you all have this experience about space and you all know that there's these different types of equipment that work together so,,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,Let's recap,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, Question one WHAT equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, What did we decide,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Oliver,Okay,,,120.2,response,1,0,3
130,Oliver," Well, you said that it was what Jazmin and Chris said, but I, I don't understand why me and Farrah are wrong",,,120.2,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher,Why the microscope is not the answer,,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
130,Farrah,Cuz that looks like it's still the answer to me,,,230.3,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher, We already know about the different types of equipment what keyword,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,"Okay, so let's look at our question",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher," Again, we have what equipment we used",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,"In this question, lets you know that we're looking for a specific piece of equipment",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Oliver, But I feel like that's not it now,,,210.2,response,1,0,3
130,Oliver,I thought it was something that would find some water,,,210.2,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher,"I think you, you're absolutely right",,,110.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, It is find water,,,110.4,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,The question uses the word discover which is the same as find,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,"So what we need to look at in our, in our article is what was the first piece of equipment that was used because discover is like when you find it for the first time, right",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
130,Oliver," Oh, OK",,,210.2,response,1,0,3
130,Oliver," OK, so the lunar orbiter comes before the microscope in the story",,,210.2,response,1,0,3
130,Oliver,Oh,,,210.2,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher,You are correct,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher,So do we do we understand why lunar orbiter is the correct answer to question number one,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, Very good,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
130,Oliver,Okay,,,150.1,response,1,0,3
130,Oliver," Um, yeah, it's cause it's cards",,,150.1,response,1,0,3
130,Oliver, It comes first in the story,,,150.1,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher,Very good,,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, So it comes first in the story,,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, And then we use the microscope to identify the water,,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
130,Oliver,"Okay, okay, well, it's time for us to go",,,230.3,response,1,0,3
130,Oliver," Um, so I want to take",,,230.3,response,1,0,3
130,Oliver, Thanks for coming to work with us and we'll see you next time,,,230.3,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher,Absolutely,,,,remark,1,0,3
130,Teacher, Thank you for having me,,,,remark,1,0,3
130,Oliver,Bye bye,,,,response,1,0,3
130,Teacher,Start simulation,,,,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,Hey kiddos,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher, And if there's evidence for and water not being valuable,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher, I'm seeing everybody's responses and it looks like we are split between water being valuable,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher, So looking at Question two,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,Yeah go ahead,,,,remark,2,0,3
130,Luis,Think I got this all figured out,,,,response,2,0,3
130,Luis," Now, so I'm all good",,,,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher,All right,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher, And what do you have figured out,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Luis,"Okay, so I read the story and I looked for the evidence and I pulled something right out of the story and not out of my big massive brain",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher," You did, in fact, your response is very good as finding pieces of text evidence",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,That is true,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,"My question for you would be how do you know that water is valuable, even if it can be split",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher, What can we use those two parts for would be my question to you,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Luis,Okay,,,210.3,response,2,0,3
130,Luis," I mean, I know that we can use oxygen to breathe",,,,response,2,0,3
130,Luis,Wow,,,,response,2,0,3
130,Luis, I don't remember what what you can use hydrogen for,,,,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher,So you're absolutely right,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher," We can use oxygen to breathe and that is one of the neat things about being able to find water in space is that we can use water on its own, which we use for what",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
130,Jazmin, That was my answer,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
130,Jazmin,We use it for drinking,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher, We can also use the oxygen for breathing,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,Absolutely,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher," Jazmin, we can use the water for drinking",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,But there are other ways in which we can use this water that's found on the moon,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,"So I want everyone to look at paragraph five, and see how else we can use The water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,Raise your hand when you find find an answer,,,120.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,2,0,3
130,Jazmin," Um, but then",,,,response,2,0,3
130,Jazmin,"Okay, so I see the thing that I said about how you could drink it",,,,response,2,0,3
130,Jazmin,In the paragraph five that you said there was a thing about how you can make fuel,,,,response,2,0,3
130,Jazmin, So the spacecraft can move,,,,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher, Okay,,,110.4,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,Absolutely,,,110.4,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher, So we can use water as rocket fuel,,,110.4,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,"Now how Jazmin, do you, can you tell me how we can use water as a rocket fuel because we can't just pour water in a rocket and make it go",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
130,Jazmin,No,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
130,Jazmin,"Okay, it says, oxygen, hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel, um,",,,,response,2,0,3
130,Jazmin,That's what it says,,,,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher, That is that is a great piece of text evidence,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,Right,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,Do you think we use the water plain water as rocket fuel or do we have to split the water and use those two separate parts,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher, You're right,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Jazmin,I guess it would be like how Luis said where you do split it,,,310.1,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher,Very good,,,110.4,remark,2,0,3
130,Jazmin,Good split it in two parts,,,110.4,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher,Absolutely,,,,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher," Yes, ma'am",,,,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher, So now my question to you,,,,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher, Farrah,,,,remark,2,0,3
130,Farrah,Oh yeah so I see what you're saying,,,,response,2,0,3
130,Farrah, But I'm still kind of confused,,,,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher,What are you confused about,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Farrah, But what the story says that I'm,,,230.1,response,2,0,3
130,Farrah, And so if if they're right that it could be valuable,,,230.1,response,2,0,3
130,Farrah,"Well, cuz I found a different answer",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
130,Farrah, It says that it will take a lot of time and energy,,,,response,2,0,3
130,Farrah,Okay,,,,response,2,0,3
130,Farrah," So it, it sounds like they don't actually have the time or the money to do it",,,,response,2,0,3
130,Farrah," So I said, no, not for a long time because then the next paragraph",,,,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher,but read the question to me one more time,,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,And I like your reasoning there because it's going to take time and money that that it would be difficult to get right now,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Farrah," Um, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,230.3,response,2,0,3
130,Farrah,Okay,,,230.3,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher,Alright so what I'm asking you is based on the ways we can use water do you think it is worth  Investing in,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,Do you think it is worth trying to get the water out of the moon,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
130,Farrah,"Okay, okay",,,210.2,response,2,0,3
130,Oliver,"Okay, well I have that same answer as Farrah, because I read that team para i i think i think yeah yeah",,,,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher,Why do you think it is a valuable resource Oliver,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Oliver, And then rocket fuel seems like pretty important you know you need rocket fuel in order to go to space,,,230.1,response,2,0,3
130,Oliver," I mean, like everybody needs to drink water",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
130,Oliver,Okay cause on the thing that Jazmin said about drinking it,,,230.1,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher, Can you think of any other reasons why water would be a valuable resource because based on what we've talked about today,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,Farrah,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,"Right, so we have water we have rocket fuel",,,110.4,remark,2,0,3
130,Farrah, The thing about us breathing the oxygen to,,,210.3,response,2,0,3
130,Farrah," Um, so I was thinking about what everybody said, and I'm",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
130,Farrah,Okay,,,210.3,response,2,0,3
130,Farrah," Oh yeah, I would say",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher, And I think breathing and staying alive in space is very important,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,"Right, so we can use it to breathe as well",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Farrah,"Yeah, I think so too",,,230.3,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher,"Oh, Farrah, would you change your answer or do you want to keep it the same as what you've already put down",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Farrah,"No, no, I would change it because now we can see that there's a bunch of stuff that that does say that waters valuable in the in the story",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher," Chris, what would you like to add",,,,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,Very good,,,,remark,2,0,3
130,Chris,"And well, I read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024",,,,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher,Whoa,,,,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,"That would be crazy if there's a moon base on the moon, then that means what, what do you think that would mean",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Chris,That they could use the fuel to like fill up the rocket and then to go back home,,,230.1,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher," We've already said it's valuable and we can put a moon base on the moon, then that means the water that we found can be used directly on the moon, which means what",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,"Yeah, so if we if we can find water and use it",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,If we can refill up on the moon,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,What do you think that would mean,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,"Go ahead, I'm sorry",,,,remark,2,0,3
130,Chris,"Um, if we call refill on the moon",,,,response,2,0,3
130,Chris,People wouldn't get stranded on the moon,,,,response,2,0,3
130,Teacher, What does it allow you to do if you have a way to fill up your car halfway through a trip,,,140.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher, So if you drive very far,,,140.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher," You are right, think about like a gas station",,,140.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher,They wouldn't get stranded,,,140.1,remark,2,0,3
130,Teacher, And you need to fill up on a gas station at a gas station,,,140.1,remark,2,0,3

131,Teacher, Okay,,,220.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, And we are going to look at it again and we're going to see if we can dig deeper together and figure out a more precise answer something with a little bit more evidence,,,220.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,Yeah well that's good that you corrected your answer,,,220.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Luis,"Okay, yeah, I can stick around for that right",,,220.1,response,1,1,4

131,Teacher,I'm glad you're joining us,,,,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, That way we can answer the question,,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, You guys are going to be looking for key words in the question important words that you could look for back in your text,,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,"But what I want to do before we start, is take a minute and look back at question number one",,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, So take just a second,,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,"Okay, who would like to share  A keyword that they found",,,,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, Did you find,,,,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,Oliver what keyword,,,,remark,1,1,4
131,Oliver,"Okay, so I found the keyword",,,,response,1,1,4
131,Oliver, I thought equipment was really important,,,,response,1,1,4
131,Teacher, I do believe that that is a correct answer,,,110.4,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher," So, good job there,",,,110.4,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,did anybody find a different word than equipment in question one,,,130.2,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,That's wonderful,,,110.4,remark,1,1,4
131,Chris,Um yeah I I thought water was the important word,,,130.2,response,1,1,4
131,Teacher, It says that the whole time throughout the article,,,210.3,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,"Okay so water is important, but how many since the article is about water",,,210.3,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,So what's another word,,,120.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, What's another keyword somebody else found,,,130.2,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,Somebody help Chris out what is another word that is maybe only said once or twice that we could look for in the text,,,130.2,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,"Jazmin, what did you find",,,,remark,1,1,4
131,Jazmin," And so I thought, is like you think the equipment that then you're like discovering using the equipment",,,,response,1,1,4
131,Jazmin," So I thought, discover",,,,response,1,1,4
131,Jazmin,So for me I thought discover was maybe the most important keywords,,,,response,1,1,4
131,Teacher,"Yeah, I agree, equipment and discover are two very important keywords for our question number one",,,230.3,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,and I know that some people had mentioned microscope are being microscopic,,,230.3,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,"Okay, so now that we know that we're looking for equipment that discovered it,",,,210.2,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher," So that is in Question or paragraph number two, or a paragraph number three is where they talk about using the microscope",,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,But let's go back and look at where it talks about the microscope,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, Do you have a question,,,,remark,1,1,4
131,Farrah,"Oh yeah, I was just gonna say I had changed my answer",,,,response,1,1,4
131,Teacher, I do like that you what you changed your answer to,,,220.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, Okay,,,220.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, And we're going to hang out,,,220.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, We're going to help other people in this group use that same thought process,,,220.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, And so we are going to use some of what you thought and how you got to your answer,,,220.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,"Yes, I noticed that you changed your answer",,,220.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Farrah,Thank you,,,220.1,response,1,1,4
131,Teacher," And remember, we are looking for the words equipment and discover",,,420.3,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, Let me know if you find either of those words in that paragraph,,,420.3,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,"Okay, so if we are looking in paragraph number three, look and reread that real quick",,,420.3,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,"Alright, Chris, what did you notice from paragraph three",,,,remark,1,1,4
131,Chris,They said that the waters microscopic,,,,response,1,1,4
131,Chris," But you said that will actually okay, you said that that wasn't Like all over the text",,,,response,1,1,4
131,Chris," And so I thought, like if that was a key word than that",,,,response,1,1,4
131,Chris, The water they found because I was thinking discover like that keyword and and i thought found was the word,,,,response,1,1,4
131,Chris,"So actually what I was looking at is that they said you need the water, they found that was it",,,,response,1,1,4
131,Teacher, So once you've discovered it,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,now Farrah in your answer in your response you named a type of machine,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, And now you can look at it,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, So the microscope is what's looking at it,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, Now you found it,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,Yeah so found and discover they play hand in hand with each other,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, What was that machine,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
131,Farrah,"In my, in my revised response",,,210.4,response,1,1,4
131,Farrah, Yeah,,,210.4,response,1,1,4
131,Farrah,So I said the lunar orbiter was how they discovered the little bits of water,,,,response,1,1,4
131,Teacher, Where did you find your answer for lunar orbiter were in the text did you find that?,,,230.2,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,"Yeah, and Farrah",,,230.2,remark,1,1,4
131,Farrah,"So I saw it in paragraph two, and that was, yeah, that was right",,,230.2,response,1,1,4
131,Teacher," All right, Chris",,,,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,"Well, good",,,,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, Do you have a question,,,,remark,1,1,4
131,Chris,"Yeah, I just wanted to check actually that okay, is my new answer okay? it's the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic",,,,response,1,1,4
131,Teacher, What were the key words,,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher," But what were, what was the keywords in number one",,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher,And your answer is closer to a correct answer,,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
131,Chris,"Um, okay",,,420.1,response,1,1,4
131,Chris, It was equipment and discover right,,,420.1,response,1,1,4
131,Chris, It wasn't water,,,420.1,response,1,1,4
131,Teacher,Correct,,,410.2,remark,1,1,4
131,Teacher, So in your answer does it talk about any equipment that discovered the water,,,410.2,remark,1,1,4
131,Chris," So I didn't really answer the question, I just was I did",,,410.2,response,1,1,4
131,Chris, I understand,,,410.2,response,1,1,4

131,Luis, Hi,,,,response,2,1,4
131,Luis, So I think I'm all good,,,,response,2,1,4
131,Teacher,"Well, let's double check our answers",,,150.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, OK,,,150.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, The way that it's asking us to,,,150.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, That way we know for sure that we have answered the question,,,150.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Luis,OK,,,150.1,response,2,1,4
131,Teacher,"So moving on to question number two it says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, Okay,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, Keywords something important to help us find it back in the text,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,"So we are going to use the same strategy, the same technique and take about 30 seconds and find any keywords in that question",,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,"All right, good job",,,,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher," What, word did you find?",,,,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,"Farrah, you found a word",,,,remark,2,1,4
131,Farrah, And then valuable,,,,response,2,1,4
131,Farrah,I thought was like my keyword was convincing,,,,response,2,1,4
131,Teacher," And I do like valuable, valuable is a good one",,,130.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, Convincing what? what are we being convinced of,,,130.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, Does anybody have a word to go along with savannas word convincing,,,130.2,remark,2,1,4

131,Teacher, Also convincing,,,130.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,"Chris, what did you find",,,,remark,2,1,4
131,Chris, So like I guess it goes together like convincing evidence,,,,response,2,1,4
131,Chris,"Um, well, I said evidence as as well",,,,response,2,1,4
131,Teacher,"Yeah, exactly",,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher," That was a great thought process, putting those two together",,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, Okay so convincing evidence and valuable,,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,So we know what headings are in our text,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, The first heading is the moon is a desert,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher," It's the bolted words, who can read to me what the second heading is",,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, So there are two headings here,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,"Jazmin, what is the second heading",,,120.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Jazmin,Water is a valuable resource,,,120.1,response,2,1,4
131,Teacher,Excellent,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, Have we already found from this heading,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4

131,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,2,1,4
131,Jazmin,"Well, actually, I was just saying I'm still kind of confused",,,,response,2,1,4
131,Teacher," We're trying to find those words back in the text, so that we know what answer to give",,,220.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,"Okay, so when we are reading our question and we have found those keywords",,,220.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,So Jazmin your answer That they can drink water and stay hydrated is a very good answer,,,110.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, And it is mentioned here in the text,,,110.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,There are a couple other of your friends that are needing a little bit help with the guidance of where to find their answers,,,150.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,So the best place to start is the key words in the question and then going back to those headings to try and see if we can look underneath that heading for an answer,,,420.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Jazmin,Did I give like convincing evidence in my answer?,,,420.2,response,2,1,4
131,Teacher,"You did, um",,,110.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Jazmin,"Yeah, cuz I said that, yes, that there's convincing evidence and I said astronaut drink the water and stay hydrated and that you can't survive without water",,,110.2,response,2,1,4
131,Teacher, And that is correct,,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, And I like that you found that because you did find a in paragraph four right under that heading so that helped lead you in the right direction,,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,Yes,,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, Is that the only paragraph that provides us with convincing evidence?,,,230.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,No? where else has somebody found something that's convincing evidence,,,230.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,2,1,4
131,Luis, Like we should read it closely,,,,response,2,1,4
131,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,2,1,4
131,Luis," So for me, like, okay, so I was looking at the text this time because you were saying we should do that",,,,response,2,1,4
131,Luis,"And I thought that like convincing evidence is like the fact that I even it's all the paragraphs like it says in paragraph four,",,,,response,2,1,4
131,Luis,Water on the moon could be valuable useful in lots of ways could be astronauts could drink it,,,,response,2,1,4
131,Luis," And then also, in paragraph five, it says moon water could be useful in other ways",,,,response,2,1,4
131,Luis, It can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen,,,,response,2,1,4
131,Teacher, But have we thought about how hydrogen and oxygen,,,410.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, And I like the way that you've gone back and put the key words from the question with your answer,,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,That is correct,,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,What what they what those parts are going to be used for how are they going to use oxygen,,,230.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, How are they going to use the hydrogen?,,,230.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, Okay so y'all talk about it for a minute and let us know in just a second,,,420.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,"Yeah, so you and Jazmin",,,420.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, Okay,,,420.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, Y'all see if you can figure out how they are going to use oxygen and how they are going to use hydrogen,,,420.2,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher,"All right, Oliver",,,,remark,2,1,4
131,Teacher, Do you have a question,,,,remark,2,1,4
131,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,,response,2,1,4

131,Luis,"I shouldn't be on this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,4
131,Teacher,I know I could tell by your answer that you really enjoy space that you know that they use oxygen tanks to be up in space and to explore up there,,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher,So did they need oxygen tanks on the moon,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher, But the question was what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher,And I think that's super cool,,,120.2,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher, ,,,120.2,remark,0,1,4

131,Jazmin," And that's a word to look for like equipment machine, you know?",,,210.2,response,0,1,4
131,Teacher, Is there a title of that machine,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher, Is there a name of that machine in number two?,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher,That is true,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Jazmin,The lunar orbiter,,,210.3,response,0,1,4
131,Teacher, So with the Lunar Orbiter,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher,Yes,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher, they're looking for,,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher," It's not capitalized like your name, Jazmin's capitalized, Chris is not is capitalized, but lunar orbiter is not",,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher,"So you were extremely, extremely close",,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher," But when it says, called a lunar orbiter that's the title and that would be the answer",,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher,And that is the name,,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Jazmin,Thank you,,,110.1,response,0,1,4
131,Teacher,"You are welcome and, Chris, you looked at, found craters full of water on the moon",,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher, Right?,,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher,Do you think that--,,,,remark,0,1,4
131,Chris," But then the craters, like it's got all this water in it",,,,response,0,1,4
131,Chris,"Yeah yeah cuz I found that in the in the story, like it was really cool that they have all these craters and like and and they thought the moon was a desert",,,,response,0,1,4
131,Teacher," And that's what this question here is asking, what did they use",,,120.2,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher,"Yeah, so it would be cool to to if you went home and told your mom and dad about this story then to know what they used right so that's where the question is coming from because what if your parents asked you, what did they use",,,120.2,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher,"So, reading back through and what Jazmin had just talked about with this small machine",,,120.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Chris,"Want me to read, read, where I got my answer from or you want me to read where Jazmin got her answer from?",,,120.3,response,0,1,4
131,Teacher,"Where did you get your answer from, Chris",,,230.2,remark,0,1,4
131,Chris," So that's, that's where I got my part",,,230.2,response,0,1,4
131,Chris,"My answer from the first part where it talks about the the craters because it says, scientists have evidence, the water can be found deep within the moon polar craters",,,230.2,response,0,1,4
131,Chris,"But I do hear what you said about like, why, what did they use to find the polar craters, I guess",,,,response,0,1,4
131,Teacher,"Yeah, and after number one where you got your answer, did you read the rest of the response",,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher, The rest of the article?,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Chris,Yeah,,,210.3,response,0,1,4
131,Chris," Yeah, I read the whole thing and and I wanted to tell you when you were talking Luis about, you know, the oxygen tanks, that I went to NASA with my dad and so I know also that like scientists use a lot of different equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, too",,,210.3,response,0,1,4
131,Teacher, That's super cool,,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher,Yeah and this lunar orbiter like we are talking about,,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Chris,"So yeah, I think I might have seen that at NASA, I just realized that, cool",,,110.3,response,0,1,4
131,Teacher,"Yeah, so, Farrah, you talked about the microscope",,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher,Where did you find your answer?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,4
131,Farrah,"It was in paragraph three when it says, the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,230.2,response,0,1,4
131,Teacher," Was there a microscope up there on the moon that they use to look at it, or do they need them something else before they could use the microscope",,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher,"Yeah, so they did talk about using a microscope and that is equipment, but is that what they used on the moon",,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
131,Oliver,"Well, I have the same answer as Farrah, and I remember when I was looking in the story, it was saying, the water they found is microscopic I'm told me that they found the water and and and it says you need a microscope so I figure, they must have brought a microscope to to see the water",,,210.3,response,0,1,4
131,Teacher,"That's true, but, that is true",,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
131,Teacher, So with the microscope--,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
131,Oliver," I know this was really short and and we just met, but",,,110.1,response,0,1,4
131,Oliver,I'm sorry,,,110.1,response,0,1,4
131,Oliver, I'm sorry to interrupt teacher,,,110.1,response,0,1,4

132,Luis,"Yeah, sure",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
132,Luis," Okay, so like astronauts go to space cuz are looking for water on the moon",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
132,Luis," That's how you get from, you know, like from from the Earth to the Moon",,,,response,0,0,3
132,Luis,"And they, they have to wear as spacesuits because they can't breathe on the moon, and they go up in their space shuttle",,,,response,0,0,3
132,Luis,Those are some facts about space that I know,,,,response,0,0,3
132,Teacher,"Do you know what people are called when they go to space, like what is their job title",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
132,Luis,"Yeah, they're astronauts",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
132,Teacher,Exactly,,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher, Does anybody remember the name of that piece of equipment,,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher, So in that reading piece astronauts went to space and the company called NASA sent a piece of equipment up to space,,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
132,Farrah,I think the equipment was a microscope,,,130.2,response,0,0,3
132,Oliver,I had a microscope too,,,,response,0,0,3
132,Teacher, Do you remember?,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher,They used a microscope,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher, But what was the name of the machine that they needed to use in space,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
132,Oliver,"Well, a microscope is a machine",,,210.3,response,0,0,3
132,Teacher, So in the text,,,130.3,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher,Nope,,,130.3,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher," It said, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,130.3,remark,0,0,3
132,Jazmin," I said that NASA since the small machine, but I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,130.3,response,0,0,3
132,Jazmin,That's close to my idea cuz I said in my answer,,,130.3,response,0,0,3
132,Teacher," But if you want it to be more specific in an answer a good answer, you could have said NASA sent a small machine and it is called a lunar orbiter",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher," So Jazmin, you were on the right track",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher,That is correct,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher,"And then Farrah, can you explain your answer",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
132,Farrah,"Yeah, sure",,,120.4,response,0,0,3
132,Farrah," Okay, like in the third paragraph, they were talking about finding the water and it said the water they found is microscopic",,,120.4,response,0,0,3
132,Farrah," So I was thinking, you know, like a scientific tool is kind of same thing you know as equipment",,,,response,0,0,3
132,Farrah, So that's how I came up with that answer,,,,response,0,0,3
132,Farrah,And then it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,0,0,3
132,Teacher,Good job,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher," Oliver, what made you come up with your answer choice",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
132,Oliver, So I was looking for a place where they talked about discovering the water,,,230.1,response,0,0,3
132,Oliver, And I know that we have to find equipment,,,230.1,response,0,0,3
132,Oliver,"Well, I know that the question was asking for water",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
132,Oliver," And that was what the question was asking about, finding water",,,,response,0,0,3
132,Oliver,"in paragraph three, it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it",,,,response,0,0,3
132,Oliver, So kind of like what Farrah was saying about how microscope is a tool,,,,response,0,0,3
132,Oliver," Yeah, that's what I have",,,,response,0,0,3
132,Oliver, You need to have a tool called a microscope,,,,response,0,0,3
132,Oliver," I was thinking, you know, like how you said, um like, is equipment and the paragraph says that they found the water",,,,response,0,0,3
132,Teacher, How did you come up with that answer,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher,"Chris, when you talk about scientists found craters will have water on the moon",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
132,Chris," Cuz question was asking, you know them, finding the water like like how Oliver said, so I was looking at the text",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
132,Chris,"Yeah, sure",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
132,Chris,"Okay, where do they find the water and it says in paragraph one that at first they didn't think that there was any water and they realized that they were wrong and they found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar crater",,,,response,0,0,3
132,Chris," So like, that's where I found my answer",,,,response,0,0,3
132,Teacher,"Okay, so if we go back and we look at this reading passage, does anybody know any reading skills we could have used to have answered these questions",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher, What key pieces could we have highlighted in the passage to help us answer this question,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
132,Chris," You know, I also want to tell you that I went to NASA",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
132,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
132,Chris, And so that's how I use that,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
132,Chris," So I just, I found that found and water",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
132,Chris,"I highlighted the part in the question that says discovery water, but I didn't see discovering there",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
132,Teacher," Chris when you hear the word equipment, what comes to mind",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher,Exactly,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
132,Chris,"Like those oxygen tanks, so that they breathe and like, there's the suit so that they don't like freeze to death, you know,",,,210.2,response,0,0,3
132,Teacher,"Good, so we can take the word equipment and we know that equipment means a physical object",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher, And then we need to find the equipment,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher, So when we're reading the passage and looking for this answer we know that we want to find physical objects that scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher, We know that water has been found on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher, So when we read this passage,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher,So as you're reading what physical objects came in the passage to your mind,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
132,,Like in paragraph two,,,210.4,,0,0,3
132,Chris,"NASA send a small machine called the lunar orbiter, Lunar Orbiter",,,,response,0,0,3
132,Chris," Okay, that's the one that Jazmin said, I think",,,,response,0,0,3
132,Chris," Glasses is is an object, but that's not that's not so I mean it's the same one that Jazmin said right? The small machine called the Lunar Orbiter, right?",,,,response,0,0,3
132,Chris,"And they say, that's like four Glasses",,,,response,0,0,3
132,Teacher, So when we're reading and we know that we want to look for equipment,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3

132,Teacher,"Yes, NASA used a small machine",,,110.4,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher,Wery good job,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
132,Teacher,"And then, to be more specific in our answer we could have put the name what and what is that machine called?",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
132,Oliver, And you said it,,,420.2,response,0,0,3
132,Oliver,I definitely well i i know it's called a lunar orbiter cuz I'm Chris just set it and Jazmin said it too,,,420.2,response,0,0,3

132,Teacher,Luis Do you have a question,,,,remark,1,0,3
132,Luis,"Um, yeah, basically, I was just gonna say like I kind of know all ready all about space",,,,response,1,0,3
132,Luis, So I don't think I need to be in this room,,,,response,1,0,3
132,Teacher," Okay, so",,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,And if you I would like you to use your knowledge that you already know to share with the other students in the group,,,110.3,remark,1,0,3

132,Luis,"Yeah, I can do that",,,110.3,response,1,0,3
132,Teacher,Today we are going to look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,Circle evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,So you guys have already came up with an answer to this question,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,And I want you guys to first start with looking back in the question I want you to either underline highlight or circle key,,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,Word in our question that we need to use to help us answer this question,,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher, So take about 30 seconds to look back over the question and I want you to circle the key words in this question,,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher," So, Farrah and Oliver YouTube can talk Chris and Jazmin, you can talk",,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher, I would like for you to turn to the person beside you,,,130.2,remark,1,0,3

132,Teacher,Do you underline,,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
132,Luis," Let's see, when I looked at it I underlined equipment and",,,210.3,response,1,0,3
132,Luis,"Yeah, so I underlined",,,210.3,response,1,0,3
132,Luis,I'm um I underlined equipment that was the main word that I underline,,,,response,1,0,3
132,Luis,OK,,,,response,1,0,3
132,Teacher,OK,,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher, So now that you've had time to share with the person beside you,,,210.3,remark,1,0,3

132,Farrah," Okay, so what we underlined when we were looking at it we underlined",,,210.3,response,1,0,3
132,Farrah,"Yeah, absolutely",,,210.3,response,1,0,3
132,Farrah,"And discover and I was just gonna say like I was kind of wondering if I was to kind of use, like what my answer was wrong",,,,response,1,0,3
132,Teacher, What words did you guys underline,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher," I like how you underline the equipment and discover because those are the two key words to help us answer this question, Chris and Jazmin",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,"Okay, and good",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,"Okay, we will get to that in just a second",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
132,Chris,So we actually had a kind of a decision about,,,210.2,response,1,0,3
132,Chris,My so I underlined up with Ben and water and Jazmin underlying discovery,,,,response,1,0,3
132,Teacher, Why did you underline discover,,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,"Okay, Justin",,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
132,Jazmin,"And so basically I repeat visits as he like the question say like, what did they use to define the water or like discovered the water so it seems like that would be",,,230.1,response,1,0,3
132,Jazmin,An important thing to look for,,,,response,1,0,3
132,Teacher,That's correct discover is the verb that is going to help us answer this question,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher, So the equipment used to discover that is how you know what type of equipment you wanted to find so,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,talk about your answers and how you could have improved those answers to be more specific to,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,"I want you guys to talk about with that same partner,",,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,"So, Farrah and Deb, you talk together Chris and Jazmin, you talk and then Luis You can you can talk with me",,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,That question by using the two words that you guys underlined as keywords,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,So Luis You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher, How could you be more specific to the passage,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
132,Luis,"Um, you mean like to the reading",,,420.2,response,1,0,3
132,Teacher,Yes,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher," So, you are correct on how scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,But if you were to underline the words equipment and discover how,,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,"What equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon oxygen piece of equipment, but it doesn't really go with the water on the moon",,,410.1,remark,1,0,3
132,Luis,"So, so I",,,410.1,response,1,0,3
132,Teacher," Again, I",,,,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,Question,,,,remark,1,0,3
132,Luis,Guess more specific,,,,response,1,0,3
132,Luis,"Well, I guess, like, I guess I'm not totally sure like what what to look for, because I thought like the equipment was anything that they",,,,response,1,0,3
132,Luis,"You know, anything that they use to like find the water so like if they were on the moon, they'd have to use like suits and masks and stuff",,,,response,1,0,3
132,Luis," Um, but, like, you know what I mean, like,",,,,response,1,0,3
132,Luis," Like, what",,,,response,1,0,3
132,Luis,I'm not quite sure,,,,response,1,0,3
132,Luis,Else like to say,,,,response,1,0,3
132,Teacher,"Well, that's why it's important that we know the action which is discover water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,So we can look back in our texts and find where it talks about a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher,"And in the text it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher, Can you point to it,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
132,Teacher, Can you show me where it says that in the text,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3

132,Farrah,"You know, like, I think that the microscope was what they use like it feels like",,,,response,1,0,3
132,Farrah,I guess I don't know,,,,response,1,0,3
132,Farrah,Does it seem like that,,,,response,1,0,3
132,Farrah, But thank you so much,,,,response,1,0,3
132,Farrah,"Was what they used to find the water because they said in the in the writing that you couldn't see the water, unless you use the microscope",,,,response,1,0,3
132,Farrah," So I was thinking like, that's what they used to discover and unfortunately, we have to go to our next class",,,,response,1,0,3
132,Farrah, Okay,,,,response,1,0,3
132,Teacher,"Yes, I can see you now",,,,remark,2,0,3

132,Teacher,keywords in questions to help us better answer questions,,,220.1,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,Okay,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher," So we need to be more specific, when answering our questions",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,So I want you to take a look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,So I want you to take a couple seconds and talk to the person but Sachi,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,Circle that evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question,,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher, So what keywords help us answer this question,,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,"About what words, can we underline in that question to help us answer the question",,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,"So, Farrah and Deb, you can work together",,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher, Chris and gel together and Luis You can work with me,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher," Okay, so take a couple seconds",,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,"Luis What key words, could we underline in this question to help us answer with the best answer",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Luis, I underlined equipment,,,210.3,response,2,0,3
132,Luis,So I put in for my answer,,,210.3,response,2,0,3
132,Teacher, Is there another word in that question to help us under to help us answer the question,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,Okay,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher," I like how you underlined equipment that is a good word to underline, you are correct",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Luis,"Um, well, maybe discover",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
132,Teacher, Discover and equipment are two very important question or two very important words in this question,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher," Okay guys, so let's come back together as a group",,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,I like how you said discovered that is correct,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher, Can one of you tell me what words you guys underline,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,That may not in depth,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Farrah," Okay, so the underlying",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
132,Farrah,Oh yeah,,,210.3,response,2,0,3
132,Farrah,Reach Every Reader:equipment and discover,,,,response,2,0,3
132,Teacher, It's wanting to know a piece of equipment that scientists did use and then discover is our action word,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,Great,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher, So those are two correct words that you would want to underline in that question because the equipment,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,To help us answer this question,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,So I want you guys to look at the answer that you put for this question,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher," I want you to read over your answer and I want you to think to yourself, how could you be more specific, when answering this question to take a couple seconds to look at your spot",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher, How could you be more specific and answering your and your answer,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher," Yes, Jazmin",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,Jazmin,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Jazmin,"Well, I guess I was just gonna ask if",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
132,Jazmin,"If, if we should all answer, but it sounds like we should actually under sure like",,,,response,2,0,3
132,Jazmin," And I realized that should be more specific, but like you said, totally sure like how I should be more specific",,,,response,2,0,3
132,Jazmin,Which is why my answers wrong,,,,response,2,0,3
132,Teacher, You could have put NASA send a small machine and gave the name,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,"So if you look back in the text and paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,"Your right NASA did send a small machine, but to give a more specific and best answer",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,So I appreciate you looking at your,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,Answer and asking why,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
132,Jazmin, So he needs to say like,,,310.1,response,2,0,3
132,Jazmin,It makes sense,,,310.1,response,2,0,3
132,Jazmin,Like he might be more specific about like what it is,,,,response,2,0,3
132,Teacher,Farrah,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,You are correct,,,520.1,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher, How could you be more specific in your answer,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher," So next time you have a question, you can underline your keywords to help you be more specific,",,,520.1,remark,2,0,3
132,Farrah,I'm,,,520.1,response,2,0,3
132,Farrah,I'm not totally sure,,,,response,2,0,3
132,Farrah, I think I feel like our answer is right,,,,response,2,0,3
132,Farrah,Each,,,,response,2,0,3
132,Teacher, But the question asked about discovering water on the main so what specific tool,,,410.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher, That is correct,,,410.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher, This scientist used to discover water on the moon,,,410.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher, That is a tool that they use,,,410.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,"Okay, you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,410.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,Teacherr: So how could you look back,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,To find that answer,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Farrah,"Well, I guess when I think about discovering the pot",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
132,Farrah," I think like they used the microscope, because they they say in the in the meeting that they can't see the water, unless they look through my school so I thought like, that's how they discuss",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
132,Teacher, I like how you're making that connection,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,Okay,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,Chris,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher, Did you notice how anything that you could be more specific and your answer,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Chris,"Well I, I went to NASA with my dad and I know that, um, you know, scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks asks, and",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
132,Chris,"So I guess like should I, should I add that to my answer",,,,response,2,0,3
132,Teacher,"Well, I like how you're bringing in that prior knowledge that you already know to help you answer this question",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher, So that's when you would want to refer back to the text,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher, So when it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,"But yes, it's looking for something specific",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,"That is when you would want to look back into the text to find your answer because you already know they use various tools, like you said, a mask",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,Microscope and stuff like that,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher, But then there's one specific tool that it states in the text that that is why you would want to look back in the text to find your answer,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
132,,So is the tool,,,420.2,,2,0,3
132,," I guess I'm wondering, like, is it like we're still or it sounds like the other one that just was still",,,420.2,,2,0,3
132,Teacher,"The correct answer is Masterson a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, because that is this specific piece of equipment that scientist used to discover water on the moon",,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher, So you can be give the best answer,,,510.1,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,"So, that is why it's very important to highlight those keywords",,,510.1,remark,2,0,3
132,Teacher,"Def, do you have a question",,,,remark,2,0,3
132,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,,response,2,0,3
132,Oliver, But before we go to lunch,,,,response,2,0,3
132,Oliver, I just really wanted to thank you for working with us and I especially want to do that,,,,response,2,0,3
132,Oliver," Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,,response,2,0,3
132,Oliver,Like that,,,,response,2,0,3
132,Oliver, Thank you for helping us really focus on the word discover and like really focusing on like how important that word is,,,,response,2,0,3
132,Oliver, So thank you so much,,,,response,2,0,3
132,Oliver,"And like also like you really encouraged us to use evidence from the text and, like, make sure that we were on that, like we were looking at the text for what we were saying, um, I really appreciate that was really fun working with",,,,response,2,0,3
133,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,So I've heard all,,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,1,2
133,Luis," So, like, I don't really think I need to be in this group",,,,response,1,1,2
133,Luis, I don't need any help,,,,response,1,1,2
133,Luis, Like all this stuff about space,,,,response,1,1,2
133,Luis," So I was just thinking, and I wanted to share that basically like I already know",,,,response,1,1,2
133,Teacher,"Well, Luis",,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,For me response,,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,"And who knows, you might even learn something new, as",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, You do know quite a lot,,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, So maybe you can actually help me teach the other students here,,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,I might as well as well to,,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Luis,Know to,,,,response,1,1,2
133,Luis,Do that,,,,response,1,1,2
133,Luis, Yeah,,,,response,1,1,2
133,Teacher,So I saw responses and Oliver,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher," My question for you just, you said that you sort of the same thing is Farrah",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, So can you explain how you also got the same answer for me,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Oliver," And the reason why I thought that, and I think it's like",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
133,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
133,Oliver," So basically what I was thinking about was that, um, you know, like that the microscope was was the tool",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
133,Oliver,"Pretty, pretty important is like so, like, is it's in the text because it says like, you know, we use a microscope or you couldn't see the water",,,,response,1,1,2
133,Teacher," I know exactly where it's at the text as well, I believe, part three of the first pair first section",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher," So, good job there Oliveron are deaf",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, Sorry,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,"Yes, exactly",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,And thank you,,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,"So I think that if we are able to work together and kind of pull their resources in there, we can come up with the right answer",,,220.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,And I think that with all of her answers,,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, We're all getting on the right track,,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,But how about,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher," Oh, yes",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher," First, we go back to the question itself",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, Jazmin,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
133,Jazmin,"Well, I was just when you say I wasn't sure why",,,120.3,response,1,1,2
133,Jazmin,"Why, my answer was Bob, do you mean like I just wasn't quite sure",,,,response,1,1,2
133,Teacher, They didn't use machinery,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, I think whenever we talked about the question you get to find out that you're actually went wrong,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, You were,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,I'm not saying I'm not saying it's wrong,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,You are getting to the right answer,,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,"So I think, I think you're gonna help us learn some stuff too",,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,So going back to the question right which so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, So going over that,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, So just for a second here,,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, Go back to the question maybe underline what you think the main parts of that question is what you need to get out of it,,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,"What are the some of the main, main words in that sentence",,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, You can raise your hand,,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,"And whenever you're ready, just let me know",,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin Oh",,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher," So, Farrah",,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,"OK, I think we're all there",,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,What did you get out of the question,,,120.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Farrah,I underlined it,,,120.1,response,1,1,2
133,Teacher,"Okay, so equipment and discover did anyone else underlying equipment",,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, I think that's what it's mainly asking,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,"Okay, so we all did",,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, So we know that scientists discovered water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, So we know that part already,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,So now we get to figure out with the equipment was,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,And Chris even pointed out in your part that scientists found craters will have water on the moon,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,"And so, Farrah and Oliver your answers are the same so you both said that they, the water is microscopic right",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,What does that mean that the water is microscopic,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
133,,"Um, it's like really small",,,210.4,,1,1,2
133,Teacher, What do you need to see the water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,Yes,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, And so from the passage Oliver,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Oliver,And you need a microscope to see the water,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
133,Teacher,In a microscope so,,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,"Luis Let's uh, let's start with you for a second",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, So for equipment from the passage,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, The moon is a desert,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,What equipment or do you see mentioned in there,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Luis,And I see,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
133,Luis,And I guess like,,,,response,1,1,2
133,Luis, Yeah,,,,response,1,1,2
133,Luis, And I think that Chris had the same question,,,,response,1,1,2
133,Luis," I was wondering, like,",,,,response,1,1,2
133,Luis,"Well, okay, so I that's a question I have",,,,response,1,1,2
133,Chris, Like Luis's answer,,,,response,1,1,2
133,Chris,That okay so here's what I thought like I've been to NASA with my dad and we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and suits and stuff like that,,,,response,1,1,2
133,Chris, So I was thinking that like,,,,response,1,1,2
133,Chris,I'm wondering why that wasn't the answer,,,,response,1,1,2
133,Teacher,So talking about equipment that can be anything from a microscope to a giant rocket or anything,,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,"So I think what might help us is to maybe, you know, over the passage, a little bit",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, I think specifically part to see if we can all find the passage,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,And,,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,Why you're looking through that Jazmin here response,,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, Do you want to repeat that for me what your response was to the question,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,Jimmy,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Jazmin,"Yeah, I was this, I said yes",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
133,Jazmin,Nasa sent a small machine,,,,response,1,1,2
133,Teacher, And what was that small machine called,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, Do you remember,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,Yes,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Jazmin,"Yeah, it was just or big",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
133,Teacher,that would also count as a piece of equipment,,,110.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, Right,,,110.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, Ruth me that,,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, And so a finch you buy it,,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,So we know the water is there and so,,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,And Jazmin,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher, Why was the lunar orbiter sent to the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
133,Teacher,Oh yes so,,,,remark,1,1,2
133,Farrah,The next group has to come in,,,,response,1,1,2
133,Farrah, But I just wanted to thank you so much for being with us before we have to be to thank you so much for everything,,,,response,1,1,2
133,Luis,"Um, yeah, I just wanted to remind everybody that my dad is actually an astronaut",,,,response,2,1,2
133,Luis,I just wanted everybody didn't know that,,,,response,2,1,2
133,Teacher,"Well, thank you for letting us know Luis",,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher,"Hopefully one day, Kevin",,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher, Unless I'm tell us a little bit about his experience there as well,,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
133,Luis,Yeah,,,110.3,response,2,1,2
133,Teacher,"So, Jazmin, I'd asked you about",,,,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher,"The Lunar Orbiter and so I guess for Luis Chris, I have",,,,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher, So you had both mentioned the fact that water is found in Luis You had mentioned equipment they had been used,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher,One question for you guys,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher,So from the passage itself because you had mentioned oxygen tanks and and other things from the passage,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher, What were some specific pieces of equipment that you see in the passage,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
133,Luis,"Oh, so like I gotta do like",,,230.2,response,2,1,2
133,Luis,From not my like knowledge but like from the passage,,,,response,2,1,2
133,Luis," Um, well, yeah, I saw you that I knew were kind of cool, like I saw that I'm",,,,response,2,1,2
133,Luis,"Like there was the Lunar Orbiter, which is a really cool spacecraft and then there was also like a talked about microscopes, but I don't think microscopes are the answer",,,,response,2,1,2
133,Teacher,What do you say that,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
133,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
133,Luis, I think that why like here's my thinking on this like,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
133,Luis, Well actually it's a really good question,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
133,Luis," And I'm thinking, well, maybe they studied the water with the microscope, but they discovered it right with the learner or so that's what I was thinking like as we as we look",,,,response,2,1,2
133,Luis,"I think that they asking the question, they're like, what equipment it scientists use discover water on the moon",,,,response,2,1,2
133,Teacher," So,",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher,"Okay, I can see how you got there, I can see I can see that",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher,"Good job, they're reading into that",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher, So,,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher," So you can have what we talked with Farrah, and Oliver here, right, which, if you don't mind",,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher,I guess,,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher,Effort there for you for the water,,,,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher, What did,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher, What did,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher, How was the water described in the passage,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher,How small was it,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
133,Oliver,"Um, so they said the water was like they said microscopic which is crazy small",,,210.4,response,2,1,2
133,Teacher,Yeah,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher," And so, so we know the water, the water is there",,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher, Right,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher," I mean, Chris you even said yourself that they found craters full of water on the moon",,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
133,Chris,Yeah,,,230.3,response,2,1,2
133,Teacher," So if the water is microscopic Chris, can we just see it from, let's say, a lunar orbiter above the above the moon, or do we have to see it with a special kind of equipment",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher,"Yeah, so I guess Chris also soften your answer",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
133,Chris, I'm not sure,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
133,Chris," Because you could do a scanner or like, something like that",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
133,Chris, So maybe you didn't need the microscope,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
133,Chris,"Well, I guess I'm not sure like which equipment",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
133,Chris, Exactly,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
133,Chris," You know what I mean, like, I'm assuming they're like Probes stuff like that",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
133,Teacher,"Well, how about we look at The passage there",,,,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher,So in the third part,,,,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher,Would you be okay to read the final sentence there,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2

133,Jazmin, This is that a good answer,,,120.3,response,2,1,2
133,Jazmin,"I will, I will just be about, like, I was wondering if this was maybe the answer is NASA use a small machine to get to the water",,,120.3,response,2,1,2
133,Teacher,"Yes, it should be a good answer there",,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher," But what specific small machine is what the is what the question is asking, so we know that the equipment, but the the actual specific equipment, I think, is what we're trying to find out",,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
133,Jazmin,"Like you have to say what it is, so that not just small machine, you have to say they",,,410.2,response,2,1,2
133,Jazmin,Like to say like,,,,response,2,1,2
133,Jazmin,What equipment so like the lunar orbiter like NASA use the Lunar Orbiter to get to the one,,,,response,2,1,2

133,Chris,"Oh well, I guess, like the passage is saying like, you have to use the microscope",,,210.4,response,2,1,2
133,Chris,"I guess, is that right",,,,response,2,1,2
133,Teacher, So the question what equipment did scientists use this river water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
133,Teacher,That's exactly right,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2

134,Teacher,Very good,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
134,Teacher,Luis You said that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen and tanks,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
134,Teacher, What are they using that for,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
134,Luis,They use that to breathe because you can't breathe in space because there isn't any oxygen there,,,230.2,response,0,0,2
134,Teacher,Very well,,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
134,Teacher," So they do use that kind of equipment on the moon to breathe, like you said",,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
134,Teacher,"What did you use to discover the water on the moon, though",,,120.1,remark,0,0,2

134,Luis, This lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits ina large polar crater,,,,response,0,0,2
134,Luis,Um NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,0,0,2
134,Chris, And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit and stuff,,,,response,0,0,2
134,Chris, So that's what's going to find the water in the craters,,,,response,0,0,2
134,Chris,"Oh, yeah",,,,response,0,0,2
134,Luis,"OK, the lunar orbiter will look for ice deposit in the polar craters",,,,response,0,0,2

134,Oliver, I was looking for the key words and the question,,,,response,0,0,2
134,Oliver,I don't know how how we got this answer about the small machine to find the ice deposits,,,,response,0,0,2
134,Teacher,"So the question is, what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
134,Teacher,"So if you look back, paragraph two, can you read that for me",,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
134,Oliver,"Yeah, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter investigate",,,120.2,response,0,0,2
134,Oliver, This is the one that Chris just read right?,,,120.2,response,0,0,2
134,Oliver,That's lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,,response,0,0,2
134,Oliver," That's just like four glasses of water, about one person might drink in a day",,,,response,0,0,2
134,Oliver,"These ice deposits are very small, scientists think about one ton of the top layer of the moon's surface would hold on total about 32 ounces of water",,,,response,0,0,2
134,Teacher,"So if we look back at the question, what do you think the key words in the question are",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
134,Oliver,I thought it was equipment and discovering water,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
134,Teacher, So what equipment did they use to discover the water,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2

134,Oliver,"Well,",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
134,Oliver,"I mean,",,,,response,0,0,2
134,Oliver,I guess I guess they use the Lunar Orbiter to go to the South Pole and then they found more water on once they got to the South Pole,,,,response,0,0,2
134,Oliver," So, um,",,,,response,0,0,2
134,Oliver," I know we just met, um,",,,,response,0,0,2

134,Farrah, And I still think it's the microscope,,,210.3,response,1,0,2
134,Farrah," So I thought, extra hard about it, but I still have the same answer",,,210.3,response,1,0,2
134,Farrah, And that's because I was thinking about what equipment was used to discover the water,,,210.3,response,1,0,2

134,Teacher,Is there convincing evidence that there's water on the moon can be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher, What was your answer,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher,Farrah,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
134,Farrah,"OK, so my answer was basically no like I don't think it's very convincing",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
134,Farrah,But not for a long time,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Teacher, So I want everyone to take a second go into the reading and circle where you found your answer,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher,Gotcha,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher,And raise your hand when you're ready,,,,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher,Okay Oliver,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher, Where did you find in the text to support your answer,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
134,Oliver,"Okay, so I had basically I said that know that it's not ready yet",,,230.2,response,2,0,2
134,Oliver, And I was looking in paragraph,,,230.2,response,2,0,2
134,Oliver, It's paragraph,,,230.2,response,2,0,2
134,Oliver,Under the water is a valuable resource and it basically was saying that like in paragraph six it says like,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Oliver,"Um, that scientists need to come up with a plan for getting the water and then making this plan will take a lot of time and money and I guess I was just thinking that like basically",,,,response,2,0,2
134,Oliver,It's not ready yet to get the water from them like you'd have to do a lot of other stuff to get the water,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Teacher,"Yes, that is true",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher, I like that you went back in the text and had some support to support your answer and I do agree with you,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher,"And Jazmin, would you like to go, let us know how you found your answer",,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher,"However, I think that they have a plan for the water",,,130.3,remark,2,0,2
134,Jazmin," See, I said that, yes, that the water would be valuable",,,130.3,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin, So astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water,,,130.3,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin,Yes,,,130.3,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin, And the reason that I said that,,,130.3,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin, Okay,,,130.3,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin," And so what I was looking at, basically, I wasn't a paragraph four, and they were saying that",,,130.3,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin, And also was gonna say like something that I thought was really cool is that you could use the water and you could grow a garden and you can have all these plants and things like that with the water that's up there,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin,Basically the astronauts could read the water,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin, You know what I mean,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Teacher,That's a great idea,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher, We'll have to do some more research about that another time,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher, Luis,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher, I wonder if that could happen,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
134,Luis," I said that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and the part where I got that from was, let's see, where did I oh oh okay, in paragraph five, purify water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen",,,110.1,response,2,0,2
134,Luis," So for me, basically what I said",,,110.1,response,2,0,2
134,Luis,"Um, yeah, okay",,,110.1,response,2,0,2
134,Luis,Oxygen and Hydrogen could also be used as rocket,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Teacher, I am very glad that you went back in the texts were able to find support for your answer,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher,"Yes, very good",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher, So that was two of the ways that they could use it,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher, And as the fuel if they break it into two parts,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher,So the water can be used for two different things for the astronauts to drink,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,2,0,2
134,Chris,"Oh, I was just going to share my answer",,,230.3,response,2,0,2
134,Chris, It takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Chris," And I think for me, like where I I saw it, like, what is it, it says in paragraph or the waters happy",,,,response,2,0,2
134,Chris,Okay so water is heavy,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Chris," So it's good, they don't you know have to carry it in the ships anymore",,,,response,2,0,2
134,Chris, And then I also said like Luis water can be broken down into two parts into hydrogen and also into oxygen and you can use both of those things,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Chris,And that would be a big deal to have that,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Teacher, Chris,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher,Very good,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher, He did a really good job,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher," I really liked your answer and how you can how you included both parts those, the water is heavy and that the water can be broken into two parts, and us",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
134,Chris,Thank you,,,310.1,response,2,0,2
134,Teacher,"Farrah, did you Farrah and Oliver",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher," Were you able to find in the in the paragraph, where they were talking about the air answers and why it is a yes",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
134,Oliver," I think that, well, do you have any thoughts",,,210.3,response,2,0,2
134,Oliver,"Yeah, we saw the answers",,,210.3,response,2,0,2
134,Farrah, You know what I mean,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Farrah," Like, how much like to do in space, like, I don't know, I guess I'm still kind of wondering",,,,response,2,0,2
134,Farrah," But I think there's just so many problems on the way, costs too much money and like we don't right now",,,,response,2,0,2
134,Farrah, Like in the future,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Farrah,"Um, yeah, I mean basically my thinking is that it's not that it will be useful",,,,response,2,0,2
134,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher,"I agree, but we're reading the paragraphs and we're wondering what based off of our paragraphs, what knowledge, are we getting from those",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
134,Teacher,and based off the paragraphs as Chris said we're able to see that they can use the water for two different reasons,,,130.3,remark,2,0,2
134,Jazmin," I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin, But before we go to lunch,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin,"Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin,"I wanted to really thank you for like taking the time to make sure that we were circling keywords and making sure that we were like using our keywords you know me and like you're even more than that, that we were like,",,,,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin,That we were using evidence like that's a really big deal because sometimes we don't always like,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin, So I think everybody went back and and like really closely,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin,Base our answers on the text that you really like wanted to make sure that we were using evidence,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin," So like, thank you so much for working with us",,,,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin, This was really cool,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin, Thank you so much,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin, And it was really cool that just like you were really made us feel valued and I guess,,,,response,2,0,2
134,Jazmin,"With you'd like everything they needed to do, you know, we take the quiz",,,,response,2,0,2
134,Teacher,"Thank you guys, are we have a good lunch",,,,remark,2,0,2
135,Teacher, So now I want to dig a little bit deeper into your answers,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,Alright friends,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, Okay,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, Thank you for sharing your answers with me about what equipment did scientists use from our text,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, Luis Do you have your hand up,,,,remark,1,1,2
135,Luis," So I was just gonna say, I don't think I need to be in this group because I already know all about space",,,,response,1,1,2
135,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,1,2
135,Teacher,Hmm,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, Alright,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, Okay,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, But we're all in this group to work on answering some questions,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher," Well, I'm glad that you know a lot about space",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, Do you have the text in front of you,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher," Okay, so our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,"Okay, alright",,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, Okay,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, So thank you again for sharing all your answers,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Farrah,"Yes, we do",,,120.2,response,1,1,2
135,Teacher, So I want you to go back and I'd like you to look at paragraph number five,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,"Okay, good",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher," Okay, so I'm going to give you a few seconds to do that",,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,"I want you to think about what equipment was used, and if you see any equipment mentioned, if you can use your pencil and underline it",,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,Yes Oliver,,,,remark,1,1,2
135,Oliver, Is that the one from the second reading about waters of valuable resource,,,,response,1,1,2
135,Oliver,Paragraph five,,,,response,1,1,2
135,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,"Excuse me, I meant paragraph two thank you for the clarification, Oliver",,,,remark,1,1,2
135,Oliver,Gotcha,,,,response,1,1,2
135,Oliver, Just wanted to check,,,,response,1,1,2
135,Teacher,"Yeah, thank you, paragraph two,",,,,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, Jazmin and Oliver,,,,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,"Alright, take another few seconds",,,,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher," So let's start with Chris, what did you underline in paragraph two, that might be a type of equipment",,,,remark,1,1,2
135,Chris,"Um, okay, so I underlined",,,,response,1,1,2
135,Chris, lunar orbiter,,,,response,1,1,2
135,Chris, machine,,,,response,1,1,2
135,Chris," Um, let's see",,,,response,1,1,2
135,Chris,"I guess glasses, but I don't think they mean it that way, those things",,,,response,1,1,2
135,Teacher, What did you underline and paragraph two?,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, Thank you for sharing,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher," All right, Miss Farrah",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,Awesome job,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Farrah,I said the same thing like small machine and lunar orbit just in paragraph two,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
135,Farrah,I'm still confused like why are my answers wrong,,,,response,1,1,2
135,Teacher," All right, Farrah, and it's not wrong",,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher," Luis Can you share what you underlined in paragraph two,",,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, All right,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, Okay,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,Okay well we're going to get to that in one second,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, We're just going to see if there was a different way to answer it,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,110.2,response,1,1,2
135,Luis," So imperative to, well, I underline the same thing like small machine",,,110.2,response,1,1,2
135,Luis," Um, yeah, that's what I put but I also like wrote down like some other stuff because there's lots of other equipment that they used",,,,response,1,1,2
135,Luis,I underlined lunar orbiter because I figured that was something that you know that's that's I know about that crap,,,,response,1,1,2
135,Teacher, Why did you underline that in paragraph two,,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher," And so, Farrah",,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,So I heard a few of you guys say that you underlined a lunar orbiter and small machine,,,110.4,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,Okay,,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,"Okay, very good",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, All right,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Farrah,It was the only equipment in paragraph two,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
135,Teacher," Oliver why did you underline that I'm paragraph two,",,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,Okay,,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
135,Oliver,"Um, yeah, basically, that was on the same because it was all the equipment that I could see",,,230.2,response,1,1,2
135,Teacher, So does that help us answer our question of what equipment was used To find water on the moon,,,120.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, Okay,,,120.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,Good,,,120.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Farrah," Is it, you know what I mean is it an answer too?",,,120.1,response,1,1,2
135,Farrah,Still confused because i i i guess why the microscope,,,120.1,response,1,1,2
135,Farrah,Because it says what equipment is used to discover water like they said That you have to use the microscope to see,,,,response,1,1,2
135,Farrah, So how did they discover what if they couldn't see,,,,response,1,1,2
135,Teacher,"Well, that's very good",,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher, So the microscope would be part of the answer and lunar orbiter would also be part of the answer right Farrah,,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
135,Farrah,Okay yeah so so microscope and lunar orbiter?,,,130.1,response,1,1,2
135,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,Because the lunar orbiter helps with the ice right? And the ice helps,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher,Do what Farrah,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
135,Teacher," Um, Farrah, how did you come up with your answer",,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher,Hello,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher, So I saw your responses to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Farrah,"Okay, so I got my answer from paragraph three and I basically was thinking like you have to use the microscope to see the water",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
135,Farrah, How could you discover it without without seeing?,,,230.1,response,0,1,2
135,Farrah, If you were going to like discover it,,,230.1,response,0,1,2
135,Teacher,Okay,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher,thank you for that,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher,Luis Where did you come up with your answer,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
135,Luis," I don't think I really need to be in this group, because I don't really need help with this stuff, you know,",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
135,Luis,"Ah, yeah",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
135,Luis, So I already kind of knew the answer to this question,,,230.2,response,0,1,2
135,Luis," Okay, so I got my answer from like I know about like space and stuff",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
135,Teacher,Hmm,,,,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher,"Chris, what do you have to say about your answer",,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher,"Okay well we're all put in this group to help each other learn, um,",,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Chris," Like, I think it was like, I think in the in the in the text, it talks about like how the craters have a bunch of water",,,220.1,response,0,1,2
135,Chris,"Um, well, I mean I guess I don't, I  don't know",,,220.1,response,0,1,2
135,Chris, I don't really have anything to say about it,,,220.1,response,0,1,2
135,Chris," Um, and like that made me think, like, that's you know what I mean, like, that was what they had to find",,,220.1,response,0,1,2
135,Teacher,"Do you think that your answer answers the question, Chris",,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
135,Chris,I'm not sure,,,210.3,response,0,1,2
135,Teacher,Let's read the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
135,Chris,"Oh, okay, yeah, I guess not",,,120.2,response,0,1,2
135,Teacher,"Okay, do you have another answer at this time, do you think",,,120.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Chris, Okay,,,120.1,response,0,1,2
135,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,120.1,response,0,1,2
135,Chris, So I actually was kind of agreeing with Luis Like my dad took me to NASA,,,120.1,response,0,1,2
135,Chris," And we went like all over the place and like looked at different stuff and like saw that like astronauts had to have, like, um,",,,120.1,response,0,1,2
135,Chris," So I guess like I kind of thought, maybe that was missing",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Chris,"Like boots and oxygen tanks and all the stuff you know what I mean, like they needed all that stuff to go up into space",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Teacher,"Okay, Jazmin, do you have anything to add to what Chris said",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
135,Jazmin,Well I guess,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
135,Jazmin,"Well, I guess what I thought was that it was this small machine that they sent was, how they discovered the water",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Jazmin, Was it not the small machine that discovered the water?,,,,response,0,1,2
135,Jazmin,"I'm not really sure about Chris's answer, but um like Farrah and Oliver's like is my answer wrong",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Teacher,"Well, let's look at our texts and figure it out together",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher, This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher, These ice deposits are very small,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher," So in paragraph two, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher,"So Oliver, do you think there's another part to your answer other than the small microscope",,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
135,Oliver," Okay, so when when we talk about it together",,,210.3,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver," Like, I guess you need the Lunar Orbiter",,,210.3,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver,"Um, yeah, I guess, actually",,,210.3,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver," But, um, I guess it kind of still think it's like I kind of still think it's the",,,210.3,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver,"It's the microscope, because like Farrah was saying like, you have to see the water to know that it's there",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver,So like maybe the microscope was on the lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,1,2
135,Teacher,Does anyone agree or disagree with Oliver,,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher,That's good thinking Oliver,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah?",,,,remark,0,1,2
135,Farrah,"Um yeah okay so I agree I think that um like, I think that that probably that's true that like the microscope was maybe attached to the lunar orbiter or something",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Farrah,"Cuz they had to discover the water, but they say that the water is um, that it's basically like they like to use the word microscopic like it's so small that you can't even see it",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Teacher,"Okay, Jazmin, what do you think, do you agree with Oliver and Farrah",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Jazmin,"Well, I guess",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
135,Jazmin,I'm not totally sure,,,,response,0,1,2
135,Jazmin,"I mean, I guess, maybe, maybe that's the case, like maybe the lunar orbiter could have like a microscope attached, I think that could be possible",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Teacher,"Okay, um, Luis, what are you thinking",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
135,Luis,"Well, I guess, like I'm kind of thinking",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
135,Luis," Um,",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Luis,"I don't know, like, I mean, I guess",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Luis," Yeah, I see that they could probably use the the Lunar Orbiter to go up there",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Luis,"I guess it's not really it doesn't really say if they're astronauts are not like if they're astronauts up there, then that would be one thing, but I don't really think there are",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Teacher,Your text doesn't say if there are astronauts does it,,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher,Chris,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher, What are you thinking,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Chris,"Um, so, like, I'm kind of just, I'm kind of thinking",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
135,Chris,"I mean, I guess I'm kind of thinking that if it was a like an unmanned craft like like a like a probe that they sent up with the lunar orbiter was like didn't have any astronauts then",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Chris," So yeah, they could use the microscope, like on the Orbiter and like control it with a computer or a robot",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Chris,Then I guess they don't need the the gloves and the stuff,,,,response,0,1,2
135,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher, And then what did we use to go back and find our answer,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
135,Oliver,"Um,",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver,I'm not quite sure what wait,,,,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver," When you say, what did we use like what did we use in class",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Teacher," Well, we just, you know, we kind of went back and we talked about what we thought our answer might be",,,530.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher, Now that we've discussed it,,,530.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher, So what kind of helped us find our answer,,,530.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Teacher,Yeah,,,530.1,remark,0,1,2
135,Oliver,"Um, well, actually, um, I would say that what seemed to help us find our answer was all like listening to each other",,,530.1,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver,Um and actually we have to,,,,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver,We have to actually go to lunch,,,,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver," I did want to thank you for that specifically because I think that we all did like have a chance, like to work with each other and to like really",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver, But before we go,,,,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver, So that was pretty cool,,,,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver,"Like listen to each other, carefully and closely and really hear what we were saying to each other",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver," And I really, really appreciate that you did that because",,,,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver, So thank you so much,,,,response,0,1,2
135,Oliver,We don't always get to listen to each other and kind of learn from each other's like thinking,,,,response,0,1,2
135,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"Okay, I'm going to start with Farrah Farrah, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to really look closely, what made you say a microscope Farrah",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Farrah," And so I was thinking like, you know, if you want to see like the water and it's really small that you could only find it with a microscope, you know what I mean?",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
136,Farrah,So I was thinking about like what equipment like I know about microscopes from like science class,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
136,Teacher, Yes,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher," Yes, I can see",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher, Are you can you say that,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,Yeah,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher, Luis Do you have a question,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Luis," Um, I think I should be in this group, because I know like all this stuff about space, like I practically know everything about space",,,110.1,response,1,1,2
136,Luis,"Um, wow, it's kind of more of a statement",,,110.1,response,1,1,2
136,Teacher, They need the oxygen to be able to breathe,,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher," You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen, oxygen tanks",,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,Okay Luis Let's look at your answer,,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher," You know, when they are in space",,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher, That is very true,,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,So could you tell me what made you say the oxygen tanks,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,But right now we're looking to see how they found the water,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher," What equipment, help them discover the water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher, So could you tell me what made you say the oxygen tanks,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
136,Luis, I think like the astronauts would have to have,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
136,Luis,"Um, yeah, yeah",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
136,Luis," So I was seeking about oxygen tanks, because, like, well, okay, so I was seeing whenever I see like movies with astronauts or whenever I think about like like watching a moon launch or whatever",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
136,Luis,"You know what I mean like if they were going up into space, you have to have that",,,,response,1,1,2
136,Teacher, I could see how you could come up with that answer,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher," Yes, that's correct",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,"and Jazmin, you said NASA sent a small machine",,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher," Could you tell me maybe what small machine or where you found that in the expert, except of the story",,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
136,Jazmin,"Okay, so when I look and small machine",,,110.1,response,1,1,2
136,Jazmin, She basically I was looking in paragraph two and I was in the first sentence,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
136,Jazmin, So that's why,,,,response,1,1,2
136,Jazmin,"It seemed like that's what they sent, they sent a small machine to go look at the water",,,,response,1,1,2
136,Teacher, You said a scientist found craters full of water on the moon,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher, I could see how you could say that yes,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher, Let's look at yours,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher, Could you explain a little bit more to me about how you came up with that answer,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,Chris,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,"Okay, very good",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Chris,"I was thinking that when they were saying in the reading like they were saying, okay, so there's ice deposits in the polar crater",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
136,Chris,"And I was thinking that like ice is, is basically frozen water and I like I kind of know that I'm from science class, and, um, it made me think, like, well, that's where the water it you know",,,,response,1,1,2
136,Teacher,Yeah,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher, So could you explain to me where you come up with your answer,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,Oliver,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher, Let's look at yours that you told me that you circled the same as Farrah,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher, I could see how you say that yes,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher, Yes,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Oliver, So what I was thinking was when I was looking through the reading,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
136,Oliver, I was seeing like so in the in the question,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
136,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,110.1,response,1,1,2
136,Oliver,"In the question, it says what equipment did scientists use and it made me think, like, look for equipment",,,,response,1,1,2
136,Oliver, I saw microscopes and I totally know about microscopes,,,,response,1,1,2
136,Oliver, So then I went I looked for equipment,,,,response,1,1,2
136,Teacher,"Okay, fair enough Farrah you have a question",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Farrah,"Um, yeah, I guess I'm still wondering like, cuz you know we're in the small group to try to help our answers like I guess I'm wondering like why my answer's wrong",,,110.1,response,1,1,2
136,Teacher, So our question that was posed to us,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher, We're going to take a look at that,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,"Okay, so we're getting ready to look at that one to hear from each person",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,Was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,So we need to look and paragraph number two,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,So we needed to decide about looking back into our  text there and try to underline or find evidence that tells us about the small machine or the equipment that scientists use,,,120.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher," It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon surface",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,In paragraph number two,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher, The first sentence,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,Or the South Pole and look for ask deposits in a large polar crater vast deposits are very small,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,So they use that small machine and the small machine was called a lunar orbiter said the lunar orbiter was the small machine or the piece of equipment that the scientists use,,,130.3,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher, Did you have a question,,,,remark,1,1,2
136,Chris," So I guess my, my question was so, like, I went to NASA with my dad and I guess kind of like what he was saying like, you know,",,,,response,1,1,2
136,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,1,2
136,Chris,"Like scientists use all this other equipment like oxygen tanks and mass and suits, I guess I was wondering, like, on the lunar orbiter like why that ones the answer and not like other",,,,response,1,1,2
136,Teacher," So the scientists, they do need to use other other equipment so like the oxygen tanks when they go up into space that does help them",,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,OK,,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,"They did need the microscope as Farrah, and Oliver mentioned",,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher," They did need the microscope as Farrah, and Oliver mentioned",,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher, What helped them found the water was the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,What helped them found the water was the Lunar Orbiter,,,130.3,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,But that doesn't help them find the water,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,"To be able to see it because those deposits were so small you couldn't see it with your naked eye, you needed the microscope to be able to really",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher," So they did use other pieces of equipment to help them, but the one that helped them find it and investigate it was the Lunar Orbiter",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,Zoom in and see it,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
136,Teacher,Yes def,,,,remark,1,1,2
136,Oliver, So we have to go,,,,response,1,1,2
136,Oliver,Thank you so much for working with us,,,,response,1,1,2
136,Oliver, It's time for the next group,,,,response,1,1,2
136,Teacher, You know the name of that machine they sent?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"Okay, so, Jazmin, you said NASA sent a small machine",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Jazmin, Should you call on him first?,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
136,Jazmin,"I think, but I think Chris has his hand up",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
136,Jazmin,or I guess Luis,,,,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"Why don't you look back at the text and paragraph two, and can you tell me the name of the machine that they sent that NASA sent",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Jazmin," So paragraph two, the name of small machine was the Lunar Orbiter",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
136,Jazmin,"Okay, let's see",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher,Very good,,,,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher, Luis Do you have a question,,,,remark,0,1,2
136,Luis, I guess than anything,,,,response,0,1,2
136,Luis," Like, I know all about space already and like I feel like I kind of know all this stuff",,,,response,0,1,2
136,Luis,"Um, yeah, it's kind of more of like a comment",,,,response,0,1,2
136,Luis, So I don't really need any help,,,,response,0,1,2
136,Luis," Like, I don't think I need to be in this group",,,,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher, They do need oxygen,,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"Okay, we're just going to continue to keep going and dig in a little bit deeper into our text,",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher, That is true,,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,so Luis you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"However, Luis, do you see in the paragraph, where it talks about the machine that they sent",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Luis," So I guess I just like I kind of know all this stuff, you know,",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
136,Luis, So I guess,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
136,Luis,"Um, yeah, I guess",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher,and our question again was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"Okay, let's look at paragraph two,",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"Luis are you looking at, paragraph two, there",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
136,Luis, Did you want me to give the answer,,,150.1,response,0,1,2
136,Luis,"Um, yeah, I'm looking right now",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"Yes, you can",,,,remark,0,1,2
136,Luis,Okay,,,,response,0,1,2
136,Luis," Um, I guess, in paragraph two, um, let's see",,,,response,0,1,2
136,Luis,I guess it could be the Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"Very good, very good",,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"And Chris, you read your response was that scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher, Can you look at paragraph three and see if they found craters that were full of water or maybe not so full water,,,430.3,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher, Can you go ahead and look there and give me a response,,,430.3,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,I just want to make sure we understand,,,430.3,remark,0,1,2
136,Chris,"Okay, um,",,,430.3,response,0,1,2
136,Chris,"The water they found is, the water the found is microscopic",,,,response,0,1,2
136,Chris, I'm kind of confused,,,,response,0,1,2
136,Chris," So was the water like, are they talking about the water molecules are like the water",,,,response,0,1,2
136,Chris,like so I guess,,,,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"So the water they found is microscopic and it says, meaning that you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it",,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,So what do we think Chris microscopic means,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Chris,Microscopic's kind of like really small,,,120.3,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher, So it was really small,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,Very good,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher, So the scientists would need a microscope to look at it very closely,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher, So the water they found was microscopic you couldn't really see if you're looking straight at it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher, There's a small amount of it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Chris,"So,",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
136,Chris,Like a small amount of water?,,,,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher, Mm hmm,,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"Yes, there was a small amount of water that they found",,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
136,Farrah,"Oh,",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher, Do you have a question,,,,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,0,1,2
136,Farrah,"Yeah, I have a question",,,,response,0,1,2
136,Farrah," So I was kind of wondering like why my answer might might not be right, like in terms of the question",,,,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher,So you said that they needed a tool called the microscope to look really closely and that is true,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,The small machine that they sent was caught a lunar orbiter and that was to help them investigate,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"So it did help them find the water and they would need the microscope to look very closely at the water because it's so microscopic, it's so little and such a small amount",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Farrah, So did they discover it with the microscope,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
136,Farrah,Gotcha,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher, It doesn't tell us that they did use the microscope,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"What does, it just says that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look at it really closely",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
136,Farrah,"Okay, so you just needed to see",,,130.3,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"Wrapped if they were going to really and truly look at it and try to see it, then they would need the microscope to look at it because it is such a small amount",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Farrah,Okay,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher,Chris?,,,,remark,0,1,2
136,Chris,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,1,2
136,Chris," So did they use that stuff to find, to discover the water?",,,,response,0,1,2
136,Chris," Okay, so, um, I was just went to NASA with my dad and I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that",,,,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"Well, again, it says that NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher," So, I do not believe that they sent any astronauts up there to look at it at this time that they just as they sent their small machine",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
136,Chris,Gotcha,,,130.3,response,0,1,2
136,Chris," Okay, so, so was like, like they may be need that stuff, but they didn't like use it necessarily this time",,,130.3,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher,Right,,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Chris,"Okay, okay",,,110.4,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher," So can you tell me what equipment, the scientists use to discover the water on the moon?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"Oliver, you said that you circled the same as Farrah",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Oliver," So it looks like um Farrah and I circled at the beginning, we circled the microscope, because that seemed like the equipment that was probably used to see the water that was so small, but um",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
136,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
136,Oliver, It sounds like they they used this on the lunar orbiter to go,,,,response,0,1,2
136,Oliver,I'm guessing that they probably used other stuff as well,,,,response,0,1,2
136,Oliver," Also, and like discover the water",,,,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher," So they did send them lunar orbiter up to investigate and then if they were to really look at the water very closely, they would need the microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Teacher,"Very good, very good",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
136,Oliver," But before we go, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us today and also to",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
136,Oliver,"So, um, we have to go to lunch, unfortunately",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
136,Oliver, Thank you so much,,,,response,0,1,2
136,Oliver,"Really, thank you for like getting us to try to listen to each other's opinions and also really listening to our responses and to making sure that each of us had time to work with you today",,,,response,0,1,2
136,Oliver, That was a big deal that we each had time to have a chance to work with you,,,,response,0,1,2
136,Teacher,Thank you guys very much,,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, Give me just a second,,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,Text is in the way,,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, You have a question?,,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"Luis, I see your hand is up",,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Luis, I don't really need any help,,,,response,0,1,2
137,Luis,Yeah,,,,response,0,1,2
137,Luis," Okay, so here's the thing",,,,response,0,1,2
137,Luis," Like, I don't think I have to be in this group",,,,response,0,1,2
137,Luis, So I don't really know,,,,response,0,1,2
137,Luis, I kind of know all about space,,,,response,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"You believe you don't need any help? Well, we're going to work through this together and we'll actually see what we can learn along the way",,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, Does anyone else have any questions before we begin?,,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher," We all have answered the same question, which I'm going to read",,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, Now what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"Alright, seeing no hands",,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, Let's begin,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,And it seems like we have some understanding of what it is that we're trying to find out,,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, Sound like a plan?,,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher," So what I'd like to do is I'd like us to go around and read this little by little, one person at a time and then we're going to work through this question together",,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, But we're not all quite there just yet,,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"All right, who would like to read first?",,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"All right, Farrah, let's have you read the first paragraph right where it says one",,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Farrah,Okay,,,120.3,response,0,1,2
137,Farrah," Um, let's see",,,120.3,response,0,1,2
137,Farrah, Scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters,,,,response,0,1,2
137,Farrah,The moon is a desert,,,,response,0,1,2
137,Farrah, These craters are dark places where the sun never shines,,,,response,0,1,2
137,Teacher,Very nice,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, Who wants to read the second second paragraph,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,Oliver saw your hand first,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, Let's go with you,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Oliver,Um okay,,,120.3,response,0,1,2
137,Oliver, These ice deposits are very small,,,120.3,response,0,1,2
137,Oliver, This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,120.3,response,0,1,2
137,Oliver," Um second paragraph, and number two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,120.3,response,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"Alright, paragraph number three, who's next",,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"Hi, Jazmin, I saw your hand first",,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, Let's go,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Jazmin," The water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific to call the microscope to look really closely",,,120.3,response,0,1,2
137,Jazmin, That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth,,,120.3,response,0,1,2
137,Jazmin,"So, let's see paragraph three",,,120.3,response,0,1,2
137,Teacher," In a moment after our answer Farrahs question I'd like us to go through and identify some of these words, Farrah, what's your question?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,Exactly,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher," Now while I'm reading this, I see a lot of words that maybe I do, maybe I do not quite understand",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
137,Farrah," Like, I was wondering why my answer about the microscope might not be right or what was wrong",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
137,Farrah," So, okay",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
137,Farrah,Yes,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
137,Farrah," I was just wondering, as we were reading it through like because I know we're in this group for for help",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
137,Teacher,We will get to that in just a moment,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher," Give me a moment to identify some of these words because, I don't know about you guys, but some of these are kind of difficult to understand at face value",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher," Or maybe just need some clarification, take just a moment, raise your hand when you find one",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,So look at this for just a moment on your own and see if you can find one or two words that maybe you don't entirely know what they mean,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, What did you find?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"Alright, Jazmin, I see your hand",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
137,Jazmin,"Basically, I wasn't quite sure about microscopic",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
137,Jazmin," I think I know what it means, but I wasn't totally sure",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
137,Teacher,What do you believe it means,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Jazmin,It means something that is small,,,230.1,response,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"Yes, small, but it's actually smaller than small, microscopic is a really big word that means very, very small, small enough to where we can't actually see it without a special tool",,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, What is that,,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, It tells you what we need to be able to see this,,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,And actually if you look a little further in that same paragraph on the third line,,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Jazmin, That was Farrah's answer,,,420.3,response,0,1,2
137,Jazmin,It's the microscope,,,420.3,response,0,1,2
137,Teacher," Yes, Chris, what did you find?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"Exactly, exactly",,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher," We need that special tool called a microscope to see these little microscopic, whatever it ends up being, in this case it's microscopic amounts of water",,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,Yes,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, Does anyone else,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
137,Chris," Yeah, I didn't actually so I didn't really see anything in here but I kind of, I did have a question that came up from reading and it was like",,,110.2,response,0,1,2
137,Chris,You,,,110.2,response,0,1,2
137,Chris,"I went to NASA with my dad and there was like, like we we saw all these spacesuits and like oxygen tanks and all the stuff that the astronauts had to use like did they not have to , did they not need those things is that whether or not in the reading?",,,,response,0,1,2
137,Teacher, Okay,,,410.2,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"Oh, I'm sure if there were actual astronauts in space they would need this equipment, you know, to survive, but I don't really think that's what this passage is focusing on",,,410.2,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"Alright, so we have identified the word microscopic",,,230.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, The question is this,,,230.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher," Now I'm going to reread the question once more, just so we get it back into our heads",,,230.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,Now the next step,,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, All right,,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher," Take a moment, look through and see just which one actually addresses the question",,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, I'd like for us to go through is which of these three paragraphs actually addresses the question,,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,Anybody have any ideas?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,Farrah saw your hand up first,,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Farrah," Like, how can you, how can you discover it if you can't see it?",,,,response,0,1,2
137,Farrah,"Okay, so to me, I thought that, um, well, I think it's to paragraph three, because they're talking about the water that they found, and they're talking about how you'd be able to see it",,,,response,0,1,2
137,Teacher, Absolutely,,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,But is that all we use to get there and be able to observe said water?,,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,That's a great question,,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, When we say that you did actually use a microscope to see the water,,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher," You're partially right we're not entirely there, you're very right",,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher," Oliver, what you got to add?",,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,We're not entirely there just yet,,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"Well, we are absolutely on the right track",,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher," Jazmin, what do you have to add?",,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
137,Jazmin, I think that it's the machine,,,130.2,response,0,1,2
137,Jazmin,"Okay, so like I don't really think that it's the microscope",,,130.2,response,0,1,2
137,Jazmin," And the reason that I think that is that it, it talks about like using that to investigate and that sounds like the like the thing that the question, like discover, what it does",,,130.2,response,0,1,2
137,Jazmin, The Lunar Orbiter,,,130.2,response,0,1,2
137,Teacher,They actually use that to find it,,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, Yeah,,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"Absolutely they did use that to get to the moon, didn't they? But really could they have seen such tiny amounts of water without the microscope as well",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher," It's that small, I don't think really we could see it with that that special tool that scientists created for us to actually use",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,I don't really think they could have,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher," So now what I want you to do, you guys know what elbow partners are?",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, I want you guys to discuss amongst yourselves,,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, I'm seeing some head nods,,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,Good,,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, Just pair up in groups of two and then a group of three over here,,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,I want you to talk about what you think the correct answer would be and maybe why you think yours is right,,,420.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, I have a timer going right now,,,420.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, All right,,,420.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, I'm going to give you 30 seconds to do that,,,420.1,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, Good,,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"Alright, it looks like we're starting to come back together",,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher, Jazmin?,,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Jazmin," But before we go, I wanted to thank you for working with us, and especially I wanted to thank you for really like",,,,response,0,1,2
137,Jazmin,"So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch now",,,,response,0,1,2
137,Jazmin,Helping us kind of work together as a group and really focusing on like having us explorer answers together,,,,response,0,1,2
137,Jazmin, And we don't really,,,,response,0,1,2
137,Jazmin,"As a group, and like not sort of just like giving us the answers like sometimes teachers just kind of give us the answer",,,,response,0,1,2
137,Jazmin, I just wanted to thank you because that was pretty cool,,,,response,0,1,2
137,Jazmin,We don't really think about like what we're supposed to be thinking about and we did a lot of thinking today,,,,response,0,1,2
137,Teacher,"You're very welcome, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to come here and work with you",,,,remark,0,1,2
137,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, How's everybody doing today,,,,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, Hello class,,,,remark,1,1,2

137,Teacher," I love that amount of enthusiasm, real quick before we begin, I would like to just address one thing that I tell all of my students Whenever they walk into my classroom for the first time",,,220.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, I'll get to you in just a minute,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, So you're not just standing there Holding it up the whole time,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"Luis I see your hand, you can put it down",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"One thing I like to mention to my students that I'd like to mention to all of you as well as my philosophy on answering questions might be a weird thing to hear at this age, but I'd like mistakes",,,220.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"That's a weird thing to hear a teacher, save right I like mistakes, you're probably not going to hear too many say make mistakes in my class",,,220.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, It's called confidence and not everyone's confident are we,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2

137,Teacher, I have a favorite word,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher," Easy, two plus two is four, maybe I actually wouldn't",,,140.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"I know at least growing up I was not always the most confident when I came to answering questions, even if I knew you know I knew the answer",,,140.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,Answer out of fear of ridicule from my friends or even the teacher,,,140.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, I want you to well fake it and see what happens,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher," If you think you know the answer, let me know and then I will do my best to guide you in the right direction",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"I don't want you to have those feelings in my class, even if you're not confident",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,If you don't come to the correct conclusion on the first trouble work together,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Farrah, And I think that we all feel really confident now that you said that,,,150.1,response,1,1,2
137,Farrah,"Oh yeah, that sounds great",,,150.1,response,1,1,2
137,Farrah, Thank you so much,,,150.1,response,1,1,2
137,Farrah, Alright,,,150.1,response,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"So I'm going to reread the question for all of us, so that we can hear it again",,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,I apologize,,,,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher," The question is, what equipment did scientists,",,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher," I have skipped over Luis's question when I said I would come back to him, Luis",,,,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, Go ahead,,,,remark,1,1,2
137,Luis," Really, I was just gonna say like, I don't think I have to be on this group, cuz like I kind of already know all about space",,,120.2,response,1,1,2
137,Luis,"Oh no, that's okay",,,120.2,response,1,1,2
137,Luis, I was more of a comment,,,120.2,response,1,1,2
137,Teacher,So you're very enthusiastic about space you enjoy it,,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Luis,Yeah,,,110.3,response,1,1,2
137,Teacher,We'll use will use that enthusiasm here in just a minute,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, So bear with us for a little bit,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"Teacher:Let's start with Farrah, would you mind reading your answer to me",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,I hear that you guys have already shared out your answers and add honestly just like to go left to right and pick apart,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, Everybody's answer,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Farrah," OK, so my answer was, you need to see typical color microscope to look really close",,,120.2,response,1,1,2
137,Farrah,"Sure, no problem",,,120.2,response,1,1,2
137,Teacher,Absolutely,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher," Thank you for using full sentences full complete sentences, full of correct grammar and all that nice capitalization",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, I appreciate that,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher," In fact, everybody look back in the text and see where you found your answer and help me understand what what it was that led you to that conclusion when we get to each person",,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, Look back in your text and help me understand what led you to that conclusion,,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, What made you say you need it scientifically tool called the microscope,,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"Now, do me a favor",,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, Have you found it,,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,Farrah,,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
137,Farrah,"Yeah, I have a good idea",,,230.2,response,1,1,2
137,Teacher,To go ahead and read me where it is in the passage,,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
137,Farrah,Good,,,230.2,response,1,1,2
137,Farrah, So when I look at the reading the thing that connected was a paragraph and it says,,,230.2,response,1,1,2
137,Farrah, Okay,,,230.2,response,1,1,2
137,Farrah," If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope really close",,,,response,1,1,2
137,Farrah,The water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it,,,,response,1,1,2
137,Teacher, Do you know?,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher," What does that mean, Farrah",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, That's one of the words that pops out to me,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,Exactly microscopic,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
137,Farrah,It means really small,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
137,Teacher," We actually can't see it, just looking at it, can we, so we do indeed need that microscope comes from the word microscopic microscope to be able to see it",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"Yeah, it means so small",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"That's absolutely right, but we're only Halfway right it's as if we have, you know, we're, we got a foot in the door",,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, But we got to get the rest of the way in,,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,they're going to come back to that in just a minute,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"So we are halfway,",,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, Let's move on to the name is tiny Oliver I believe I'm reading your name right,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher," Is that right,",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,Let's move on,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Oliver,"Yeah, that's right",,,110.1,response,1,1,2
137,Oliver, My name is Oliver,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
137,Teacher,Absolutely not,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, See you said you circled the same thign as Farrah,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Farrah,Go ahead,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
137,Farrah, I was just gonna Oliver and I have the same answer,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
137,Farrah, I think that we were still little bit about why he was wrong,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"Yeah, and that's exactly why I pause for just a moment because you both do have the same answer",,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, So you have the same answer As Farrah,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, That's great,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, You do use a microscope to actually see the water,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, So I'd like to dress you both at the same time,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"helped me look back, I'm looking at",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, I don't think it quite is,,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,But is that all that they used in order to find the water,,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,let's very quickly,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, I'm just going to quickly read because we're crunching on time,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"Well, the first three paragraphs, the answers in there somewhere,",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, I'm going to very quickly read starting in paragraph two follow along with me,,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon's South Pole and look for an ice deposit in a large polar crater",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that up to one ton sorry one ton of top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water",,,120.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher," What do you guys believe what do you think Farrah, and Oliver?",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"Is the answer in there, or is that just a partial answer in there",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, Let's move on to Jazmin for a moment,,,,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,I see Jazmin's hand,,,,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, You got some insight,,,,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, Let's hear it,,,,remark,1,1,2
137,Jazmin, So that seems like the right answer to me ,,,,response,1,1,2
137,Jazmin,"So when I was looking, I realized that I think the answer is the lunar orbiter",,,,response,1,1,2
137,Teacher," Let me scroll up if you look back direct quote from it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate you read the rest of the paragraph, it leads them to the water right?",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"Yeah, absolutely",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, If you look back,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"so Farrah and Oliver, yes, you absolutely use a microscope to see to actually see The water",,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,But if we were to choose one answer to be correct,,,130.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, Right,,,130.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,"However, they use the Lunar Orbiter to actually physically get there",,,130.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,So in essence kind of both of them are correct,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher,Does that make sense you three,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
137,Teacher, I would probably go with the lunar orbit,,,130.3,remark,1,1,2
137,Oliver, Thank you,,,130.3,response,1,1,2
137,Oliver, We really enjoyed working with,,,130.3,response,1,1,2
137,Oliver, But thank you so much for working with us,,,130.3,response,1,1,2
137,Oliver, And I'm unfortunately we have to go to our next class,,,130.3,response,1,1,2
137,Oliver,"Um, so I think that I understand that the equipment like the answer to the question is the Lunar Orbiter, but I think I'm still not quite sure why",,,130.3,response,1,1,2
137,Teacher,Chris,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," Would you remind me what you were saying, just so we can catch back up",,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,Allright class just to recap for my own sake I believe we went over Farrah and Oliver and Jazmin,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," You hopped back in believe Chris, you just had a question",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, Luis hold on just one moment,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Chris,"Yeah, so I was just say, um, let's see, I think it was talking about like the before lunch",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
137,Chris," Well, so my answer was that the craters were full of water on the moon, and that that was like you know what I mean, like, they found all this water",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
137,Chris, I was talking about like craters,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
137,Teacher," Yeah, we were on your answer",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, And your answer,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"Yeah, that's where we were",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, I'll read it verbatim scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," Luis, put your hand up for just a minute we'll get to you in just a moment",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,So let's go back,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, Help me understand what led you to your conclusion,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," Do me a favor, go back into the text",,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, Your next up,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,So Chris,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Chris, I thought that,,,230.2,response,2,1,2
137,Chris, Okay,,,230.2,response,2,1,2
137,Chris," So I said, Okay, so you have to find quiet and you both do the bidding",,,230.2,response,2,1,2
137,Chris, So one of the key words in the question was what,,,230.2,response,2,1,2
137,Chris,"Okay, so when I was reading",,,230.2,response,2,1,2
137,Chris,And then when I was looking at the meeting,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Chris," So I thought, yeah, that's where they'll find it",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Chris, I saw that there was all this water that it was mostly located in the craters,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Teacher,but I believe we've had just a little bit of misunderstanding,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," Does that make sense, just a little bit",,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, We can easily,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," That's actually very well done,",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,And that's a very logical series of steps you took to get to that answer,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, Did you find the information about the crater,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"Sure, if I were to so do me a favor, which paragraph",,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Chris,"Um, let's paragraph one",,,230.2,response,2,1,2
137,Teacher," So, would you mind Chris, would you mind reading paragraphs one and two for the class, please",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"Yeah, I see, I see",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, In the last minute,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Chris, Scientists have known for a long time that the moon is it desert because it has no opposite like we have,,,120.3,response,2,1,2
137,Chris,"Yeah, okay",,,120.3,response,2,1,2
137,Chris,"However, a usable that there was no water on",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Chris,And we can imagine that I read the rest it so you have plenty of time,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Chris, Yeah,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"Yeah, there we go",,,,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," Alright, so after reading it",,,,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, Thank you for that,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," However, if we look at paragraph two it goes a little bit more in depth, from what I see",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,Good,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, Right,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," So let's look specifically at paragraph number two, both of them mentioned craters",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,Let's look specifically at,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," Well, I'm just going to read the whole thing quickly for myself, NASA send a small machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate that lunar orbiter would land in the south pole deposits",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,These ice deposits for very small sounds,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, It says that one of the top 10 layers,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," Okay, good",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, That was for myself,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, Thank you guys and that they would contain water,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,How about we look halfway down,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," Do you see the sign the sinister begin scientists said that one ton, you see that sentence",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"I'm going to read that for all of us, scientists said that one time of the top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,is that a lot of water Chris,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, And if we continue that's that's only about four glasses of water,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Chris, I guess it's not,,,120.3,response,2,1,2
137,Chris,"Um, no",,,120.3,response,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"Yeah, maybe not",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," So if we look back down at your answer, which was there, full of water on the moon",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,Is that completely accurate,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Chris,"No, because they're not as there's just a little bit of water like not a lot of water",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
137,Teacher, And if we go back,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, Isn't it,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," So it's really, really small and spread over a really large area",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, It actually says that we need a microscope to see the water,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"I love where you went with that and it was a very logical series of steps that you took,",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,but for time we're gonna move on over to Luis,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"we just need to take it a little bit further,",,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,I see,,,,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, You had a question,,,,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"Yes, sure",,,,remark,2,1,2
137,Luis, So I think I'm good,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Luis," I was just gonna say, I think I can go back to my seat",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Luis,"Yeah, I, I think I've got this all figured out",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Teacher, I'm going to read it for everybody so we can remember says scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,I'd actually like if we stayed together as a group,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," I like the small group dynamic, would you mind staying with us and following along,",,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,actually let's go on to your answer,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, I bet they absolutely did have to use some a lot of equipment to get to the moon,,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," So absolutely use a lot of equipment to get up there, so you're not wrong in that regard",,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, I can't imagine just you know stroll up to the moon,,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,Sure,,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"So your answer was that they use oxygen tanks, essentially, is what your answer was",,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,But I'm going to reread the question for myself and for the class what equipment did scientist used to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"So, would you mind going back in the text and finding that for me, while you're looking",,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"I'm going to go over to Jazmin, since we're low on time, Jazmin",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, You had your hand up,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, What were you gonna say,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Jazmin,"I was just gonna say that I was still a little bit confused about some of the stuff like I think they understand like, so in this being the right answer",,,230.2,response,2,1,2
137,Jazmin, That seems like the right answer,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Jazmin," Right, so",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Jazmin,"And I understand that, like the NASA scientists machine called a lunar orbiter to discover the water like that",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Jazmin,I understand that,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Jazmin," But I think what I was confused by was that there were like, I guess I'm wondering like why",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Jazmin,"Like why that was the right answer and like Farrah, and Oliver's the answer was like about the microscope like is the or even like this stuff about like the spacesuits and the masks that is it just the lunar orbiter part of the answer or should you answer like with all the thing",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"In reality, I'm not sure any teacher would count it wrong, myself included, if you put  Every bit of it",,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"You know, if you put the lunar order and the microscope and just about anything",,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, I don't think I'd counted wrong because technically that is correct,,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,Every little bit that us to get to the moon and find the water is technically correct,,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, So if we go back up and we see that,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"However, if we read the question itself specifically what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," That's our buzzword right there, discover the water",,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," More specifically, that you're looking at it and actually seeing it in order to see it, you would need to have already discovered it by this point, right",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,If we look at the microscope,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
137,Jazmin, So does that make sense in that,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
137,Jazmin, Yeah,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
137,Jazmin,Makes a lot of sense,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
137,Jazmin,Makes sense to me,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Jazmin," But like I think that, yeah",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Jazmin," Okay, so it's the orbiter was like that thing actually found the water and then they studied the water later, but first you have to find is that right",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"Yeah, that makes complete and total sense",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, Well done,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, That was a good job connecting the dots there,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," Help me, help me with yours",,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, I asked you to find where you found your information in the text,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, Where'd you see it,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,Luis,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"Luis Let's move back over here real quick before we hop over to Oliver I see your hand, you can put it down,",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Luis, And I think that was the thing right like,,,230.2,response,2,1,2
137,Luis,So I think it was a trick question because I did not find it,,,230.2,response,2,1,2
137,Luis, I think I just brought that in from outside,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Luis, Yeah,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Luis," Like, I think pretty much like I got that from like what I already know",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Luis, You know what I mean like it wasn't in the text,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Luis, There was nothing about like face masks and stuff like that,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Luis,It wasn't there,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Teacher, Sometimes,,,410.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"I know from personal experience when I'm really excited about something I'm interested in, like, for example, music, I'm very interested",,,410.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"I'll just kind of rush through and pull information from other bits of what I've already read about music, or in this case about science into what we're already reading",,,410.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," Yeah, they should probably do use oxygen tanks when they go to space",,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,So in essence,,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, Right,,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, They need to breathe,,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, So maybe in the future use that information,,,430.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher," But just make sure inside of whatever given takes that you have that you take it, maybe a little bit slower find all the information there and and then apply that",,,430.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, Sure,,,430.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, So what it's asking,,,430.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,But not necessarily applicable to this specific text,,,430.3,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, If,,,,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, I believe we were hot hopping over to you next have any can put your hand down,,,,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher,"Alright, Oliver",,,,remark,2,1,2
137,Teacher, I see that you're waiting,,,,remark,2,1,2
137,Oliver," I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Oliver,I'm sure thing,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Oliver," So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Oliver, But before we go to lunch,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Oliver,I really wanted to thank you for helping us to really make sure that we were using evidence from the text in our answers and you really asked us like about our thinking,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Oliver,And you really like had us kind of like prove what we were saying by also like explaining what we were thinking and let us take time,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Oliver,You like really let us take time to explain our ideas like sometimes we interrupt each other but like you're really made sure that everybody was listened to,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Oliver,And like I think everybody thought really value and like finally you really explain what we needed to work,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Oliver,And you gave us ideas about what what we needed to do to like improve our answers,,,,response,2,1,2
137,Oliver," So I think like every single one of us, even if we're not like totally on the answer or totally understanding",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Oliver,"Everybody knows, like what we need to work on to get to the right answer",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Oliver," And like, that's really cool because that doesn't happen all the time",,,,response,2,1,2
137,Oliver, So just wanted to say thank you bye bye,,,,response,2,1,2
138,Farrah,Hi,,,,response,0,0,2
138,Farrah, How are you today?,,,,response,0,0,2
138,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,0,2

138,Luis, I have a question,,,,response,0,0,2
138,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,0,2
138,Luis," So I already know, like, all about space",,,,response,0,0,2
138,Luis, I don't think I need to be in this group,,,,response,0,0,2
138,Luis,"Yeah, okay",,,,response,0,0,2
138,Luis," So, like, I don't really think I need any help",,,,response,0,0,2
138,Teacher,"Well, I definitely think it would help if you stuck around and maybe you can help encourage your classmates to learn a little bit more, and even learn a little more yourself",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
138,Luis,"Okay, yeah, I can do that",,,110.3,response,0,0,2
138,Teacher,Awesome,,,,remark,0,0,2
138,Teacher,"Okay, does anybody else have any questions so far?",,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
138,Oliver,"Um, yeah, I have a quick question",,,150.1,response,0,0,2
138,Oliver," Um, so we were we were just discussing the text and looking at the question, how did scientists, or what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,150.1,response,0,0,2
138,Oliver,and we each had our answers,,,,response,0,0,2
138,Oliver," Um, what would you like",,,,response,0,0,2
138,Oliver," Um, what would you like us to do",,,,response,0,0,2
138,Oliver, Do you want us to keep discussing our answers,,,,response,0,0,2
138,Teacher,"Okay, so I think right now what we can do is discuss with your neighbor or even the group and kind of talk about where you guys got your answers from and what you'd like to know more about",,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
138,Oliver,"Okay, we can do that",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
138,Teacher,Yes?,,,,remark,0,0,2
138,Farrah,"Okay, so my, my question was when I was looking at the text again and we were when we were talking about it",,,,response,0,0,2
138,Farrah," Um, I still think my answer is right, like, I think that my answer about the microscope is right",,,,response,0,0,2
138,Farrah, So I really don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,0,0,2
138,Teacher,We just want to dig a little bit deeper into the text and maybe help your fellow students figure out some more details about what NASA did to find water on the moon,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
138,Farrah,Okay,,,420.2,response,0,0,2
138,Teacher,What else did you guys decide with your group discussion,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
138,Teacher,Go ahead,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
138,Jazmin,Who would you like to go?,,,120.4,response,0,0,2
138,Jazmin,It's Oliver and then Jazmin have their hand raised,,,,response,0,0,2
138,Teacher,Um Jazmin,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
138,Teacher, Go ahead,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
138,,"Okay, so basically what what we were discussing, we didn't agree, but I thought that the answer was the small machine which when I was looking was saying that, was a, was the Lunar Orbiter",,,120.4,,0,0,2
138,Jazmin, Was the Lunar Orbiter and so with the small machine,,,,response,0,0,2
138,Jazmin," I think that's what they used to discover the one and that's the answer, but I think that Chris and Luis thought something else",,,,response,0,0,2
138,Jazmin,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,0,2
138,Teacher,"Okay, well let's see what Chris and Luis thought as well",,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
138,Chris, And when we went to NASA,,,130.2,response,0,0,2
138,Chris, I basically like my dad took me to NASA,,,130.2,response,0,0,2
138,Chris," We went and saw like all of this, like, um like all of these like space suits and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff that like Luis was talking about",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
138,Chris,"Okay, so I'm like, here's the thing",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
138,Chris,"So like I was just thinking like, I think that's missing from the text like I think that's important to have those things, you know, like how could they go up there without oxygen tanks, they had to use that to discover the water",,,,response,0,0,2
138,Teacher,"Yeah, so I would say based on our text here, they've used different equipment to discover that there was water on the moon",,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
138,Teacher," So we know that they sent up that small machine and Farrah, we know that we have to use a microscope to actually see the water",,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
138,Teacher,"And Jazmin, you mentioned that they did use the Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
138,Teacher,"So I think you guys are on the right track with that and then Chris and Luis, you guys agreed that there was other equipment used",,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
138,Teacher,"But since they sent a small machine, I don't know that we would have needed the equipment for actual people like oxygen things to check that out",,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
138,Teacher,"Oliver, you have a question",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
138,Oliver,"Oh yeah, um, well actually, at the end, maybe I'm thinking a little differently um like, I was thinking, so you'll have to use all the things to discover the water, is that the idea?",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
138,Teacher,"Yeah, so um in paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, and basically look for these ice deposits, and since the water was so small, we then have to use a microscope to see it",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
138,Oliver, But before we go her just wanted to thank you for working with us today and,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
138,Oliver," Um, well, we have to go to lunch, unfortunately",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
138,Oliver,"Okay, gotcha",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
138,Oliver,I wanted to thank you for being so patient with each of our answers and for making sure that you were able to listen to each of our answers because sometimes,,,,response,0,0,2
138,Oliver, So thank you so much for working with us,,,,response,0,0,2
138,Oliver,"We don't always each like get called on in class, and it's really nice that we each had a chance to talk this time",,,,response,0,0,2
138,Teacher, You all did a good job,,,,remark,0,0,2
138,Teacher," Thank you, guys",,,,remark,0,0,2
138,Teacher,Awesome,,,,remark,0,0,2
138,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,0,2
138,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,0,2
138,Luis, So I don't think I need to be in this group,,,,response,1,0,2
138,Luis, So I kind of know like all this stuff about space,,,,response,1,0,2
138,Teacher,And maybe if you do understand everything you can help out some of your classmates,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher,"Well, I think we're all going to work together to form a deeper understanding of the article",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
138,Luis,"Yeah, I could do that",,,150.1,response,1,0,2
138,Luis, That sounds cool,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
138,Teacher,Awesome,,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher," Well guys, I've taken a look at the answers that you gave to the question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher," I want you to take another look at the article, and I want you to either underline or circle words that are similar to the question or words that you think would be really important",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher,And while each of you had really good thought processes,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher,"Alright guys so What words did you guys pick out that were really important or key terms, in your opinion",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,0,2
138,Farrah,"Okay, so in in the text I picked out the word microscope",,,,response,1,0,2
138,Farrah, Yeah microscope and microscopic,,,,response,1,0,2
138,Farrah,Microscopic and let's see what else,,,,response,1,0,2
138,Teacher,"Okay, great",,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher, So what made you choose those two words,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
138,Farrah,"Um, well, I chose them because I think that that's the equipment that the scientists you use",,,230.1,response,1,0,2
138,Farrah,"  It's the equipment, because it says that the waters microscopic and then you can't see it without the microscope",,,230.1,response,1,0,2
138,Farrah, If you can't see it,,,230.1,response,1,0,2
138,Farrah, And I think that that tells us why,,,230.1,response,1,0,2
138,Farrah," So I'm thinking like, you know, you can't find it",,,230.1,response,1,0,2
138,Teacher,"Okay, that's a really good thought",,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher," Jazmin, would you like to go next",,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher, I want to hear from your classmates and then we're going to come back together and see what everyone thinks about your key terms,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher, Farrah,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher, Okay,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Jazmin," I circled equipment, and then discover, then I looked at the text, I also circled, in paragraph two, investigate",,,130.2,response,1,0,2
138,Jazmin,"I was trying to figure out why my answer was wrong, and when I looked at it",,,130.2,response,1,0,2
138,Jazmin, So the word that I circled I circled keywords in the question,,,130.2,response,1,0,2
138,Teacher, Jazmin,,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher," So it looks like so far, Farrah, and Jazmin",,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher,"Okay, that's a good job",,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher,And so let's hear from Luis and see what he has to say,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher, Okay,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher, You guys have both talked about equipment,,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher, And we'll come together with a group response,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Luis, Absolutely,,,130.2,response,1,0,2
138,Luis, Like I said equipment too,,,130.2,response,1,0,2
138,Luis, So I basically um yeah so what I was looking at when I was looking at the reading was I basically was saying,,,130.2,response,1,0,2
138,Luis, I always like to talk,,,130.2,response,1,0,2
138,Luis," And then I said, like",,,130.2,response,1,0,2
138,Luis,"Yeah, yeah, yeah",,,130.2,response,1,0,2
138,Luis,What else did I put on,,,,response,1,0,2
138,Luis," Yeah, but I basically circled equipment and that was it",,,,response,1,0,2
138,Teacher,"Okay, great",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher, So the three of you guys have chosen equipment as a key term which is really good because it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher, So maybe we can use a combination of equipment and see what equipment helped us discover water,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher, You also said that discover and investigate were really similar,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher,Jazmin,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher,And although it was microscopic,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher," Um, let's see what NASA sent to the moon and if there any other equipment pieces that you guys think are really important Chris, would you like to add something",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Chris,Yeah I okay so I went to NASA with like that,,,210.2,response,1,0,2
138,Chris," So I was wondering, like, is that part of you know what I mean is that part of how they found the found the water?",,,210.2,response,1,0,2
138,Chris, We saw that scientists like use oxygen masks and two and things like that,,,210.2,response,1,0,2
138,Chris, And when we were there,,,210.2,response,1,0,2
138,Teacher,"I definitely think that those pieces of equipment could be important, but I think that we're looking for a little bit more specific piece of equipment that helped us discover water",,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher," You can ask me, but this is what I want you guys to focus on",,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher,I want you guys to break up into small groups so Farrah Oliver and Chris and then maybe Jazmin and Luis If you guys will work together for just a little bit,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher, And if you have questions while you're discussing,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher,I want you to help each other,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher, Understand the text,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher, And so now that we know the key words that everybody thinks I want you guys to reconstruct your answer to give us a little bit more detail about the equipment that specifically helped us discover water,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,0,2
138,Farrah, Thank you,,,,response,1,0,2
138,Farrah, This was really fun,,,,response,1,0,2
138,Farrah,"So unfortunately, we have to go to our next class, but I wanted to thank you so much for working with us",,,,response,1,0,2
138,Teacher, Thank you so much,,,,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher,Awesome,,,,remark,1,0,2
138,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,0,2
138,Luis, I think I'm all good,,,,response,2,0,2
138,Luis," So, um, yeah",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Luis," So I kind of, I think I got this all figured out",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Teacher,All right,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher," And let's see how our answers may have changed, based on your group discussion",,,220.1,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,"Guys, let's bring it back together as a as one group",,,220.1,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher, How do you guys think you could reconstruct your answer to be just a little bit more detailed,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,I want to ask you guys after you've talked to your partners or your group members and we circled are underlined key terms in the text and in your questions,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,Oliver would you like to share first,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
138,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
138,Oliver, So I was thinking when you said like more detailed like that we need to use like,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
138,Oliver,"A complete sentence and like like draw from the, from the text right like from the things that we circled or underlined and like say this is why",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Oliver, So if I was gonna say my answer,,,,response,2,0,2
138,Oliver," Well, I guess",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Oliver," Like, I guess",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Oliver,I think that's right,,,,response,2,0,2
138,Oliver, Can I still say microscope or I guess it's the lunar orbiter isn't,,,,response,2,0,2
138,Teacher, It's good that you've pulled in the Lunar Orbiter,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,"So you can definitely still say that your answer is, is a big part of what you want to reconstruct to, but I think to be a little more specific",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,"And now that you've chosen to answer that gives us more detail, instead of just circling the same as Farrah",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher, Your thought process is a lot deeper as well,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
138,Oliver,"Yeah, I'm trying to think like how to explain it in my own words, you know,",,,310.1,response,2,0,2
138,Teacher," Well, I know that a couple of you guys had your hand raised",,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,Sure,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher, Since you guys may have similar answers,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher," But Chris, would you like to share how your it's your may have been reconstructed and maybe that will help Oliver with his words",,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
138,Chris,"I wasn't really answering the question, so I ok so my answer now would be like that scientists are found craters full of water on the moon by using the lunar orbiter",,,130.2,response,2,0,2
138,Teacher," First of all, because I know that that's a really important detail, but now that we know how it was found in those craters we've answered the question with much more detail",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,"Great, that's, that's really good Chris",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher, So I appreciate that you noticed where the water was found,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,Let's hear from your partner Jazmin and see what she has to say,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
138,Jazmin,"Okay, so basically, the first thing I was gonna say is that I'm still a little bit confused",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin, And I think what I'm confused about is how Like how we can make sure that our answers are complete,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin," I said NASA sent a small machine, then I could add Lunar Orbiter, but I'm not sure how to do more than that",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin,"I think I understand what Chris did, but I'm not quite sure how to make my answer more complete",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Teacher, And now that you've added the name you've definitely added more detail,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher, So I think that you're on the right track because they did send a small machine,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,Sure,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher, Jazmin,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,"One thing that may help you in the future is to answer the question, as if you were teaching about the question",,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher," So if somebody was new to reading this passage, just like you guys were, how would you best explain it to them so that they would get a full picture of what you guys are reading",,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
138,Jazmin,Oh that's really interesting,,,420.2,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin,"I just want to make sure that they they answered the question so that whatever they said like I would want to make sure that it was like, it answered the question about equipment and discovering water",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Teacher,"Sure, so you can also remind them if you were teaching or even from your perspective as a student, if you can answer the question, and then give us a little bit more detail as to why that your answer that will help you with a with a more concrete answer",,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher, Okay,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,Sure Oliver,,,,remark,2,0,2
138,Oliver,"Um, so I was just gonna share and I thought this was kind of interesting, based on what we're talking about that I read somewhere that there could possibly be a base on the moon like a settlement by by 2024 like that's what NASA was trying to do",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Teacher,"Yeah, so I think that's really good information",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher," I want to bring us back to the question, though",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher, And I appreciate you sharing with us,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,Does anybody have any questions remaining about that,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,And I want to make sure that everybody has a really good understanding of why it was the lunar orbiter that helped us discover the microscopic water,,,220.1,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,"Farrah, would you like to go first",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
138,Farrah,"Yeah, I don't think it's actually, I guess, I guess I don't really have a question, because I understand why it's the lunar orbiter because it's not",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
138,Farrah,It didn't say those tricky in the in the reading,,,,response,2,0,2
138,Farrah, They studied using a microscope,,,,response,2,0,2
138,Farrah, Is that the right way to look at it,,,,response,2,0,2
138,Farrah, It didn't say that they discovered it using the microscope,,,,response,2,0,2
138,Farrah," So, is that right",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Teacher,Sure,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher," I think that um, you know, earlier we discussed how discover and investigate were two really big key terms in the question and the article,",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher," That gives us a path to answer Lunar Orbiter, because that is what the scientists use to discover it",,,130.3,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,And since we're looking at the question when it says discover the water on the moon,,,130.3,remark,2,0,2
138,Teacher,"Jazmin, would you like to add anything to that",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
138,Jazmin,"Yeah, we have to go to lunch",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin,"I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and, like, in particular, I wanted to thank you for making sure that we were using the words",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin,"From the question, like the word discover in what we were looking at",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin," And not just that, but like you have this use evidence in our interests and you also like you asked us a lot about",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin, We all you know like,,,,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin, And so I think we all really valued in a minute,,,,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin,"Like you help us to clarify what we were trying to say because you asked us, like, why did we say this, or what were we thinking, even me",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin, And it was pretty cool,,,,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin," And so, thank you so much for coming",,,,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin,Like you really were listening to us,,,,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin, And you also like beginning explain like what we needed to work on and like how we could improve our answer,,,,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin,So I think we learned a lot,,,,response,2,0,2
138,Jazmin, Thank you so much,,,,response,2,0,2
139,Farrah,How are you doing,,,,response,0,1,2
139,Teacher,Hi Luis,,,,remark,0,1,2
139,Luis, I don't really need any help,,,,response,0,1,2
139,Luis," I already know like all this stuff about space already um like, I don't think I need to be in this group",,,,response,0,1,2
139,Luis,I have a question,,,,response,0,1,2
139,Teacher,"Okay, well, we do want to focus your attention on the article we just read and we're going to examine this article and try to determine how scientists have gone about finding water and the craters on the moon",,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,"And turning our attention to that question and you all have read, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
139,Farrah,We can go one at a time and give you our answers again,,,120.2,response,0,1,2
139,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,0,1,2
139,Farrah,"Okay, so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and",,,,response,0,1,2
139,Oliver,Yeah I circled the same thing as Farrah,,,,response,0,1,2
139,Chris,"Um, so scientists foudn craters full of water on the moon",,,,response,0,1,2
139,Teacher,They said that scientists need a microscope to find water in the craters on the moon,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,"And just for a second, let's examine what Farrah and Oliver just said",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher, Does this text actually support that idea that you need a microscope find water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,And that and what do you think about that,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
139,Oliver,I agree,,,,response,0,1,2
139,Farrah,I think so,,,210.2,response,0,1,2
139,Teacher,And what part of that passage do you see that reference that you need a microscope?,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
139,Farrah, You wouldn't be able to see the water without the microscope,,,210.2,response,0,1,2
139,Farrah,I would say okay so in paragraph three it talks about how you need the microscope,,,210.2,response,0,1,2
139,Teacher,Exactly,,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher," You look at paragraph three, you will in fact see that it says you need a microscope",,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,"Good job, Farrah is exactly right",,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
139,Farrah,But I know that we're here in the group to sort of help with our answers,,,110.2,response,0,1,2
139,Farrah, But I am not really sure why my answer is wrong,,,110.2,response,0,1,2
139,Farrah, It seems it is the microscope,,,110.2,response,0,1,2
139,Teacher,"In fact, it is the microscope and part of the answers is right, it is the microscope",,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher, Why do you think they need to work real closely at the water that's on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,"And you type in your answer, you said they need the microscope to look real closely",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher," Yes, Oliver?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher, What is it about the water on the moon that necessitates the fact that they need to look closely at it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Oliver,"Um okay, so you have to look really closely because you can't see it with just your eye",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
139,Oliver, You have to see it through the microscope,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
139,Teacher, And why can't you see it with your eyes?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,Exactly,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,What is it about water,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Oliver,"Because it's so small, like the the particles of water are so are so tiny",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
139,Teacher, That's going to make tiny objects appear large,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher," So, you know, you think about water on Earth",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher, We all need a microscope,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,"Absolutely, they're small",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher," We look at ponds, lakes, oceans, we can see that water",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,"But on the line as conveyed in that passage, we can see that the water is small and we need this microscope to make it appear large and that's the purpose of the microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher," So, good job there",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher, That's exactly why we need it because we cannot see the water that's in these craters,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher, Is there any other equipment that we need,,,120.1,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,"What other instruments do we, we determined that we need an instrument called a microscope we know what the microscope does and why we need it",,,120.1,remark,0,1,2
139,Jazmin,"Yeah, I think that we would need the small machine that they sent up into space and I think, I guess I'm confused, like why is my answer wrong?",,,120.1,response,0,1,2
139,Teacher,They need a small machine,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher," Could you elaborate on that, what exactly do you mean by a small machine",,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,And go ahead and refer to the text and see if you can find textual evidence that supports the fact that they need a small machine,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
139,Jazmin,"Well I guess what I'm trying to find, it says that in paragraph two, that NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
139,Teacher,"Exactly, exactly",,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,we can see they send a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter in this case,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,"They do need a small machine and, more specifically, as you just said in paragraph two, we can see they send a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter in this case",,,230.3,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher, So you're right,,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher," They do need a small machine and,",,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,0,1,2
139,Chris,"Yeah, so I went to NASA with my dad and we saw like all like spacesuits and and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff that people had to use",,,,response,0,1,2
139,Chris,"So I guess I'm kind of confused like, did they not have to use those things like, was that, like, did they not not need them",,,,response,0,1,2
139,Teacher,"And you're right, whenever they go into space, there's a lot of equipment they have to use to get into space, to get to the moon, to land on the moon,",,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,but specifically this paragraph address is just a small part of that process and that is actually investigating the craters on the moon,,,410.3,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher," So, that is right, Chris",,,410.3,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,They do need a lot of equipment to get there,,,410.3,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher, But this article that we have here is examining just one little part of that whole process,,,410.3,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher," You know, a lot of equipment to land and they need equipment to examine the craters",,,410.3,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,"Yes, Oliver",,,,remark,0,1,2
139,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,1,2
139,Oliver,"So unfortunately,",,,,response,0,1,2
139,Oliver,We have to go to lunch,,,,response,0,1,2
139,Oliver," I just wanted to, um, I just wanted to thank you for a second",,,,response,0,1,2
139,Oliver,But before we go to lunch,,,,response,0,1,2
139,Oliver,for working with us today,,,,response,0,1,2
139,Oliver, And we,,,,response,0,1,2
139,Oliver,You were very patient with us,,,,response,0,1,2
139,Oliver," And you were very positive, the whole way through",,,,response,0,1,2
139,Oliver, So thank you so much,,,,response,0,1,2
139,Oliver, When a teacher listens,,,,response,0,1,2
139,Oliver,I think we really feel like you were very positive listening to our answers and talking to us today and it's really nice,,,,response,0,1,2
139,Teacher, Thank you all for being such great students,,,,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher, Oliverin,,,,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,1,2
139,Teacher,Hi,,,,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,1,1,2
139,Luis, Oh,,,,response,1,1,2
139,Luis," So I was just gonna say like, um, I think I have to be in this room because I already like all out space",,,,response,1,1,2
139,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,1,2
139,Teacher,Okay and Luis So you have read the text right the text that is water on the moon?,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher," The question is, what equipment, the scientists use discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,What was your answer to that question,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"Yeah, there is a question",,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
139,Luis,So I said that scientists use a lot of it like oxygen tanks and stuff like that,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"And what made you say that answer in relation to the question that was asked, and the text that you read",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Luis, I was thinking like what did they use to discover the water,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
139,Luis,"So I thought, well, in terms of the question",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
139,Luis,"And I was like, well, I know that they use like they have to have oxygen tanks and they have to have that kind of stuff in order to breathe",,,,response,1,1,2
139,Luis," So I was like,",,,,response,1,1,2
139,Luis," Okay, so that was something that happened to us like even if it's in the reading or not",,,,response,1,1,2
139,Luis,Oh yeah,,,,response,1,1,2
139,Luis," I was like, Oh yeah, well that's gotta be part of the answer",,,,response,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"Okay, now, like how you have started thinking about question",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher," It did say what equipment do they use discover water on the moon, and you're starting to think about what equipment  Would they need to find water on the moon",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"However, you really have to go to the text and find specific equipment that is mentioned in the text",,,410.3,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"So, Luis, if you would",,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher," And if you don't, what is mentioned",,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher, Right now go to the text and find some equipment that is specifically mentioned in the text and see if your answer is there if you see oxygen tanks mentioned,,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
139,Luis,"Okay, yeah, I guess they don't really talk about like oxygen tanks, they talk about Lunar Orbiter and microscopes",,,420.3,response,1,1,2
139,Teacher, And you're right,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher, You have mentioned two pieces of equipment that are specifically referenced in the text Lunar Orbiter and microscope,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher, That's great,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,Okay,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"I'd like you to focus on just the microscopes, does it mentioned in the text that the microscope was used to find water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"And in fact, yet",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher, Luis You keep on looking for that,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"And I know that Farrah, in fact did mention microscopes in her answer",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"And you said that they use the microscope so Farrah, I'd like to turn to you and Luis You keep on looking for that information",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher, I'll turn to Farrah Farrah,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,Why did you say microscopes in relation to that question,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Farrah,"So I was I'm still I'm still a little confused about why my answer is wrong, but I can't tell you what I was thinking",,,110.1,response,1,1,2
139,Farrah," So basically, when I looked at the text like I saw",,,110.1,response,1,1,2
139,Farrah, They were talking about how it's like microscope and he said you couldn't even see it unless you would look through the mircoscope,,,,response,1,1,2
139,Farrah,I think it's in paragraph three,,,,response,1,1,2
139,Farrah,"So I was thinking like, you know, how did they find the microscope",,,,response,1,1,2
139,Farrah, So the microscope has to be the answer,,,,response,1,1,2
139,Farrah," Oh, OK",,,,response,1,1,2
139,Farrah, If they decide how could they find the water if they if they couldn't even see you know what I mean,,,,response,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"However, I do want you to look at that part of the text again and ask yourself",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher," I like how you read the text you saw mentioned microscope and you're thinking, well, I have to have a microscope to see the water deposit",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,Right,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher," Therefore, the microscope is what was used to find as water deposits",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,Was the microscope used to find water on the moon?,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"Remember, he uses a microscope",,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher, Humans look through a microscope right scientists look through a microscope,,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,Were their scientists on the moon to use that microscope to see the water deposits,,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
139,Farrah," Um, I'm not sure I have to look at again",,,210.3,response,1,1,2
139,Farrah,Interesting,,,210.3,response,1,1,2
139,Farrah,"Okay, so it looks like, Well, I don't see anything about scientists, so I'm guessing no",,,,response,1,1,2
139,Farrah,"So my question like, how did they find it",,,,response,1,1,2
139,Farrah, If they didn't use the microscope,,,,response,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"Right, so the microscope",,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher," However, scientists were not on the moon",,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher," If a human or a scientist wanted to see those water deposits, they don't have to use a microscope",,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher, All right,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher," Was there a piece of equipment referenced in the text that was on the moon, and Chris get to in just a minute",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,What was on the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,Was there a piece of equipment that was mentioned on the moon?,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,So I want you to look for that Farrah look to see if there's a piece of equipment that was on the moon,,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"And Chris, what would you",,,,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher, You had your hand up,,,,remark,1,1,2
139,Chris,"Yeah, I was",,,,response,1,1,2
139,Chris," I was actually gonna say, I'm thinking about what Farrah was saying",,,,response,1,1,2
139,Chris," And so I guess I was wondering, like,",,,,response,1,1,2
139,Chris,"That, like, I went to NASA with my dad and we saw that like scientists use a lot of like masks at suits like Luis was saying",,,,response,1,1,2
139,Chris, So it's not in the answer,,,,response,1,1,2
139,Chris,I guess that doesn't if I'm remembering from what you said to Luis It's not in the reading,,,,response,1,1,2
139,Chris,But it seems like that was an important thing to have,,,,response,1,1,2
139,Chris,Thing to have like an even if it's not masters,,,,response,1,1,2
139,Chris,I guess I'm confused,,,,response,1,1,2
139,Chris, Yeah,,,,response,1,1,2
139,Teacher, Scientists are going to be using a lot of equipment when they go to the moon,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,You're right,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher, What was your answer to that question,,,430.2,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"In the text, you need to look for specific equipment referenced in a text so Chris",,,430.2,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher, Did you find specific equipment that was referenced in the text itself,,,430.2,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,Because we must always refer to the text,,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
139,Chris,"No, I didn't find equipment",,,420.2,response,1,1,2
139,Chris,What I I was looking at was the water,,,,response,1,1,2
139,Chris,So I said that scientists breeders full of water,,,,response,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"Right, and I do like how you have focused on part of the question you focused on the part where it says they, they discovered water on the moon and you specifically said where they found water on the moon, they found it in the craters",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,So I would like you to do Chris is go back to the text,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,"You know, they found water in the moon, you know, they found it in the craters and that's great",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher, Oliver?,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher," I want you to ask yourself what equipment, did they send into the craters to find that water as on the moon",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
139,Oliver, Thank you,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
139,Oliver, I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
139,Oliver, But before we go to lunch,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
139,Oliver,"So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
139,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher, Thank you,,,,remark,1,1,2
139,Teacher,Yes Luis,,,,remark,2,1,2
139,Luis," So I think that like I got everything pretty much figured out, so I think I'm all good",,,,response,2,1,2
139,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,2,1,2
139,Teacher,"Okay, and you did read the text, right, which was water is a valuable resource",,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
139,Luis,Yeah,,,150.1,response,2,1,2
139,Luis,"I read it carefully, this time",,,,response,2,1,2
139,Teacher, What was your answer to that question,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,"Okay, and you did answer the question was, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Luis,"I said on water can be split into two parts, oxygen and hydrogen",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
139,Teacher,"Okay, and I do like how you have referenced something in the text that is specifically mentioned it does in fact say that water can be broken down into oxygen and hydrogen",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, Why is that valuable that it can be broken into oxygen and hydrogen,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,And what was your thinking when you said that is your answer,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,Why does that make water valuable,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
139,Luis,"I was thinking, looking at the meeting because I made sure to look this up and I said, like they said, I'm",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
139,Luis," Well, you could do all the steps of oxygen can like astronauts can breathe it and like hydrogen and oxygen can be used to make rocket fuel",,,,response,2,1,2
139,Luis, You know what I mean like that would seem very valuable to me,,,,response,2,1,2
139,Luis,That like you can,,,,response,2,1,2
139,Teacher, So your initial answer kind of got started on that process,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,Absolutely,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher," You said it can be split the oxygen, hydrogen",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, That's a great answer,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher," The fact that when I break it down the oxygen, hydrogen astronauts can breathe the oxygen And they can use the oxygen and hydrogen as fuel",,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, That's why it's valuable,,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,but that detail you just added is critical,,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, So that's a great answer,,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, That's why it's valuable,,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,So that second Part that you just gave me,,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
139,Luis,"Oh, thank you",,,420.2,response,2,1,2
139,Teacher,"And Jazmin, what was, what was your answer to that question",,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Jazmin,I said yes,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
139,Jazmin, You can't survive without water,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
139,Jazmin," And I said, the astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
139,Teacher,Absolutely,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, And that is great because you obviously went to the text and the text does in fact say that astronauts could drink the water,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, But why can't take a spring water with them,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher," Could the astronauts, you just bring in the water with them",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,and why does that make it valuable,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher," What do you say,",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, What's your thinking there,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,You did kind of explain that you said that they need water,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Jazmin,"Okay, let's really see cuz I'm like I was still use like maybe why my answer wasn't quite right",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
139,Jazmin," But actually, that makes a lot of sense",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
139,Teacher, And your answer is right,,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,"I will say, Jazmin",,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, You're right,,,410.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, The fact that can they bring water with them can astronauts spray water with them on the on the rocket?,,,410.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,I just want to kind of add some detail to it,,,410.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher," They need that water to be able to drink, but there's something that the text add that makes it even more valuable",,,410.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Jazmin,"What he said you could you could, but it's super heavy so it takes it takes up all this room like a rocket ship",,,410.3,response,2,1,2
139,Jazmin,Exactly,,,,response,2,1,2
139,Jazmin, Beacuse then you wouldn't have to take as much with you,,,,response,2,1,2
139,Jazmin," It seems like it would be really good to have it with your phone, right",,,,response,2,1,2
139,Teacher,But it's even more valuable because they,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,Absolutely,,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher," They need that water to be able to drink, be able to survive",,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, So your initial answer was correct,,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher," They could, but it's going to take up too much space and that when you go into the moon",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,Can't really bring that water with them,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,Spaces valuable,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher," You know, you need to save as much space as you can",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, And it takes a lot of money to get stuff up to the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,"So your first answer was correct, but that added detail kind of gets to why it is even more valuable than what you mentioned",,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,"So, the less weight, I can turn that rocket the more money I'm going to save",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,Chris what was your answer?,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Chris,"OK, so my answer was that water is heavy",,,420.2,response,2,1,2
139,Chris, So it's good that they don't have to carry it in the ships,,,420.2,response,2,1,2
139,Teacher, I just mentioned with Jazmin right that water is heavy,,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,"Exactly and Chris, you got you got to that part",,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, So,,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,The fact that it's on the moon means they don't have to carry it on the rocket and that does make it extremely valuable right,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,Was there anything else in the text,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,"So you have mentioned something that is valuable, they can",,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, Is there anything else in the text that you can add of why water might be valuable,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,What else is valuable,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,They don't have to put that water on the rocket,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Chris,As well,,,230.3,response,2,1,2
139,Chris, And I guess if that was true,,,230.3,response,2,1,2
139,Chris, So I read somewhere that they were maybe going to try to put in a moon base by 2020 or like some kind of base,,,230.3,response,2,1,2
139,Chris, So like what he was saying like with the rocket fuel,,,,response,2,1,2
139,Chris,Then like it would be really important to have like not only water but like the other stuff,,,,response,2,1,2
139,Chris, So I'm thinking like the oxygen and hydrogen on that you can make from water like that would be useful as well,,,,response,2,1,2
139,Teacher,"Absolutely and that's in the text says, Great your point information out of the text that water H2O can be splitting the oxygen and hydrogen",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,"And like you said, I think they are planning on building a base on the moon",,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,As a stage to go further into the solar system like Mars,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, And you're absolutely right,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher," So they're going to need fuel, they're going to need oxygen, they're going to need hydrogen",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,"Water can be used to make those fuels and that can be used for that base, they might potentially build",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,"that's not referencing the text, but I do believe you are right about that",,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,Oliver what was your answer to that question,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
139,Oliver,"So my answer was, I said no because it's not ready yet",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
139,Teacher,Okay and and what exactly do you mean when you say it's not ready yet?,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
139,Oliver, They talked about how,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver, They said like later on in it,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver," So you know what I mean, like, you'd have to make it into something that you could bring and then like they said in the writing",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver,Like the water,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver," First off, like the water is ice",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver," And so I thought, like, you know, like maybe someday",,,,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver,"That the it would take a lot of time and money to, like, make it happen",,,,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver," It might be valuable, but like it doesn't seem like it's very convincing right now that there's very good",,,,response,2,1,2
139,Teacher, So you're right that water isn't ready yet,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,"Like what you've done, you got to that last paragraph, where it says that scientists need to come up with a plan for extracting the water",,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, They're going to have to Oliverelop a plan to extract water so it can be used,,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher,"And but let's let's consider this hypothetical situation where we do have, yes Oliver",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
139,Oliver," But, um, I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us today",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver," Again, we have to watch this",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver,"Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver, So like,,,,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver,"And like, in particular, there was all these things that you were doing with us, that I think really helped us along as like students",,,,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver,"Not only did you make sure that we used evidence from the text, but you also really asked us lots of questions about like our thinking",,,,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver,And you listen like really closely as we explained how we got to our answer you took all this time for us to explain our ideas and like I don't think anybody ever felt rushed like,,,,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver," So we all got to really feel like, you know, like, like, like",,,,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver,You know guys like yeah I think everybody felt like they had time to do everything and like,,,,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver," Not only that, but like, we also felt really value",,,,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver,"I think like we all had good ideas, even if we weren't right and then finally you like helped us to explain what we needed to work on",,,,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver, So it was pretty cool,,,,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver,"And then you gave us ideas on like how we could improve our answers, but then you let us improve the answers",,,,response,2,1,2
139,Oliver, Working with thank you so much for being here today,,,,response,2,1,2
139,Teacher, Thank you,,,,remark,2,1,2
139,Teacher, I appreciate it,,,,remark,2,1,2

140,Teacher, Are you guys ready,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
140,Luis,Excuse me teacher,,,150.1,response,1,0,3
140,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,0,3
140,Luis,"Um, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,3
140,Teacher,"Whoo, that's fabulous",,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher, Maybe you can help us understand even more about space,,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher," So stay with this group, you might be able to help us",,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
140,Luis,Okay,,,110.3,response,1,0,3
140,Teacher,"All right, so here's my first question, what tools and equipment",,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher, Did you see that the astronauts were using in space,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,Miss Jazmin,,,,remark,1,0,3
140,Jazmin,I saw that they used to small machine,,,,response,1,0,3
140,Teacher,Do you remember what that machine was,,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
140,Jazmin,No,,,230.1,response,1,0,3
140,Teacher,"Well, do you think that you could maybe find what machine you're talking about inside your text",,,230.2,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher, Did they use,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,"Miss Farrah I saw that your hand was raised, what, what kind of toll or equipment",,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
140,Farrah,Have I said that they use the microscope,,,120.2,response,1,0,3
140,Teacher, What is the microscope D,,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,Awesome,,,230.1,remark,1,0,3

140,Jazmin,I see,,,,response,1,0,3
140,Teacher, Is it wrong,,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher, What was that small machine used for,,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,"Well, your, your answer",,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher, I just want you to be a little bit more specific about what you're saying there was a small machine used,,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,Didn't they give us an name,,,,remark,1,0,3
140,Jazmin,"Yeah, is they said he was caught the Lunar Orbiter",,,,response,1,0,3
140,Teacher,Who don't want an orbiter,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher, What did it say that we did with it,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Jazmin,"They said it lands at the South Pole and looks for ice to pass it, and a large polar crater",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
140,Teacher, Hmm,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher, Are you guys thinking that we're going to be looking for a big pond of water or are we going to be looking for water that is extremely small,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher, If you have that machine and you have a microscope,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,Oh well,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,I see some hands shaking and,,,,remark,1,0,3
140,Chris,"Yeah, I see what you're saying",,,,response,1,0,3
140,Chris,"Um, I guess we wouldn't look for a big pond of water with a microscope, because we can see that",,,,response,1,0,3
140,Teacher, Are you going to see water that is in large areas or are we looking for little bitty areas of water is a main full of water,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher, So do you think based off of what you guys just told me that,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,Right,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Chris,When I read it,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
140,Chris,I sort of put the craters were full of water,,,,response,1,0,3
140,Teacher, What do you guys think,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher, But what Miss Jazmin just read and what's advantages told us,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher, It makes me think that there might not be full of water that we can see,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
140,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks shoots,,,130.1,response,1,0,3
140,Chris,I don't know,,,130.1,response,1,0,3
140,Chris," You know, I went to NASA",,,130.1,response,1,0,3
140,Teacher,They do use those and article even talks about using those different things,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher," When you think about water on the moon, are you thinking about oceans or are you thinking about those small those craters filled up with small amounts of water",,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,But the water,,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
140,Chris,"Oh,",,,210.3,response,1,0,3
140,Jazmin, I don't remember what did you say about the craters,,,,response,1,0,3

140,Teacher, If you were looking straight at it,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher, It's are we going to look at large bodies of water,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher, So from that scene,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,Is the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,All,No,,,210.4,,1,0,3
140,Teacher," The reason why you have to use a microscope, you can't see it with your naked eye",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,"Right, so we're looking at microscopic micro being small",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher, They use other equipment to like oxygen tanks and there's another one,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,"So you guys are completely right about the winner equipment and the microscope,",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3

140,Teacher,"Whoa, man",,,,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher," So, hmm",,,,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,Why do you think that they have to use mass to breathe on the moon,,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
140,Luis, So we can't breathe that era there,,,230.1,response,1,0,3
140,Luis,Cash because there isn't the same kind of air that we breathe here,,,230.1,response,1,0,3
140,Teacher,"Oh, who knows what the periodic element is for oxygen",,,140.1,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,So you might know what that is,,,,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,What is oxygen for what we breathe,,,,remark,1,0,3
140,Teacher,I don't know,,,,remark,1,0,3

140,Teacher," If you can split water up into two elements, like you said, how can you and Mr Chris that said that they had to use oxygen tanks come up with what the astronauts could use water on the main for",,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
140,Teacher,So,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
140,Teacher, Mm hmm,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3

140,Teacher,"By using what you and Mr Chris and Mr Chris, you can talk to",,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
140,Teacher, Luis and see how good your response and Luis just wanted to work together to help astronauts,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
140,Chris,"Okay, so, so I was talking about the meeting debrief and you said that to Luis And you're talking about them needing to drink on",,,130.2,response,2,0,3
140,Chris,"Okay, so, I mean, that makes me think, you know, like",,,,response,2,0,3
140,Chris," Um, okay",,,,response,2,0,3
140,Chris," Um, no, we don't breathe water, but we do breathe oxygen",,,,response,2,0,3
140,Chris," Wait, but that's we don't we don't breathe water",,,,response,2,0,3
140,Chris,Water is important to breathe them to drink,,,,response,2,0,3
140,Luis, So if water gets like split up into on hydrogen and oxygen then,,,,response,2,0,3
140,Luis,"Okay, okay",,,,response,2,0,3
140,Luis,"Okay, help me out",,,,response,2,0,3
140,Luis, Chris,,,,response,2,0,3

140,Teacher,To us and help benefit the astronauts when they go to the moon,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
140,Teacher," We do drink water because we have to have it for our bodies, but we breathe oxygen",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
140,Teacher, So hydrogen and oxygen,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
140,Teacher, Luis You said that those two elements are can be broken apart,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
140,Teacher, Think about them being separate now so your water molecules are now broken apart,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
140,Teacher,Mr,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
140,Teacher,You're left with hydrogen and oxygen,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3

140,Teacher,"Miss Jazmin, what do you think",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
140,Jazmin, You can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
140,Jazmin,"Well, I was thinking about the water can use",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
140,Teacher,"Okay, well, what do we know that the moon doesn't have",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3

140,Teacher,You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
140,Teacher,"So, what did you guys see in your mind when I read that? Jazmin?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
140,Jazmin,So I guess what I saw was like that the moon is really like a desert like it's really dry and there's just a little bit of water there,,,230.3,response,0,0,3
140,Jazmin,I guess that's kind of what I saw,,,,response,0,0,3

140,Teacher,"They don't really say that, is where Mr",,,410.2,remark,0,0,3
140,Teacher, Luis talks about that they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in our texts,,,410.2,remark,0,0,3

141,Teacher,Okay,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher," So real quick, back to the last question, Farrah, can you repeat the answer in that you came up with for this?",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
141,Farrah," So basically, you just need a scientific a tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
141,Farrah,"Oh yeah, okay",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
141,Teacher,"Okay, now in the test we did hear about how you might need a microscope to view this this these water molecules",,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher, Right?,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher,Now the question is asking for the tool that we use for this,,,210.1,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher,"You might want to take another guess at the tool used to get that, to get those microscopic images?",,,120.1,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,0,2
141,Jazmin,So I think that it was the small machine that they sent,,,,response,0,0,2
141,Jazmin, That's what they used,,,,response,0,0,2
141,Teacher," Does anybody, anyone have the specific name of the machine?",,,230.1,remark,0,0,2

141,Teacher,Any responses,,,,remark,0,0,2
141,Farrah,"Okay, so I'm actually wondering like why is my answer wrong?",,,,response,0,0,2
141,Teacher,With your answer is not wrong,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher," But if you look closely at the question, it was asking what the tool was to get that sample,  your answer was the tools to see it",,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher,"Well, you had the right idea about the microscope about the microscopic water molecules",,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher," Right, right",,,,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher,You had the right idea,,,,remark,0,0,2

141,Farrah,"Yes, they use the Lunar Orbiter to discover it",,,130.3,response,0,0,2
141,Farrah," And then they use the microscope to study, I think, is that right",,,130.3,response,0,0,2
141,Farrah," Um,",,,,response,0,0,2
141,Farrah, That makes a lot of sense,,,,response,0,0,2

141,Chris,"Yeah, but I'm okay",,,,response,0,0,2
141,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,0,2
141,Chris,"Okay, so I went to NASA and with my dad and I know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff to go up into space, like they didn't, did they not use that stuff to to discover the water?",,,,response,0,0,2
141,Teacher, If you look back at the discussion question it's looking for the specific tool or Oliverice specifically used for that purpose,,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher,"In a way, yes",,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher, But this is also why science questions are a little tricky,,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher,"Each each Oliverice has a particular purpose it is designed for, for example, like you said the oxygen tanks",,,210.1,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher,"The question was looking for the specific Oliverice us to find that one doesn't mean that all the other stuff is a used, it just means that's not the is the specific item that they were looking for",,,210.1,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher,"Yes, they did use oxygen tanks to find water, you know, but that was not exactly the purpose that those oxygen tanks were designed for",,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher,what are the oxygen tanks usually designed for? Anybody know?,,,140.1,remark,0,0,2
141,Chris,"Well, they're they're yeah they're designed so you can you can breathe in space",,,130.1,response,0,0,2
141,Teacher,But is that the specific Oliverice used to find the microscopic water samples?,,,210.1,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher,"Right, so they used to help people to breathe air, to breathe in space",,,210.1,remark,0,0,2
141,Chris,"No, no, that that was the the Lunar Orbiter",,,210.1,response,0,0,2
141,Teacher," So even though it wasn't, even though that they didn't use the oxygen takes to help them in their mission to find those samples",,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher,Right,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher, That's what the question was asked,,,410.1,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher,It's not the specific tool used to get to the water to get those samples,,,410.1,remark,0,0,2
141,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,0,0,2

141,Teacher,"Well, it's always good to go back and review things that you've learned",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
141,Teacher,And maybe you can help some of the other students because for some students,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
141,Teacher, This might be their first time learning about space,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
141,Luis,"Okay, yeah, I can do that",,,110.3,response,1,0,2

141,Teacher,You guys want to share your responses to this article,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
141,Farrah," Um, okay, so I said, you need a microscope to do the water",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
141,Farrah,"Sure, we can do that",,,120.4,response,1,0,2

141,Farrah, Let's see,,,230.2,response,1,0,2
141,Farrah,"Um, yeah, I can do that",,,230.2,response,1,0,2
141,Farrah,I said the water they found is microscopic meaning you would be able to see it if you were looking straight at it,,,,response,1,0,2
141,Farrah, You need a special tool called a microscope to look really close,,,,response,1,0,2
141,Teacher,"So what other kinds of equipment would you guys say that you would need to find water on the moon, other than a microscope",,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
141,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,1,0,2
141,Chris, So I know that you have to use all that stuff,,,,response,1,0,2
141,Chris,You'd need spacesuits and like stuff for astronauts like I've been to NASA,,,,response,1,0,2
141,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,2

141,Teacher,Could you share with the class The section that mentioned this tool,,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
141,Jazmin,"Okay so in paragraph two, and it says, NASA send this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,230.2,response,1,0,2
141,Teacher, Yes Jazmin,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
141,Teacher,"Okay, so what so class",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
141,Teacher, What would you tell me the purpose of the lunar orbiter would be based on the text,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
141,Jazmin,Like is it,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
141,Jazmin," I mean, I guess it's to find the water to, like, you know what I mean like to go get the water",,,210.4,response,1,0,2
141,Teacher,Correct,,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
141,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,1,0,2
141,Chris, So I know that the scientists like us all this equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that kind of stuff,,,,response,1,0,2
141,Chris,"Well, I guess I still am thinking like, I went to NASA",,,,response,1,0,2
141,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,2
141,Teacher,They do us all a lot of tools like that,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
141,Teacher, We are focusing on the specific action of locating water,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
141,Teacher,Now for this particular article that we're looking at,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
141,Teacher, Right,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
141,Teacher, And this is one of those tools that you probably saw at NASA Chris when you went to go visit,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
141,Teacher,Now we've talked about how we we have this small lunar module,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
141,Teacher,This lunar module again just like Jazmin said was sent to the moon to find ice deposits and large and large polar craters,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
141,Teacher, This would help them find water,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
141,Teacher,"Now, is there any convincing evidence that you guys can think of the water on the moon could be valuable",,,,remark,1,0,2

141,Farrah," So like, you know, like is there convincing evidence that of water on the moon could be valuable?",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
141,Farrah,I don't think it will be valuable like now cuz you know cuz we don't we don't know how to I guess we know how would you I mean like it would be really hard to use it,,,,response,2,0,2
141,Farrah, So I don't think it's valuable right now,,,,response,2,0,2
141,Teacher," So you're thinking, we may not have the technology yet",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher,"Okay, now, so",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher, What's your response,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher," So we'll, we'll, we'll come back to that here in a minute",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher,"First, let's hear, Oliver",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher,"Yeah, okay",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
141,Oliver," You know what I mean like that we can't, we can't just use the water because it's all ice, you know",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
141,Oliver,"Yeah, I kind of had a similar thought that basically no it's not ready yet",,,120.4,response,2,0,2

141,Chris, They don't have to carry it in the ships,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
141,Chris," So I would say, water is heavy",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
141,Chris, So it's good,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
141,Teacher,"Okay, so we have, it's heavy",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher, And we have the we believe us not valuable yet Jazmin,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
141,Jazmin," And I was thinking, basically what you could do",,,110.1,response,2,0,2
141,Jazmin," Is you could use the water to grow things, you could have a garden on the moon, in the craters",,,110.1,response,2,0,2
141,Jazmin,I think it would be valuable because astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and like you can't survive without water,,,110.1,response,2,0,2
141,Teacher, Luis?,,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher,"Okay, so that could be a one use of water",,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
141,Luis,"Um, yeah, like water can be split into two parts",,,110.2,response,2,0,2
141,Luis," It can be, you know, hydrogen and oxygen",,,110.2,response,2,0,2
141,Teacher,Right okay now,,,,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher,Do you want to describe where in the text you found this?,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
141,Luis,On yeah yeah I can do that,,,230.2,response,2,0,2
141,Luis," Okay, so let's see",,,230.2,response,2,0,2
141,Luis," Um,",,,230.2,response,2,0,2
141,Luis,"In paragraph five moon water could be useful in other ways, and water can be broken down to two parts hydrogen and oxygen",,,,response,2,0,2
141,Teacher,"And now, what do you think we can use those two for hydrogen and oxygen",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher,"There's a clue in paragraph five, yes Luis",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
141,Luis,"Um, yeah, I think, like, okay, you could use it or okay well you could breathe it",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
141,Luis," Um, and then it says oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
141,Teacher,What was that?,,,,remark,2,0,2
141,Luis,As well rocket fuel,,,,response,2,0,2
141,Teacher, You can use it to grow things,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher, Chris?,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher," So rocket fuel will be a use and Jazmin, you could drink it",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher,rocket fuel,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
141,Chris,"On yeah I guess I just wanted to say this, like water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and they both are important",,,110.1,response,2,0,2
141,Teacher,"Okay, and like Luis said, oh, we can use them for rocket fuel",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher, Going back to your first statement so transporting it would be something that we would have to do,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher,It is very heavy,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher,"now, Farrah, and Oliver you guys mentioned that during our discussion that the technology might not be ready for that yet but however there are some possibilities that we can use water",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher,This question in particular is asking is there is there convincing evidence of water alone can be valuable,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher,Water can be valuable,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher," Yes, we do have some Olivereloping to do with the technology to be able to move and transport the water and to split those chemicals up to form the rocket fuel",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher,See all these are good points because this allows us to go back into this paragraph and look at the clues that they have left in this article to help us find an answer to this discussion to this discussion question,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher, There are a lot of uses for water,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher,"Okay, yes",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
141,Teacher,Day now is the technology ready,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2

178,Teacher,mm hmm so you and Farrah had the same idea,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
178,Teacher,"Jazmin and Luis and Chris brought up the idea of oxygen and you need water, but then you and Farrah thought about what it would take to get that so you, your opinion on it is whether or not it would be worth it to do it",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
178,Teacher,"And so, some would say yes, and some people would be no",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2

184,Teacher,"tweak them a little bit and improve them and adjust your sentences to just show that you understand what the text is saying, I just wanted you guys to use examples exactly from the text that way",,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
184,Teacher, I know that you guys had an easy time reading,,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
184,Chris,Okay,,,220.1,response,0,0,3
184,Chris,"Well,",,,,response,0,0,3

184,Oliver,I'm,,,,response,0,0,3
184,Oliver," Oh, sorry",,,,response,0,0,3
184,Oliver, Okay,,,,response,0,0,3
184,Oliver,"I wanted to say thank you, teacher for giving us specific suggestions and hopeful ideas on how each of us can improve our answers",,,,response,0,0,3

184,Teacher,how's everyone doing today,,,,remark,1,0,3
184,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"Okay well today we're going to experiment with different kinds of groups, and if you know a lot about space, then maybe you can help your table mates that, we probably don't know as much as you do",,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher," It sounds good to you, Luis?",,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
184,Luis,"Okay yeah Okay, I guess that's fine okay",,,220.1,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,good to hear so today I put you on a group because we're going to focus on today's lesson which is about scientific tools that are used on the moon,,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher,and other than that we're going to talk about whether the moon has valuable resources for people to be able to live on the moon,,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"There was a short reading and I gave you guys two questions, just to remind you what the questions are i'll read them out loud for you guys, the first question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes Jazmin",,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
184,Jazmin,The teacher said that we would only work on question number one right now,,,220.1,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"Okay we'll just work on question number one, thank you for letting me know so did you guys will be time to write down your answers to questions",,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
184,Jazmin,yeah we put them down on our tablets to you,,,220.1,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,Okay sounds good,,,,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher,Can I hear some of your responses,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
184,Jazmin,Do you want to hear mine?,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"Yes, please",,,,remark,1,0,3
184,Jazmin,Okay,,,,response,1,0,3
184,Jazmin,I said that NASA a small machine,,,,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"Okay, so when you say NASA send a small machine, do you know what the name of it was?",,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
184,Jazmin,"Oh, the lunar obiter",,,210.3,response,1,0,3
184,Jazmin, I can do that,,,420.2,response,1,0,3
184,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.2,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"Yes, Okay, so you can always rephrase your sentence to say that NASA sent a little bit over there that way, I know that you're using the information that's in the text",,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher, Does that sound good?,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"Does anyone else, want to share they wrote",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
184,Farrah,"Oh well, I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"Okay let's talk about it, then what to do right Farrah",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
184,Farrah,"I said, you need a scientific microscope to look really closely",,,150.1,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"I don't think your answer is wrong, we did read that you do need a Microscope to look closely at the moon, maybe we can rephrase that what do we use the microscope for? Do you remember?",,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"Teacher:, maybe we can rephrase that what do we use the microscope for? Do you remember?",,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
184,Farrah,You yeah to look at really small thing,,,110.2,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"Exactly, so we can always write that too, I think your answer right now is just as good though",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher, Good job,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
184,Jazmin,"i'm sorry teacher, but how can it be right and my answer be great because we have two different answers",,,110.1,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,So you're both right because we read three different parts of the text where they talked about two different equipments that are used on the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"The lunar orbiter is used to investigate what's on the moon, and the microscope like Farrah said is used to look at small particles, that the Lunar orbiter wouldn't really pick up so you're both re they're just used for different things",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
184,Oliver,"I circled the same thing with Farrah, so I guess I am right too",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,yeah nor did you notice anything about will you circle anything special about the microscope,,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
184,Oliver,"Well, I noticed that he said",,,210.3,response,1,0,3
184,Oliver,The water that they follow those microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it,,,,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,that's a good point,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"So you could always write that to that, even though scientists use a microscope there might be so some things that are so small, they still can't see",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
184,Oliver,It can you say that again you're talking kind of fast,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher,You can always write that even scientists use a microscope,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher, Is that better?,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher,But sometimes there are still things that are so small that they cannot see,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
184,Oliver,"Okay, I got it now",,,420.2,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"Good i'm Chris Luis didn't want to do you want to share? Yes, Chris",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
184,Chris,yeah I was just I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,Do you know what they use oxygen for them suits that your classmates might not,,,140.1,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"Okay, thank you for using your outside knowledge to contribute to the conversation",,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
184,Chris,"Oh yeah, So they use on a breathe because, while the oxygen tanks are to breathe because there isn't any oxygen up there in space and then the suits because it's so cool that if if the air touch their skins, they would they would freeze to death and then shattered pieces",,,140.1,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"Thank you, thank you for your answer, and thank you for explaining in case anyone didn't know",,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher,Luis do you read something different or similar?,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
184,Luis," Because that equipment and the question as our equipment, and so I said, you know the equipment that scientists use on them owner oxygen tank",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
184,Luis,"Actually, I wrote about the oxygen tanks too",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,So good answer to or like how different everyone's answers were and I felt that you all explained what the tools were used for in a perfect way,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
184,Luis,"So i'm right too, it could be oxygen tanks, or microscopes, or lunar orbiter?",,,110.1,response,1,0,3
184,Teacher,yeah so,,,,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"All these tools contribute to scientists being able to discover if the moon is truly habitable, which means that people can live there for humans like us",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
184,Teacher,"Usually, they try to find the similarities between the earth and the moon, try to see if anyone from earth can be able to live in the moon, yes Oliver",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
184,Oliver,I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll see you later bye,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
185,Teacher,High class,,,,remark,0,0,1
185,All,High,,,,,0,0,1
185,Teacher, Luis Do you have a question,,,,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,0,0,1
185,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,0,1
185,Teacher,No worries,,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, So even though I know you guys all know lots about space and Luis You may know more about space than everyone else in the group,,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,But I just want to talk with you guys a little bit more specifically about the texts that we just read to make sure that everyone understands the water on the moon text,,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,Sound okay,,,,remark,0,0,1
185,Chris,"Yeah, I also know about space as I went to NASA with my dad",,,,response,0,0,1
185,Teacher," Well, that's really cool",,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, And the fact that you guys know so much about space already means you definitely have some good background knowledge that you can connect,,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,Awesome,,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,What do you think was the most important piece of equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,"To the text, but I want to talk a little bit about how everyone responded after reading the text and I just want to kind of ask one more time",,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Luis,I think the most important equipment was the microscope,,,150.1,response,0,0,1
185,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,0,1
185,Luis,I've got my tone,,,,response,0,0,1
185,Teacher, But I want to kind of make it a little more clear for everyone because the microscope,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher," So in the texts that you guys read, they definitely mentioned the microscope at the very end there",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,Awesome,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,"You would need a microscope to look really closely at the water that they found on the moon, but that's not actually what these scientists use to find the water",,,130.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher," However, the scientists actually used the Lunar Orbiter to find the water",,,130.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,If one of us went into space and we wanted to look at the moon water we would need a microscope,,,130.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,So this tool,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, Does anyone remember what was said in the text about the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher," It was mentioned in the text, and I want to see it",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,0,0,1
185,Jazmin, So I don't have to say my my answers wrong,,,,response,0,0,1
185,Jazmin,"Oh, I don't remember what I said in the text, but that was kind of my answer",,,,response,0,0,1
185,Teacher, Right,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher," So, Jazmin, you said that NASA send a small machine to the moon",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,"Okay, no worries",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,"Yeah, so that is a pretty good response because the lunar orbiter is definitely a small machine and it is what they sent to the moon",,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, So I just want you to go a little further in your explanation and you some evidence from what you read about,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,I just think that it sounds like you understand,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, I just want to tell you that your answer wasn't wrong,,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,And Jazmin,,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Jazmin,"I have to, I have to write more stuff in my answer",,,150.1,response,0,0,1
185,Teacher,"Um, yes",,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, So I just want your answer to be a little more specific and sometimes that does mean writing more stuff,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
185,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.2,response,0,0,1
185,Teacher, Right,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, I'm Luis I want to talk about your response,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, You said that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, So looking at the other responses,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,Right,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Luis,A hack,,,110.1,response,0,0,1
185,Teacher,And that is a really awesome response because that is definitely true scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,And they would need those on the moon,,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, And I know you said you know a lot about space,,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, So that is a very good response,,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,"However, I just want to make sure that for the future when you're responding to a question about the texts that were reading you of course can bring in background information and stuff you already know about the topic, but make sure that your answer is also specific to what we're reading",,,410.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Luis,"Um,",,,410.3,response,0,0,1
185,Luis, I know they need on the moon,,,,response,0,0,1
185,Luis," And so I I wrote about em and an astronaut equipment and so I'm like, well, this is some equipment",,,,response,0,0,1
185,Luis,"Yeah, I mean, we're we're reading about the Mon",,,,response,0,0,1
185,Teacher,"Yeah, no, you definitely did and I do like that you used the oxygen tanks as the equipment",,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,But in your answer,,,410.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,410.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher," I also would have liked to see you mentioned the lunar orbiter because that was the big idea of the text that we read, and that was the most important piece for specifically finding water on the moon",,,410.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Luis,"Yeah, I guess so",,,410.3,response,0,0,1
185,Teacher,"Um, but I think I'm going to talk about Chris's response really quickly so Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher," If you have any questions, let me know",,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,Okay,,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Chris, I went to NASA,,,110.1,response,0,0,1
185,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment my oxygen tanks and masks answer,,,110.1,response,0,0,1
185,Chris,"Yeah, yeah",,,110.1,response,0,0,1
185,Teacher, Chris,,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher," I also just want to make sure, similar to Luis I know that you guys have lots of knowledge about space and",,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,"Yeah, they definitely do use all of that equipment and that is a great answer",,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,"But when you're answering the discussion questions for the text that we read, just try and incorporate",,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, So the text mentions the Lunar Orbiter,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, So that would have been a good thing to include in your response in addition to what you said about finding Craters of water and they're like suits masks and oxygen tanks,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,Something specifically from the text,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
185,Chris,"Yeah, I think you're saying like",,,420.2,response,0,0,1
185,Chris,"Okay, I gotta, I gotta use more more stuff in the text and use what I already know",,,,response,0,0,1
185,Teacher,"Yes, that is exactly what I would like",,,510.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher," And that goes for everyone, not just Chris",,,510.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher," So when you're answering these questions, try to use what you already know, as well as specific information from what we're reading",,,510.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,So now dead I talked about your response,,,,remark,0,0,1
185,Oliver,"Yeah, yeah",,,,response,0,0,1
185,Oliver," I felt like I did that, you know, I mean, I looked at the question and the question asked about equipment",,,,response,0,0,1
185,Oliver,And and asked about like what equipment that they use to discover water,,,,response,0,0,1
185,Oliver, And so when I was walking in the in the story and I saw that on Microsoft is equipment and we're using a microscope to look at the water,,,,response,0,0,1
185,Oliver, So I felt like I get all the right thing,,,,response,0,0,1
185,Oliver, I don't know why white minus wrong,,,,response,0,0,1
185,Teacher, I appreciate that,,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, So you kind of focused on that microscope that was at the very end,,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, Right,,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher," So again, your response isn't wrong you just focus on a different section of the text",,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,"Okay, so that is a really good thing to bring up Oliveron",,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, But the big idea of the story is the Lunar Orbiter and that that is the most important piece to discovering water on the moon,,,410.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, And they definitely do need to use a microscope,,,410.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,Uh huh,,,410.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, Yeah,,,410.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,"So your answer was very specific and it definitely use information from the text, which is really, really good",,,,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,410.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,But I also just want to make sure that you're focusing on what the big idea of the whole reading is instead of just one specific part,,,410.3,remark,0,0,1
185,Oliver,I'm,,,,response,0,0,1
185,Oliver,"A big idea, not just one part",,,,response,0,0,1
185,Oliver, So thanks for that,,,,response,0,0,1
185,Oliver,"Okay, okay, well I just looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch",,,,response,0,0,1
185,Oliver, I know this was really short but um I I do appreciate that you helped us all kind of look more at the text to try to use more evidence,,,,response,0,0,1
185,Oliver, And our answer,,,,response,0,0,1
185,Oliver,"Okay, bye",,,,response,0,0,1
185,Teacher,Bye,,,,remark,0,0,1
185,Teacher,"Hi class, so I pulled you all into a small group, because I think you did a really good job in answering our discussion question about the water on the moon texts, but I want to work with each of you a little more and just make your responses more academic and a little longer",,,220.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher, Yes Luis,,,220.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,220.1,response,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"yeah you do know a lot about space um and I don't want to say that this group is for people who don't know about space, because you all did a really good job, but this group is just to work on giving responses to questions from a text",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher, i'll start with Farrah,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,So i'm gonna go one by one and give you each some feedback on what you said to the response,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"um for our first question, you said that scientists use a microscope to look closely and I wanted to say that that was really good I like that you used the specific name of the tool that scientists use, but I also want to encourage you to",,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"Make sure that when you are using the specific name of a tool it's the tool that the question is asking for, so in this question what equipment was used to discover water on the moon, is there, another tool, you can think of that the scientists used from the text",,,120.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Farrah,"Well, I thought that was the correct tool",,,120.1,response,1,0,1
185,Farrah,Because it says in the third paragraph that they used it to look really closely at the water,,,,response,1,0,1
185,Farrah, And the question is asking about looking at water,,,,response,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"yeah so you're definitely right they need the microscope to be able to look closely at the water, but when they're doing this, they might not be doing this on the moon, so, if you look at the second paragraph, can you read the first sentence for me",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
185,Farrah,"Okay, let me see",,,210.4,response,1,0,1
185,Farrah,"Sorry, my my tablets not loading Oh, give me a second",,,,response,1,0,1
185,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,1
185,Farrah,Okay,,,,response,1,0,1
185,Farrah,"Okay, so",,,,response,1,0,1
185,Farrah,You said the second paragraph,,,,response,1,0,1
185,Teacher,yep the first sentence of the second paragraph okay,,,120.3,remark,1,0,1
185,Farrah,NASA sent a small machine to the moon to investigate,,,120.3,response,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"Right, so in that sentence, we can see that the text is using the Lunar orbiter as the tool that is actually finding the water",,,130.3,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"So Farrah you did a really good job, saying that the microscope was a tool that they used because you're definitely correct it is",,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"But I want you to go a little bit further and be able to say that the microscope would be needed to see the water, but the Lunar orbiter is what found the water",,,130.3,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,1,0,1
185,Jazmin,I don't understand why my answers wrong,,,,response,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"Okay Jazmin so, you said that NASA sent a small machine right",,,230.3,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"yeah so that is a really good answer and you're definitely correct um, but I want you to elaborate a little bit more so, yes NASA sent a small machine, but what was that small machine called",,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
185,Jazmin,"I guess it was what Farrah just read right, the Lunar orbiter",,,420.2,response,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"Right, so when we use the term lunar orbiter we're using evidence to support our response and so that's something you want to make sure you're doing, because it shows that",,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"hey you really know what you're talking about, and it also shows that you found your answer from the text",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher," Does that make sense, everyone?",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Jazmin,yeah it makes sense to use that I have to use it okay,,,150.1,response,1,0,1
185,Teacher,awesome um okay so Luis I know you are unsure about being in this group can we look at your response,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
185,Luis,yeah yeah sure,,,120.4,response,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"Okay, so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right",,,230.3,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,awesome I want to say that that is a good response because you said that they use a lot of equipment and then you were specific by saying oxygen tanks ,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"Like Farrah, though, I want to push you a little bit further, and while I do like that answer, and I think you could keep that I would want you to add on to it and talk a little bit about the Lunar orbiter",,,130.3,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"Because that is the piece of equipment that ultimately, the question wants you to pick out of the text, yes Chris",,,130.3,remark,1,0,1
185,Chris,And I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like,,,130.3,response,1,0,1
185,Chris,oxygen tanks and masks and,,,,response,1,0,1
185,Chris,suits yeah,,,,response,1,0,1
185,Teacher,yeah that's awesome i'm glad that you have that background knowledge of what astronauts use,,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,And I think it's really good when you're reading a text to think about what you already know and experiences you have so like Chris is saying,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,he already knows a lot about space and he learned the astronauts use these specific things so that's great to keep in mind when you're reading the text,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,But you also want to make sure that when you're answering the question you're specifically using evidence and examples that the text gives you,,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"So it's awesome to make connections with your background knowledge, but in order to answer a question you want to make sure that it comes from the text",,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Chris,yeah yeah yeah okay,,,420.2,response,1,0,1
185,Chris,"But my question did come from the text, I mean my answer did",,,,response,1,0,1
185,Teacher,Your answer was that they found craters of water on the moon right,,,230.3,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"yeah yeah and you're definitely correct the scientists in the text, they did find craters of water on the moon",,,110.2,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"However, again when you look at that question, it asks what equipment found those craters of water, so that would be similar to Jazmin where you just want to make sure that you're using a specific piece of evidence to support what you said when you said that there's craters of water",,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,Does that make a little more,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,sense,,,,remark,1,0,1
185,Chris,"I mean, I guess, I can see it for Jazmin because she just had to add more the specific name but they didn't say, like the more specific name of the craters in the in the story",,,,response,1,0,1
185,Teacher,"yeah you're right i'm Sorry, I think, I said that in a bit of a confusing way, so you want to make sure that you would say scientists found craters of water on the moon, and the machine that they used to find these craters was the Lunar orbiter",,,130.3,remark,1,0,1
185,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,0,1
185,Oliver,"i'm sorry teacher, but I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll see you later okay",,,,response,1,0,1
185,Teacher,Start simulation,,,,remark,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"hi everyone, so I really appreciate you all, giving your responses to our second discussion question which was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable, so I want to just talk through each of your responses",,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"And we'll start with a Oliver this time, so you answered that um no the water on the moon is not ready yet correct",,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
185,Oliver,Correct,,,230.3,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,Okay um so what in the text makes you think that,,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
185,Oliver,Ok so,,,230.2,response,2,0,1
185,Oliver,"when I was reading it and i'm in the last paragraph, it says i'm",,,,response,2,0,1
185,Oliver,"Making this plan will take a lot of time and money, do you think about you decide, and so i'm like well if it's gonna take a lot of time, and I mean it's not ready yet",,,,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"Right, I definitely appreciate that um and I like that you were able to find exactly where in the text you found your answer um I do have a concern, though, so the question",,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"is asking could water on the moon be valuable at any point um and so you said no, but i'm wondering if you think that the answer could be yes um and why it could be yes",,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
185,Oliver,So why could it be yes,,,210.3,response,2,0,1
185,Oliver,i'm thinking,,,,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,2,0,1
185,Luis,"Okay um while he's thinking I got this figured out this time, so now i'm all good",,,,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"Okay i'm glad that you're feeling more confident um, why do you think you are feeling more confident",,,230.1,remark,2,0,1
185,Luis,"Okay, because I I get it now that i'm supposed to like you know",,,230.1,response,2,0,1
185,Luis,"Read the question and then read it, and then find the evidence so yeah I think i'm good here",,,,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"that's a really good strategy um so in your response, you said that water can be split into hydrogen and oxygen right yeah",,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
185,Luis,straight from the text,,,230.3,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"awesome yes it is um, but I do want to ask you, while that is from the text does that tell us if the water on the moon is valuable",,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
185,Luis,Oh,,,210.3,response,2,0,1
185,Farrah,"Okay, oh okay all right while Luis is thinking, um I had a similar answer to Oliver and so",,,,response,2,0,1
185,Farrah,I think i'm still kind of confused,,,,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"Okay, so Oliver and Farrah you guys did have similar answers you guys said not ready yet or not, for a long time um",,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
185,Teacher,So where are you confused Farrah,,,230.1,remark,2,0,1
185,Farrah,Okay um because it asks is if it's valuable right,,,230.1,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,2,0,1
185,Farrah,And so it said,,,,response,2,0,1
185,Farrah,"Okay, they would need",,,,response,2,0,1
185,Farrah,to study the moon surface and build new equipment,,,,response,2,0,1
185,Farrah,"So that sounds like it would take a lot of money which, if it's not ready, then it's not valuable right",,,,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"that's a really good question to ask and that's something that I think all of you should definitely be asking some sort of version of when you're reading, so if the water is not ready yet, is it not valuable",,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"Well, to me, when I think of the word valuable, I would say that I think that could be either now or in the future so looking at the question, the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"So even though it's not ready yet Farrah, do you think that the water on the moon could be valuable in the future",,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
185,Teacher,So when we see it could be valuable that kind of implies the future,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
185,Farrah,yeah yeah,,,210.3,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"yeah so Oliver and Farrah that would be where I would like you to like adjust your response, so I think you had really good answers, but you just want to try and make sure that",,,420.1,remark,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"you're fully understanding what the questions asking, because that could be makes a big difference from the present to the future",,,420.1,remark,2,0,1
185,Farrah,Okay,,,420.1,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,Does that make more sense to you two or are you still confused,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
185,Oliver,um yeah,,,150.1,response,2,0,1
185,Oliver,I think I didn't really look at that word could be so yeah that makes sense,,,,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,2,0,1
185,Chris,"Talking about the future, I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024",,,,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"that's really cool fact Chris, where did you read that",,,140.1,remark,2,0,1
185,Chris,"me and my dad had been reading this book about aviation and then we went to NASA so there was this whole exhibit about the traveling to the moon, and then what their plans are in the future",,,140.1,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,yeah that is really cool um and again that's a good example of some background knowledge that you have about the topic,,,110.3,remark,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"And what you could do with that so in your response um you could have added something like in another article I read, it said that there could be a base on the moon, and then connect to the article we're reading now, so do you have any idea of how you could do that",,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
185,Chris,Okay,,,420.2,response,2,0,1
185,Chris,"Okay, so",,,,response,2,0,1
185,Chris,There could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,,response,2,0,1
185,Chris,And so,,,,response,2,0,1
185,Chris,Then they won't have to carry the water in the ships anymore,,,,response,2,0,1
185,Chris,So,,,,response,2,0,1
185,Chris,how's that,,,,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"pretty good I would maybe just add a little bit about how like you said they're not carrying the water on the ships anymore, because they're keeping it at the base that they're going to build on the moon",,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
185,Chris,yeah yeah yeah okay okay,,,420.2,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"Does hat makes sense, so you're connecting both sets of text with just a few words there",,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
185,Chris,yeah yeah yeah yeah I think,,,150.1,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,Okay awesome um so Jazmin do you have any questions about your response,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
185,Jazmin,"Well Okay, I think I did what what Oliver and Farrah didn't do is I answered the question I said yes, and then I also did the thing, where I I I pulled the evidence from the text, so I guess I don't know why mine is wrong",,,150.1,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"Okay, so your answer, I would not say that your answer is wrong, so you said yes water on the moon could be valuable because astronauts drink water",,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
185,Teacher,That is a very good response and I like that you provided a use for the water so that would be your evidence that you pulled from the text um,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"I would probably just expand your response, so you could",,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"Go back and look at the text, so in that first paragraph there paragraph four um it says, you know future astronauts could drink this water, water is heavy and it takes up a lot of room",,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
185,Teacher,So do you have any idea of how you could connect astronauts drinking water to water being too heavy to put on a spaceship,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
185,Jazmin,Okay yeah yeah yeah I have an idea,,,210.4,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,Do you want to share,,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
185,Jazmin,You want me to share now,,,120.4,response,2,0,1
185,Jazmin,Okay okay um So yes,,,,response,2,0,1
185,Jazmin,"astronauts could drink the water and because it's heavy they won't have to carry it on the ship, they can drink it from the moon",,,,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,awesome that is a really great response so,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
185,Teacher,"How did your thinking change there, what did you do differently",,,530.1,remark,2,0,1
185,Jazmin,"Well, I I use two sentences I use my sentence and then kind of Chris sentence and then I set it up because in there too",,,530.1,response,2,0,1
185,Teacher,yeah so because statements are a really good way to make sure that you have enough evidence to support what you're saying yes Oliver,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
185,Oliver,"Well it's time for us to go to lunch, but I do want to say, I appreciate um how are you kind of explain what each of us needs to work on and how we can improve our answers",,,150.1,response,2,0,1
185,Farrah,yeah me too bye bye,,,,response,2,0,1
186,Teacher,Hello everyone,,,,remark,0,1,3
186,Luis,Hi,,,,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"Alright, so we're in a circle here today",,,,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher," Just us to go, oh, yes, Luis",,,,remark,0,1,3
186,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group",,,,response,0,1,3
186,Luis, I already know all about space,,,,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"Oh no, it's not anything like that, I'm sure you all have your own great knowledge of space",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher, Do you guys remember the passage about water on the moon?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher, We're just going to discuss a little bit of how we read and responded to the passage,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Luis,Uh-huh yeah I have it on my tablet right here,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
186,Farrah,"Yeah, it's on our tablets on our desk",,,,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher, So we're just going to go over so you guys get a bit of a more clear understanding of this passage,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,Perfect,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"So when you read it, you should have known what the equipment was that scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,Can someone raise their hand and let me know what it was?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,0,1,3
186,Farrah,"Yeah, the equipment was the microscope",,,,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher, That's perfect,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,Exactly,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Jazmin, I said the equipment was a small machine from paragraph two,,,110.1,response,0,1,3
186,Jazmin,"Oh, but, Miss Teacher I didn't have the microscope",,,110.1,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"Yes, and that's why we're going to talk about that because when you read a passage",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher, But the real name of the machine was a microscope,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,Sometimes things be hard to understand because they use certain adjectives to describe the machine,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,So does everyone understand that now from the passage?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"So you did a great job finding that it was a small machine Jazmin, but Farrah was just a little more clear and how she said it was a microscope",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
186,Jazmin,"Um, I mean I think so, but I okay i'm going to listen more and then I'll see if I have a question",,,230.3,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"Okay, perfect",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher, That sounds great,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"So the question sometimes can be a little bit hard because you do read so much in the passage, but because the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, we only want to answer that question right?",,,,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher, That's something we always want to keep with us,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"So in the passage, it does say that there there's evidence that water can be found within the moon's polar craters which - that's a great piece of knowledge",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,But the last passage has our answer in it,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,It says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth,,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher," So water they found is microscopic meaning you would not be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look real closely",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"So,",,,,remark,0,1,3
186,Jazmin,Um,,,120.3,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,1,3
186,Jazmin,"Oh, I still don't understand why my answer is wrong because I I looked in paragraph two, and it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher, That's a great answer,,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher, But the real word that we want to do to find here was in the last paragraph,,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher, It is a small machine,,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"Yes, and that's great",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher, That's what a microscope is,,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Jazmin,"Um, ok",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"So we know you're reading everything and making sure you see everything in the paragraphs, right? So you you caught that first in paragraph two, but if you kept reading in paragraph three, you would have seen the real word for the small machine, right?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"Okay, does that make sense?",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Jazmin,"Um,",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
186,Jazmin,"I mean I I did read the third paragraph, but I didn't think that the microscope was the right answer, because it said it said",,,,response,0,1,3
186,Jazmin,You that you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it is that you would need a scientific tool,,,,response,0,1,3
186,Jazmin," So that means you would need a microscope to look really closely, but it doesn't say that they had a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,1,3
186,Jazmin,"And so that's why I thought it was the lunar orbiter in paragraph two, because they said that that was that they sent that to look for the ice in the craters",,,,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher, So you're right,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"Yes, you are completely right that there is, there's a lot to kind of dissect in this",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,So does anyone else have anything that they were confused about?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Chris,"It's not so much confused, but I went to NASA",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
186,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher," I definitely haven't, but that is a really cool thing to to share with the class",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"Yeah, that's really cool that you got to experience that",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher, I bet not everyone has,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"Nice job, Chris",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,Does anyone else have questions on the passage?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Luis, And so I know that um scientists and astronauts like they have to use oxygen tanks to go to go to the moon,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
186,Luis,"Okay, well, I don't know why mine was wrong, because, I mean, I know, I know a lot about space",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
186,Luis, They can't breathe,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher, It's just the oxygen tank,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"Right you you did mention that in your response, which was great",,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher, Could you use an oxygen tank to find water on the moon?,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher, I'm glad that you could acknowledge that,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
186,Luis,"Umm, huh",,,210.3,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher,It would help you to get to the moon right?,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"But it would, it wouldn't be the thing that found the water",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Luis, Yeah,,,130.1,response,0,1,3
186,Luis,"Okay, okay",,,130.1,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher, But do you see where the question was a little bit different than your answer?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"That was a really good thing to - if I asked about anything you needed to go to the moon, that would be a great part of your response",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Luis,"Um, cuz yeah well I mean yeah cuz well when you said okay, you don't need the oxygen tank to find water you need oxygen tank to breathe",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
186,Luis, Okay,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
186,Luis," So, yeah, yeah",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher, But you did,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher, So that was good,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,But still really great thing to think about because not everybody thought about that intheir response,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"Oliver, do you have anything to say?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
186,Oliver, If we're right then what's wrong with with my answer?,,,120.4,response,0,1,3
186,Oliver,"Well, I mean, I, I circled the same thing as Farrah",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
186,Oliver," Um, so I guess I mean I don't know why I'm in this group",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"You just, um, didn't really have anything to say that you found on your own",,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher, You just said you circled the same thing as Farrah,,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher," So I really wanted to hear in your own thoughts, not in Farrah's thoughts, um, what you found in the passage and how you did it",,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
186,Oliver,"Oh, OK",,,430.2,response,0,1,3
186,Oliver, And then in the last sentence of the last paragraph,,,430.2,response,0,1,3
186,Oliver," Well, yeah, I mean, I just found I read the whole thing",,,430.2,response,0,1,3
186,Oliver, OK,,,430.2,response,0,1,3
186,Oliver, I saw where they said a scientific tool called a microscope so,,,430.2,response,0,1,3
186,Oliver,"I was like okay yeah that's that's equipment and we use that equipment in science class, and they're looking at the water",,,,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"Good, I'm glad I could hear your own words",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
186,Oliver,"Okay, okay, okay",,,110.1,response,0,1,3
186,Oliver," Um, I know it's what's a short time and we just met but i i did appreciate how you",,,,response,0,1,3
186,Oliver,"Miss Teacher, I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch",,,,response,0,1,3
186,Oliver, And so I'm going to think about that when we go to lunch,,,,response,0,1,3
186,Oliver,"You helped all of us kind of talk about and ask questions from you and I heard how you told Luis that his answer was cool, but it didn't come from the question",,,,response,0,1,3
186,Teacher,"Thank you, Oliver",,,,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher," Well, everyone have a great lunch",,,,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher, See you soon,,,,remark,0,1,3
186,Teacher, All right,,,,remark,0,1,3
188,Teacher,"Okay everyone, do you mind giving me your answers again, really quickly, before I give you some feedback",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Luis,"Um, yeah, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher,"But we're going to figure that out right now, so can you",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher, Could you remind me what your answer was,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,"Okay well after we asked the question, your answer maybe didn't include what the question was looking for",,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
188,Luis," I said, ah, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
188,Luis,"Yeah, okay",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher, That was really good,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,"Okay, so the question asked what equipment did they use to find water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher," However, can you elaborate? How did they use oxygen tanks to find water on the moon?",,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,That -you did discover that they use oxygen tanks,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
188,Luis,"Um, well, I mean they have to use oxygen tanks to breathe because they can't breathe on the moon, without the oxygen tanks, you know,",,,210.2,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher," Good job, Luis",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,"Jazmin, how about you?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,Exactly,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2

188,Teacher,"Okay, what is that small machine",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,What did the small machine do what was its purpose on the moon?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Jazmin,Um,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
188,Jazmin," Ok, it investigated",,,,response,0,1,2
188,Jazmin,NASA since a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher,What specifically did it investigate? Use your evidence from the text,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Jazmin,Um,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
188,Jazmin,"It investigated, um the Lunar Orbiter, um to investigate, to look for ice deposits",,,,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher,Right and ice is water correct just frozen,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2

188,Chris,Uh huh,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
188,Chris, Okay,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
188,Chris,that scientists found craters full water on the moon,,,,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher,"Okay, let's think back to the question",,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher, What equipment did they use? You can look back in the text to help you,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,So you discover that there was water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher, The question was what equipment did NASA use to find water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
188,Chris,What equipment did they use,,,120.2,response,0,1,2
188,Chris,Oh it's what Jazmin just said,,,,response,0,1,2

188,Teacher,Can you find a different one?,,,120.1,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,That wasn't Jazmin or Luis's answer?,,,120.1,remark,0,1,2
188,Farrah,"Oh well i i i had some equipment, but I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,120.1,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher, Let's look through the text again and we're going to come back to you,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,"Alright, so we're Chris, do your best",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher," Okay, Farrah",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher, What was your answer?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Farrah,"Oh, my answer was that um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
188,Farrah,But if Jazmin's right and she has a different answer than me um,,,,response,0,1,2
188,Farrah,I don't know why,,,,response,0,1,2
188,Farrah, Why is mine wrong?,,,,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher, So can you elaborate on why they use the microscope? What did they do using the microscope?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,"Um, so you're right, they do use microscopes to look really closely",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,And how does that relate back to the question?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,Do you need a reminder of what the question was?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
188,Farrah," Well, I mean, it says that they look at the water with a microscope",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
188,Farrah," Um, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
188,Farrah," That's equipment, um,",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
188,Farrah,"Oh no, I can see it",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher,Why did they need the microscope?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Farrah,Because the water was really small,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher,That's right,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher, How about you?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2

188,Teacher, Oliver,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Oliver,"Um, okay, well i i had the same answer as Farrah cuz I I said the thing, the same thing about how they went um, so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely um cuz",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
188,Oliver, That's the only paragraph that says,,,,response,0,1,2
188,Oliver,Cuz,,,,response,0,1,2
188,Oliver, Okay,,,,response,0,1,2
188,Oliver," Well, that's the only",,,,response,0,1,2
188,Oliver,Says water and has an equipment in it,,,,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher,"So, Jazmin and Luis also found different paragraphs",,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher, So there are multiple answers,,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,"If you need a second to look back and find another piece of equipment, we can come back to you and I can move on to Chris again",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
188,Chris,"Yeah, so I went to NASA",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
188,Chris, So I know that it is used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,150.1,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,Did you find any evidence of them using those masks or suits in the text?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
188,Chris, So the only things that I saw was the microscope that Farrah and Oliver said and the lunar orbiter that Jazmin said,,,230.2,response,0,1,2
188,Chris," No, Um OK",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
188,Chris,"Oh, no",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
188,Chris,So I don't know which one is the right,,,,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher, So they're all right,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,"Well, there's multiple pieces of equipment",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher," Um, what was your original answer? Let's build off of that",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Chris,"Okay, so I said that they found a lot of water in the craters",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
188,Chris,Yeah,,,,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher,"Okay, so",,,,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,"If you go back to the microscope that Farrah was talking about, how did they find water using the microscope?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Chris, It's not like it's like binoculars or something you could only look at water um using a microscope,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
188,Chris,You can't really find water using the microscope,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
188,Chris,Yeah,,,110.1,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher,That is true,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,So they had to use the microscope to know that there was water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher, Right?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Chris,"Well, how did they find the water first to even put it underneath the microscope",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher,That is a good question,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,Does it say it in the text?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Jazmin," Um, I think maybe",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
188,Jazmin,"Well, that's why I thought that maybe my answer was the right one",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
188,Jazmin," Because, um, cuz the the Lunar Orbiter, I think, that they sent to investigate",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher,"Right, so",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,That's how they found the water Chris,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,Using small machine that Jazmin identified,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher, Oliver,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,And then they took the microscope that Farrah found in the text and used that to look at the water,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
188,Oliver,"I'm sorry to interrupt teacher, but I was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch",,,210.4,response,0,1,2

188,Oliver,"for working with us, you know, um, yeah, that was kind of fun like I i see how we have to keep going back you kept saying, okay, go back to the text",,,,response,0,1,2
188,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,1,2
188,Teacher,hi everyone,,,,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,So,,,,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,so Farrah,,,,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"Your response to the question, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely what led you to",,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,Using a microscope as a piece of equipment,,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
188,Farrah,"Okay, it was in the last paragraph",,,230.2,response,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"Okay, thank you Luis we're gonna get to your answer in a few minutes",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
188,Farrah,"Okay, so it said i'm in the third paragraph the water they found is microscopic you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,110.1,response,1,1,2
188,Teacher,Alright awesome Farrah I like how you told me how they used the microscope for the water that they found on the moon,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,And you were able to find that in the text good job,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"That was a great answer so Oliver you circle, the same as Farrah what led you to seeing that a microscope is a piece of equipment that the scientists used",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
188,Oliver,well,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
188,Oliver,"The question was asking about where they discovered the water, and that was the only part where they had equipment and water and finding it, so I looked for all the keywords and that's what's this the section of the story with the key words",,,,response,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"All right, so if you go back to the first texts and moon is a desert",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"And microscope is one of the pieces of equipment, but remember equipment isn't always going to be defined as equipment",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"Equipment could be a machine a piece of technology, do you see anything in this text that is not a microscope but is a piece of equipment",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
188,Jazmin,"teacher, I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
188,Teacher,We will go over your answer in a few minutes right now we're focusing on Oliver but i'll have time for you to explain your thinking,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
188,Oliver,"Okay, I see one more piece of equipment in paragraph two",,,110.1,response,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"Paragraph two all right, can you tell me what it is",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
188,Oliver,yeah I saw lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"Okay, great that is a piece of equipment that they use, can you tell me what a lunar lunar orbiter is",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
188,Oliver,Okay it's a small machine it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
188,Teacher,Alright perfect awesome,,,110.4,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,Great job pulling that out of the text,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"now if you go back to the question, the question asked how did they use this machinery to find water",,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"Now, how did they use the Lunar orbiter to find water, you said that they looked for ice deposits right",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,Great and yeah ice is also what when it's melted,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
188,Oliver,ice ice is also water,,,210.4,response,1,1,2

188,Teacher,"What was your answer, can you remind me",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
188,Chris,yeah I said that scientists found crators full of water on the moon,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"Okay, great so",,,,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,What led you to finding that waters are full craters are full of water on the moon,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
188,Chris,In the first paragraph,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
188,Chris,"I was looking for, like the key words like how Oliver was saying, you know and i'm looking for like",,,,response,1,1,2
188,Chris,Finding water on the moon in this sentence had like a bunch of those words scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters and so that's got like all of the things about finding water on the moon,,,,response,1,1,2
188,Teacher,great job that's a good strategy finding Those key clues and keywords to help you find your answer,,,510.1,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"now, they did find water on the moon, but what equipment, did they use to find that water",,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,Can you find any in the text,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
188,Chris,is the one that Oliver said,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"there's the possibility there's what Oliver said what he said, is there any others, that you have found",,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"Okay, what about equipment that's not talked about in the text,",,,140.1,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,How did they get to the moon,,,140.1,remark,1,1,2
188,Chris,I do know that I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,140.1,response,1,1,2
188,Teacher,Absolutely good job way to think outside of the text,,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
188,Teacher,So how do you think they would use oxygen oxygen tanks and stuff like that to find water on the moon What are those use for,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
188,Chris,"Use to like breathe or walk or you know, to protect themselves from from the elements because it's really cool",,,110.2,response,1,1,2
188,Chris,I guess they don't use them To find water,,,,response,1,1,2
188,Teacher,"um well you're correct they do because they're on the moon, they need to be able to breathe to do their research to find the water correct yes",,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
188,Chris,yeah yeah,,,110.2,response,1,1,2
188,Oliver,i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but it's time for the next group,,,,response,1,1,2

188,Jazmin,yeah so I said,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
188,Jazmin,NASA sent small machine,,,,response,2,1,2
188,Teacher,"Okay, great Luis you have a question",,,,remark,2,1,2
188,Luis,"Okay, I think I got this all figured out so i'm all good",,,,response,2,1,2
188,Teacher,alrighty then you'll be able to explain your thinking to me as soon as i'm done talking to Jazmin all right,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,"Thank you alright Jazmin so, you said that NASA sent a small machine now",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,Where in the text did you find that NASA sent a small machine,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,"all right, can you read that to me please",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
188,Jazmin,NASA small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,120.3,response,2,1,2
188,Teacher,all right perfect good job finding that out the small machine is a piece of equipment that the scientists used like there you were able to find that same answer as Oliver,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
188,Jazmin,RER: A lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
188,Teacher, In reading that you also found that the small machine was called what?,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher, so,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,"Right and this paragraph, also tells you what a lunar orbiter does, can you tell me what the Lunar orbiter does",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
188,Jazmin,RER: It looks I used to pause it in a large polar crater,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
188,Teacher,"Perfect, now what about looking for ice deposits in a large polar crater has to do with finding water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
188,Jazmin,Okay well,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
188,Jazmin,"I had always seen those two machines that the equipment was the microscope or that the machine, the small machine called a lunar orbiter and I guess, I was thinking about looking for ice deposits, is the same as like trying to discover water cuz ice is just frozen water",,,,response,2,1,2
188,Teacher,yeah absolutely they had to use,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,"Okay, so to review what you were saying they use the Lunar orbiter which looks for ice deposits in the craters on the moon and ice is just frozen water",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,So a lunar orbiter is a piece of equipment that finds water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,awesome job Jazmin,,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,2
188,Jazmin,"Why why what's wrong with my answer then, if I had the right answer",,,,response,2,1,2
188,Teacher,"Well, I just wanted you to be more specific and answer the full question, you said that NASA used a small machine I wanted you to tell me what the machine was called and why it was used to find water on the moon",,,430.2,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,"Okay Okay, so when you're answering so next time when we have questions, make sure you're answering all parts of the question and as much detail as you can",,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,"Okay, oh",,,,remark,2,1,2
188,Farrah,yeah I think there's still evidence in the text at the microscope,,,,response,2,1,2
188,Teacher,yeah there's multiple pieces of equipment that's why I have you guys answering any,,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,Excuse me,,,,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,"equipment that you find whether it's in the text, or you think of it in your head",,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
188,Farrah,"Okay, well, I added like a longer answer than Jazmin's one and I, and I said, the name of the equipment in mind so So why is mine wrong",,,110.2,response,2,1,2
188,Teacher,"Not necessarily wrong, I think that you did a good job, identifying that the microscope was the equipment and a microscope does look at things closely, but I wanted you to",,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,Look at the microscope in context of how it was used to find water on the moon that's what I wanted you to bring to me,,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,Do you understand that?,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
188,Farrah,How it's used to find water,,,150.1,response,2,1,2
188,Farrah,And it's not used to find water on the moon,,,,response,2,1,2
188,Teacher,It is,,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,"you explain to me that it was a piece of equipment and what it does, but I wanted you to tell me how it was used to find water on the moon",,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
188,Farrah,"Oh, so I have to add that, to my to my answer",,,420.2,response,2,1,2
188,Teacher,"Yes, which you did, so awesome",,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,Now Luis your answer was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks what made you think of oxygen tanks is a piece of equipment that scientists used,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
188,Luis,"Okay, so I know about space, and I know that they can't breathe up in space and like Chris said, you know they use a lot of different equipment and so on oxygen tank is one that they have to use",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
188,Chris,yeah yeah and I heard there could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,,response,2,1,2
188,Teacher,all right awesome job Luis I like that you didn't,,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,have to use the text there's a ton of other equipment that scientists used,,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,so how did they use the oxygen tanks to find water,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,And this one you thought about using your knowledge of NASA,,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
188,Luis,"wow Okay, I guess, I guess, they didn't use oxygen tanks to find the water they use that to",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
188,Luis,breathe air,,,,response,2,1,2
188,Teacher,"right they didn't directly use that as a piece of equipment to find water like a microscope would be looking at water, but in order to be on the moon like you said you need an oxygen tank because we can't breathe on the moon right",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
188,Luis,Right,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
188,Teacher,"So yes, so tell you told me that",,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
188,Teacher,um you need oxygen tanks to be on the moon,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2

189,Teacher,"um the scientists found for creators, full of water on the moon on",,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
189,Teacher,"To maybe not like bulk it up, but to add a little more background knowledge to it um was you could say why the water on the moon is important and how it can help",,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
189,Teacher,"on future astronauts or scientist when they get to the moon um which could maybe like oh i'll add some valuable evidence to your sentence, which is on",,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
189,Teacher,Pretty key to all this um,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
189,Teacher,"So yeah like it said in a text on that the water if they find enough on the moon, they couldn't make like a gas station, so now it's time that could be important,",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
189,Teacher,so um yeah just maybe next time just try think of like,,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
189,Teacher,so do you have any questions for me on that well,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1

189,Teacher,"A suggestion I had written down when I looked at all the responses um I saw it, you could instead of saying NASA sent a small machine, you could say",,,420.2,remark,1,1,1
189,Teacher,"NASA send an equipment, called the Lunar orbiter which is put that help the astronauts discover more on them",,,420.2,remark,1,1,1

190,Farrah,Okay,,,130.1,response,1,1,1
190,Teacher,"a microscope is would not work because you need to discover the water, first, to use a microscope to look at the water, so you actually need the Lunar orbiter to find the water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
190,Teacher,Oliver What was your,,,,remark,1,1,1
190,Teacher,answer?,,,,remark,1,1,1

190,Oliver,Scientists use,,,,response,1,1,1
190,Oliver,"And I thought well microscope is a piece of equipment, I thought that maybe like the Lunar orbiter maybe it wasn't a piece of equipment, because it's a machine, so I was thinking equipment was more like a tool, like a hammer, or like a microscope",,,,response,1,1,1
190,Teacher,So we're using your background knowledge on the word,,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
190,Teacher,equipment,,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
190,Teacher,And like tool you like,,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
190,Oliver,yeah that's what I knew about equipment,,,230.3,response,1,1,1
190,Teacher,So here's what you're using our already background knowledge on what scientists had already used for previous things correct,,,230.3,remark,1,1,1

190,Teacher,"If you read the question carefully, you would have noticed the keywords equipment scientist and discover you use the Lunar",,,410.1,remark,1,1,1

190,Jazmin,"was my answer is, it is",,,210.4,response,1,1,1
190,Jazmin,So I said NASA centers small machine but was that not quite the the answer,,,,response,1,1,1
190,,Small machine,,,,,1,1,1

190,Chris,"i'm Okay, yes, so I was just thinking and wondering cuz my dad took me to NASA and when I was there I saw that scientists and astronauts us all kinds of like suits and oxygen tanks and equipment other kinds, so I guess, I was thinking like",,,,response,1,1,1
190,Chris,I guess what I was wondering was like,,,,response,1,1,1
190,Chris,didn't they need that did they leave that out of the reading because that seems really important,,,,response,1,1,1
190,Teacher,"I don't think they are exactly what it out of the reading I think they they didn't feel that it was appropriate to writing with what the reading was about which wasn't discovering the water on the moon, yes",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
190,Teacher,If you were to go up to the moon you got all that equipment,,,130.1,remark,1,1,1

190,Jazmin,"You know the the scientists use the small machine, but I would make sure that I will use my evidence and say that completely answer, so I would say",,,,response,2,1,1
190,Jazmin,"NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to find water on the moon, is that right?",,,,response,2,1,1
190,Teacher,"That is right, and I like your answer, how you use evidence from what you knew that I told you, in the name of the machine that I set up for",,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
190,Teacher,anybody else like to share what they would change their answer to,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
190,Teacher,"Chris, what would you change your answer to",,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
190,Chris,"So I would change my answer what I would say, as I would say, like um, so I said initially scientists craters on the water",,,120.4,response,2,1,1
190,Chris,And I would say instead that scientists found craters with small pieces of ice in that on the moon,,,,response,2,1,1
190,Teacher,Luis What would you change your answer to?,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
190,Teacher,Like that it's a lot more general towards what the check said and then an opinion that you add or your guess of what you saw was there,,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
190,Luis,"And um so actually for me, I was just gonna say that I think that i've got everything all figured out now, so I was gonna say I think about good can I go back to my desk",,,120.4,response,2,1,1
190,Teacher,no,,,,remark,2,1,1
190,Teacher,What would you change your Institute,,,120.2,remark,2,1,1
190,Teacher,because your intro wasn't exactly what we were looking for,,,130.1,remark,2,1,1
190,Luis,"um so well, I guess, I would change my answer to",,,130.1,response,2,1,1
190,Luis,um,,,,response,2,1,1
190,Luis,I don't know,,,,response,2,1,1
190,Teacher,"Using the information already gave you about what they actually sent to the moon, to find the water, how would you change your answer because they didn't use oxygen tank to go find the water, because nobody exactly was on the loan when they found the water machine found it",,,410.2,remark,2,1,1
190,Luis,a machine so lunar orbiter,,,410.2,response,2,1,1
190,Teacher,"Yes, orbiters what found the water on the moon, so how would you change your answer from what you originally had",,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
190,Luis,um I would say,,,210.3,response,2,1,1
190,Luis,The lunar orbiter went to the moon,,,,response,2,1,1
190,Teacher,"Okay, I like that answer",,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
190,Teacher,Would anybody else like to share what they would change their answers?,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
190,Teacher,"Oliver and Jazmin you can go, because you already went yesterday",,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
190,Oliver,um okay so basically what I said okay so initially what I had said was that I circled the same as Farrah Farrah,,,120.4,response,2,1,1
190,Oliver,"She has some really good ideas, but also, I thought the same thing as her, which is that the microscope was the tool that they looked really closely and how they found the water",,,,response,2,1,1
190,Oliver,And it sounds like there was the other things that they used to find the water and i'm still a little confused about if they use the microscope,,,,response,2,1,1
190,Oliver,"Or if they use the space suits but it sounds like the answer to this question from our conversation is the Lunar orbiter, but I think that in the text, it still says they use the microscope so it makes me think like put the microscope beyond like a second answer",,,,response,2,1,1
190,Teacher,"I don't think the microscope is a second answer is a microscope cannot exactly go up to an object and find something you have to put the object, you want to look at under the microscope",,,410.2,remark,2,1,1
190,Teacher,You use a microscope to zoom in on something small that you cannot see with your eyes,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
190,Oliver,gotcha so um I I read somewhere that they were going to try to build a base on the moon for 2024,,,210.4,response,2,1,1
190,Oliver,"Do you think that they did that, because they found water",,,,response,2,1,1
190,Teacher,"I dont know, maybe",,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
190,Teacher,Farrah do you want to share what you attend your interview,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
190,Farrah,"Yes, so it seems like for me okay so originally I said that",,,120.4,response,2,1,1
190,Farrah,"That you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and what I meant by that when I was thinking about my answer, like, I meant that because it says in the in the text that the water is just like little microscopic ice crystals so I thought, how can you find",,,,response,2,1,1
190,Farrah,"If you can see that, so I guess the Lunar orbiter like that that that makes sense that that's the machine at a sense, and it was looking like maybe the Lunar orbiter had a microscope on it like how could you find the microscopic water, if you couldn't see it",,,,response,2,1,1
190,Teacher,that's a very interesting idea of maybe the Lunar orbiter does have a special,,,,remark,2,1,1
190,Teacher,Quality of it that it can zoom in on something and pick up very small details of the water and like what it's what micro like what's in it and stuff,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
190,Teacher,The micro,,,,remark,2,1,1
190,Teacher,service,,,,remark,2,1,1
190,Teacher,Jazmin do you want to say some things I know you add years before,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
190,Jazmin,So actually fortunately it's time for us to,,,120.4,response,2,1,1
190,Jazmin,The,,,,response,2,1,1
190,Jazmin,"lunch, I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular, I wanted to help you for a while, I wanted to thank you",,,,response,2,1,1
190,Jazmin,for helping us understand some of the misconceptions that we like you really helped us to understand like,,,,response,2,1,1
190,Jazmin,"You know the meaning of the kind of words, especially around discover like when you were saying like what we needed to focus on the question, I think that was really like helpful because, like words like discover",,,,response,2,1,1
190,Jazmin,yeah like I think everybody like thought that that was really helpful because it helps us to figure out like what to look for you know what I mean like it's not always obvious like what we should be looking for in,,,,response,2,1,1
190,Jazmin,"You know, in the thing, so I think it really helped us to understand, like the word, we should look for and you also encouraged us to make sure that we use evidence so",,,,response,2,1,1
190,Jazmin,You know what I mean like we we couldn't give an answer that didn't have evidence from the text and I think that was really good practice for us to thank you so much,,,,response,2,1,1
191,Teacher,Hi guys,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2

191,Farrah,Sounds good,,,120.4,response,0,0,2
191,Farrah," Okay, you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really close",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
191,Oliver,"And I basically circle, the same thing as Farrah",,,,response,0,0,2
191,Chris,Scientist scientists don't printers for water,,,,response,0,0,2
191,Jazmin,And I said a small machine,,,,response,0,0,2
191,Luis,"And scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, stuff like that",,,,response,0,0,2
191,Teacher, So I'm going to go around the room and give a little bit of feedback to each of you,,,220.1,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher," So, Farrah to start",,,220.1,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher,So I think you guys all did a really great job thinking while using our text,,,220.1,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher,but I also think maybe next time and your responses you could give us a little bit more of a personalized approach to your response,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher," So maybe what you found from the text, along with what you thought about it",,,420.2,remark,0,0,2

191,Teacher,But we weren't didn't pull anything directly from the text like a quote,,,430.2,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher, So do you think maybe next time we could look back into the text and add a quote or something to directly,,,430.2,remark,0,0,2

191,Teacher, Our question was sorry I have to pull it back up,,,410.1,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher,"Well, your answer wasn't necessarily incorrect",,,410.1,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher," You had some really good vocabulary terms, but you weren't completely answering our question",,,410.1,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher,So the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher, Is there a place in the text where you found that Jazmin,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher, And you talked about that NASA send something,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
191,Jazmin,Yeah,,,230.2,response,0,0,2
191,Jazmin,Basically I saw that,,,,response,0,0,2
191,Jazmin,In paragraph two NASA send a small machine,,,,response,0,0,2
191,Jazmin,Or better to investigate,,,,response,0,0,2
191,Teacher,"Sorry, excuse me for one second, Jazmin, how can I help you, Luis",,,,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher,"So that's a really good start, but at your next point, you should add in what comes next, and the texts, a reading",,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
191,Luis,"Oh, well, actually I was just gonna say",,,,response,0,0,2
191,Luis,"That like I already know all about space, like, I don't think I need any help",,,,response,0,0,2
191,Teacher, And maybe we can learn from it,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher, Okay,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher, So maybe we should just keep our minds open to what's going on,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher, So the more we learn the better off we might be,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher,"You know, I think it's awesome that you already have so much knowledge, but nobody can know everything about one thing",,,150.1,remark,0,0,2

191,Teacher,Thank you and Chris,,,,remark,0,0,2

191,Chris, You know what I mean,,,,response,0,0,2
191,Teacher, That really helps us build on what we're learning,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2

191,Teacher," And Luis Sorry, I'm looking at the response again",,,,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher,"So you also had a great answer, scientists can use a lot of things",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher, So you've seen that they can use a lot of things,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher, And like you said you know a lot about space,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher,But in this particular text,,,420.3,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher, So maybe next time,,,420.3,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher, We're learning about one specific thing,,,420.3,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher," If we can look back into the text and pull something directly from there along with your personal opinion, we'd have a stronger response is that okay",,,420.3,remark,0,0,2
191,Luis," The thing is, because there's so many pieces that go into the spaceship",,,420.3,response,0,0,2
191,Luis,"Um, yeah, I guess I'm trying to figure out which",,,420.3,response,0,0,2
191,Luis," You know, so I'm I'm trying to figure out, like which one it is",,,420.3,response,0,0,2
191,Teacher,"Yeah, and I think if we look back into our reading, we can find specifics",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher, Okay,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher," So the more we continue reading about it, the more we can learn about it",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher,"and also if we continue our readings outside of class, we can learn a little bit more like you said you know a lot about space",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
191,Luis,"Yeah, okay",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
191,Teacher,"Thank you, Farrah",,,,remark,0,0,2

191,Farrah,"drawing our attention to, you know, to me, and asking us to share our thoughts like I was really glad to be able to share my thoughts out",,,,response,0,0,2
191,Farrah, So thank you so much for working,,,,response,0,0,2
191,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,0,2
191,Teacher,"So, are they responding first Am I",,,,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,Saying your responses first,,,,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,and,,,,remark,1,0,2
191,Oliver,What you'd like us to say them or or do you remember that,,,,response,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"i'm sorry I thought you were gonna say them first I have them okay alright guys, so you all have really great responses",,,,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"So now i'm going to ask you, each question and that question is where can you reference the test the text from your answer and how does it answer the question, do you have a question Luis",,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
191,Luis,"um yeah so I don't think I need to be in this group, because I already know, like all about space",,,230.2,response,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"that's awesome that you know a lot about space, but there's infinite learning that we can have none of us know absolutely everything is because none of us have been to space I don't think, have you been",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
191,Luis,"No, not yet, but I will",,,150.1,response,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"And i'm sure, one day, you will get there, but until then let's try to focus on learning a little bit more, so all right i'll repeat myself just so you guys remember",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"The questions that i'm asking you, is in your answer, where, can you refer to the text so where did you get your answer from in the text,",,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,so easy why don't you start for me where did you find your answer in the text,,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,and also how was your answer answering the question,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
191,Luis,"um so I didn't really need to read it, because I already knew the answer, because I know a lot about space, so I knew already that that scientists had to use that",,,230.1,response,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"So in our reading we did learn a little bit more about what they used to find the water and the first question i'm sorry discovering the moon, so we found that",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,We found different answers and what you found and that that's okay we'll just have to look back in the text to find these answers,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"And maybe from listening to your classmates you might see in the text and see new things and learn from what is really happening, along with what you have found in prior knowledge okay you then so let's listen to our classmates all right",,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,Thank you alright Jazmin so NASA sent a small machine where did you find that in the text,,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,He,,,,remark,1,0,2
191,Jazmin,"So basically what I was thinking that it was in the second paragraph, and they were talking about the end of the machine",,,,response,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"yeah that's awesome I see it, right in the second paragraph NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that's a great answer",,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,So the question asking what equipment did scientists use So is there any way you think that you could expand on your answer yes Jazmin,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
191,Jazmin,I don't understand why my answer is wrong even though you say we really want to expand,,,210.3,response,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"Your answer is not necessarily wrong I just think we could expand on it further, so if you could look back in the text and see exactly where you have your answer so in paragraph two, is there any more knowledge that you can add to your answer now",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
191,Jazmin,"Well, it says that",,,420.2,response,1,0,2
191,Jazmin,"Its looking for ice sheets, is that what it's supposed to be?",,,,response,1,0,2
191,Teacher,That would be more information yeah that would make your answer a little bit more,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"what's the word i'm looking for specific and a little bit more, you know, on task What you said is good but it's a little",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"it's a wide range for an answer, so this kind of pinpoints more so if you were to be a little bit more specific so that's a great answer but next time just try to lead read a little bit further just for a little bit more information okay",,,430.2,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"All right, awesome Thank you alright Chris, so your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon, where did you find that in the chat",,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
191,Jazmin,"Oh OK, so I saw that i'm excited the first paragraph, it, they were talking about the yeah the craters and how there was all the water",,,230.2,response,1,0,2
191,Jazmin,You know,,,,response,1,0,2
191,Teacher,yeah So let me ask you now How does that answer what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
191,Jazmin,Oh,,,230.1,response,1,0,2
191,Jazmin,Well that's where they discovered the water,,,,response,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"That is true, that is where they discovered the water, but the question was the equipment that they used",,,410.1,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"so maybe as we keep listening, as you heard from Jazmin and we might hear from Oliveron Farrah",,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"we're talking about the equipment, so you did name, where we found it, but the question is more focused on the equipment",,,410.1,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,That okay so next time we'll really read the question through a little bit harder i'll read it more myself to help you understand the question better and then we'll we'll find the equipment okay,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,Okay awesome alright Oliver so your answer was just circling the same as Farrah is there any more in depth that you'd like to go and your answer,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
191,Oliver,"Farrah is usually right, and I also thought that too",,,210.3,response,1,0,2
191,Teacher,Okay well that's great why don't we go to her and asked her about cars and we'll come back to you to see if there's anything more you can add afterwards okay,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"All right, thank you so Farrah where did you find your answer in the text",,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
191,Farrah,So I was looking for,,,230.2,response,1,0,2
191,Farrah,And the only equipment that I could find it pretty three paragraphs with me and I thought it was a like you know how are our test as like the kind of trick questions and it says what and you have to find that exact I was like what,,,,response,1,0,2
191,Farrah,"And I thought Oh, the bikers right so, even though I wasn't quite sure about like how it works I figured the microscope had to be",,,,response,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"yeah it's definitely a good answer to give and you use multiple paragraphs looking through to find that answer, but where the question is kind of",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"wide range, you could have multiple answers like how Farrah said they use the machine to get there, well, they couldn't find the water if they didn't get there right, so they use the machine and they use the microscope excuse me, yes Chris",,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
191,Chris,um I,,,130.1,response,1,0,2
191,Chris,I actually saw like a spaceship one time,,,,response,1,0,2
191,Teacher,that's really cool and i'm sure we can circle back to that when we finish our discussion then we're just going to finish up first okay Chris,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"Alright, so Farrah as I was saying there's multiple tools that were used to find the water, because we had to get there in order to find the water right so that's a really good answer",,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,"so next time with a question like this, how do you think you can make your answer better",,,520.1,remark,1,0,2
191,Farrah,"Unfortunately, we have to go too much, but thank you so much for people, it was really fun",,,520.1,response,1,0,2
191,Farrah,Thank you so much bye,,,,response,1,0,2
191,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,1,0,2
191,Teacher,simulation,,,,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"Alright, so I believe we left off the savanna talking about the microscope being the only thing i'm sorry Luis, how can I help you",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
191,Luis,"Oh well, I just was off, I was gonna say that, like, I think I got everything figured out now, so I think i'm all good to go",,,150.1,response,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"Okay, well, I appreciate your thoughts, but i'm just going to ask that we keep listening and that maybe we'll find new knowledge okay so",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"let's just keep listening to our classmates make sure we're all respectful to each other and let's keep our hands down until I come to you Okay, unless you have a serious question",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,2
191,Luis,Okay,,,,response,2,0,2
191,Teacher,Thanks guys alright so Farrah we were talking about the microscope and how that's the only object that you found after looking through the first three paragraphs,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"But since we've kind of brought in our knowledge now about how it takes time and equipment to get to space to find the water, how can we brought in our answer",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
191,Farrah,Oh well,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
191,Farrah,"I use it sure cuz when I think of equipment I just think of like a wrench or hamper you know, like that equipment right, so a microscope like maybe like fancy equipment, but it still",,,,response,2,0,2
191,Farrah,"don't see any other equipment, you know look that up",,,,response,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"And that's okay um if we think back to Jazmin's response she talked about the spaceship and, if you think about it equipment can be anything that you really use to get to the water",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"or anything that helps you find the water, so now thinking that way thinking anything that can be considered equipment to help us find the water is there anything more that you can think of that you saw",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
191,Farrah,Oh,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
191,Farrah,Like a robot,,,,response,2,0,2
191,Teacher,let's see where where did you find that in the text,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
191,Farrah,"Oh no No, sorry I was thinking about like what would be like oh so the Lunar orbiter is like",,,230.2,response,2,0,2
191,Farrah,You would use,,,,response,2,0,2
191,Farrah,"And I guess they had a robot but no, they just use the Lunar orbiter",,,,response,2,0,2
191,Teacher,Absolutely,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"yeah that's a great answer, thank you, so now we can see that we've used the microscope and the Lunar orbiter",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"so Oliver is there anything you'd like to add to that now that we've looked through the text and, if you want to review it again see if there's anything else or add",,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,to that,,,,remark,2,0,2
191,,I think samantha's right,,,,,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"yeah I totally agree, do you want to point out exactly where in the text, she found the answers for us",,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
191,,um,,,230.2,,2,0,2
191,,"Well, I think it was next to the robot part",,,,,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"Can you find it for me because I don't think that we had a robot part in there, but that's Okay",,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,and just a second the Oliver can you find where the microscope is in text,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"so we know that Jazmin said that we found small machine in the second paragraph, so i'm gonna talk with Jazmin",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
191,,"yeah Okay, I see it",,,230.3,,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"Alright, so we'll come right back to you Jazmin, how can I help you",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,How so,,,,remark,2,0,2
191,Jazmin,"Well, I guess it's just what",,,,response,2,0,2
191,Jazmin,Is,,,,response,2,0,2
191,Jazmin,"The leader is that, like",,,,response,2,0,2
191,Jazmin,You that's equipment like it too,,,,response,2,0,2
191,Teacher,So equipment is considered to be anything that helps you get to the water in this point or helps you get on to,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,The moon so basically you could even say that the food on the ship is equipment for the people to stay alive to get there,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"So it can be taken in multiple different directions, some people could be very like how you guys each said, one thing, but if we bring it all together, we have all the equipment, we need to find the water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
191,Jazmin,yeah,,,150.1,response,2,0,2
191,Teacher,awesome alright so Oliver where did you find the information about microscope and the text,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
191,Oliver,"Okay, so when I was looking at it",,,230.2,response,2,0,2
191,Oliver,"You know, more seriously, I saw that that they had like that they were using the microscope to look at the release small like particles of water",,,,response,2,0,2
191,Oliver,"And so that's kind of like why I thought that might have been cool as well, and then I actually do understand like how Farrah was say like",,,,response,2,0,2
191,Oliver,"That the Lunar orbiter is also a piece of equipment, because, just like semana like I only saw the microscope I didn't think that the Lunar orbiter was really like",,,,response,2,0,2
191,Oliver,"equipment, the same way that like you know she was saying, you know, like a screwdriver or like you know something like that seems different so I kind of had the same thing, she did",,,,response,2,0,2
191,Teacher,i'm glad we could expand on that and we can see how there's much more to getting to space and finding the water than we thought there was,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"Now Chris, now that we've heard everyone else's responses, do you have anything to reflect on or add about what you've heard and how this equipment was used to get to find the water on the moon",,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
191,Chris,"yeah, I guess, so I I think like I read that there could be a base on the moon by maybe 20 or that made me think that you know, like I don't know like It made me think that this is something that could make that possible",,,130.2,response,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"that's a really good connection, so the note the news that you're hearing outside of the text so yeah this equipment will definitely help them get there, thank you for adding that",,,110.3,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"And Luis now that we've heard from everybody we've learned that we use the spacecraft and the microscope to see the water on the moon, is there any other",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"Information in the text, maybe we could look for some harder words in the text so spacecraft stuff like that and reflect that on to these answers, do you think you can do that for me",,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
191,Luis,"Oh, I maybe I kind of feel like I don't know I feel like the stuff",,,420.3,response,2,0,2
191,Luis,"Well, I kind of feel like",,,,response,2,0,2
191,Luis,"I don't really understand why they wouldn't like if they have all those astronauts they would have to use oxygen, so I think my answer was still pretty right",,,,response,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"And it could be right, yes, but it doesn't reflect on our texts and the main point here is that we're trying to ask from the text what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,So if you can reflect on your texts for me and find some bigger words harder words that maybe you didn't understand and we can go over them,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
191,Teacher,"Yes, Oliver, how can I help you",,,,remark,2,0,2
191,Oliver,"So, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular, I wanted to thank you for really",,,,response,2,0,2
191,Oliver,hoping to sort of value the answers that we had and then like helping a lot of us sort of work through like our fusion and like,,,,response,2,0,2
191,Oliver,"Also, you really had us focus on using evidence which was pretty cool because that made sure that we were able to tell you like, why we thought what we were thinking and like why we had our answer, which was pretty cool, so thank you so much, it was really fun",,,,response,2,0,2
191,Teacher,bye bye,,,,remark,2,0,2
192,Teacher,Hello students,,,,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,"Oh, sorry",,,,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher, Go ahead,,,,remark,0,0,3
192,Luis,"I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,0,3
192,Teacher,"Well that's great that you have some background knowledge, we're just going to build that in this group and expand your knowledge on the subject",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,To all guys,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher," So to start off, we're gonna start with Farrah",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher, So all of you guys read the text and gave good answers,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher," And you notice an example of what helped them decided the water on the moon was sufficient enough for us, however, that wasn't the tool they used for the to discover the water",,,410.3,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,"Farrah, you had a great response",,,410.3,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,But you use great academic knowledge,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,nd great academic vocab in your response,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,So that was good but next time I want you to dive deeper into story and think about what they used to discover the water,,,420.3,remark,0,0,3
192,Farrah,"Okay, I guess",,,420.3,response,0,0,3
192,Farrah,I thought that what I wrote I was what they used to discover the water,,,,response,0,0,3
192,Teacher, So the question was asking for what they used to discover and that was in the text above us,,,410.3,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher, It was a great example but not exactly what we were looking for,,,410.3,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,With your response you talked about what they would use to check if the water was sufficient enough,,,410.3,remark,0,0,3
192,Farrah,"Okay, I'm looking",,,410.3,response,0,0,3
192,Farrah,The water they found was microscopic,,,,response,0,0,3
192,Teacher,If you look in the second sentence,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
192,Farrah,The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking at it closely,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
192,Teacher,"No the one that starts with ""NASA sent""",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
192,Farrah,NASA sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate lunar orbiter when the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large public crater,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
192,Farrah,"these ice deposits are very small, scientists said the one top of the top layer of the surface will hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water, about one one person might drink in a day",,,,response,0,0,3
192,Teacher," Do you see where it says the exact equipment they sent, Farrah?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,Okay,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
192,Farrah,I'll let me read it again,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
192,Jazmin,Teacher,,,,response,0,0,3
192,Jazmin,"I think my answer from paragraph two, but I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,,response,0,0,3
192,Teacher,"Jazmin, you started off your response really well",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher, They use the equipment they use,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,"So you notice that it was a small machine was very good which they also stated, it shows that you use your context from the text, which is very good",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,You just needed to go a little further to name the machine,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,You just needed to go a little further to name the women they use,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher," But so far, so good",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Jazmin,"Okay, okay",,,420.2,response,0,0,3
192,Teacher,"Now, Farrah, did you see where it said the equipment",,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
192,Farrah,Is I guess the one that Jazmin said,,,210.3,response,0,0,3
192,Farrah,The NASA sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,0,0,3
192,Teacher,So you see how that was the equipment they used to discover the water and then the microscope was the equipment they used to go closer and see if the water was sufficient,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
192,Farrah," But I guess I didn't, I didn't",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
192,Farrah, It doesn't look like they found water in there,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
192,Farrah,"Well, I mean, I see where it's at that the lunar orbiter will land at the South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
192,Teacher,They um the water they found was microscopic that's why they need it on my microscope to look closer,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,"Okay, okay, I'm moving on to Oliver",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher, You realize that Farrah had a good answer,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher," And you agreed with her, but next time I would like you to either add on to something She says, based on the text or you can make up your own, go say your own answer",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,Oliver,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,So you're adding on to discussion or adding your own opinion to it,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Oliver, You just asked her how first so when it was my turn,,,420.2,response,0,0,3
192,Oliver,"But, but, I mean, I had the same answer",,,420.2,response,0,0,3
192,Oliver, It was just the same thing,,,420.2,response,0,0,3
192,Teacher," Um, but for next time I would just like you to add on",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher, So you see how she said microscope,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher, They use a microscope to find the closer look in the water,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,"Yeah, that's okay",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,You could have added on to say if you saw another equipment in the text,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,Or if  you disagree or anything,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher, So we're not all saying the same things,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher, Just adding on to the discussion,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
192,Oliver,Okay,,,420.2,response,0,0,3
192,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,0,0,3
192,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,0,3
192,Chris,Went to NASA,,,,response,0,0,3
192,Teacher,"Yeah, that's great background knowledge to bring to the table",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher, I just want you to look closer at the text,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,And since we're in a small group we're supposed to discuss it here for next time,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher," Um, it seems like you didn't quite understand the text, which is okay",,,410.3,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,And based on your answer,,,410.3,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher," I just want you to read closer and if you don't understand the first time just reread as much as you need, or ask a pair or a teacher",,,430.3,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,It was talking about how they didn't find a lot of water that they had to use a microscope to like look at the water that they did find so for next time,,,430.3,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,Next time I just want you to get a deeper look into the text and think closer about the question,,,420.3,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,But you used great academic vocab in your response,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
192,Chris,Okay okay,,,310.1,response,0,0,3
192,Oliver," And we just met, but I really appreciate how you helped me think about how I",,,,response,0,0,3
192,Oliver,It's time for us to go to lunch but and I know this was really short,,,,response,0,0,3
192,Oliver, But maybe you how I always want to add on a new idea or more more things,,,,response,0,0,3
192,Oliver,Should kind of give my own ideas,,,,response,0,0,3
192,Oliver, If somebody else has the same idea as me,,,,response,0,0,3
192,Oliver," I mean, it's not like I copied off Farrah",,,,response,0,0,3
192,Teacher,Exactly,,,,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher," Well, you guys have a great lunch was nice meeting you all",,,,remark,0,0,3
192,Teacher,"Okay, so to start off everyone had a great start answering the questions um",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"Yes, Luis?",,,,remark,1,0,3
192,Luis,"i'm gap, so I was just gonna say that I don't think I need to even be in this room, because I already know all about space, and all this kind of stuff ready",,,,response,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"Well it's always great to expand your knowledge, because you can always learn something you wouldn't have thought you needed to know before so it's always a good experience to build upon our responses and our knowledge of the subject",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"As I was saying you guys all started off great and we're headed in the right direction and we only need to build your response, a little more to fully answer the question so to start with Farrah",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"First, Farrah, I see what you were saying",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"When you said, the tool the scientists needed for water was a small microscope um",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,But you need to go a little further and see the first tool they used to find the water in the first place,,,420.3,remark,1,0,3
192,Farrah,"So, like how they found even I mean like today yeah cuz I thought the",,,420.3,response,1,0,3
192,Farrah,The microscope you through the microscope really close,,,,response,1,0,3
192,Teacher,They did use a microscope to look at the water closest answer was small I see how you connected those two,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"My suggestion would be to look at the passage the paragraph before it, where it stated the the equipment they use to find the water in the first place before they could even look into it with the microscope they use something else to find the water so my suggestion would be to add that and then revise your response",,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
192,Farrah,Okay,,,420.2,response,1,0,3
192,Teacher,And then for Oliver let's see Oliver your response,,,,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,I understand that you had a similar response to Farrah,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"And I would like you to just dive a little deeper and either add on or revise your statement to like either add on or say something different to what Farrah said so, is there anything you wanted to add on?",,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
192,Oliver,"um well I guess what I was thinking about was kind of a same thing that they used a microscope to look really closely because I was thinking like if you're gonna see the water, like the ice crystals they're really small, and so I was thinking like that's, the only way to see that",,,210.3,response,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"Exactly, but before they could see them water with the microscope they had to use an equipment to find the water in the first place",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,or ask a question if you're confused and um because Farrah also,,,420.3,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher," My suggestion would be to Either if you're gonna if you're gonna agree, I need you to add something",,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,So I see where you agreed with Farrah,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,question if you're confused and look closely at the passage,,,430.3,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"was almost there, but then quite fully answer the question so next time if you're going to add like just add on something extra",,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,1,0,3
192,Jazmin,"Like like I guess I wasn't sure in this group you're helping us, because we weren't quite right, it",,,,response,1,0,3
192,Jazmin,is still kind of confused like why my answer was wrong,,,,response,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"It actually wasn't wrong, and I see where you answered your question, I just wanted you to be a little more specific of what the equipment was called so you had a good start, and you was almost there you just needed to name the equipment, so you you were on the right track",,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
192,Jazmin,I know the equipment can I say it?,,,420.2,response,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"Yes, you can",,,,remark,1,0,3
192,Jazmin,"So the small machine it was the lunar oriber, right?",,,,response,1,0,3
192,Teacher,It was one second i'll tell you if it's correct,,,,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"Yes, that is correct, so you just needed, you were in the right track, you just needed to name the object so for next time when you're given a response is make sure you as specific as possible, but you had a great start",,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
192,Jazmin,"In that makes sense that it was like I just tend to be more specific, like see what it what",,,420.2,response,1,0,3
192,Teacher,Exactly,,,,remark,1,0,3
192,Jazmin,Thank you that makes a lot of sense,,,,response,1,0,3
192,Teacher,So for Chris i'm,,,,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,just looking at your response,,,,remark,1,0,3
192,Chris,So I was also going to say that I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and stuff like that,,,,response,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"yeah that's actually great background knowledge for this assignment and it could also help you, but the question that we are being asked",,,410.1,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"Is the specific equipment, the scientists use to find the water",,,410.1,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"and for your response Chris, I would just like to ask you to just look a little closer into second paragraph",,,420.3,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,To see the exact equipment they used,,,420.3,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"You, the background knowledge is very helpful to understand the passage better, I just want you to look into the text to find the equipment they used",,,420.3,remark,1,0,3
192,Chris,gotcha okay yeah I can look close,,,420.3,response,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"Okay, and then moving on for Luis",,,,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,i'm,,,,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"Similar to Chris, I just want you to look closer at the passage, specifically the second paragraph, which it talks about the equipment they use,",,,420.3,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,I just want you to look into it and find the evidence to support your answer,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,Most of you have an answer,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"So just basically look closer and it stated in the text, but you just need to read it thoroughly to answer the question you had a great start",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"And the background knowledge is helpful to understand what's going on in the passage, I want you to use that background knowledge to help you understand the passage better and be able to read to find the answers",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
192,Teacher,Exactly,,,,remark,1,0,3
192,Chris,"Okay yeah I can look more closely and see what what else is going on, because yeah I was just connecting to what I already do, but I think I see what you're saying like I need to I need to look at the paper look at the reading and my kind of pull it from from there as well, right now",,,310.1,response,1,0,3
192,Chris,OK cool thank you,,,,response,1,0,3
192,Teacher,Yes Luis?,,,,remark,1,0,3
192,Luis,"So unfortunately, we have to go to our next class, but I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us this was really fun, thank you",,,,response,1,0,3
192,Teacher,"OK, so now that I have given you guys some feedback, I want you to think about how you started out thinking",,,530.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"  Then, how that changed",,,530.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"And how you will apply what you learned in your next task so we're gonna go i'm gonna give you guys a couple minutes to think about it, and then we will go around in the circle answering",,,520.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"So we can start with Farrah and just to repeat, I want you to stay, how you started out thinking, one second Luis, how you started out thinking and the strategy you use how it changed, based on the feedback I gave and what you will do next time to um What you are doing, next time, to make sure you are fully doing answering the question",,,520.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,Yes Luis?,,,,remark,2,0,3
192,Luis,"um well, I was gonna say i'm excited to share, because I think I got it all figured out so i'm all good",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"um well there's always room to grow for everyone when answering a question or doing an assignment, so, for your answer",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"I well, one thing I noticed was that you started out with your context your background knowledge which is great, and always useful",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"What do you think you can include after using a background knowledge to answer your question so after you use your background knowledge, what do you think what strategy, do you think you can use to help promote learning and answering the question",,,510.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Luis,"So I thought, like, I was thinking about what you were saying, and you were telling me like I needed to look more closely at the reading",,,510.1,response,2,0,3
192,Luis,"And not just not just use my background knowledge, so you know, like it was an interesting question",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Luis,"You know, like what equipment, do they use, and so I was saying, like Oh, they use like oxygen tanks and stuff which I do, but then, when I look at paragraph two",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Luis,"I realized that the equipment, maybe that they were really focused on was the Lunar orbit and and then in paragraph three, was the microscope so it looks like maybe I can read more closely in the um, you know what I mean like in the reading to understand like what i'm trying to answer",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"Exactly that's a great observation Nathan, and a growth strategy to continue with",,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"we're just going to go around Jazmin, what do you think first you're going to stay what you want strategy you used how that has changed or how you will build on to it, for your next assignment or task",,,520.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Jazmin,"So for me, what I noticed was that basically what you pointed out was that my answer was right but it was incomplete",,,520.1,response,2,0,3
192,Jazmin,"so like what I needed to do was make sure that well (a) that I was like saying like You know, not just this small machine but like what this machine was and if I didn't say that thenI didn't really answer the question because they were asking like what equipment and I just said small machine  I didn't say like lunar orbiter, you know what i mean?",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"Exactly great observation and another thing is, if anything, you can always use direct evidence from the text to answer your question as long as you use the quotation mark for the evidence, but good job yeah exactly",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,Chris,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
192,Jazmin,Can I ask a quick question?,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"Yes, go ahead",,,,remark,2,0,3
192,Jazmin,"So I guess I was partially still a little confused only on one section, and so I understand why this woman she like the Lunar orbiter was what they used to discover the water",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Jazmin,"And I was wondering like if they use the microscope as well you know, like Farrah and Oliver's answer like it seems like that might be an answer and I guess, I was confused like why that might not be the right answer",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"Okay yeah no problem, so the reason why it wasn't the answer we were looking for is because we wanted to know the machine that help find the water",,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"And the microscope after they found the water they use a microscope to look closely at it, so the microscope help them to see the water better, but I did it help them find the water",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
192,Jazmin,makes perfect sense Thank you so much okay that makes sense I'm not confused,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"Chris, what about you",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
192,Chris,"um I think for me like what I noticed is like kind of similar to like I I bring a lot of my like background knowledge, because I know all about this stuff",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
192,Chris,"But I wasn't reading as closely about the question because I was saying, like you're saying this craters full of water moon and they use oxygen tanks and stuff like that, but they didn't",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Chris,"I didn't say really the answer I said, like that they found the craters and then they use this other stuff but I didn't really say like what it meant that they fought with just what you've been pointing out to everybody, so I think that that's why my answer was incomplete",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Teacher,yeah exactly and similar to what I said to the other two students,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"If you're always confused you can always go back and read the text and um and use evidence, if anything to help you to sort out the answers",,,420.3,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,Oliver What about you?,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
192,Oliver,"i'm so actually I understood a lot, so I was thinking about it, and then, when you were talking to Luis and Jasper, it really made me think that like",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
192,Oliver,"i'm I understand now that like when I said that they use the microscope, just like the statement survey and I said I realized that",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Oliver,"They did use it, but first they had to find it so I didn't read the question as closely as I could, but what you pointed out, was that I needed to read it closely and understand what they were asking",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Teacher,Exactly and um,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"Always you guys want to always build on each other's thoughts so even though, if you agree, or if you have the same thought you have to think of a way that you could either add on or ask questions",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,Yes Oliver?,,,,remark,2,0,3
192,Oliver,"So I I read that they weren't going to try to build a moon base on the moon by like 2024, and it was just making me think like",,,150.1,response,2,0,3
192,Oliver,"The questions always make me think of other things, so I was wondering like when when should I bring in that like that knowledge and question like",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Oliver,"You know what I mean like because that seems like that would use a lot of equipment, but I guess I guess it's not answering the question is that right",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"Yes, that is right so it's always great to have background knowledge to help us understand our text better or understand the question better",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"But we want to focus on exactly what the question is asking us, so we can answer it completely",,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"So it's always good to bring in that background knowledge, but if the question isn't asking for that specific answer let's try to focus on what it is asking and where we can find it in test text",,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Oliver,Okay,,,420.1,response,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"And last but not least, Farrah What about you, what do you think how did you start off and what strategy, did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future",,,520.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Farrah,"So I started by saying that it was the Microscope that they found the water with because I was so my thinking was if they couldn't see it, they couldn't find it, but when I read read it sounds like they had other sensors that could find the water",,,520.1,response,2,0,3
192,Farrah,Then they studied it using the microphone so that's that's pretty cool and where it makes me think like going forward is that I need to think really closely about what it's asking,,,,response,2,0,3
192,Farrah,"because sometimes like when we take our our leap test it always is hard for me to know, like some of the tricky answers like they asked like what's the best answer",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Farrah,"And I think i'm understanding that there's like you can still see an answer and it still is connected, but like what's the",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Farrah,"best answer, and it seems like the best answer was the Lunar orbiter like you were saying the Jazmin because that's the best answer that says like",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Farrah,"How did they find it like maybe they proved it with the microscope and they sort of found it, but like what did they do to even find that it was there, like they didn't have a microscope like",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Farrah,"I thought there was an astronaut, but with a magnifying glass on the moon, but that's not at all what it was like they had a little machine, so I think what I would do is read really closely and try to understand like what what they're asking",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Teacher,"Exactly, these are all great reflections and for the next text you can always think back to this and see how to build on",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
192,Teacher,yeah Farrah?,,,,remark,2,0,3
192,Farrah,"So, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go I really wanted to thank you for a couple things",,,150.1,response,2,0,3
192,Farrah,"That are really important in this class so like one thing that was really important, as you help us understand our use evidence better so you really helped us to use evidence like",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Farrah,"In our answers, so that we weren't just using background knowledge and also you have this there you know by by asking us what we were thinking",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Farrah,"That led to our answers you helped us understand like what we were doing right and maybe what we could do better, and you also were so patient you let us explain our ideas and like you didn't interrupt this what we were trying to to understand and that made us feel really valued, right guys?",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Teacher,Well that's what,,,,remark,2,0,3
192,Luis,I felt really valued,,,,response,2,0,3
192,Farrah,"So I just wanted to share that that was something that up and then, finally, you also like give us your concerns, so you let us know, like exactly what we could work on which helped us because rather than saying",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Farrah,"Like Oh, you need to just work on your answer you were like we think about like what you're saying, think about what's be asked and then give your answer so that like helped us to have a much better set of answers",,,,response,2,0,3
192,Farrah,Thank you so much that was really fun working with you,,,,response,2,0,3
193,Teacher, How are you?,,,,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Hi class,,,,remark,0,1,3
193,Luis,I'm good,,,,response,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Do we remember reading that,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Awesome job,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Everybody did a great job,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Good,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher," Alright, so, um, we remember the other day, we read the text water on the moon",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Luis,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, So the reason that we are meeting today is because we're going to try to work on your responses,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Awesome,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Awesome,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Yeah,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Yeah,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Yeah,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Luis,Excuse me,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
193,Luis,"I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,3
193,Teacher,I know that you know all about space,,,220.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, It's about we're going to work on creating better responses when we read texts,,,220.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, But this isn't about learning about space,,,220.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Does that makes sense?,,,220.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Luis,Oh,,,220.1,response,0,1,3
193,Luis, Ok,,,220.1,response,0,1,3
193,Luis, Yeah yeah,,,220.1,response,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Remember reading that and digesting the text? So in the text,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, So we remember we read the text water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,"Okay, okay",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Remember we,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,We learned about how scientists found evidence that water can be found on the moon's polar craters these craters are in dark places that the sun never shines,,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher," NASA, which is the big space station that sends stuff to the moon",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to to look for these polar craters that have the water in them,,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Does anybody know what microscopic means?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher," And then we found the water, but the water is microscopic",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Microscopic means that you can't see it with your eye that you need a scientific tool called a microscope in order to see it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Farrah,"Yeah, we talked about, we use a microscope in science class",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher," And I just want to like we want to meet in a group, just so we can work on our responses",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,"So, um, you all gave responses",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher," Alright, so",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Remember answering that question?,,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,"We need to make - when we are given a question, remember the question that you guys all answered was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,So there's just a few things that we need to work on in order to create better responses and better understanding of the text,,,220.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,"Okay, so one thing is we need to make sure that we are answering the question fully",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, So the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, So what you want to say in your,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,"So we could say, for an example, we could talk about the microscope, because they used it to see the water you can talk about the lunar orbiter that NASA sent",,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Response is you want to say scientists discovered water on the moon by using blank equipment,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Those are some options,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher," Yes, Jazmin",,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
193,Jazmin,"Well, I don't understand why my answers wrong because I did",,,420.2,response,0,1,3
193,Jazmin,Use one of the equipment,,,,response,0,1,3
193,Teacher," You said that NASA sent a small machine, which is good that you mentioned, NASA",,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,You did,,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, You said I remember your response,,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, We want to be specific on our answer and pulling things from the text,,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, But you said small machine and we want to be a little bit more specific,,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Jazmin,"So after, I have to write more stuff",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
193,Teacher,"Yeah, you have to write more stuff",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,"Alright, so",,,,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Luis I remember in your response,,,410.3,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Like Luis talking about being more specific and pulling things from the text,,,410.3,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, But you said that they use oxygen tanks and oxygen tanks were not mentioned in the text,,,410.3,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher," You, you talked about how they use equipment",,,410.3,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,You said that scientists use a lot of equipment which is good,,,410.3,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,"So if you guys are having trouble thinking of an answer, you know that you can go back to the text and look at the text",,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,That makes sense? Good,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher," Oliver, I remember you said that you have the same answer as Farrah",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Also another thing that I noticed,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Even if your answer is going to be the same as the person next to you,,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher," I still want you to say an answer, because I want everybody to be giving an answer",,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,And I don't want you to just say that you have the same answer,,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,So I know where everybody is at learning,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, So I can help you guys further if you need it,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Oliver, It does,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
193,Oliver, It was just that it was exactly the same because she circled the last sentence and I circled the last sentence too,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
193,Oliver,Okay,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
193,Teacher, It's for good participation and I want to make sure everybody says their answer,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,"And even if you circle the last sentence, I still want you to say something",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Oliver,Okay,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
193,Teacher, You said that use the,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,All right,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher," And then so Farrah, you gave a really good response",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Tool a microscope to look really closely,,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher," That's a good response, but we just need to add a little bit more talking about and being specific",,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, You want to say that they used it to find the water because the whole purpose of the text is finding water on the moon,,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Awesome,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Awesome,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher," You, you said they use the scientific tool called the microscope",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Awesome job,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,"Okay, so in order to do that, like in your response",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,We want to be using that,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Good language and good vocabulary that we're learning from the text just add in it and say um they use the microscope in order to see the water,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Farrah,"So,",,,420.2,response,0,1,3
193,Farrah,"I guess kind of like Jazmin, I have to add more words",,,,response,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Add more words,,,,remark,0,1,3
193,Farrah,Or I have to change my answer?,,,,response,0,1,3
193,Teacher,You have to add more words,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,You want to make sure that - it's all about being specific,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, You want to use good examples from the text,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher," And then Chris, you talked about how they found craters",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,"Alright, okay",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Chris,Reach Every Readers: I went to NASA,,,420.2,response,0,1,3
193,Teacher,You went to NASA? Really?,,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Chris,"Yeah, with my dad",,,140.1,response,0,1,3
193,Chris, I went to NASA,,,140.1,response,0,1,3
193,Chris, So I do know that scientists use a lot of equipment like,,,140.1,response,0,1,3
193,Chris,oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,1,3
193,Chris," Yeah, they, they, they need a lot of equipment to go to the moon",,,,response,0,1,3
193,Teacher,but right now we're just going to focus on what's in the text and answering the question from the text,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,That's awesome,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher," So I that's great that you have really good knowledge about NASA, which can come in handy in the future,",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, Awesome,,,,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, So you said you talked about how the scientists found craters full water on the moon,,,,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,But you didn't talk about the equipment,,,410.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, That's what the text was all about - finding water on the moon,,,,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,The question asked for you to talk about the equipment,,,410.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher," This is for everybody, not just Chris, when you are talking about",,,410.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher, So when you guys are,,,410.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,when you are going to answer the question you want to make sure that you answer all parts of the question and that you're specific as possible,,,420.1,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,"Yes, Oliver",,,,remark,0,1,3
193,Oliver,"Um teacher, it's time for us to go to lunch",,,,response,0,1,3
193,Teacher,No problem,,,,remark,0,1,3
193,Oliver, And we just met,,,,response,0,1,3
193,Oliver, I know this was really short,,,,response,0,1,3
193,Oliver, But I really do appreciate how you helped us to think about using more evidence from the text in our answers,,,,response,0,1,3
193,Oliver,Bye,,,,response,0,1,3
193,Teacher,Bye guys,,,,remark,0,1,3
193,Teacher,"Hi students, how are you?",,,,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,Good?,,,,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,Okay awesome,,,,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher, Yes Luis,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,So we're here because I have concerns about each one of your guys's responses to the water on the moon passage and we're going to work on improving them,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I know all about space",,,220.1,response,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"You may know all about space, but this doesn't really have anything to do with learning about space it's going to be about improving our responses to questions when we read passages",,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,So the five of you just all told me what your response would be to the question,,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher, So looking back the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"So Farrah and Jazmin, the two of you, in your responses mentioned -actually Luis you as well, so Farrah Jazmin and Luis the three of you mentioned some type of equipment that was used",,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"So you guys are getting there you're almost there, but my main concern for the three of you is that you didn't fully answer the question as it's stated",,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"So going back again, the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so the key words, and this is for all five of you, the keywords are equipment and discover water for the passage",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"So for the three of you Farrah Jazmin and Luis when you go back and read, I want you to go back and reread the passage with the question in mind",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"And yes, you talked about equipment, but I want you to really focus on the discovering water what equipment discovered water",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"Farrah you mentioned a microscope which is mentioned in the passage which is good, you just need to reread the question again and take it a step farther because i'm concerned that you didn't fully understand what the question was asking",,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"Jazmin, you said that NASA sent a small machine, you're correct that NASA was mentioned, so you got that part of it, but um",,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"You didn't mention what like you just wrote a small machine it's not very specific,",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"so I want you to go back and reread and be more specific, because we want specific answers",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"And Luis, you said that the scientists use equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks",,,410.3,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher, So oxygen tanks weren't mentioned in the passage,,,410.3,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"So for you, I just want you to totally um scrap the answer and we're just going to start fresh and new and we're going to improve and build, so I want you to reread the question",,,120.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,And then look for equipment that helped to discover water,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher, So those are your key words,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"So for now Chris for you, you said that scientists found water found craters full of water right?",,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Jazmin,Excuse me teacher,,,110.1,response,1,1,3
193,Jazmin,I was looking and I still don't understand why my answer's wrong,,,,response,1,1,3
193,Teacher,So your answer it's not okay you're not it's not wrong you're just not fully there okay so,,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher, So you're right about like a small machine is a piece of equipment,,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"um your you, your answer was NASA sent a small machine",,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"you're right about that, but it's not specific so rereading the question asking what equipment was used to discover water, I want you to keep that question in mind and reread the passage to rework your answer",,,430.2,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"So Chris back to you, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon correct yeah?",,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,So I want you to reread the question because I don't think you fully understood what the question was asking,,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"Because your answer didn't have anything to do with equipment, it just said that water was found on the moon, which is right that's what we're talking about water being found the moon so",,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,so it's good to reread the question and go back to find those words to help you get the answer that you need,,,420.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"As i've been saying to everybody those keywords equipment and to discover water on the moon is really, really important when finding the answer in the passage",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"And Oliver for you, you just said that you have the same answer as Farrah",,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"And, as I talked, as I said, to Farrah she said microscope which is -was mentioned in the passage, but for you, my concern is that you didn't have really your own answer you just said that Farrah, so yours was the same as Farrah",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"So I would love if you go back, reread the question and then go to the passage and come up with your own answer because I want to know your own ideas and thoughts for the answer",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
193,Chris,I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,420.2,response,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"So Chris, you may have gone to NASA but we're going to be focusing more on what the passage is saying, because the question is specific to the passage",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,Has everyone had a chance to reread the question in the passage?,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
193,Jazmin,yeah,,,210.3,response,1,1,3
193,Teacher,Okay does anybody want to start?,,,,remark,1,1,3
193,Jazmin,"Okay, well, you told me that I have to be more specific",,,,response,1,1,3
193,Jazmin,So I have NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,1,1,3
193,Teacher,So in the passage you read that it talks about how NASA sent a lunar,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"awesome that is so so good, that is what I wanted you to look for",,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"lunar lunar orbiter to investigate and then, if you look at the sentence right after that, it says this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,Which is good awesome which shows that you now the equipment that was used was the Lunar orbiter to help discover the water on the moon awesome,,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher," Oliver, yes",,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
193,Oliver, I was just looking at the time and it's time for us to go,,,110.4,response,1,1,3
193,Oliver,Sorry to interrupt,,,110.4,response,1,1,3
193,Oliver, So we'll have to see you later,,,110.4,response,1,1,3
193,Teacher,Okay bye bye,,,,remark,1,1,3
193,Teacher,"hello, how are you guys?",,,,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"Good, awesome so we just read the passage that is called water is a valuable resource",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,And the five of you had answered the question that is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"So the reason that the five of you are with me today is because I have some concerns about your responses that I would like to address, so we can improve on them, so you guys can better understand",,,220.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher, Awesome,,,220.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,How -have a better of understanding of how to answer questions that are given to you after reading a passage,,,220.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher," Farrah you said no, not for a long time for the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable so Luis yes",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"So, I have a specific little notes for each of you, so let me start off with Farrah",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
193,Luis,"Okay, I think I got it now and i'm all good",,,230.3,response,2,1,3
193,Luis,Yeah,,,,response,2,1,3
193,Teacher,You do?,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"Okay well give me one minute i'll keep, I'm going to tell Farrah what I want her to do and then i'm going to come to you",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"And i'm going to tell you exactly what I, what I want you to do, and I want you to apply that",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher," You may understand it now, but I still want to tell you my concerns just so you and I are both on the same page",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Luis,Ok,,,110.1,response,2,1,3
193,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,So Farrah back to you,,,,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"um So the question is, is there evidence and you said no, not for a long time, so the reason that the question is saying is there evidence is when you read the passage",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"I want you to go back and look at the question, so the question says is there convincing evidence that water can be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher, OK?,,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"So the word evidence, what is it what is evidence, can you tell me what evidence is?",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Farrah,it's like facts,,,210.2,response,2,1,3
193,Teacher," So and then is there, so is there facts that can show if water is valuable",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher, what does the word valuable mean?,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"facts yeah yeah so it's facts, information, details that can help",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,Can anybody tell me?,,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
193,Chris,Valuable means like has a lot of value?,,,120.4,response,2,1,3
193,Teacher,yeah so,,,,remark,2,1,3
193,Luis,"Like it's worth a lot of money, like money",,,,response,2,1,3
193,Teacher, So valuable can also be something that we need,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"Yeah, so when we think of value most of the time we think of money",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher, Helpful is another word instead of using valuable,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher, It's something that's helpful to us,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,So something that can be helpful,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"So is there evidence that let's rework the question just a little bit, so it can be easier to understand, because there are some big words in there, like evidence and valuable So is there facts information that can help the water that water on the moon can be helpful to us?",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,so Farrah I want you to go back and look for anything that in the passage that the passage reads not any information that you know from outside just specifically in the passage that water can be valuable to us,,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher, So um that can be useful useful helpful something any kind of detail,,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,Jazmin yeah,,,,remark,2,1,3
193,Jazmin,"I think I did that, so I don't know why my answers wrong",,,,response,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"let's let's take a look at yours and then we'll go to Luis's um, you said that yes, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water, so you, yes, you did",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher," Awesome you got that right from the passage,",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,but there are some more evidence that can be used and also you said how you can't survive without water,,,130.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"mention a piece of evidence that is in the passage that because it says clearly in the passage um, for example, future astronauts can drink water",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"Which is right, we all know, that's a known fact",,,130.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"But I just want you to go back and look for more specific evidence, because there is more stuff where you can be super super specific so reread the question and go back into the passage",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,but you didn't answer the question,,,130.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher," So you had said that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen, you are right, that is from passage, so you did get that from the password, which is good,",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"Luis, just as you said, you said you understood it, but I still want to give you the feedback",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"So I know I know, so the question said, is there evidence that water can be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"So I want you to so as I just said to Farrah and to all of you, that is, I want you to look for any information details facts that water can be helpful",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"so, as I was just saying to Jazmin she said that for in the future astronauts can",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"drink the water, so that is a fact, but I want you to go back because there is more stuff in there, so I want you to reread the question and then go back in the passage and look for evidence",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher, Chris what's up,,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
193,Chris,I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,420.3,response,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"Really? I didn't know - is that, did you get that from the passage?",,,230.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Chris,"No, no me and my dad have been reading about aviation and we went to NASA and I read that maybe they could put some, a base up there, so it'll make things easier",,,230.2,response,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"yeah so, which is why we this passage is pretty important since we need to know if the water and NASA can be valuable to us",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"so going to you i'll go to you next and then Oliver, I can talk to you",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Chris,"Yeah, yeah",,,110.1,response,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"Chris you said, water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore",,,230.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher, So did you get the part about water being heavy from the passage?,,,230.2,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"Okay, so your answer, you're almost there you're almost there, so you talked- you got stuff from the passage, but there is evidence from the passage that can be used on why it is, so why water can be valuable",,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"I want you to like for everybody else go back and reread because in the small, the first paragraph, is where you got that from",,,120.3,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher," Having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and other things, which is good because it's pretty much what you wrote in your response",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,Where it says water is heavy and it can take up a lot of room on the spacecraft,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,But that it doesn't really explain why water being on the moon would be valuable,,,130.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher, Oliver what's up it's your turn,,,120.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"it's almost there you're almost there, but you just need to reread the question and reread the passage, because there is more information that you can use to include",,,120.1,remark,2,1,3
193,Oliver," But I was listening to what you're telling everybody else, and I think you did help me think about if i'm answering the question and to try to find all the evidence and the answer",,,120.1,response,2,1,3
193,Oliver,"yeah well, I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go",,,120.1,response,2,1,3
193,Teacher,"Yes, so you know to reread the question and then go back to the passage to find the information that the question uses",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
193,Oliver,yeah I think I think I know that that's what I need to do,,,420.3,response,2,1,3
193,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,3
193,Teacher,Bye,,,,remark,2,1,3
194,Teacher," So I want one-- yes, Luis",,,220.1,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher," So today, I heard you read Water on the Moon, is that correct? Anyone? Did everyone read? Yes, OK",,,220.1,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher," So I want to revise our answers because I saw you had an understanding of it but I didn't see that you had a deep, deep understanding",,,220.1,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher, So we're going to try to fix that today,,,220.1,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher,"Hi, everyone",,,220.1,remark,0,0,4
194,Luis, I already know all about space,,,220.1,response,0,0,4
194,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group",,,220.1,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher, So all of us are going to keep learning,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher,So I want Oliver to go first,,,120.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher," You're going to join us, I'm happy for you to join us today",,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher, And I want him to remind me of what his answer was,,,120.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher,"Well, that's OK because we'll all learn-- all of us are learning anyway",,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher, So that's OK if you're in this group,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
194,Oliver, You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,150.1,response,0,0,4
194,Oliver, So I circle the last sentence in the text,,,150.1,response,0,0,4
194,Oliver,"Yeah, sure, OK",,,150.1,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher, These ice deposits are very small,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher,"But I want you to look, I want everyone to look on paragraph 2 where it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher, Do you think that this refers to the question at all?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher, The lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher,Right,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher," OK, now that is correct",,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
194,Oliver,"Well, I'm thinking because you're asking that maybe it does",,,110.2,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,"Yes, so we're-- we're going to look at-- I want everyone to look at the machine it's referencing to",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher, And I want someone to tell me what the machine it's referencing to,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Oliver,The machine is the lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,"Oliver, let's have everyone look first before you share",,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher," Anyone besides-- anyone else? Chris, what did you come up with?",,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
194,Chris,"In that paragraph two, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter",,,130.2,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,So would you think that would be a form of equipment used by NASA?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
194,Chris,"Yeah, because a machine is equipment",,,150.1,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher," So Jazmin, do you want to try?",,,120.1,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher,So I want someone else to answer my question again,,,120.1,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher," Previously, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? And I want someone to revise their answer from last time",,,120.1,remark,0,0,4
194,Jazmin,"Well, I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,120.1,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,"OK, well, if you think your-- if you had the answer, then someone else who didn't have that answer want to try again",,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
194,Jazmin,OK,,,110.1,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,Good job for knowing the answer,,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher," Anyone else want to try? Luis, do you want to go? Yeah, go ahead",,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
194,Luis,So I feel like the answer is lunar orbiter,,,130.2,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,OK now I want you to give me specific detail from the text about why you think it's lunar orbiter,,,230.2,remark,0,0,4
194,Luis," Well, I mean and you told us to look at this paragraph",,,230.2,response,0,0,4
194,Luis, So--,,,230.2,response,0,0,4
194,Luis, So it says that NASA's sent a small machine called a lunar orbit,,,230.2,response,0,0,4
194,Luis,OK,,,230.2,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,What does it do though? So what does the machine do?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Luis,It investigates,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,What does it investigate?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Luis, Ice deposits in a large polar--,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
194,Luis,Lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher, Do you think ice deposits correlate with water by any chance?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher,I want someone else to answer this,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Farrah," Oh, yeah, because ice is just frozen water",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
194,Farrah,"Oh, yeah, right",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,"Yeah, exactly",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher," So going back to what Luis said, the machine looks for ice deposits",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher, So does anyone-- can anyone understand that ice deposit is water they're looking for,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher, Does everyone agree with that?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Oliver," And I didn't even think about the fact that, Oh, yeah, like you said today, and ice and water is the same",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
194,Oliver,"Yeah, I wasn't thinking about that, I was just looking for the word water",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,"So going back to what Luis said again, Luis, if you want to try to finish your statement because you're on the right track that the lunar orbiter is a small machine",,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher, But ice deposits are water,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher, So that's the important part of the reading,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher,"Good point of the storywise, they were looking for ice deposits",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher, But what does it do? To answer the question in context,,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
194,Luis,It look and looks for ice deposits,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,"Yeah, and what are ice deposits?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Luis,Frozen-- frozen water,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
194,Luis," Yeah, frozen water",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,So what is the overall goal with this machine? I want you to say it in one complete sentence for me,,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
194,Luis,OK,,,210.3,response,0,0,4
194,Luis, So the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit,,,210.3,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,Yep,,,110.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Luis,And Ice deposits are frozen water,,,110.4,response,0,0,4

194,Farrah,I'll try,,,120.1,response,0,0,4
194,Farrah, OK,,,120.1,response,0,0,4
194,Farrah, So the lunar orbiter sends-- the lunar orbiter--,,,120.1,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,I want you to look at paragraph 2 again,,,420.3,remark,0,0,4
194,Farrah,OK,,,420.3,response,0,0,4
194,Farrah, NASA sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter--,,,420.3,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,"Just pause for a second, I don't want you to read it, I want you to look at it and then try to interpret that into a sentence like Luis did",,,420.3,remark,0,0,4
194,Farrah, The lunar orbiter-- the lunar orbiter to investigate ice deposits,,,420.3,response,0,0,4
194,Farrah,"OK, OK, OK",,,420.3,response,0,0,4

194,Teacher,"Yup, continue, you're doing good",,,,remark,0,0,4
194,Farrah,OK,,,,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,And what are the ice deposits?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Farrah,They're very small,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
194,Farrah, Oh ice ice deposits are frozen water,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,"Yes , ice deposits are frozen water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher, And so they use that equipment to what?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Farrah,To find them,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
194,Farrah,"To investigate, to investigate",,,,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,To investigate what?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Farrah,The ice deposits,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher, So they're using it to investigate the water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher, Does anyone have any questions about that?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher,The water because the water is the ice deposit,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
194,Oliver,I don't have any questions but I did look at the clock and I see that it's time for us to go to lunch,,,210.4,response,0,0,4

194,Oliver, I wanted to say thank you for really helping me to think more about how to find more evidence in the story to put in my answer,,,,response,0,0,4
194,Oliver,"Oh, you're welcome",,,,response,0,0,4
194,Oliver, So thank you for that,,,,response,0,0,4
194,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher,Bye,,,,remark,0,0,4
194,Teacher,hi everyone so today we're going to be looking at questions from our readings,,,150.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher, Everyone know what I'm talking about?,,,150.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"Yes, good",,,,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"Okay, so our first question is what the equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"now before you share the answers with the class, I want you to independently for one minute circle key words or words that you think are important in the question I want you to circle them and then I want you, in one minute to share back with me what you circled",,,420.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Jazmin,Yeah,,,120.2,response,1,0,4
194,Teacher,Is everyone done?,,,150.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher, Can everyone do that?,,,420.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,Ok so what key words did anyone circle?,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Farrah,I circled equipment and water,,,120.4,response,1,0,4
194,Chris,I circled water and moon,,,,response,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"Okay, what else?",,,120.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,Ok,,,120.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher, What else?,,,120.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Jazmin,I circled equipment,,,120.1,response,1,0,4
194,Teacher," Okay, so the two words that I think are the most important that I heard from was equipment and the second word would be discover",,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,Equipment as well,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,Does anyone know why discover would also be an important word in the question?,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
194,Chris,Because it's an action word?,,,210.2,response,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"It's an action word, yes, because what, what are we doing? What is the question asking?",,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
194,Chris,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?,,,210.2,response,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"So they're trying to discover the water, does everyone agree? So now I want everyone to look at the reading",,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher," Yes, Luis",,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
194,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,210.2,response,1,0,4
194,Teacher," So that's okay, you're going to learn anyways, I appreciate you sharing that",,,150.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"Oh that's Okay, because we're still revising our answers, and I know you had an answer to the questions",,,150.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"So we're going to look at the reading and the first part, and I want you to circle again independently equipment that you see in the reading - equipment listed",,,420.3,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"Ok, everyone's done?",,,150.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"Oliver, you can go first",,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,So I want some people to share what equipment they circled,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Oliver,I circled ah microscope,,,120.4,response,1,0,4
194,Teacher,Microscope,,,110.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher, Ok,,,110.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Farrah,"I circle microscope too, so I don't understand why my answer's wrong",,,110.1,response,1,0,4
194,Teacher,Well it's wrong in a sense that we're going to get to in a moment,,,130.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,I want- before we get into that I want anyone else to share any other equipment they may have circled,,,130.2,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,Anybody else?,,,130.2,remark,1,0,4
194,Jazmin, I circled small machine and Lunar Orbiter,,,130.2,response,1,0,4
194,Jazmin,I circled two,,,130.2,response,1,0,4
194,Teacher, So now we're going to reflect on what Jazmin shared there,,,120.3,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher," Anyone want to read out loud, the first, second sentence of a paragraph about the lunar orbiter",,,120.3,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,So that's correct,,,120.3,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher, So I want everyone to look at lunar orbiter and read the first and second sentence of paragraph two,,,120.3,remark,1,0,4
194,Luis, Ok,,,120.3,response,1,0,4
194,Luis, This lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,120.3,response,1,0,4
194,Luis, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,120.3,response,1,0,4
194,Luis,I'll read it,,,120.3,response,1,0,4
194,Luis, I'll read it,,,120.3,response,1,0,4
194,Teacher,Thank you so much,,,,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher, Does anyone know what ice deposits are?,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"So when we look at the second sentence, we can see ice deposits",,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,Have a guess what is deposits are?,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Oliver,"Oh, maybe like ice? That gets put down somewhere?",,,210.4,response,1,0,4
194,Teacher,Okay,,,130.2,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher, Anyone else anyone else have any guesses?,,,130.2,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,No,,,,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher, So is there any similarity between ice and water? Does anyone know the similarity between ice and water?,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,It's ok,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,Go ahead,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Farrah,Ice is frozen water,,,120.4,response,1,0,4
194,Teacher,Ice is frozen water,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher, That is a type of equipment,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher, So ice so ice and water on the same thing,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher, They're both water just in different forms,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher," So going back to what Jazmin said earlier, NASA a small machine called a lunar orbiter",,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher, Well the microscope is looking for something,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,So going back to Farrah's question before,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher," When you said, why is the microscope the wrong answer",,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher," Go ahead, Chris",,,,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,And I want you,,,,remark,1,0,4
194,Chris,Well i'm sorry to interrupt but it just made me think of something yeah so,,,,response,1,0,4
194,Chris,I went to NASA and so I saw that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and mask and suits,,,,response,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"Yes, yes that's a good point but we're focusing on the equipment they used to find the water",,,130.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,Not what they wear,,,130.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"We're looking for something to find it, but that as a good point, thank you for sharing",,,110.3,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,So I want to get into some small groups really quickly so i'm going to put with Farrah and Oliver,,,130.2,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher," And then Chris Jazmin Luis are going to work together, and I want you to compare and contrast the difference between the Lunar orbiter and microscope",,,130.2,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,So when you look at paragraph two and three you're going to try to see keywords that may make a microscope and lunar orbiter two different types of equipment,,,420.3,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher, Does that make sense? so why don't you do that for one minute,,,420.3,remark,1,0,4
194,Jazmin,Okay um so,,,420.3,response,1,0,4
194,Jazmin,I have a lunar orbiter as my answer,,,,response,1,0,4
194,Luis,Okay yeah I didn't have that one,,,,response,1,0,4
194,Chris, The water they found is microscopic you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,1,0,4
194,Chris, Okay so that's pretty much easy you know you use a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,1,0,4
194,Chris,i'll look at all the paragraph three again,,,,response,1,0,4
194,Luis,"Okay, and then for the Lunar orbiter thing it says the lunar orbiter will look for ice deposits so they're both looking for things",,,,response,1,0,4
194,Jazmin,"Okay, and well, it says that the Lunar orbiter Okay, so they both look for things and it says that the Lunar orbiter",,,,response,1,0,4
194,Jazmin,looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,,response,1,0,4
194,Jazmin,And the microscope looks really closely at water,,,,response,1,0,4
194,Jazmin, I mean I guess that's different except it's also the same,,,,response,1,0,4
194,Teacher, Come back into group,,,150.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"Okay, so I want everyone to come back to class for a second",,,150.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"I noticed from your small groups that you guys are talking about, you guys are looking",,,150.1,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"But the way it's written in paragraph two, they first use a lunar orbiter to look for the water, then they use a microscope",,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,I want you guys to think for a second in your head about why they would use a lunar orbiter before they would use a microscope,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,  I want you to think,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,Go ahead Oliver,,,,remark,1,0,4
194,Oliver,i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but it's time for us to go so,,,,response,1,0,4
194,Oliver,"Okay, love to finish later",,,,response,1,0,4
194,Teacher,"Okay, thank you",,,,remark,1,0,4
194,Teacher,hi everyone so today we're going to be revising our answers from the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,220.1,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher," So first before we share our answers with the class, I want you to independently for one minute look at the question",,,220.1,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,"Everyone had a good understanding of the reading, but I do want to work out answers just a little bit, because I think we're getting a little confused between two big aspects",,,220.1,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,2,0,4
194,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group",,,,response,2,0,4
194,Luis,I already know all about space,,,,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher," It's okay, you can be in our group",,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,that's okay Luis because we're revising our answers and we're all learning today,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher, So I appreciate you sharing that,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher, I want to do that for one minute and then come back,,,420.1,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,"So, looking back at the first question I want you to independently for one minute I want you to circle any key words or important words that you see in the question that you think are important",,,420.1,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,Does anyone want to share what words they circled?,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,Farrah you can go first,,,,remark,2,0,4
194,Farrah,I circled equipment and water,,,,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher," Oliver, what did you circle?",,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,Okay,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
194,Oliver, I circled equipment and water,,,210.3,response,2,0,4
194,Oliver,I circled the same thing,,,210.3,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher,Okay anyone else? any other words?,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,2,0,4
194,Jazmin,"Well, okay, I guess it's the same thing",,,,response,2,0,4
194,Jazmin, I circled equipment,,,,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher, What did you circle?,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,You only circled water,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher, What about you Luis you're one who hasn't shared yet,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
194,Luis,I circled equipment and the moon,,,210.3,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher,"Okay okay So yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,2,0,4
194,Jazmin,"I forgot, I thought that I only circled equipment, but I actually circled equipment and scientists",,,,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,"All of these answers are correct, but I want to look at the word equipment and the second one, I noticed no one circled was discover",,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher, Does anyone know why discover would be an important word in the question?,,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher," Excuse me, sorry I was confusing",,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,"Because it's an action word, because the scientists are discovering water, but how does -sorry discovering it",,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher, That's the action word,,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,"So now, what I want you to do so, I want you to look at the reading",,,,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,"and looking at the reading I want you to circle, the moon is a desert, and we're looking at the reading the moon is a desert",,,,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,And I want you to circle any important equipment that you see in the reading,,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,I want you to do this with a with a small group,,,130.2,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher," So Farrah and Oliver can do it together and Chris Jazmin Luis can also be a small group, and I want you to circle any equipment, you see, in the reading, that you think is important, and then I want you come back in one minute",,,130.2,remark,2,0,4
194,Jazmin,Okay um So the first one that I see is the small machine,,,130.2,response,2,0,4
194,Jazmin,"teacher, I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher,"i'm not saying any answer's wrong right now, I just want you to collaborate with your peers because they all have different answers then you",,,130.2,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher," So I want you to collaborate with them, okay? Thank you for the question",,,130.2,remark,2,0,4
194,Jazmin,"Ok, all, what do you see",,,130.2,response,2,0,4
194,Farrah,"Ok well, Oliver, I see a small machine, that's equipment",,,,response,2,0,4
194,Oliver,Okay i'll circle that one,,,,response,2,0,4
194,Chris,Ok guys I'm going to circle small machine like Jazmin said,,,,response,2,0,4
194,Luis,they've got microscope in here that's equipment,,,,response,2,0,4
194,Jazmin,Okay i'll circle that too,,,,response,2,0,4
194,Luis,REach Every Reader: Okay we're done,,,,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher,Ok you're done,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher," Does anyone know the difference between these two types of equipment? Anything, any guesses is fine, from what you see in the reading",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher, The first word was microscope and the second was the small machine,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher," So, from what i've heard from you guys, you guys circled two words",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher," Luis, go ahead",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Luis,"yeah well, I mean, I think that microscope is like small",,,210.4,response,2,0,4
194,Luis,Well a small machine could be small too,,,,response,2,0,4
194,Luis,Ok then they're the same,,,,response,2,0,4
194,Luis," Well, they could be the same",,,,response,2,0,4
194,Luis,They could be the same,,,,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher," I want you to look at the reading, I want you to think why they might be different, it might help you",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,"Does anyone know why they might be different? Luis's on the right track, but does anyone know why they might be different? Look at the reading",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Farrah,"Well, no, it says on the small machine is called a lunar orbiter",,,210.4,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher, What about anything else? anyone else noticed anything in the reading?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,That is correct,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Chris,It said that the lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits,,,210.4,response,2,0,4
194,Chris,"You know what, teacher, I was, I went to NASA and I know that scientists used a whole bunch of equipment like oxygen tanks, and masks, and suits",,,,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher,But Chris you're on the right track with finding ice deposits,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,"Yeah that is correct, but that's what they wear",,,410.1,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher, We're looking at when they used to find the water,,,410.1,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher, Does anyone know the similarity between ice deposits and water?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Jazmin,Ice is frozen water,,,210.4,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher," And ice ice and water are the same thing, because they're both water",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher, And from what we know in the reading that the small machine called the lunar orbiter is finding ice deposits which are really -what are they really?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,Ice is frozen water,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Oliver,they're really small,,,210.4,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher,They're really small,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher," What else are they? what are the ice deposits, what did we just say?",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Oliver, They're water,,,210.4,response,2,0,4
194,Oliver,"Oh, they're water",,,210.4,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher,So the lunar orbiter is finding what?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher," So do you think - does that make any sense? So what is the microscope, what does the microscope do?",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,We're funding water,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Luis,"We use the microscope you know, to look at really small things in science class",,,210.4,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher,So what are we using the microscope in this reading? what are they using the microscope for in this reading?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Farrah,I wrote this one in my answer,,,210.4,response,2,0,4
194,Farrah, They're using the microscope to look really closely at the water,,,210.4,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher,"At the water, that's right Farrah",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher, So they already found the water when they use the microscope,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher, So the microscope isn't the right answer because the water's already been found before they use the microscope,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher, So if you have any questions about that,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,If you don't understand why the microscope would be the wrong answer,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,"No, so no So what are they using the find the water?",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
194,Oliver,they're using the lunar orbiter to find the water,,,210.4,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher,So what is the answer to our question?,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher,You just said it,,,,remark,2,0,4
194,Oliver,Scientists used the Lunar orbiter to find water on the moon,,,,response,2,0,4
194,Teacher,"That is, that is correct",,,130.3,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher," So the reason why we did this was because people were thinking, the microscope is what we were using to find the water, but in reality it was because we're using the small machine, the Lunar orbiter to find water",,,130.3,remark,2,0,4
194,Teacher, Does anyone have any questions about that?,,,130.3,remark,2,0,4
194,Oliver,"No, no, and I, I was, I just want to say aw thanks teacher, it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch",,,130.3,response,2,0,4
194,Oliver,But I wanted to thank you,,,,response,2,0,4
194,Oliver,"For when you when you kind of helped us keep looking at the story and thinking about what the meanings of the words are, I think that kind of helped me to think about the answer",,,,response,2,0,4
194,Oliver,Okay bye,,,,response,2,0,4
195,Teacher,"Hey everyone, I'm so I just heard your great responses",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, So can we work together to do that,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher," But we, there's a couple pieces were missing",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, I just wanted to touch base and maybe see if we can get a deeper understanding,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, Yeah,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, We have a great start,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Luis,"Yes, excuse me",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
195,Luis,"I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,3
195,Teacher," I saw that maybe we could all help each other, get a deeper understanding of space",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,"Okay, well I pulled you aside because me as the teacher",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Luis,Okay,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
195,Teacher,That makes sense,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3

195,Teacher,"So Farrah, would you mind if I started with yours",,,,remark,0,1,3
195,Farrah,"No, I don't like",,,,response,0,1,3
195,Teacher, So you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look more closely,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,All right,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher," So you said, I know what equipment you need you need a microscope to look really closely, you had the what and the why",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,That's right,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher," You picked up wonderfully in the part where they asked what equipment, you would need",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,"One part you were missing, though, is",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, So what were they looking at closely,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,What they were looking at,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Farrah,Water,,,410.2,response,0,1,3

195,Teacher, That makes sense,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,Could really just push through your answer,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Farrah,So I just got to add at the water all my all my sentence,,,420.2,response,0,1,3
195,Teacher,"Um,",,,,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,"Yes, so",,,,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, The second piece,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, So you had part of the what you just needed,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,"Just make sure when you're writing answers like this, you need to be very clear about the what and the why",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Farrah,Okay,,,420.2,response,0,1,3
195,Teacher,"And Oliver, you said you circled the same as Farrah",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3

195,Oliver, I'm an animal story and I I circled the last sentence and the story to,,,230.1,response,0,1,3
195,Oliver,When she read her answer,,,230.1,response,0,1,3
195,Teacher,Why did you circle the last sentence?,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Oliver,On cars,,,230.1,response,0,1,3
195,Oliver," Of course, we use it in science class",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
195,Oliver," Well, though the question asked about equipment and so I was looking for, like, an equipment and and I saw the microscope, and I know that that's equipment",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
195,Teacher," But I also want to make sure that you're getting an understanding for what you're eating as well, not just looking to answer the questions",,,410.3,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,"Okay, so you're coming from the right, you're coming from the right intention of your reading",,,410.3,remark,0,1,3

195,Teacher,"All right, so",,,,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,It's okay,,,,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,So you said NASA send a small machine,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,What was the machine called,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,look back to the reading,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Jazmin,The Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
195,Teacher,"Right, so",,,,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,And do you know why based on the reading,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, They sent the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,"So,",,,,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,They sent,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, What were they looking for,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,A lunar orbiter to look for something in the craters,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Jazmin,Deposits to look for ice deposit and a large crater,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
195,Teacher, You don't necessarily have to take the whole paragraph you read,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,Right,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher," So when we're answering questions like this, you need to have the specifics",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,"Chris, can you one minute, I'm almost done with Jazmin",,,,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,And I'll get right with you,,,,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, Okay,,,,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, You need to be able to,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,"So, Jazmin when you're looking at these answers",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, So you got that you got you got the equipment,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,Look at the what they're asking for,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,"Next time, just make sure if it has a name include the name",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,So like the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, OK,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,OK,,,,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,"OK, so",,,,remark,0,1,3
195,Jazmin,Just at the name,,,,response,0,1,3
195,Teacher, So why did you need to add more to your answer for to describe with lunar orbiter did,,,530.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,Of the name right so now I given you an example of what you need to add to your answer,,,530.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, Can you help me figure out the why,,,530.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Jazmin,"You say,",,,530.1,response,0,1,3

195,Teacher,"Chris, thank you for patiently waiting",,,,remark,0,1,3
195,Chris,No problem,,,,response,0,1,3
195,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and lots of other stuff to,,,,response,0,1,3
195,Chris, I just wanted to tell you that I went to NASA,,,,response,0,1,3
195,Teacher,They do use a lot of other stuff like that,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher," Um, so your answer",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, You said scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,"So,",,,,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,"You had what they discovered, but can you help me",,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, Look for examples of how they discovered it in the reading and you may use some examples that Jazmin or Farrah and Oliver had but let's let's figure it out together,,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
195,Chris,"I mean, I know Jazmin said something about a lunar orbiter",,,420.3,response,0,1,3
195,Teacher,Why don't we look at the reading Chris,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, Okay,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, Let's look at the reading together,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,So what does it say in the second paragraph,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Chris, these ice deposits are very small,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
195,Chris, this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
195,Chris, and look for ice deposits in a large pool of crater,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
195,Chris,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
195,Chris, scientists say one of the top layer of the moon surface will hold in total about 32 ounces of water,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
195,Teacher,That's good,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, So looking back in that,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,Thank you for reading that,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, What did you find what kind of equipment,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher, It was very helpful,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
195,Teacher,Yes Oliver,,,,remark,0,1,3
195,Oliver," Um, I know it was a really short time, but I did appreciate how are you, you asked us to a look more at the text to add more evidence from the text tool to our answers",,,,response,0,1,3
195,Oliver, I'm teacher,,,,response,0,1,3
195,Oliver,I'm sorry to interrupt,,,,response,0,1,3
195,Oliver, I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch,,,,response,0,1,3

196,Teacher,Can you guys hear me,,,,remark,1,0,1
196,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: Yes,,,,response,1,0,1
196,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, can you hear us",,,,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,Now I can yeah,,,,remark,1,0,1
196,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: Great we're excited to work with you today,,,,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,i'm excited to work with you,,,,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"So we're going to focus on the question, what do a quick what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes Luis",,,120.2,remark,1,0,1
196,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: i'm excuse me, I should be and best group I already know all about space",,,120.2,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,Oh that's awesome we're going to really dive into this material and you're probably going to learn something you didn't already know you knew so we're going to still stay in this group and work together,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,and then by the end you probably could teach me something about space,,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
196,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah sounds good,,,150.1,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,you can look over what you have and then we're going to come back together and we're going to answer the question,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"Alright perfect so i'll give you guys a second, if you want to read the first three paragraphs just read",,,120.3,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"If you guys have any questions at any point, you can just raise your hand and I can answer",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"All right, perfect which student wants to speak out first about what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon Jazmin",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
196,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: I said NASA centers small machine,,,120.4,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"Okay, so what made you say that, why did you say that",,,230.1,remark,1,0,1
196,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: Well, I said because there's a sentence at the beginning of Part two that says that",,,230.1,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"awesome so I see what you did,",,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"and that was great to use the reading, to help us with our answer",,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"So if you keep reading that sentence, why did NASA send that to the moon, what about it, what about the water did that did they need to send something to the moon for do you know why",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,But we need to be a little more detailed,,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
196,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: They needed it to investigate the craters,,,420.2,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"They did so we're going to look at the next paragraph after that paragraph three, it says that means the moon, is still drier than the driest desert on earth",,,110.1,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely Farrah,,,120.3,remark,1,0,1
196,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: um yeah so I sent a microscope That was my answer um so I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,120.3,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,So your answers not wrong,,,110.2,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"but we it's not complete so there's a little bit more that we need to add to your answer to make it complete you're almost there, but we just need to make it a little bit big, we need to make it a little bit more detail",,,430.2,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,That makes sense?,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
196,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah,,,150.1,response,1,0,1
196,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: I just don't know what to add,,,,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"yeah So what did you said, your answer was what can you tell me again",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
196,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: yeah My answer is, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.4,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"but we can add a little bit more so, we could say NASA send a small machine called a what does anyone know what that what it's called that they sign",,,130.3,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"awesome so that's what it says in the text, which is great that we used our resources,",,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,Do you guys know what did NASA send to help investigate Jazmin,,,130.2,remark,1,0,1
196,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: They sent the small machine,,,130.2,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,yeah What was it called,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
196,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: I know,,,210.3,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,Who was that Luis what is it called,,,120.2,remark,1,0,1
196,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: lunar orbiter,,,120.2,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,what do we know about the water can you see it with your eyes,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"Perfect so NASA send an lunar orbiter to investigate and they needed that they were using that to help discover the water on the moon,",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
196,Luis,"RER: No, it's too small",,,210.4,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"right it's too small, so they needed to use a tool called a microscope to view it",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"so Farrah you have one part and Jazmin had the other part, and we need to add it together",,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,So can someone new share out what our new sentence could be that helps answer this question in a lot of detail,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,1,0,1
196,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: i'll try,,,,response,1,0,1
196,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: Okay um so for the equipment the scientists used the machine called the Lunar orbiter and a microscope,,,,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"awesome So yes, that included the important details",,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,I Chris,,,,remark,1,0,1
196,Chris,"Agile Teacher Lab: Well, so I I went to NASA",,,,response,1,0,1
196,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"Your that is so true that's so true, but it doesn't answer our question for this one, so, while they do use those equipment, that's not what we're looking for for this question",,,410.1,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"For this question we're talking about what equipment, did they use to help discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"So you guys now that we've gone over this again and really dove into this material and answered the question and looked at it in different views, can you guys understand, do you guys understand what was used what scientists used Luis",,,120.2,remark,1,0,1
196,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: i'm sorry yeah I mean they use the orbiter and they use a microscope, but I also know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for water and definitely using oxygen tanks, so I think Chris's right",,,120.2,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"No okay well see I told you we're going to teach me something about space that I didn't know and there, it is nice job",,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
196,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: So, we could say, like all of the equipment for the answer",,,110.3,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"You could say, can you explain what you mean",,,230.1,remark,1,0,1
196,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah so I could say lunar orbiter and microscope and oxygen tanks and masks on suits,,,230.1,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"So yes, they did use masks and suits and oxygen tanks, but to discover water on the moon remember what they used",,,120.2,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,So while oxygen tank and a mask and suits are part of the equipment they use for this question we're only focusing on what they use to discover water on the moon,,,410.1,remark,1,0,1
196,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: just the orbiter, and the microscope",,,410.1,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,microscope yep that's right,,,110.2,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,"So do you see how they're a little different so while they did use the things that we talked about suits and mass and oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon, they only use a lunar orbiter and a microscope",,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
196,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: i'm really sorry but we have to go now,,,210.3,response,1,0,1
196,Teacher,Okay perfect thanks for working with me I enjoyed our time together,,,,remark,1,0,1
196,Teacher,You guys,,,,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"know what we're gonna do is we're going to focus on the question i'm sorry I lost it is there, convincing evidence that water is on what on the moon could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"So before we share our responses and possibly revise and change them, I want you guys to reread and look at the paragraph four, five and six in your reading once you guys are done, we can look at, we can keep going with this lesson",,,120.3,remark,2,0,1
196,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: um excuse me,,,120.3,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,yeah Luis,,,,remark,2,0,1
196,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: um I think I got this all figured out saw on God,,,,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"Oh well, I really want to work with you because I want to hear how what your answer is, and I want to know what we can do to make it even better",,,220.1,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"So i'm going to ask you to look at i'm going to have you told me your answer,",,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,Teacher:but then I also want you to tell me the evidence that you have that makes you that made you come up with this quick answer,,,230.1,remark,2,0,1
196,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, you want me to say it now",,,120.4,response,2,0,1
196,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay um My answer is water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen, and that is right from the story",,,,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"Listen, can you show me where you found that can you tell me where you",,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
196,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: Paragraph five,,,230.2,response,2,0,1
196,Luis,Agile: oxygen hydrogen can also be used,,,,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"Okay, so I see where you're coming from but let's think about this a little differently we're trying to see is there convincing evidence that could it be valuable Do you know what the word valuable means",,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
196,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: Like important,,,210.2,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"What useful important so saying that it can be split into hydrogen and oxygen is true, but it doesn't totally answer this question so",,,410.1,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,and then we're going to come back together and figure out a really strong answer as a group that answers the question completely sound good,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"What I want you guys to do is to look at that reading, one more time",,,120.3,remark,2,0,1
196,Luis,Okay,,,120.3,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"Perfect alright can one of my friends tell me in the first paragraph, in paragraph four in that sentence there's something that tells us about why the water having it there could be important Can someone tell me why it could be valuable that the water is already on the moon",,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,2,0,1
196,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: Oh well, and they drink",,,,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"They could drink it yeah so if astronauts right now it's something about the water there, what do we know, is the water light or heavy",,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,2,0,1
196,Chris,"Agile Teacher Lab: On it's heavy and that was my answer Oh, they don't have to carry the heavy water in the ships if it's already on the moon",,,,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,Exactly so that's one of our possible answers that could be one reason why it could be valuable is that it's heavy so if it's already there they already have access to it and they don't need to worry about bringing it to the moon Farrah,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,2,0,1
196,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: I i'm kind of confused,,,,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,yeah what are you confused about telling me,,,230.1,remark,2,0,1
196,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: Well, my answer is that i'm there it's not ready it won't be ready for a long time",,,230.1,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,What won't be ready,,,230.1,remark,2,0,1
196,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: The water on the moon,,,230.1,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"So be ready what made you choose that answer, can you tell me the evidence that you had from the book that made you think that",,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
196,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: yeah um so like the last part of part six it says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money, so I don't think it's that valuable",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"You don't think it's valuable, so I see where you're coming from because it does say right here that making a plan will take a lot of time and money,",,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,but that doesn't mean that it's not valuable it just might take some extra time and work so,,,,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"If you look at what the positives are it might outweigh the time that it takes, so it is possible for water to be valuable on the moon  so Farrah can you look back at your text and find me one piece of evidence that tells us why it is a good thing if there's water on the moon",,,430.3,remark,2,0,1
196,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, oh",,,430.3,response,2,0,1
196,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay um Oh well, this is interesting Okay, the moon can serve as a stop as crafts to refill their gas tanks",,,,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"that's true, but how does that relate to water",,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
196,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: I don't I don't know,,,210.3,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"so Farrah I want you to read this paragraph and the fourth the fourth paragraph I want you to read it right here, and it says i'm",,,,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"It doesn't totally relate to water, but that is a really cool fact",,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"In the last sentence, can you read that last sentence and tell me in paragraph four, and tell me what that sentence means to us, so why do we know that",,,,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,Can you read that,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
196,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: i'm having water on the moon, would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things",,,210.4,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"Exactly So what does that mean, how is that valuable",,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
196,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: well,,,210.3,response,2,0,1
196,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: It could bring more astronauts,,,,response,2,0,1
196,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: They don't have to,,,,response,2,0,1
196,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: Put the water on the ship,,,,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,That is Farrah and we know that water is heavy so if there's less space for water than we can bring more people that's awesome a Oliver,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
196,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: um well I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,230.3,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,Did you read that in the article,,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
196,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: I read it online and well if there's water on the moon, it sounds really believable but there could be a base there in three years",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,that's really cool I appreciate you telling us and teaching the rest of our students that fact that's a really cool fact,,,110.3,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"Alright, my friends let's look at the last sentence, it says",,,,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"let's look at the last sentence, because I like what Farrah brought up making this plan will take a lot of time and money",,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"So, knowing that we could have more people on the spacecraft knowing that water is really heavy and knowing that water um and knowing that it's already there, so people could drink it do you guys think that it's valuable that there could be water there",,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
196,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,2,0,1
196,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: Yes, I think it's valuable because you can't survive without water and that's very valuable",,,,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,yep 100% true Luis,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
196,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: um yeah I, I also think it's valuable because if you split the water like I said i'm",,,110.1,response,2,0,1
196,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: astronauts can I can breathe the oxygen,,,,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,awesome Chris,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
196,Chris,"Agile Teacher Lab: You yeah yeah it's valuable, I think, having more money, the spacecraft's definitely valuable",,,110.1,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,Perfect so now that we've taken the oh yes,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
196,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: um well I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch now,,,110.1,response,2,0,1
196,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: What I want to say thank you so much for giving every one of us, the space to share our responses and opinions it really felt like you cared what we had to say and some teachers don't make us feel like that, so thank you so much",,,,response,2,0,1
196,Teacher,"Of course, thank you",,,,remark,2,0,1
197,Teacher,"Hi guys, so I liked hearing your responses about the water on the moon text, but I brought us all together, just because some of us",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,1,3
197,Luis," I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,3
197,Luis,I'm sorry to interrupt,,,,response,0,1,3
197,Luis, Excuse me,,,,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher, So I think that we all have a reason to be here together,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"Well, we're all here together because we're going to deepen our deepen our understanding of what we thought of the text",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher," So, just listen to what I have to say, please",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
197,Luis, Okay,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
197,Luis,All right,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,Farrah,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher, So I really liked your response,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher, You said that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher, And do you remember what we were looking really closely at?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Farrah,Water,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher," And Oliver, I noticed that you said that you circled the same as Farrah",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"Yeah, that's great",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,So this was an activity where I kind of wanted you guys to discuss the question of what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher, I really want to hear,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,Could you tell me what you think,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,So I didn't,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher," I really wanted to hear your personal thinking and what you thought to answer the question, not the same as Farrah",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
197,Oliver,"Yeah, cuz you asked her for her answer first and she circled the same thing that I did have I circled the last sentence which says arm YOU NEED A SCIENTIFIC POLL ON A microscope to look really closely",,,410.2,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"Yeah, so I just wanted what do you know what the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon was?",,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
197,Oliver," It's not the microscope, but I thought it was the microscope",,,120.2,response,0,1,3
197,Oliver, But I guess since we're in this group,,,120.2,response,0,1,3
197,Oliver,I think it's the microscope,,,120.2,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,So the microscope really did help it helps you see something really tiny,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher," And if you remember in the reading, we learned that they discovered that there was water on the moon, but it was so small that they had to use a microscope to see it",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Oliver,Okay,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,Do you understand?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
197,Oliver, We're so small they have to use a microscope to see it,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
197,Oliver,By water,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"Yeah, perfect",,,,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"And Chris, I also really liked your response",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher, But do you remember what the scientists used to find in the craters to find the craters,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Chris,What do they use to find the craters,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,0,1,3
197,Chris," I mean, I know a lot about space, but I don't know that",,,,response,0,1,3
197,Chris,"No, I don't know",,,,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,Does anybody in the group remember reading about what they use to find the craters,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
197,Jazmin, I don't know why my answer is wrong,,,130.2,response,0,1,3
197,Jazmin,"Well, I put in my answer that NASA sent a small machine",,,130.2,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,Does anybody remember hearing the Lunar Orbiter,,,,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,All right,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher," So yeah, you're right",,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher," They did send a small machine, but just so everybody knows the small machine that NASA son was the Lunar Orbiter",,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
197,Jazmin,"Oh yeah, I read that part too",,,,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"Yeah, so the lunar orbiter was small machine that was sent from NASA to help discover the craters on the moon",,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,And Luis I also noticed that you have to be did your background knowledge by referencing that they use oxygen tanks on the moon,,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"I knew you were using your background knowledge because in the reading, we read, we didn't read anything about oxygen tanks, but you knew that when you're on the Loon",,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher," You need to have oxygen to be able to breathe, right?",,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
197,Luis,Yeah yeah,,,310.1,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,So can you think of any of the equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Luis," Um, I think that that's probably the equipment",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
197,Luis, The thing that they said,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
197,Luis, I don't know,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
197,Luis,"I'm on the thing that I'm like Jazmin said, or maybe that you said are Chris your set",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"Do you want to add Jazmin, what was the equipment that you had said that may be Luis's thinking about?",,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
197,Jazmin,It was lunar orbiter,,,130.2,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"Yeah, and",,,,remark,0,1,3
197,Oliver,"I, yeah, yeah",,,,response,0,1,3
197,Oliver, So that was it,,,,response,0,1,3

197,Teacher, And do you remember what the lunar orbiter did?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Oliver,"Um, it's a center",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,Yeah,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
197,Oliver,"So, it flies flies through space",,,110.1,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,Does anybody want to help out Luis and tell him what the lunar orbiter was,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"Jazmin, maybe?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,Chris?,,,,remark,0,1,3
197,Jazmin,"And oh gosh, I don't even remember what the question was now",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,We're just trying to help,,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher, Luis remember what the lunar orbiter was,,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
197,Jazmin,"Okay Luis It says, NASA send the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,120.2,response,0,1,3
197,Jazmin,So it was a small machine that investigates,,,,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"And what did it and what wasn't looking for, Anybody remember that one?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Farrah,"Oh, ice deposit,  it's it's looking for ice deposit",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"Yeah, perfect",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"So Luis, just go back",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher, So the lunar orbiter was used,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,You understand?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher, It was a small machine sent by NASA to look for ice deposits and craters,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
197,Chris," So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots, um, lots and lots of different equipment",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
197,Luis,"Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it",,,,response,0,1,3
197,Chris,"Oh, I, I went to NASA",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher, Don't you?,,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"Yeah, you need a lot of different equipment to be able to go into outer space",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
197,Chris,Yeah yeah,,,230.3,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"Yeah, so you know what equipment, the scientists used to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher," Oh yeah, Chris",,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
197,Chris,"Hey, I'm sorry",,,120.2,response,0,1,3

197,Teacher,Are you sure you're all set?,,,,remark,0,1,3
197,Chris,Yeah,,,,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,"Alright, so does anybody have any confusion about what equipment, the scientists used to discover water on the moon?",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,No?,,,,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,1,3
197,Teacher, Oliver,,,,remark,0,1,3
197,Oliver," Um, I know this was short and we just met, but I really appreciate how you help us look for evidence from the text in our answers",,,,response,0,1,3
197,Oliver, I don't have confusion,,,,response,0,1,3
197,Oliver,I don't have,,,,response,0,1,3
197,Oliver, But I was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch,,,,response,0,1,3
197,Teacher,Start stimulation,,,,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,hi guys,,,,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"So we're talking about how we just read the moon, is a desert, and I know that, yes, Luis",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,150.1,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"we're going to learn, even more so i'm sure you're in the right place",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,So so so Oliver I noticed that you said that you circled the same as Farrah,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Oliver,"yeah so she went first I figure I don't have to say, the exact same thing as her because I found that same answer",,,110.1,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"So, my concern is is that you're not you're not understanding completely by yourself, you know that Farrah circle, the same one as you",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,And she went first and you're telling me that that's why you circled it but can you tell me why you what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Oliver,yeah sure I have the same answer as her because I I think it's the microscope,,,230.1,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,You think it's the microscope,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,So sorry,,,,remark,1,1,3
197,Oliver,yeah yeah I do,,,,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,You understand why it's a microscope,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Oliver,uh huh because,,,150.1,response,1,1,3
197,Oliver,looks like the teacher went offline so we'll wait a moment,,,,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"Sorry, could you just repeat what you were saying",,,,remark,1,1,3
197,Oliver,"yeah sure, so I was saying that I do think the microscope is right, because it says i'm a water they found us microscopic blah blah blah blah, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"So I can see why you think that microscope is important, and I agree to the microscope is very important, with discovering water on the moon",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"But I do think that there's one thing that's just a little bit more important because it's the machine that was used to discover the water on the moon, if you want to look in paragraph two, and maybe scan it and tell me if you see anything that talks about the machine used",,,430.3,remark,1,1,3
197,Jazmin,"Teacher, I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,430.3,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,i'll get right to you in just a minute,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Oliver,"Okay, I see your machine called the Lunar orbiter",,,110.1,response,1,1,3
197,Oliver,They don't say anything about that one off finding water,,,,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"So maybe I told, let me just backtrack really quick",,,,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"So what it's really having us do here Oliver is it's having us infer that they use the Lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon, so I can see why you are confused, but am I helping you clear this up at all, but the Lunar orbiter help discover the water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
197,Oliver,"Okay, so I read a thing right and i'm I see where it says that it was looking for ice deposits I",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
197,Oliver,hold in total 32 ounces of water,,,,response,1,1,3
197,Oliver,"I mean, they say, but it could hold water but they don't actually talk about water in the first part",,,,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,so at this point we're just trying to figure out what we what what what machine was used to investigate if there was water,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,it's the water so microscopic that it's still drier than the desert,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,So i'm just trying to get the answer of what equipment started is used to discover the water itself,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
197,Jazmin,"Thats why I think mine is right teacher, because I mean they did use that one, and I think it that it was the ice is water so when they were looking for ice deposit they were looking for water",,,210.2,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"yeah so Jazmin and I remember your answer was that NASA sent a small machine, so I can I I wanna I wanna I noticed that you",,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"That you said you know that it's a small machine, they said, but can you tell me anything more about it, like what did you find interesting about it, maybe the name of the machine",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
197,Jazmin,"Oh, oh yeah the name is a lunar orbiter",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,yeah so my suggestion to you in the future is just to remember those key words because those key words like the Lunar orbiter that's an important thing to know for our vocabulary in the future in this lesson,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"And then I want to talk, I also wanted to talk to Luis, you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,So,,,,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,Can I just ask you what made you say that,,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Luis, So boom oxygen tanks,,,230.1,response,1,1,3
197,Luis,"RER: I know a lot about space, astronauts can't breathe up there",,,230.1,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"Yes, I see how you connected your background knowledge to the text for reading right now, but my only concern is is that you didn't answer the question that I originally asked",,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and do you think that scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon",,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Luis,"Oh um yeah no, I guess, they don't use that to discover water",,,410.1,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,So what do you think that the scientists used to discover water on the moon?,,,120.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"Okay, let me see maybe we could think back to the first reading",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
197,Luis,Oh okay yeah I see Jazmin why you said you didn't know why yours was wrong place yeah cause ice deposits is water,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,deposits well ice the ice has to it if we are well meaning one so but,,,,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,yeah a Jazmin is responsive originally was NASA send a small machine so she was able to gather that NASA did send a small machine,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,And that's why me and Jazmin just spoke a little bit longer just to make sure Jazmin understood what the name of the machine was i'm just trying to so Luis Do you understand what the name of the machine was and what it did,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Luis,yeah the Lunar orbiter,,,150.1,response,1,1,3
197,Luis,yeah perfect and I looked for ice deposits,,,,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"perfect and now Chris, I also wanted to talk to you, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,So I want to i'm I just want to wonder what made you say that,,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Chris,"was looking for the keywords like how you said to Jazmin you know from the question because it talked about the question was asking about water on the moon so then in that first paragraph, I saw that it was also talking about water on the moon",,,230.1,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"Okay, so I see how you did connect but you were you were kind of scanning the page for the words that connected to water, because the question was about finding water on the moon",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"But i'm just concerned that you are understanding the full question itself, because the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so my suggestion sorry",,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Chris,I was just gonna say that I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,410.1,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"And it's awesome you have that background knowledge, because you can later apply it, and you can pull that in the back of your mind",,,410.3,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,But right now we're talking about this one question and my only suggestion my suggestion for you is,,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"Is you told me before that what you did was you read you notice that the word water was in the question, so you scan through and you looked for things that related with water",,,510.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"My suggestion would be to go through and look for equipment, like me and then we'd be able to find what machine was used",,,420.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Chris,"Okay, so different a different key word from the question",,,420.1,response,1,1,3
197,Teacher,yeah maybe look for equipment like different pieces of equipment,,,420.1,remark,1,1,3
197,Teacher,"machine, maybe",,,,remark,1,1,3

198,Teacher,def,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
198,Teacher,Microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it,,,120.3,remark,0,0,4
198,Teacher, Can you tell me if they use any equipment in that quote,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
198,Teacher," If you were looking straight at it, you need to scientific tool called the Microsoft look very close",,,120.3,remark,0,0,4
198,Oliver, Cause that was my answer was a microscope,,,120.3,response,0,0,4
198,Oliver, Yeah,,,120.3,response,0,0,4
198,Oliver,"Know, you'll be used the um the microscope",,,120.3,response,0,0,4
198,Teacher,Can you explain to me how the scientists use it to look for water maybe,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
198,Oliver," And I said, you may use a microscope to look really closely at the water",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
198,Oliver, Yeah,,,210.4,response,0,0,4

198,Luis," Okay, I was kind of spacing out for a second there",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
198,Oliver,"I said, but they use a microscope to look really closely at the water",,,,response,0,0,4
198,Luis,"Well, I mean you do use a microscope to look at things, but I don't know why they would bring a microscope, all the way up into space",,,,response,0,0,4
198,Luis, I don't know about that one,,,,response,0,0,4
198,Luis, I think I don't know,,,,response,0,0,4
198,Luis," I mean, they usually use a microscope when they get back down or on their space shuttle or something",,,,response,0,0,4
198,Teacher,I believe the microscope is attached to the lunar orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
198,Luis," Oh, I'm, I'm all okay I don't know",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
198,Luis,Right,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
198,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,0,0,4
198,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like,,,,response,0,0,4
198,Chris,I went to NASA,,,,response,0,0,4
198,Chris,oxygen tanks masks and suits,,,,response,0,0,4
198,Teacher,"Yeah, has anyone else seen anything from NASA, you can reach",,,140.1,remark,0,0,4
198,Teacher,Out,,,,remark,0,0,4
198,Teacher,so Luis has as well,,,140.1,remark,0,0,4
198,Teacher," Yeah, yeah",,,140.1,remark,0,0,4
198,Luis,"Well, I didn't go to NASA, but I did, um, I've seen that in box",,,140.1,response,0,0,4
198,Luis, Yeah,,,140.1,response,0,0,4
198,Teacher,"Did you see the lunar orbiter or Microsoft that was referenced, you can answer that Chris as well",,,210.1,remark,0,0,4
198,Chris," I don't remember exactly the name of it, um,",,,210.1,response,0,0,4
198,Chris,And we didn't see the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.1,response,0,0,4
198,Chris, But we did see something also be sent up to the moon,,,210.1,response,0,0,4
198,Chris,"Oh yeah, I don't remember the name of it, but it was something small that they sent up to the Moon before",,,,response,0,0,4
198,Teacher,"Yeah, it's probably a s machine just like a little Lunar Orbiter",,,210.1,remark,0,0,4
198,Chris, So which one is the right answer is usable microscope,,,210.1,response,0,0,4
198,Chris,I'm not clear on,,,210.1,response,0,0,4
198,Teacher,So there's actually two answers,,,130.3,remark,0,0,4
198,Teacher,"because the question was what equipment, the scientists use to discover the water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,0,4
198,Teacher,And in the second quote it mentions the small machine called the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
198,Teacher, It's equipment using it,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
198,Teacher," Um,",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
198,Teacher, So that was the equipment that the NASA had sent up to the space,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
198,Teacher,"Help to find the water and then the second equipment that was mentioned in the quotes, where the microscope, because that's an equip up piece of equipment",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
198,Teacher,"That can be used to help look at small little things, and the water particles up on moon were so small you wouldn't even be able to see it with your regular eyes",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
198,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
198,All,Yeah,,,150.1,,0,0,4
198,Teacher,Def what's up,,,,remark,0,0,4
198,Oliver,"Well, I was looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch, but",,,,response,0,0,4
198,Oliver,I did want to say thank you for asking us some good questions that made us have to look back at the story to see if we can actually back up what we're saying,,,,response,0,0,4
198,Oliver," Like, I saw that Chris couldn't find equipment and then",,,,response,0,0,4
198,Oliver, So that was that was really helpful,,,,response,0,0,4
198,Oliver,I think for Luis to what what they were saying,,,,response,0,0,4
198,Oliver, Thank you,,,,response,0,0,4
198,Teacher,You're Welcome,,,,remark,0,0,4
198,Teacher, Have fun at lunch,,,,remark,0,0,4
199,Teacher,High class,,,,remark,0,0,3

199,Luis, Hi,,,,response,0,0,3
199,Teacher," You might know a lot about space, but we're gonna go over what you guys read in the text",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher, So it might be something that new that you might not know,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"Um, well, actually",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3

199,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,So have you guys already read the text,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Luis, So I'm not even sure why why we're in this group,,,150.1,response,0,0,3
199,Luis,"Um, yeah, and I want you answered our questions",,,150.1,response,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"OK, so",,,,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,The discussion question was what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,And your answers were,,,,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"Okay, um,",,,,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher," Maybe you guys do have a good understanding of the text, but I think we can go dig a little deeper and relate the text to your answers and pull out evidence from the text",,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,So I think so,,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,In from the reading,,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,So do you guys see anything that could support your answers from the text,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,0,3
199,Farrah,"Yeah, in, in, in paragraph three is where I got my answer",,,,response,0,0,3
199,Farrah, And I think it's supportive in in paragraph three,,,,response,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"Where specifically in paragraph three, do you see that",,,230.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Farrah,"At the at the end of the paragraph, um,",,,230.2,response,0,0,3
199,Farrah, Yeah,,,,response,0,0,3
199,Farrah,You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,0,0,3
199,Farrah,"Um, but I, I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,0,3
199,Jazmin, I think the answer is the small machine,,,,response,0,0,3
199,Jazmin,I'm Farrah,,,,response,0,0,3
199,Jazmin, The small machine called the lunar orbiter is the correct answer,,,,response,0,0,3
199,Jazmin," I'm not sure why mine a while I am in this group, but I know that the correct answer is the arm the small machine or the Lunar Orbiter",,,,response,0,0,3
199,Jazmin,"Like, that's the right answer",,,,response,0,0,3
199,Teacher,And Jazmin,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher, Why do you think that is the correct answer to the question,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Jazmin, And so the teacher told us that was the answer,,,230.1,response,0,0,3
199,Jazmin,"Um, cuz well we we got the answer sheet",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
199,Jazmin, And so I know our answers didn't all get 100 on them,,,230.1,response,0,0,3
199,Jazmin, And so that's why we got pulled into this group,,,230.1,response,0,0,3
199,Jazmin,So that's how come I know,,,,response,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"Well,",,,,remark,0,0,3
199,Farrah,"Fine, if that's the right answer",,,,response,0,0,3
199,Farrah," But still, so how come my answer is not the right answer",,,,response,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"Actually, I think I agree with savannas answer",,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Jazmin,The question asked what equipment that they used to discover water on the moon,,,110.2,response,0,0,3
199,Jazmin, And that's why I said I'm the small machine I that's why I picked the one from paragraph to because,,,110.2,response,0,0,3
199,Jazmin,It says I'm that is going to investigate and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater and to look for ice deposits that that means like to discover them to find them for the first time,,,,response,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"Nice job, Jazmin",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Jazmin,Thanks,,,110.1,response,0,0,3

199,Teacher, Does anybody else want to explain why their answer could maybe be right,,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"Well, I think you're thinking could benefit everybody else and how you just does everybody",,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Oliver," So I don't think I'm wrong, either",,,130.2,response,0,0,3
199,Oliver,"Well, I mean, in paragraph one it does say that there's the the the waters deep in the craters",,,130.2,response,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"That's true, but the question is asking what equipment",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher," So, what tools do they use to find those craters",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher, But we're asking what equipment was used,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,So craters full of water means what they found,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks in suits,,,210.2,response,0,0,3
199,Chris,"Well, I went to NASA",,,210.2,response,0,0,3
199,Teacher," They use all that stuff, but specifically here in the text, where do we, where can we find that it talks about what tools they use to find those craters",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3

199,Oliver, Cause my there's a tool as equipment and they're talking about looking at water and in that part of a story,,,130.2,response,0,0,3
199,Teacher," And she looked at the word discover and when we think of discover, we think, how did they find water on the moon",,,430.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher, They are using the microscope to look at the water,,,430.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,That is true,,,430.1,remark,0,0,3

199,Teacher,"But, yeah",,,,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,So today we're going to be reviewing the discussion question and answers that you guys had over the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,3

199,Teacher, So first let's maybe dissect the question a bit to really understand the question,,,430.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher," Why, what are your answer, maybe not answer the questions",,,430.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,So the question is asking what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher, Equipment usually means tools or systems,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher, So let's think about the words in this,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher, So find something or know that it exists on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"And then discover is another big word in there and discover means, how did they find water",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher," Jazmin's answer was, NASA sent a small machine",,,120.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,So what tools did scientists use to find water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,Let's go back to the text and see if that's true,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher, Can anybody find in the text where it says,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,where it talks about what tools they use to find the water,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Farrah,"Well, I mean, in my answer",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
199,Farrah," I, I said a tool, uh, the microscope, because I use that to look at the water",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
199,Teacher, That's a really good strategy,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher," Farrah, they did use the microscope to really look closely, and that's a really good way to use the text as evidence in your answer",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,That is true,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"However, um, the, they did use the microscope to look at the water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"However, the question is asking, how did they find the water",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher," So they use it to look at the water, but what did they use to find the water?",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Jazmin,"Okay, so I saw the part where I found it in the story where I i saw it at the beginning of paragraph two, and it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.2,response,0,0,3
199,Jazmin,So that was the equipment that I thought,,,,response,0,0,3
199,Chris,"Oh yeah, I could see that because Farrah said microscope for equipment and Jazmin said on the lunar orbiter for equipment",,,,response,0,0,3
199,Teacher,Yeah,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher," Thank you for pointing that out, Chris",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,And thank you Jazmin for explaining your answer and using the text really well,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Chris, So I know that time does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits,,,310.1,response,0,0,3
199,Chris,And I went to NASA,,,310.1,response,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"That's really good that you know all those things, Chris",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher, It's really interesting,,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher, Those are really good things to know,,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher," Um Jazmin, I really like your",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,But back to the text,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"answer because it really, like I said, it really uses the text like Farrah's",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"And, yeah",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher," They might -Also in the text, they don't really, when they say water, we don't really see the word water in the text, a lot right? Did you guys notice that?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Chris, And that's why I oh I looked for the part that had the most stuff about the water,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
199,Chris,I noticed that too,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
199,Luis,"Yeah, I didn't",,,,response,0,0,3
199,Luis,See that much,,,,response,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"Yeah, that's true",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher, Right? So they say that they looked for so that like Jazmin said,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,They use the they use the small machine,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher, So ice is just dried up water,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher, The Lunar the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and they found water in ice deposits,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher," In the third paragraph, the water they found is microscopic so",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,And sometimes they the text is saying that,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"This in the beginning of the end of paragraph two, they say ice deposits are very small",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"And then when you think of microscopic microscopic means that they have to look through a microscope to to see it, which means that it's really small",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"If you put those two together, you can infer or guess from that, that ice deposits is where the water was stored",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"So, if that's where the water was, what did they use to find the ice deposits? Can anyone tell me? Can anyone refer to the text?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
199,Jazmin,"Um,",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
199,Jazmin,I don't think it's mine,,,,response,0,0,3

199,Chris," Oh, just like you said teacher",,,,response,0,0,3
199,Jazmin,"Yeah, like I said, so it's they use, they use the Lunar Orbiter to find the ice deposits",,,,response,0,0,3
199,Teacher," However, we need to think about our phrasing of the question",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher," Um, so yeah, so we found our answer",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
199,Teacher,"Yes, that's really good",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3

199,Oliver, It was really nice having you,,,,response,0,0,3
199,Oliver,"But you said to discover means to find the water and so you helped me think about what some of the meanings of the words discovered mean, too, so oh thanks so much",,,,response,0,0,3

199,Teacher,"That can be true, however, today we're using science",,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
199,Teacher,"to drive our reading skills so we're actually going to be using science ,a reading about science and about",,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
199,Teacher,As you guys have done we're going to be using that reading,,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
199,Teacher,"and we're going to be reviewing our, our responses to those questions",,,220.1,remark,1,0,3

199,Teacher, So we're going to be learning but we're also- about science,,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
199,Teacher,But we're also going to be learning how to work on our reading and writing skills,,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
199,Teacher,And how we work to break down questions and such um,,,220.1,remark,1,0,3

199,Teacher,we're also going to be using that reading to learn and to practice our reading and writing skills and understanding how to break down,,,220.1,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,information that we might not even know about yet So how do we do that and stuff,,,220.1,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,So to get started today um does everyone have the- their materials in front of them? the reading their responses just give me a nod or thumbs up,,,,remark,2,0,3

199,Teacher,Just so I can make sure that everybody knows what the question is um So the question that we're that we're going to be reviewing the answers for today are what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,So does everybody know what the word equipment means?,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
199,Jazmin,yeah,,,210.2,response,2,0,3

199,Jazmin,harvard,,,210.2,response,2,0,3
199,Teacher,"Okay um well just by going over the word equipment, I wanted to make sure that everybody knew what the word equipment was just because sometimes not everybody understands the question and then sometimes",,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,Our answers are a little bit just -they're in the right direction but they're not exactly meeting expectations,,,130.1,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,Farrah you had your hand up?,,,,remark,2,0,3

199,Chris,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,,response,2,0,3
199,Teacher,"All right, thank you Chris",,,,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,yeah So what we can say what tools or what,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,Instruments did they use,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
199,Chris, You know I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,210.2,response,2,0,3

199,Teacher,Just moving forward with the lesson,,,,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,"But just some common mistakes, I think, are that some people just didn't use specific words from the text I know",,,410.2,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,"We want to really reference, the text, just so that we show that we found our evidence in the text, you know",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,"I think it's important that, when you say something you know you have evidence to back it up so in case somebody asked Oh, how do you know that, how do you know this is true, you can say Oh, I found it in this source or you can say, you can quote the text",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,um so would anybody maybe like to revise their answer? and maybe just include a piece of evidence in there or a specific word?,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3

199,Teacher,yeah That is very true you both do use very specific evidence um,,,110.2,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,I think,,,,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,Maybe we can Jazmin Would you mind if we use your response?,,,,remark,2,0,3
199,Jazmin,No I don't mind,,,,response,2,0,3
199,Teacher,"Now, if we look at the text where it talks about",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher," So Jazmin's response is really good because it does lead us to answering the question, the question was what equipment did they use",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher, And she answers NASA sent a small machine,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,"Okay, so Jazmin's response was NASA sent a small machine",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,These,,,,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,These small the small machine can anybody find the name of the small machine?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3

199,Teacher,"Yes, lunar orbiter",,,110.4,remark,2,0,3
199,Teacher,So now that we now that we know that that that the expectation is maybe using more specific language Jazmin would you maybe like to revise your answer using one of the words that we just discussed or one of the phrases that we just discussed yeah,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
199,Jazmin,harvard,,,110.4,response,2,0,3
199,Jazmin,"edu: Ok, um NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter",,,110.4,response,2,0,3

201,Teacher,"So,",,,,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, I think you guys can come up with better,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, I noticed that,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,you guys just finished reading water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, And I also noticed that you guys tended to have some answers that weren't thought about as best as I think you guys can think about,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, All right,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,Better responses to the question that I'm asking because I know you guys are super smart and you can do that,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"So Farrah, you said that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look super closely",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,And-,,,,remark,0,1,3
201,Luis,"Excuse me, teacher",,,,response,0,1,3
201,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,1,3
201,Luis,"Excuse me, I should be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,3
201,Teacher,I just want to make sure that you understand all of what what we just talked about and stuff,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, And what we read,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher," This is just to help you understand, just a little more",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"I know you know all about space I'm, I'm sure you all know a lot about space",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,Got - is that alright?,,,,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"Okay, awesome",,,,remark,0,1,3
201,Luis,Yeah yeah,,,,response,0,1,3
201,Teacher,Alright so Farrah,,,,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,You indicated that we would need a tool called a scien- a scientific tool called a microscope to look super closely,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"And if we actually take take a, take a look back at the text, you can actually see that",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,That they - that they do use use,,,,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,Is-,,,,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,So you can see that they are using a scientific microscope to look at it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, But let's think about what else they used,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"And that's true, but we want to talk about what, what else they used",,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher," So, yes, they use the scientific microscope to look super closely at it",,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, So that's another tool,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,So if we look in the reading,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher," We can even see that that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"And then, now that we've all understood that we're going to need a scientific microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, Like Farrah said,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, If we look in paragraph three,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,And now we understand that we're going to need a Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,and now we also can keep looking at the reading,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"We can see that they said that the water that they found is microscopic so if you were looking straight at it, you wouldn't be able to see it",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, So definitely what Farrah said yes,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, Jazmin,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
201,Jazmin,I don't understand why my answer's wrong,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
201,Teacher, They did send a small machine,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"Because, well your answer is not wrong",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, You're definitely,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher," Well, you guys are all definitely right with your answers that you guys that they did use a microscope",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"But what we want to do is we want to make sure that that you're using terms that are in the reading like just, just like the ones that we just talked about, like microscope",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"Like Orbiter, things like that",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, Does that make sense?,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, So we want to make sure you're using the most strong vocabulary you can from the reading,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Jazmin,I have to add more vocabulary,,,420.2,response,0,1,3
201,Teacher, I'll read it to you,,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher," So what's your, your response",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,Yeah,,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher," Was NASA send a small machine, which is true, NASA did send a small machine",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,But I want to hear more specific answers in that,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher," What kind of small machine that they send like what, what did they use once they sent it when they brought it back like",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"I just need to like we need to be able to understand what small machine it was because it tells you what small machine, it is in the reading",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, Right?,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Jazmin,See,,,410.2,response,0,1,3
201,Jazmin," Oh, yeah",,,410.2,response,0,1,3
201,Jazmin, So it's called a lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,1,3
201,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"Yeah, there you go",,,110.4,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"So, that's awesome",,,110.4,remark,0,1,3
201,Jazmin,Oh that's it?,,,110.4,response,0,1,3
201,Teacher," And then let's keep reading, paragraph three, in the last sentence that says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really clearly",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"Well, they use an orbiter",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"So with that in mind, who can tell me what are the two tools that we need",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
201,Oliver,That,,,120.4,response,0,1,3
201,Oliver,My answer,,,,response,0,1,3
201,Oliver,"I said that, um, the microscope",,,,response,0,1,3
201,Oliver,"Already, um, ah, but like, just like Sabrina did, um, and I guess the one that Jazmin said too",,,,response,0,1,3
201,Teacher,Which is what? Like-,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
201,Chris,I went to NASA,,,120.4,response,0,1,3
201,Teacher,Who went to NASA? Chris you went to NASA?,,,,remark,0,1,3
201,Chris,"Yeah, so I know that scientists",,,,response,0,1,3
201,Chris, We went to NASA,,,,response,0,1,3
201,Chris,"Yeah, me and my dad",,,,response,0,1,3
201,Chris,"And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, too",,,,response,0,1,3
201,Chris, So they use a lot of different equipment,,,,response,0,1,3
201,Teacher, You guys all had responses that were definitely,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher," So going off that, the equipment that they used to find water on the moon",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"That's really, really cool",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher," Yes, Oliver, you said you circled the same as Farrah",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,You guys were all mostly right in your responses,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"And that's right, Farrah did choose a correct objects,",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,but I want you each to come up with your own individualized answers,,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"But I want you to make sure that before you answer that you're looking at the reading you're reading all three of the paragraphs, you're definitely taking the time to look at the words that are being used",,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, You're right,,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, You need a scientific tool called the microscope,,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, We also need,,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, That's right,,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,So Farrah,,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, You're right,,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"A small machine called the Lunar Orbiter, so that's that's so all you need to add is what other machines that they needed to use",,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"Oliver, I want you to be able to come up with your own answer in your own words,",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,because I know you have really good words and you can use them and you're able to tell them I know you can tell me,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,The reading,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, Chris,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
201,Chris,Yeah,,,210.3,response,0,1,3
201,Teacher," I know you can tell me what small machine they send, and I know you can tell me what what they used to see it",,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
201,Chris,Uh huh,,,,response,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"I understand that you read the reading because you know that they found craters full of water on the moon, but",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,"But, that doesn't truly answer the question",,,410.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,So I'm going to read the question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, What did they use to see the water,,,430.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Chris, Ok,,,120.2,response,0,1,3
201,Teacher, Okay,,,430.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, You did say a fair point,,,430.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher,So you didn't quite answer the question there,,,430.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, So if you take a look back in paragraph two and three to tell you what they use,,,430.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, Did they use,,,430.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, What type of equipment,,,430.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, What type of machines,,,430.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Teacher, But the question really was,,,430.1,remark,0,1,3
201,Chris,Ok,,,120.2,response,0,1,3

201,Oliver," Um, I appreciate how you",,,,response,0,1,3
201,Oliver, And then I heard you tell some of the other kids that they should make sure that they read the whole question,,,,response,0,1,3
201,Oliver,encouraged me to use my own words,,,,response,0,1,3
201,Teacher,Thank you Oliver,,,,remark,0,1,3

201,Teacher,out and understanding and so that we can definitely take a look at everything that we've written about,,,,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,Shall we start with you Luis,,,,remark,1,1,3
201,Luis,harvard,,,,response,1,1,3
201,Luis,edu: yeah yeah let's start with me,,,,response,1,1,3
201,Luis,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,,response,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"Alright, so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,you're right they definitely do use a lot of equipment like awkward to use to find water that's right,,,110.2,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,So we want to dig a little bit deeper than that okay,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"Okay, so you, you did the reading and you found that they found oxygen or that they needed oxygen tanks to dig up so now, my question is did you see any other types of equipment, besides the oxygen tank",,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
201,Luis,edu: I don't remember,,,210.3,response,1,1,3
201,Luis,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,210.3,response,1,1,3
201,Luis,harvard,,,210.3,response,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"Okay, well, if you don't remember my suggestion to you is to keep the word equipment in your head when you go back and I want you to do the reading again",,,,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,and try and highlight or underline some of the types of equipment that they use and then maybe we can try and adjust your answer again okay,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"Okay Okay, thank you",,,,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"Jazmin are you ready i'm ready awesome so, you said that NASA sent a small machine",,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,you're right they definitely did send a small machine and that's great,,,110.2,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"We I know that you can dig a little deeper than that I know you're smarter than that, and I know that you have more complete sentences that you can give me",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"So if we were to read the question again, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"And yes, they did use a small machine, but I wanted to go through with you and I wanted to come up and help you so that we could give an example sentence, so that I could help you start",,,,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"Your thinking so i'm going to show you my example sentence right here, this is how, if it were me I would start this sentence, but keep in mind there's a million ways to start the sentence, I would say to discover water on the moon, the scientist used blank",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"A small machine, a small machine What else do you remember",,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
201,Jazmin,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,210.3,response,1,1,3
201,Jazmin,"edu: Oh, I just underlined it that's the Lunar orbiter machine",,,210.3,response,1,1,3

201,Jazmin,Oh that's,,,,response,1,1,3
201,Teacher,awesome,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"that's perfect, do you know any other tools",,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
201,Farrah,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,210.3,response,1,1,3
201,Farrah,edu: teacher well Jazmin's looking I don't understand why my answers wrong,,,210.3,response,1,1,3
201,Farrah,harvard,,,210.3,response,1,1,3
201,Teacher,know Farrah your response was you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really clearly,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"Alright Farrah will Jazmin you keep looking and try and find an answer for you read it again, if you have to and highlight and underline",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,Again that's the correct answer and you wouldn't need a microscope to look really clearly and the reading did say that,,,110.2,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"But I know that you have more I know that you can give me more than that, I know if you go back to the reading",,,,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"And you look, you can find at least two more tools that you can pull out and use in your response you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope you'd also need blank and you'd also need blank",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,does that make sense yeah yeah,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"that's what that would be a good start so again my same suggestion, think about the question think of it in your head and then go back in the reading and try and underline all of the types of equipment that you can find in the reading",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"Alright, are you ready",,,,remark,1,1,3

201,Teacher,Your answer,,,,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,I didn't really see that you understood the reading well because your answer was I circled the same as Farrah,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"Now i'm sure you serve you did circle, the same as Farrah Farrah his answer was the microscope, but I want you to come up with your own words and your own answers, yes, you and samantha might have had the same answers",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"But that wasn't necessarily what the question was specifically asking the question was asking for what types of equipment and I know you circled the same thing as Farrah, but I want to hear from you",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
201,Teacher,"What types of equipment use on the reading not not necessarily you and Farrah I want to know exactly what depth saw in the reading so again, the example sentence might help you",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3

201,Chris,"edu: I would say that's equipment, because we were talking about equipment, but then it's saying specifically to discover water on the moon, and so that you don't use their suits to discover the water they use their suits to stay warm",,,210.2,response,1,1,3

202,Teacher,"Yes, that is correct",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher," But when you reach the third paragraph, you'll see that small machine they used",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher," And that is in the second paragraph, NASA did send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and the lunar orbiter just looks for ice deposits in the in the craters",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,is actually called a microscope,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,And that's what actually finds the water,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,Do you see what I'm saying?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
202,Jazmin,"Okay, let me look again so",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
202,Jazmin," Um, so I was thinking about, you know, like when you watch the investigator shows where they're looking for clues",,,,response,0,1,2
202,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,,response,0,1,2
202,Jazmin, So investigate,,,,response,0,1,2
202,Jazmin,"So then I was like,",,,,response,0,1,2
202,Jazmin,"Well investigate is when you're looking for something and I didn't choose the microscope, because they were looking at the water not looking for the water, so I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,,response,0,1,2
202,Teacher, The small machine is called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,"So if we look back in the second paragraph, you're right",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher, It says that the water they found is microscopic so the water that is found,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher, That's looking to find the water,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher, But as we see it in the third paragraph,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,And investigate,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher, You're right,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,"You need to look at it with a small machine called a microscope, because you can only see it with the microscope, not the Lunar Orbiter",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2

202,Teacher,Does anyone else want to share their answers?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
202,Chris,Well yeah I had a completely different answer than them,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
202,Chris, I said let me look at what I wrote down,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
202,Chris,"Yeah, scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,,response,0,1,2
202,Teacher," Chris, the scientists did find craters with ice in them",,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,And that is true,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,"But the question is,",,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher," Did the scientists use to discover the water, not where is the water found",,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,What equipment,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,So if we take a closer look at the question and in the text we see that they use a microscope to find the water,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,Do you understand?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,"So your answer is right, but you will have -didn't take that extra step to look for the small machine's name",,,410.2,remark,0,1,2
202,Chris,Um so it is correct that they found craters full of water on the moon,,,150.1,response,0,1,2
202,Chris,But I didn't see the name of the machine?,,,,response,0,1,2
202,Teacher,That's exactly,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2

202,Chris,"Okay, okay",,,110.1,response,0,1,2
202,Luis,Okay fine but,,,,response,0,1,2
202,Luis," I mean, I know my answer is right too because I talked about equipment and I know that it's appointment that scientists use because you know I read about space all the time",,,,response,0,1,2
202,Luis,Me,,,,response,0,1,2
202,Teacher,"Okay, let me hear it",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
202,Luis,"Oh, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
202,Teacher,"Alright Luis, so, when we look back at the question",,,410.1,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher," While it may be true that scientists do use oxygen tanks and probably very often, it's not the equipment that they use to find water on the moon",,,410.1,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher, Do you see how you can fix your answer a little bit?,,,410.1,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher, It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,410.1,remark,0,1,2
202,Luis,"Okay, they do use oxygen tanks",,,410.1,response,0,1,2
202,Luis,But they didn't use them to find the water,,,,response,0,1,2
202,Luis,"Okay, okay, okay",,,,response,0,1,2
202,Luis," I guess, yeah, I could go for that",,,,response,0,1,2
202,Chris,"You know, I went to NASA",,,,response,0,1,2
202,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits,,,,response,0,1,2
202,Teacher, And that is very true,,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher," They use those equipments so many times a day in many different things, but it's not actually what they used to discover the water on the moon",,,130.1,remark,0,1,2

202,Jazmin,"How would, I tried to change my answer to",,,,response,0,1,2
202,Jazmin,To make it like a complete answer,,,,response,0,1,2
202,Teacher,"So your answer was, NASA sent a small machine?",,,230.3,remark,0,1,2
202,Jazmin,Uh huh,,,230.3,response,0,1,2
202,Teacher," You are correct, NASA sent a small machine",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,So to fix your answer just a little bit,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher, And just a simple fix,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher," We can put on it is at the words, called a microscope, at the end of it",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,"That's all you need to do, because you did say it was a small machine and you just needed to put the name of it",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher, So NASA sent a small machine called a microscope and then your answer would be perfect,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
202,Jazmin,"Okay, I just have to put the name of it on there",,,420.2,response,0,1,2
202,Jazmin," Oh, okay",,,420.2,response,0,1,2
202,Jazmin, I guess they didn't need to cross it out,,,420.2,response,0,1,2
202,Jazmin," Oh, I crossed it out",,,420.2,response,0,1,2
202,Oliver,"Wow, okay",,,,response,0,1,2
202,Oliver," Oh man, um teacher, it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for for",,,,response,0,1,2
202,Oliver,Keeping us to like look back at the question,,,,response,0,1,2
202,Oliver," I kept hearing you say, oh, but Chris, that's a good answer but it's not in the question, that's true, Luis, but that's not in the question",,,,response,0,1,2
202,Oliver," So I guess we have to we have to, like, read the question a little bit more closely next time",,,,response,0,1,2
202,Teacher,"Well, thank you guys for",,,,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,Participating,,,,remark,0,1,2
202,Teacher,simulation,,,,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,hi everyone,,,,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,1,1,2
202,Luis,um yeah so I was just gonna say that I know all of this stuff so I don't think I need to be on this group I don't need any help,,,,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"Okay i'm glad that you know so much about this already, but I think you should stay, so you can help me with this assignment with your classmates",,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher, Does that sound okay?,,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
202,Luis,"yeah yeah Okay, I can do that",,,110.3,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"Okay, so does everyone have their tablets out with the reading",,,,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,Perfect who wants to share their answer first,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"Okay um savanah, yeah let's hear yours",,,,remark,1,1,2
202,Farrah,Okay yeah so my answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close,,,,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,Can you tell me why you chose the microscope as the answer？,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"that's awesome and I love, how long is like how you worded your answer",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
202,Farrah,"yeah so my thinking was that Okay, so if you're trying to play, you have to first be able to see it",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
202,Farrah,How do you find if you can't see right So when I was looking at the different types of reading,,,,response,1,1,2
202,Farrah,I thought microscope was the best answer because you couldn't discover something unless you could see right and and we know we know that the water was microscope,,,,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"I love, how you comprehend the reading so well",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"and I love, how you said that you look back at the reading to like determine which machine you thought would be the best one",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"And, your answer is right about the microscope data scientists did use the microscope to look at the water they already found in the reading it says they already found the water",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"The question asks what small machine to do to discover the water, so if the if they're using a microscope to find the water they're already on and you look back at the reading what small machine, do you think found the water?",,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
202,Farrah,"that's a really good question i'm not totally sure because Well, I can look and see because i'm not really sure, is it still seems like the microscope would be the first thing I guess I could second look at",,,210.3,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"yeah if you just take another look maybe at the second paragraph, the first sentence says a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate",,,130.3,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"And in the question asked what machine discovered the water, so your answer is correct,",,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,but I it just means that you need to look a little bit further into the reading yes,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
202,Farrah,Is the answer to the Lunar orbiter,,,150.1,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"Yes, it is excellent",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"Yes, Oliver",,,,remark,1,1,2
202,Oliver,"um I also got that answer from from what said, and I said that it's the Lunar orbiter",,,,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,Did you work with Savannh on this question?,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
202,Oliver,"um I did the first time, and then I heard her say lunar orbiter and now I know it's the Lunar orbiter",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"I love, how you work together with her, and I think it's great to work with your classmates in class but, for your answer, I want to hear what you have to say",,,410.2,remark,1,1,2
202,Oliver,"Okay um well, I think it is the Lunar orbiter cuz what you were saying was that we needed to look for",,,410.2,response,1,1,2
202,Oliver,"You know what I mean like something that actually discovered the water was in the question, and like found it and then you said they they they looked in the microscope after they found it so, then it has to be the Lunar orbiter that out",,,,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,that's excellent Oliver so glad that you're listening and paying attention in class,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,1,1,2
202,Jazmin,I think I am just a little confused,,,,response,1,1,2
202,Jazmin,I was confused because I also thought it was the Lunar orbiter like why my answer was wrong,,,,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"What was your answer, let me hear it one more time",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
202,Jazmin,yeah yeah,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
202,Jazmin,My answer which really was NASA send a small machine,,,,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"Can you tell me why you picked that as your answer, I'm not saying it's wrong, but I want to hear where you're coming from with that",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
202,Jazmin,"Yes, so I was thinking",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
202,Jazmin,"That when I was reading like it was saying, basically that like Okay, where does it say I can read it, it says NASA sentence for me, she called a lunar orbiter to investigate, so I thought that was the answer the question was saying, like what equipment that the scientists used to discover the water",,,,response,1,1,2
202,Jazmin,"and so that makes me think what had to be the Lunar orbiter right, so I I was saying that it was the small machine that they you know they sent this fall machine it, that was the the answer",,,,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,I really like how you looks back at the reading and really understood the question because you totally did,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,and it's the Lunar orbiter is a small machine and,,,110.4,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"my only suggestion for you like, your answer was almost perfect is just to put the name of the small machine that's it that's my only issue",,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher, Otherwise your answer is perfect,,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
202,Jazmin,"Okay, that makes perfect sense so like to make a complete answer it has to include the name of the thing",,,420.2,response,1,1,2
202,Jazmin,"Yes, awesome Thank you",,,,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,1,1,2
202,Chris,"You know, I was a little bit confused because I was thinking",,,,response,1,1,2
202,Chris,"um so Okay, so I was just",,,,response,1,1,2
202,Chris,"Like well Okay, I was thinking that I went to NASA So when I was there with my dad I aw that like they had stuff like oxygen tanks and masks and I was thinking like they have to have use those to discover the water so I guess i'm confused by that tonight and",,,,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"you're totally right about how NASA you so much equipment like oxygen tanks and other things like that, and they definitely do use that when they go to the moon, but",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"In the question is asking what did they use to discover water on the moon, and while they use so much equipment up in the moon, I couldn't even tell you half the names of them, the article, the reading says that",,,410.1,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,"They use the Lunar orbiter to discover the water and they do use the other equipment, but the Lunar orbiter purpose is to discover the water",,,130.3,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
202,Chris,"Oh so it's like a like maybe they weren't astronauts up there, like Maybe it was a like a NASA they call it an unmanned pro",,,150.1,response,1,1,2
202,Chris,"And that's like you know, maybe that was it",,,,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,It definitely could have been just up there lunar orbiter,,,110.4,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,yes Oliver,,,,remark,1,1,2
202,Oliver,"i'm so I unfortunately we have to go to our next class, but before we go I really just wanted to thank you um this was a really interesting conversation, so thank you so much for working with us bye",,,,response,1,1,2
202,Teacher,bye,,,,remark,1,1,2
202,Teacher,hi everyone,,,,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,hi,,,,remark,2,1,2
202,Luis,"So I just wanted to say that I kind of know, like all about space already so I don't think I need any help I don't need to be in this",,,,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"Well i'm so glad that you already know so much about space, but do you think you could stay and help me answer the questions for your other classmates too",,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
202,Luis,yeah I get I can stick around for that yeah for sure,,,110.3,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,So who wants to share their answer first?,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"Oliver, you can go first",,,,remark,2,1,2
202,Oliver,awesome,,,,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"Okay, so what I said was that I circled the same with Farrah",,,,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,Did you work with Farrah on the question,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Oliver,Oh yeah we work together a lot of help each other out,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"Well i'm so glad that you worked with your classmates and I think it's really important to work with your classmates, but when answering your question on your own paper, I really would love, if you could explain your answer, rather than, say you didn't listen to someone else",,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
202,Oliver,"Oh yeah I can do that so basically what we said was We thought that you would need a scientific tool, called the microscope We thought that was the equipment that the scientists used to discover the water we agreed that it was the microphone right Farrah yeah",,,420.2,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"Well that's great, and I can definitely tell that you guys read the reading and understood it",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Farrah,"Farrah, do you want to tell me why you guys pick the microscope?",,,310.1,response,2,1,2
202,Farrah,um yeah so basically we we picked microscope because I think he was that the waters microscope,,,,response,2,1,2
202,Oliver,"No, not a telescope, you need like a microscope to see microscopic water",,,,response,2,1,2
202,Farrah,"it says you can't see it unless you have a microscope or, like, I guess",,,,response,2,1,2
202,Farrah, How are they supposed to discover the water if they can't even see it,,,,response,2,1,2
202,Farrah,"yeah so you need to be able to see it and basically, if you can't see the order like how are the astronauts like finding like when, you know what I mean like",,,,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"I totally understand where you're coming from, and I think that's a great way that you guys interpreted interpreted the reading,",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"But the question is what small machine discovered the water, so if we look back at the reading the microscope is what they use to view the water know what found it",,,410.3,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Farrah,"um, I guess, but actually it's kind of music because, like",,,410.3,response,2,1,2
202,Farrah,"I still think like that question like yeah they could see the water and they could study the water, but how could they do that if they couldn't find it",,,,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,I definitely can see how you would find it confusing,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"One second, Jazmin",,,,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"What I suggest, what you guys do next time is look at the question and look at the reading for keywords and in the question, it states verse it says What small machine or not, what equipment did scientists use to discover water",,,420.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"when we look back at the reading it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter, and the Lunar orbiter looked in the craters to find the water",,,130.3,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Farrah,yeah I can see make sense,,,150.1,response,2,1,2
202,Farrah,"I guess yeah that makes sense, we need to look kind of, but I think that we Okay, so we were looking at the keywords right there",,,,response,2,1,2
202,Oliver,yeah we were looking at the keywords and we were trying to find like,,,,response,2,1,2
202,Oliver,"Okay, so we were looking for equipment and we found other equipment in the reading, but we still thought the microscope was was the answer because we thought it had to be the first equipment that they use other than like a spaceship",,,,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,but the microscope was to discover to look at the water that was already discovered,,,410.3,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"and i'm glad that you guys didn't notice that when you guys read,",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,I do agree that it does say other equipment that Thank you,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Oliver,"yeah Okay, so if it was used for the stuff that was discovered how did they discover",,,310.1,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"that's perfect that's the perfect question, that is what we're trying to find the answer to, and if you guys look back, you'll see that it says the Lunar lunar orbiter discovered the water",,,130.3,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,i'm going to move on to Jazmin real quick but i'll come back to you guys,,,,remark,2,1,2
202,Jazmin,So I just had a question I was just like why my answer was wrong,,,,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"Can you read me your answer one more time, please",,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
202,Jazmin,"yeah what I said was that, yes, it's it is",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,Your answer is almost perfect and it does show that you read the reading and understood it and understood the question which is great,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"And the only only recommendation I have, for your answer, because it's almost there is to just name the small machine that they used",,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher, That's it to make your answer perfect,,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
202,Jazmin,"Oh, oh so like that",,,420.2,response,2,1,2
202,Jazmin,"So they So this is the leader or better to discover, or rather the scientists discovered water on the moon, using the Lunar orbiter right",,,,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,That is perfect,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Jazmin,Yes,,,110.1,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,2,1,2
202,Chris,"Okay, so I was just the key because my dad and I went to NASA, and I, I know that they use like equipment like oxygen, masks suits and stuff like that, so I was just wondering like should that be in the reading",,,,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"So you're definitely right about how NASA uses so much equipment to do so many different things, but the answer the question is only asking for one specific machine or equipment that they used to find the water,",,,410.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"so I don't think it's necessary to include the other equipment, when the question is only asking for what found the water",,,,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Chris,"like, Okay, I think that makes sense",,,,response,2,1,2
202,Chris,"Oh okay oh okay does that make sense, like, Okay, I think that makes sense",,,,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,Does anyone else have any questions or confused about anything?,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,2,1,2
202,Luis,um so was my answer right?,,,,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,Can you read me your answer please,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
202,Luis,yeah so I said that scientists use a lot of equip like oxygen tanks and stuff like that,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"That is true and it's basically just what I told Chris, that the scientists do use a lot of equipment so much equipment for so many different things, but the question is only asking for one specific piece of equipment that was used to find the water",,,410.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Luis,yeah but didn't they use like oxygen takes to walk around and see the water?,,,150.1,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"They definitely could have, and I do see where you're coming from,",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"but when we look back at the question its assets only asking specifically what machine they used to find the water, not all the other machines",,,410.1,remark,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"So if you wanted to write as your answer that they use the Lunar orbiter and they use so many other machines for different things you could, and that would be right, but I think just saying the Lunar orbiter is perfectly fine too",,,130.3,remark,2,1,2
202,Luis,interesting,,,130.3,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,"yes, Oliver",,,,remark,2,1,2
202,Oliver,"So, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch, I just wanted to take a moment and I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like",,,,response,2,1,2
202,Oliver,"In particular, it was really interesting and helpful, how you asked us about kind of like",,,,response,2,1,2
202,Oliver,"Like how we got to the answer you know, because it was helping us to understand ourselves how we got to the answer, and then you helped us by like",,,,response,2,1,2
202,Oliver,"You really made us feel value, because every answer that we had like, even if it was like kind of wrong on you made sure that we knew that it was you know, a still a valuable answer, so thank you so much",,,,response,2,1,2
202,Teacher,Of course you guys,,,,remark,2,1,2
205,Teacher,All right,,,120.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher," So we, we just read the moon is a desert and I asked the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher," Hi, everybody",,,120.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, But I just wanted to go over these responses to see if we can get some really great answers,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4

205,Teacher,"Describe your intro, which is awesome because I could tell that you know so much about scientists and space",,,110.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, So I love the fact that you knew about the oxygen tanks,,,430.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,But I really wanted you to use some information from the text when answering this question,,,430.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, So do you think you can show me maybe something for the text that would also,,,430.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,But I do not believe that was in the article itself,,,430.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,"But what would be used to help scientists find water on the moon, and maybe use your texts to answer that question",,,210.2,remark,0,0,4

205,Teacher,"What this small machine was so you said exactly what the texts needed, which was NASA send a small machine",,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, So do you think you can look back in the text and maybe figure out that will give me a little bit more information,,,430.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,To the moon,,,430.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher," So, that's correct",,,430.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, But I wanted to know maybe what was the small machine and how did it help find water on the moon,,,430.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Jazmin,"Okay, so I should look for what the machine did",,,430.2,response,0,0,4
205,Teacher, And maybe what the machine was called,,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.2,response,0,0,4
205,Teacher," How are we doing so your response was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon, which is completely true",,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,"All right, Chris",,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,But I was wondering could you find an instrument that helped the scientists find this one on the moon and for your tax,,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Chris,An instrument,,,210.2,response,0,0,4
205,Chris,Okay,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Chris,I guess it probably be something that you can say,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Teacher, You don't need to use what you said,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,Or you could use maybe something you found on your own,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
205,Chris," Okay, I'm gonna read it and see",,,150.1,response,0,0,4
205,Chris,Okay,,,150.1,response,0,0,4
205,Chris,A small machine called,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Chris,Investigate,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Chris,"look for ice deposits in a large crater, I suppose",,,,response,0,0,4
205,Chris,"Well, the only other paragraph that talks about the waters, paragraph three",,,,response,0,0,4
205,Chris,"So what does it say in paragraph three, that they use for an instrument to find water",,,,response,0,0,4
205,Teacher,And microscope and what is the microscope,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
205,Chris,It's something you use to look at really small thing,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
205,Teacher,"Right, so how did they use a microscope to find the water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
205,Chris,"Well, it didn't really say",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
205,Chris," It just says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, you know, I went to NASA",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
205,Chris, So I know that I just use a lot of equipment like,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
205,Chris,oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Chris,Right,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Teacher, What,,,410.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, But I don't think they use those to necessarily find the water,,,410.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,You use those,,,410.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher," I think they use those to be signed sun, the moon, but for this question",,,410.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, So that's really great,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,"Instruments, they used to find the water, which was microscope",,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Chris,You put it doesn't,,,110.2,response,0,0,4
205,Chris, I don't know how,,,110.2,response,0,0,4
205,Chris, I don't know,,,110.2,response,0,0,4
205,Chris,"How they got bad answer from the question because the question says,",,,,response,0,0,4
205,Chris,What equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Chris,And,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Chris,You need a scientific to column microscope,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Chris, So it's the same answer is Farrah ducks into that,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Teacher,But what we did with Farrah,,,230.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher," If you remember, if I had Farrah Farrah gave me the answer that said my cursor tropes will really",,,230.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,"Look really closely at things, which is true",,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher," But I asked him into then go on and say, how did the microscope",,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,Be used to find a water and she said to me that microscopes looked really closely and then they found the water because some more,,,230.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, Chris,,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,"Microscopic so that's why Farrah said that, and which is why spins and ended up being really great because she explained how the instrument was used to find the water",,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, So does that make sense,,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Chris, That's what made her that that's what made it a better answer,,,420.2,response,0,0,4
205,Chris, Cuz she explained more of it,,,420.2,response,0,0,4
205,Chris,I think so,,,420.2,response,0,0,4
205,Teacher,"Yes, so she took the instrument, she explained with instrument did and then explained how the instrument helps find the water",,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Chris,Okay,,,420.2,response,0,0,4
205,Chris," Yeah, I think so",,,420.2,response,0,0,4
205,Teacher,So def,,,230.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, You said you had the same answer as Farrah,,,230.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, Do you want to explain a little bit what you found when you're reading,,,230.2,remark,0,0,4
205,Oliver," I'm like, here are some words, you're saying",,,230.2,response,0,0,4
205,Oliver,"Yeah, cause I read the question",,,230.2,response,0,0,4
205,Oliver,"Is that one equipment, the scientists use to find to discover water on the moon",,,,response,0,0,4
205,Oliver, So I was like a microscope isn't equipment and this paragraph is talking about water so so that's why I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Teacher, So that was a really great response,,,510.1,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, So I really liked that response because you explain yourself really well,,,510.1,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,Great,,,510.1,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, You said that you read the question you look you talk saw what the question was asking for and then you found it and explain why,,,510.1,remark,0,0,4
205,Oliver,"Oh, thanks",,,510.1,response,0,0,4
205,Oliver,Okay,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Oliver,Good,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Oliver,Job,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Teacher,Luis,,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, After giving yourself a little bit more time,,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, Did you figure out any answers,,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
205,Luis, And ICE just frozen water,,,210.3,response,0,0,4
205,Luis,"Okay, so I I read the whole thing again",,,210.3,response,0,0,4
205,Luis, And so that's why I think that's,,,210.3,response,0,0,4
205,Luis," And I think the answer is about the Lunar Orbiter, because I know that, um, I think, Chris said that it doesn't talk about water but it talks about ICE",,,210.3,response,0,0,4
205,Teacher,Good,,,110.4,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,"um, and what the question was asked before, and it is right because I",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher," So there are a few different answers that you could have, but the lunar orbiter is definitely one of the answers that you could have,",,,110.4,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,Is being used to ISIS and different form of water,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, So great job,,,110.4,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher," It's the solid for so the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in the polar craters, which helps them find water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher, The equipment was used to find water on the moon,,,110.4,remark,0,0,4
205,Teacher,"So yes, that is one of the answers to that",,,110.4,remark,0,0,4
205,Luis,Thanks,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
205,Luis, Thanks a lot,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
205,Luis," Hey, I'm",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
205,Oliver,On excuse me teacher,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Oliver, I just looked at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Oliver,But I did want to her site,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Oliver, Thanks for helping us know that we needed to use more evidence because I heard your toll Luis and Chris that they had to pull from the story and all,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Oliver,That for the rest of us that we should try to find more stuff in the story to us in our answer,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Oliver, So thanks for that,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Oliver,By,,,,response,0,0,4
205,Teacher,"Alright guys, so we just shared our great answers for the question but I just-",,,150.1,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"As we're going over our answers, I wanted to think back and let's really look at the question to see what the question was asking",,,150.1,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"So i'm going to reread the question and once I finish, I want one of you to raise your hand and tell me what the question is asking for and it's answer",,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher, So the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,So what do you guys think the question is asking for,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,1,0,4
205,Chris,It's asking for the name of equipment,,,,response,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"Right so in the question, it says what equipment did the scientists use so now when you're looking back at your paper with the sheet describing all of this",,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"What you should be thinking about what equipment specifically you saw that was used to discover water, the key words in here, I think are equipment and to discover water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,So now let's look at your responses,,,110.1,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher," So Farrah you circled the same thing as Chris, and so, you said that you needed a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely now I mean",,,110.1,remark,1,0,4
205,Luis,"i'm sorry teacher, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,110.1,response,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"You do? Well Luis I bet you have a ton of background knowledge on all of your science equipment, but I think that what this question was asking for doesn't mean necessarily background knowledge, but more for you to look at the evidence from the text",,,130.1,remark,1,0,4
205,Luis,Oh okay,,,130.1,response,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"Right, so I think that you and Farrah and Oliver all did this, you used all of your background knowledge when answering this question, which is great",,,310.1,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"but for this question it didn't necessarily ask for background knowledge, so what you said was probably would be used potentially to find water on the moon, but",,,130.1,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"In this text, it did not specifically state that a microscope or oxygen tanks were being used, so why don't we look back in the text and see if you can see, specific equipment that was used to find the water on the moon and circle that answer",,,420.3,remark,1,0,4
205,Luis,Okay,,,420.3,response,1,0,4
205,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"So can we go and look right back and just quickly, maybe skim the page and see if we could see any new equipment that was found",,,120.1,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,And you can raise your hand if you finally found a piece,,,150.1,remark,1,0,4
205,Chris,Ok so I found a small machine,,,150.1,response,1,0,4
205,Farrah,I found the Lunar orbiter,,,,response,1,0,4
205,Teacher,um so a lunar orbiter is a the actual answer to the prompt so that's the equipment that was found in the text that describes what was used to find water yes Jazmin,,,130.3,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,Good so Chris and Farrah you both found specific information for the text so that is great,,,310.1,remark,1,0,4
205,Jazmin,Well I don't understand why my answer's wrong,,,310.1,response,1,0,4
205,Teacher,So let's see your answer was NASA sent a small machine,,,110.2,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher," That answer is not incorrect at all, and I think none of your answers are wrong in any of this case I just think",,,110.2,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"When we read the question, it asked for what specific type of equipment would be used and your answer was correct, but I think to answer the correct",,,110.2,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"so you got the answer and you use evidence from the text because it says it was a small machine,",,,310.1,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"The question fully, you would need to describe the exact small machine that was found",,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,but the name of the small machine was the Lunar orbiter,,,130.3,remark,1,0,4
205,Jazmin,"Ok, ok",,,420.2,response,1,0,4
205,Oliver,"Okay, but they also, a microscope is a small machine and it does say that they looked for",,,,response,1,0,4
205,Oliver,"Oh, they looked at the water using a microscope so that that should count",,,,response,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"Right, so you said in your answer that",,,,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"The microscope was used to look at the water, but if they had the water already that's means that the water was already discovered on the moon, so the microscope seems to be used after the water was discovered and to analyze it",,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,But the question was asking for what was what equipment was used to find the water not look at it after it was found,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
205,Oliver,"Ok, ok",,,210.2,response,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"Yes, Chris?",,,,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"So, your answer was close but it you just missed a tiny part of the question, so you got water and you got equipment, but you needed to look at how it was discovered not how it was looked at afterwards",,,410.2,remark,1,0,4
205,Chris,"As we're talking about equipment, I was thinking so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,410.2,response,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"right they do so you, it seems like everyone in this group has a lot of background information about space, which is great, so you probably, when reading this article, connected a lot to it which is really great, but when we looked at the text, it said",,,110.3,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"For the question to look in the text to use the evidence and I don't think in the text, it talks about oxygen tanks",,,130.1,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,or microscopes when looking for the water,,,130.3,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher," When you went to look for the water, to discover on the moon, the equipment used was the lunar orbiter",,,130.3,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"And then afterwards, they definitely used microscope to look at the water and they probably had to have oxygen tanks when they are trying to discover it",,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"But that wasn't necessarily used to discover water on the moon more as an add on, so I think you bring up a great point Chris, that there are probably lots of different types of equipment used when people are on the moon",,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"But for this specific question, we are looking for what equipment was used to discover water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
205,Chris,"REach Every Reader: Ok, ok",,,210.2,response,1,0,4
205,Oliver,So it looks like it's time for the next group so we'll see you later teacher,,,,response,1,0,4
205,Teacher,goodbye,,,,remark,1,0,4
205,Teacher,"Alright guys, so we just answered the second question, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable and so you guys had some great answers",,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,That supported the question and I do see some more evidence from the text that we use that's really good,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"So um first let's go over it, so the question can anyone tell me what off the bat the question is asking? yes Luis",,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
205,Luis,"Okay, I think I got this all figured out so I'm all good",,,210.2,response,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"Okay so Luis, then, can you explain to me what the question is asking?",,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
205,Luis,"yeah okay sure, and so it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,210.2,response,2,0,4
205,Teacher,mm hmm So what is the question looking for and it's answer,,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
205,Luis,um it wants us to say,,,210.2,response,2,0,4
205,Luis,If water is valuable or not,,,,response,2,0,4
205,Teacher,so let's all look back at the reading and see if we can find any important clues that might tell us right away what the answer is,,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,Good right so when we read that question we're trying to figure out based on the reading if water is valuable or not,,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"and raise your hand if you find any evidence that would right away tell you, yes or now",,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,2,0,4
205,Farrah,"Okay um the um the first like title, it says water is a valuable resource",,,,response,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"That is a great point so off the bat guys, we should be thinking that we are looking for now evidence that proves water is valuable as a resource because off the bat the title says water is a valuable resource",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher," so in some of your answers, Farrah and Oliver, I realized you say, you both said no it's not ready yet and so now, after talking about this little bit um do you think your answer has changed at all?",,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,Great job Farrah,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
205,Farrah,"Okay, well, I mean I see how the that title says that it is a valuable resource, but then in the story, it says something different all right",,,210.3,response,2,0,4
205,Oliver," Like, okay, I have the same answer as Farrah because when I read the like a sixth, paragraph it says it says that it's gonna be really expensive",,,,response,2,0,4
205,Oliver,Yeah yeah,,,,response,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"Right, so you again you're using some evidence from the text which is great, but",,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,It although it's being a little bit expensive don't you think that some of the points from the text would say that it is a good thing,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,um can you find a maybe a point in the texts that were explains a benefit to having water and why it would be valuable,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
205,Oliver,Ok,,,210.3,response,2,0,4
205,Jazmin,"Okay, well, I don't understand why my answer's wrong",,,,response,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"um let's look at your you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated, you can't survive without water",,,110.2,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher, That is perfectly correct Jazmin and I don't think your answers wrong I just think,,,110.2,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,When we are answering the question we're looking to answer with evidence from the text,,,410.2,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"And I don't think that that answer was based on evidence from the text, but I think it was based on your background knowledge which is great to use when answering questions, but for this specific question",,,410.2,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,I think you should be looking at the text and pulling evidence for a specific sentence that relates to explaining why water is valuable,,,420.2,remark,2,0,4
205,Jazmin,"well i'm still kind of confused because I found this this one right in the story, so how come it's not evidence?",,,420.2,response,2,0,4
205,Teacher,um let's see can you point out to me where you found that?,,,230.2,remark,2,0,4
205,Jazmin,"Okay yeah it's in the the third sentence in paragraph four: for example, future astronauts could drink this water",,,230.2,response,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"Oh right Okay, so when we read that sentence, that you immediately think okay good we need water to drink, which is a great answer, but what it goes on to say is that",,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,The water is actually very heavy so,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,it's really hard to keep in a spaceship so if we were able to have the water come through moon it would lighten up the spacecraft leaving more room for different types of materials,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"So although, your answer was correct, that we do need to drink water, the evidence that would relate to the text would be more focused on how the water being on the moon would relieve space on the spaceship",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
205,Jazmin,yeah I think so,,,150.1,response,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"Ok, so if you had to redo your answer Jazmin What would you say now?",,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
205,Jazmin,"Well would I, I think I'd still keep the first sentence right?",,,210.3,response,2,0,4
205,Teacher,mm hmm and then what would you add to it?,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
205,Chris,that's what I put in my answer um I did read that they they might have a moon base on the moon by 2024 yeah,,,210.3,response,2,0,4
205,Jazmin,"Um I guess the sentence after it: Astronauts could drink the water, water is heavy takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft",,,,response,2,0,4
205,Teacher,right,,,,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"and so you're in your response you said water's heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry on the ships anymore, which is true because",,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,Right I love that you have some background information on that Chris that's great,,,110.3,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"If they do have that room on the ship, it would be very valuable because they could store more things, which is what it says in",,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,The text so that's a great response,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
205,Chris,So how come I'm here? because I used the evidence from the text and including the part that you told Jazmin she should put in her answer,,,230.3,response,2,0,4
205,Teacher,let's see so you did explain,,,,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"That the water is heavy and that it takes up room on the spaceship but you didn't relate it back to the question as if how that would be valuable, so what me and Jazmin were talking about was that, yes, the spaceship",,,410.2,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"would carry the water, it would be too heavy but then your response should have something about why it not the water not being carried would be a good thing, so just elaborating a little bit off of that of how",,,420.2,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher, Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,not carrying the water on the spaceship would be valuable,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
205,Chris,"Um, saying more about why it would be valuable",,,150.1,response,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"Yes, so you said you brought up a good point from the text that water is heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore, but why would that be valuable to people in space in scientists?",,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
205,Chris,Cuz then maybe they wouldn't have to burn up as much fuel,,,210.3,response,2,0,4
205,Teacher,"Right, so that is what you would put into your answer, just to explain and relate back to the question that's being asked",,,420.2,remark,2,0,4
205,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,2,0,4

206,Teacher, Luis Do you have a question,,,,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, I'm excited to be back with you,,,,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, I missed you guys so we just discussed our water on the moon,,,,remark,0,0,3
206,Luis, Like all this stuff about space,,,,response,0,0,3
206,Luis,"Um, yeah, I guess it's more of like a statement like I already know",,,,response,0,0,3
206,Luis," So, like, I don't think I really even need to be in this group",,,,response,0,0,3
206,Teacher, It only helps us better understand what we're learning about and it's also great,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher,"Right, I understand, but it's really important like when we listen to other students responses",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, I'm sure you'll have some great contributions today,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Luis,"yeah, I can do that",,,150.1,response,0,0,3
206,Teacher," So I noticed Farrah, as you said that, um, scientists use this specific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher,Awesome,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher,"And I thought that was great response, I noticed that you used your vocabulary,",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher,"but maybe we could elaborate and and why, why do they use this tool",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher," What does this tool, help them with",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, Can you kind of elaborate on that response,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, Can you tell me why you need a microscope,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher,So Referring to the water on the moon text,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Farrah, If you were looking straight at it you don't like you have to have the microscope to even see the water,,,420.2,response,0,0,3
206,Farrah," Okay, so what I saw when I was looking at it is that it says the water is the water they found is microscopic we wouldn't be able to see it",,,420.2,response,0,0,3
206,Farrah,Yeah so,,,420.2,response,0,0,3
206,Farrah, And See the water,,,,response,0,0,3
206,Farrah,Do you know what I mean,,,,response,0,0,3
206,Farrah, How do you find the water,,,,response,0,0,3
206,Teacher,"Right, you just did a really good job using textual evidence to support your answer",,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher,Can anyone help him?,,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher,Can you elaborate on that response,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher,"Next, Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, but how what equipment did they use or in the text",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, What equipment did it say they use to discover these things on the moon? Do you know?,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Chris,That's interesting because I was thinking about crater,,,230.1,response,0,0,3
206,Chris, So you were saying that the question is like what equipment so well,,,230.1,response,0,0,3
206,Chris,"Okay, so, like, you know, I've been to NASA",,,,response,0,0,3
206,Chris," So like I know that scientists use lots of equipment like on oxygen tanks and mass and shoots, and I guess like that's something they use right",,,,response,0,0,3
206,Teacher,Think about what's Farrah said,,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher,so referring back to your texts,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher,Right,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher," But what more specifically did they did they use to discover water on the moon,",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Chris,I'm not sure,,,130.2,response,0,0,3
206,Teacher, Can anyone help him,,,130.2,remark,0,0,3

206,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,0,0,3
206,Jazmin,"Well actually the thing that I was thinking about was, I wasn't really sure why my answer was, well,",,,,response,0,0,3
206,Teacher,So your answer wasn't wrong,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, You said that NASA uses a lot of small machines they sent a small machine,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, That's true,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, That's correct,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, I think you had a really great start to a response there,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher,"Um, but I'm just wondering, more specifically what small machine did they use",,,230.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher," How do you know they used to small machin, like did it tell you in the text? Where in the text is that?",,,230.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Jazmin,Yeah yeah it's it in yet basically was like,,,230.2,response,0,0,3
206,Jazmin,"In the, in the text",,,,response,0,0,3
206,Jazmin," It was saying and pick up three that, no, no",,,,response,0,0,3
206,Jazmin,"No, a pair of to this moment, she was the Lunar Orbiter",,,,response,0,0,3
206,Jazmin,"Is that, is that what I got wrong",,,,response,0,0,3
206,Jazmin, I didn't say this thing,,,,response,0,0,3
206,Teacher,"Yeah, that's great",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, Nice work,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3

206,Teacher, And you made it an amazing excellent well thought out response,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, Now you you've built on your response,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, You're using each other to help one another,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, Do you need me to to re explain it,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, What did you fully understand this question,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher," I mean, you were all working in a small group which is great",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher," But why did you circle, the same thing as Farrah",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, Why did you think it is a right answer?,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher,"So, Oliver",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, I see that you said that you,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
206,Oliver,"I had kind of the same thinking and what I was thinking was basically that like the water was microscopic and I was thinking like, you can't",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
206,Oliver," You know what I mean, like,",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
206,Oliver,"I guess I was thinking, like, how did they find the water and it seems like they found the water using the microscope",,,,response,0,0,3
206,Teacher, So that answers the question,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, Nice work!,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher,Right,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher, That's great,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
206,Jazmin,"Yeah, I can say was just wondering, since I was thinking like that",,,110.2,response,0,0,3
206,Jazmin," It seemed like the Lunar Orbiter, we see that they use to discover the water",,,110.2,response,0,0,3
206,Jazmin, So is it both the microscope and the lunar orbiter is it just one?,,,110.2,response,0,0,3
206,Teacher,So it's actually both of them,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher," So in our text in the second bullet point, it says that NASA sent this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, they used both the Lunar Orbiter",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher,"And the microscope to explore these things and the lunar orbiter helped look for ice deposits, which is another form of water right I use is just frozen water so they use both of these things to explore the water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
206,Teacher,Yes Oliver,,,,remark,0,0,3
206,Oliver," I just wanted to thank you for, like, first of all, you really made sure that we kept going back into the text and being like,",,,,response,0,0,3
206,Oliver, But before we go to lunch,,,,response,0,0,3
206,Oliver,"Um, so, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,,response,0,0,3
206,Oliver,"What, what does it say in the reading and you were really beginning to help us make sure we were using evidence and in our answers",,,,response,0,0,3
206,Oliver, And that was especially cool,,,,response,0,0,3
206,Oliver,"And I think that was really cool and like what, seven and I you asked us, like why we came to our answer",,,,response,0,0,3
206,Oliver, So thank you so much for working with us,,,,response,0,0,3
206,Oliver, It was a lot of fun,,,,response,0,0,3
206,Oliver, Bye,,,,response,0,0,3
206,Oliver,Because it got me thinking about like how I think about stuff and like how I do it,,,,response,0,0,3
206,Oliver," So it was really cool when you're asking us, like how did we come to our answer",,,,response,0,0,3
206,Teacher,"Good afternoon class, how are you today",,,,remark,1,0,3
206,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"Well, you know what it's actually really important to foster collaboration and listen to our peers responses to help build on what you already know",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"It's great that you have background knowledge, though",,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,So do you all remember reading and answering the question and your notebooks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"All right, and",,,,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,the question what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"Farrah, can you tell me what you responded to that question",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
206,Farrah,yeah,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
206,Farrah,"I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,1,0,3
206,Teacher,So that is a great response,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher," i'm noticing that you use the text to support your answer, you used the two words scientific tool",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"As asked in the question, it says what equipment and that's answering what equipment they used and you said called a microscope so you referred backup to the text to help you answer this question",,,,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,Can you tell me why that's That was what your That was what you said,,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
206,Farrah,"Oh yeah okay um so cuz I was looking for like you said, the arm the words in a question I was looking for equipment and water on the moon, and I saw in paragraph three",,,230.1,response,1,0,3
206,Farrah,"They talk about finding water, which is what the question is asking about discovering water and then the lesson into the one that has the name of the equipment",,,,response,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"awesome so i'm noticing, you said you were referred exactly to where in the text you found your answer you said in paragraph three",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"I noticed the it said that they used a microscope to find water, and this is exactly what the question asks I really like how you referred back to the question to help support your answer",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"So now Jazmin, can you tell me what you answered what your answer was",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
206,Jazmin,yeah I said I said to small machine and I don't understand why my answers wrong,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"So I don't think your answers wrong, I think you have a really, really great start to a strong response so in the text, it does actually say NASA sent a small machine",,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"But if you think back to Farrah response, she said I referred to the text and I thought about the specific tools they used so if you look back into the text, what do you notice about the specific tools, it says they used to discover water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
206,Jazmin,Small machine called,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
206,Jazmin,I guess that it's called a lunar orbiter,,,,response,1,0,3
206,Teacher,awesome so see you just improved your response by just looking back you read you read that sentence and you strengthen your response,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"Okay, so now moving on to the second question, it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon, excuse me, could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,So I think that's a great start yeah awesome,,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"So, considering this wiki I yes oh yes",,,,remark,1,0,3
206,Jazmin,"um so I guess, I still don't know what what my answer should be do I just have to add the Lunar orbiter to the answer to make it right?",,,,response,1,0,3
206,Teacher,so you said okay well Farrah said that they use a microscope she looked back she thought about the,,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,So it's not about right or wrong here right it's about building on our response strengthening it with textual evidence in and looking at the key ideas in the question,,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"The tools, the equipment, she thought about the question and then by looking back in the text you did the same thing you looked in you found another thing that they use the how they discovered this water on the moon so by adding those key terms you're answering the question what equipment",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
206,Jazmin,"So, so if I say i'm NASA send a small machine quarterly in order to investigate",,,310.1,response,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"Maybe even what what are they investigating, if you think back to the question, what are they investigating what was that tool used for",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
206,Jazmin,To investigate,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
206,Jazmin,"Well, I mean the question says to discover water that's not the same thing as investigating water",,,,response,1,0,3
206,Teacher,it's very similar though right like they're investigating they're thinking about considering how they can find water on the moon so,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"it's not always going to be like super easy the same word in the text, sometimes you're going to have to think what synonyms are in the text, what other things might mean something similar to investigate or discover",,,420.3,remark,1,0,3
206,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.3,response,1,0,3
206,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,1,0,3
206,Chris,"Oh yeah I was thinking about some other specific equipment it's not in a story, but I did I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks mask suits",,,,response,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"Right, so that actually has to do with like the second question is great that you know that, and you can use that background knowledge",,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"To help you understand this question, but this question specifically is asking what what equipment they use to discover the water, yes, they do use that equipment to help them discover the water, but that is not the actual equipment that is discovering the water",,,410.1,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,1,0,3
206,Chris,"Oh yeah yeah Okay, I see what you're saying I see what you're saying okay um what for my answer um I guess",,,,response,1,0,3
206,Chris,i'm trying to think what did I miss okay so i've got the scientists on craters for water on the moon,,,,response,1,0,3
206,Chris,Scientists found,,,,response,1,0,3
206,Chris,Which one,,,,response,1,0,3
206,Chris,"Is Farrah right or is Jazmin right which which equipment, one is right",,,,response,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"There both right, because in the text it actually talks about both of those things that were used to discover the water on the moon so",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"i'm i'm noticing in your response, it says scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"So you're saying that they were able to discover water on the moon, but you're not necessarily saying what equipment they used so in order to strengthen your response, you might want to add something about the equipment that they use much like Farrah and Jazmin added",,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
206,Chris,"Okay, oh so like scientists",,,430.2,response,1,0,3
206,Chris,Use the Lunar orbiter to,,,,response,1,0,3
206,Chris,"Find craters for water, the moon",,,,response,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"Sorry, what was that",,,,remark,1,0,3
206,Chris,I was adding lunar orbiter into my answers oh scientists use the Lunar orbiter to find craters full of water on the moon,,,,response,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"awesome so you started with they found these creators of water and then you, you referred back to the question you thought about your peers responses and you ended up adding the equipment that they used",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"Yes, that works, it does",,,,remark,1,0,3
206,Oliver,Oh,,,,response,1,0,3
206,Oliver,"Sorry sorry to interrupt teacher, but I was looking at the clock and actually it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later okay",,,,response,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"All right, thank you",,,,remark,1,0,3
206,Teacher,"Good afternoon class and welcome back, how are you",,,,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,i'm good good to,,,,remark,2,0,3
206,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"You know what then we can actually just build on your background knowledge in your understanding that you already have, I think it's great that you already know a lot about space, but it's really important to build on that knowledge",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,So today,,,,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,do you all remember answering this question?,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,considering our reading that we've already done we're going to consider the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,yeah yeah,,,,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,alright,,,,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"So today Chris, could you tell me what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon, could you read your answer to me?",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
206,Chris,yeah,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
206,Chris,Oh scientist phone critters all scientists fall for water,,,,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"Right so actually in the text, it does say that they found creators of water on the moon so you're you're telling me that you know they did in fact discover water on the moon",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"but if you look at the question, can you tell me what a key word you're missing is",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
206,Chris,yeah I just heard it when I was reading my answer when you said what equipment was,,,230.3,response,2,0,3
206,Chris,i'm missing equipment,,,,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,Right so just building on your response that you already have let's look back in the text it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,So that's the type of equipment isn't it,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"yeah yeah and it says that if it landed at the south Pole and looks for ice deposits and then, if we look at the next paragraph it talks about how the water was so so tiny that they needed a microscope",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,So if you build on your answer that you already have what might you add to strengthen your response,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
206,Chris,Scientists phone creators for water on the moon,,,210.3,response,2,0,3
206,Chris,with the lunar orbiter,,,,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"So now you're answering every part of the question you're answering what equipment they use you're telling me restating that they discovered water on the moon, so, can you tell me how your answer changed from the beginning",,,530.1,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"When you said that they found craters of waterfall on the moon, to the end when you added that they used those two tool",,,,remark,2,0,3
206,Chris,i'm OK,,,,response,2,0,3
206,Chris,"OK, I didn't have the name of any equipment in my answer, and then I added the names of pieces of equipment in mind",,,,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"Alright, so i'm noticing that you really strengthen your response from the start to the end you really use that you're thinking and you use the text to support you",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"Alright, so now Oliver, can you tell me what you answered what you said",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
206,Oliver,yeah um well I took all the same thing,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
206,Farrah,yeah and I don't understand why my answer was wrong,,,,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,Who said that sorry I missed that,,,,remark,2,0,3
206,Farrah,Me,,,,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"OK OK so Farrah, can you tell me what you said",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
206,Farrah,yeah,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
206,Farrah,I said on scientists use know you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"So Farrah,",,,,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"and Oliver so Oliver, can you tell me why you circled the same thing as Farrah?",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
206,Oliver,"um yeah cuz I was looking for all of the key words in the question, like how you said",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
206,Oliver,i'm always looking for,,,,response,2,0,3
206,Oliver,"equipment and discover and water and the moon, and that was the only place that had all of the parts in it",,,,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,awesome okay so Farrah looking at your response and then looking back at the text you're saying you need a specific scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"If you refer back to the text, and you think about what Chris added to his response you're correct in saying that you do need a microscope to be able to see this water, but if you look at paragraph two, can you tell me what machine NASA sent to discover the water?",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
206,Farrah,They said the lunar orbiter well how do you know that they sent it to discover the water,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,It says in the next sentence this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater and it says that how they're really strong and yeah,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
206,Farrah,yeah I was looking for the word water I forgot I didn't because they didn't actually say water in this in the paragraph about the Lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"can you tell me, building on the response that you already have what might you add to make it a little bit stronger?",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"yeah it's a little bit tricky you have to think about other forms of water, like you have to think about ice or like gases, you know it give me a little bit tricky so",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
206,Farrah,you'd need,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
206,Farrah,A scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,awesome so i'm noticing you started with a really strong response and then you added the the actual specific tool that they initially discovered water on the moon with right?,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,So Oliver does that make sense to you too?,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
206,Oliver,"yeah I think so, so we just have to say, both of the names of the equipment in our answer",,,150.1,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"Right, but why, why is it important to include both of those names of the tools",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
206,Oliver,because  they used both of them to find the water,,,230.1,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,Exactly,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,2,0,3
206,Chris,Okay,,,,response,2,0,3
206,Chris,"I was just thinking about some other equipment, you know that the scientists use because I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks",,,,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"yeah so that equipment is used for the scientists themselves right and but do they need that equipment to actually discover the water on the moon, does the Lunar orbiter where that equip excuse me equipment on the moon?",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
206,Chris,"No, no it's a machine",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"Right so so maybe if an asteroid is going to lower the things the moon, that would be beneficial and necessary for them to have in order to discover water on the moon, but the machines they send don't need that equipment in order to successfully explore the water on the moon right",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
206,Chris,"Right okay yeah I wasn't even thinking about that maybe they didn't have the astronauts on the moon that they just sent the machine by itself, I just I figured the astronauts were there with the machine",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"Right, so the astronauts maybe they're up in their spaceship their rocket ship up there, and then they send this tool out to investigate before they would go right",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
206,Chris,yeah yeah that makes sense,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
206,Oliver,When you were talking to Farrah and Chris like why I would have to add both of the machines there until you kind of asked me,,,,response,2,0,3
206,Oliver,Until yeah so that was useful for me,,,,response,2,0,3
206,Teacher,"thanks for that feedback Oliver, enjoy lunch everyone",,,,remark,2,0,3
206,Oliver,Thanks,,,,response,2,0,3
208,Teacher,"Hi, everyone",,,,remark,0,,
208,Oliver,Hi,,,,response,0,,
208,Teacher,So can you guys tell me a little bit about what do you think this equipment looks like? Luis?,,,120.4,remark,0,,
208,Teacher, So you guys just answered what object did-- I'm so sorry,,,120.2,remark,0,,
208,Teacher,My name is Teacher ,,,120.2,remark,0,,
208,Teacher," What equipment did the scientists used to discover water in the moon, right? OK",,,120.2,remark,0,,
208,Luis,"Well, I was just going to say, I kind of know all about space already",,,120.4,response,0,,
208,Luis, So I don't even think I should be in this group,,,120.4,response,0,,
208,Teacher, What do you think?,,,110.3,remark,0,,
208,Teacher,"Oh, maybe you can tell us and share what you know it does so we also can know about it",,,110.3,remark,0,,
208,Luis,"OK, I'll do that",,,110.3,response,0,,
208,Teacher, Do you want to start?,,,120.4,remark,0,,
208,Teacher,That sounds great,,,120.4,remark,0,,
208,Luis,"Yeah, so my answer to the question was that scientists use lots of equipment, like oxygen tanks and stuff like that",,,120.4,response,0,,
208,Teacher,"That's right, but do you know what object did they use to find water in the moon?",,,120.1,remark,0,,
208,Luis,"I think the same stuff, like they use oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that",,,120.1,response,0,,
208,Luis, I think they used the same thing,,,120.1,response,0,,
208,Teacher," However, they needed to use a specific equipment to really, really find water because it was very, very hard to find",,,410.3,remark,0,,
208,Teacher,They did use that because we can not breathe the air in the moon,,,410.3,remark,0,,
208,Teacher," So we did use that, Luis",,,410.3,remark,0,,
208,Teacher, You're totally right about that one,,,410.3,remark,0,,
208,Teacher," They needed an equipment to look very, very close to that little block of ice, and then they would see if there is water in there",,,210.4,remark,0,,
208,Teacher,"So even if you're looking straight to it, you wouldn't be able to tell if it was there or not",,,210.4,remark,0,,
208,Teacher," One second, Farrah",,,210.4,remark,0,,
208,Teacher," Farrah, you want to share something with us?",,,210.4,remark,0,,
208,Teacher, So they needed an equipment that would help them,,,210.4,remark,0,,
208,Teacher, I'll be right back with you,,,210.4,remark,0,,
208,Farrah," So it sounds like you were saying that they use something to find the small water, and I was thinking that-- because I said that they must have used the microscope",,,210.4,response,0,,
208,Farrah,"Yeah, I guess I was wondering",,,210.4,response,0,,
208,Farrah, So I guess I was wondering why my answer was wrong?,,,210.4,response,0,,
208,Teacher,"Yes, that's exactly what's the word I was looking for",,,110.2,remark,0,,
208,Teacher,"But for that, they have something very similar that they take it to the space so they can actually find that",,,210.4,remark,0,,
208,Teacher," They needed a microscope to really, really see what the ice was like",,,110.2,remark,0,,
208,Teacher, OK?,,,210.4,remark,0,,
208,Teacher, OK?,,,130.3,remark,0,,
208,Teacher, And then the name for it-- it's lunar orbiter,,,130.3,remark,0,,
208,Teacher," And then it looks very, very close to the surface, and they look for ice deposit in li-- Chris?",,,210.4,remark,0,,
208,Teacher,So that's kind of like a little microscope,,,210.4,remark,0,,
208,Teacher,So it's basically a microscope so they can see really deep in the picture,,,130.3,remark,0,,
208,Chris, So they didn't need that stuff,,,130.3,response,0,,
208,Chris,"Oh, I was just wondering because I've been to NASA with my dad, and we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff",,,130.3,response,0,,
208,Teacher,They did need that,,,130.1,remark,0,,
208,Teacher,But they also bringing a huge machine that it's called lunar orbiter,,,130.3,remark,0,,
208,Teacher, Luis was right about that one,,,130.1,remark,0,,
208,Teacher," Oliveron? I mean Oliver, sorry",,,130.3,remark,0,,
208,Teacher," And this is equipment that the scientists brought to the moon, it was like a microscope",,,130.3,remark,0,,
208,Teacher," They use that, as well",,,130.1,remark,0,,
208,Teacher, It was just like I was telling Luis,,,130.1,remark,0,,
208,Oliver," And in particular, I wanted to thank you for especially encouraging us to draw on our background knowledge",,,130.1,response,0,,
208,Oliver, Thank you for letting us share,,,130.1,response,0,,
208,Oliver," But before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you for working with us",,,130.1,response,0,,
208,Oliver,"Yeah, I just was going to say unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,130.1,response,0,,

210,Luis,"um so I was just gonna say that um basically um I I kind of already know, like all about space, and I know that we're like here in the group to to help us with our answers, but I don't think I really belong here, as I already know all about",,,,response,1,0,2
210,Teacher,A good attitude to keep is that never know,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2

210,Teacher,Next i'm going to give you another two minutes after that i'll time it and i'll let you guys know and i'm going to give you two highlighters with different colors,,,,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,"You are going to use one highlighter to highlight two examples of equipment that they used on the moon specific examples, at least two examples",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,And then you are going to use the other colored highlighter to highlight at least two examples,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,"of why finding water on the moon, is important",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,Does anybody have any questions before we start,,,,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,Go ahead Jazmin you had your hand up first,,,,remark,1,0,2

210,Teacher,"Okay yeah let's go back into your answer you had said that NASA send a small machine, this is not incorrect, they did send a small machine, however, in the text it provided the",,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,Actual name of what that machine was so i'd like to see a bit more specific detail to know exactly what that small machine was,,,410.2,remark,1,0,2

210,Chris,yeah I can hear you,,,,response,1,0,2
210,Teacher,Good i'm going to give you two colored highlighters they're going to be different colors with one color you are going to highlight two examples of specific equipment that they used on the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,"Then, with the other colored highlighter you're going to",,,,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,start with the other colored highlighter you're going to highlight specifically two examples of why finding water on the moon would be well,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
210,Chris,"Does that answer your question yeah that's that makes sense Okay, I think I can do that",,,210.4,response,1,0,2
210,Teacher,"awesome I am going to start your two minute timer to read the text really closely, if you finish before two minutes go ahead and read it again your two minutes, starting now to read",,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
210,Oliver,"We can read super fast, so we we did our two minutes",,,120.3,response,1,0,2

210,Teacher,yeah okay,,,,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,i'm going to give you another minute then,,,,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,And you can use your two different colored highlighters,,,,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,"and find two examples of equipment news done the moon, and two examples of why finding water on the moon will be helpful, after the one minute i'm going to check in and see if you guys need any more time",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,and your minute starts now,,,,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,0,2

210,Teacher,you're reading one through six but you'll find your first answer the equipment in one through three,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,and your second,,,,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,and your second question,,,,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,In three through six,,,,remark,1,0,2

210,Teacher,"let's just go left to right Farrah, what do you have for the first question, what are some examples of equipment found on the moon",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
210,Farrah,"Okay, so I highlighted two things first I highlighted the microscope because I thought that was something that you really mean like would be important",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
210,Farrah,"And then, as I was reading closely, I saw that like another thing like a piece of equipment that you use on the moon, is this thing called the orbiter",,,,response,1,0,2
210,Teacher,You did an awesome job to that,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,um to make this a little easier did anybody have any answers that were different from savannas,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,"Now, oh Chris, did you have an answer those different from savannas",,,,remark,1,0,2
210,Chris,"um yeah I think I might be not quite right, though, but what I said was, I said that the the craters I don't know if it's equipment, but I thought that maybe you could think of it as equipment, because it holds the water, you know what I mean",,,,response,1,0,2
210,Teacher,"backed up why you said, because if you had just said that you put creator down I probably would have marked it as a wrong answer, but now that you're saying to me that they used it is used to hold water, it is a very good",,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,it's a very good thought,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,um what I would say to that,,,,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,Is,,,,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,That while it could be used as equipment to hold it's not necessarily something that the scientists used to discover the water,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
210,Chris,"Oh so it's the the equipment that like found the water so, even if it was in the crater it's not like the crater was equipment to find it",,,210.4,response,1,0,2
210,Teacher,"Exactly, but you did an awesome job backing up your answer, I really liked that",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,1,0,2

210,Teacher,bye,,,,remark,1,0,2
210,Teacher,I loved your guys responses looking at it,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
210,Teacher,But I think we could do a little bit better and get a lot more of a specific answer so i'm going to have us do the same activity that we did with the first question,,,220.1,remark,2,0,2
210,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,2,0,2
210,Luis,"On so I guess like kind of what I was thinking is that, like so I learned a lot from our last session and I do that i'm probably pretty good now, I think I understand that",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Teacher,"Well there's always always more to learn that's how you get really good at something you don't think that you've learned it all, you always have an open mind to learn more",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
210,Luis,"Okay, I got it",,,150.1,response,2,0,2
210,Teacher,awesome,,,,remark,2,0,2

210,Teacher,"The second section paragraphs three, through six of the text, and then I want you to highlight two specific examples of how water on the moon could be valuable",,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
210,Teacher,So i'm going to give you one minute to review the text you guys can let me know if you're done before that,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
210,Teacher,And then i'm going to give you another minute after to highlight those two examples and then we'll come together and share does anybody have any questions before we start,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
210,Teacher,"No all right i'm starting your timer and I want you to really closely reread those stats second section paragraphs three, through six go ahead and start",,,,remark,2,0,2
210,Oliver,All right,,,,response,2,0,2
210,Teacher,You guys are all finished,,,,remark,2,0,2
210,Teacher,yeah awesome,,,,remark,2,0,2
210,Teacher,So now i'm giving your highlighters you're going to go through those sex that section that you just read and I want you to highlight at least two examples of how water could be a valuable resource on the moon anybody have any questions before we start that,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
210,Teacher,"All right, go ahead and get started",,,,remark,2,0,2
210,Oliver,"All right, we got",,,,response,2,0,2

210,Teacher,"All right, so last time we started with Farrah so i'm going to switch it up a little and ask Chris to go ahead and start",,,,remark,2,0,2
210,Chris,All right,,,,response,2,0,2
210,Teacher,So what two examples in the text did you highlight that shown that water is a valuable resource on the moon,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
210,Chris,"Okay, so I saw a couple things that jumped out to me so one thing I saw is that, like astronauts could drink the water and like that's really important",,,210.3,response,2,0,2
210,Chris,"Because like you have to drink water to survive and so that was really important, as you could drink the water so that's one thing that's huge",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Chris,"And then another thing that's useful, is that you can use it to make oxygen to people so like that was saying that maybe they were going to put a moon base on the moon, and I was thinking well, they could use the water to make oxygen and to breath",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Teacher,Teacher:Great,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
210,Teacher,let's see Luis did you have anything different today,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
210,Luis,um yeah I mean I kind of noticed a couple things so one of the things that I noticed was that,,,130.2,response,2,0,2
210,Luis,"Like I circled the same thing as Chris, for the first part, I put down that you could drink the water, because I know how important it is to drink the water, but I also said that you could make walk it",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Luis,"Like that just just out of each to Oh, I think, is the chemical sign for water, you can rock it yeah yeah",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Teacher,"Those are awesome answers, and I was great job, knowing that i'm waters chemical was h2o that was awesome Jazmin what's up",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2

210,Jazmin,quite sure when i'm confused about like i'm not quite sure like a we certainly are we're highlighting the things that we need to do,,,,response,2,0,2
210,Jazmin,That that like we can use the water for is that right,,,,response,2,0,2
210,Teacher,yeah that is correct,,,110.4,remark,2,0,2
210,Jazmin,"Okay, that makes sense because",,,110.4,response,2,0,2
210,Jazmin,That makes sense,,,,response,2,0,2
210,Teacher,"that's all right so yeah i'll clarify that a little bit when I say let's think of examples of why water is a valuable resource or a valuable resources, something that we can use, so we are highlighting what are some ways we can use water, the water that's on the moon",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
210,Jazmin,Oh that's okay,,,210.2,response,2,0,2
210,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,2,0,2
210,Jazmin,"I just didn't quite get the question right, the first time",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Jazmin,"um yeah so I was thinking about the moon base, and I was thinking about the fact that, like they were maybe going to do that for 2024",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Jazmin,"And it made me think a little bit about like they couldn't do a moon base if they did have water because, just like",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Jazmin,"Chris and Luis were saying like you have to use water to bring but then you can also use water to make rocket fuel and you can use water to make oxygen so you can breathe in the in the space, like the little the base on the moon, which is pretty cool",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Teacher,I think so to water is a super valuable resource wherever you go,,,110.4,remark,2,0,2
210,Teacher,"All right, you guys did an awesome job Jazmin after I clarified that for you do you have any new answers",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
210,Jazmin,"yeah so Okay, so I think when I look at it, one of the things that jumped out was",,,210.3,response,2,0,2
210,Jazmin,"was interesting so like they said that it might be hard to extract some of the water, so it made me think like what kinda",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Jazmin,"You know what I mean like what kind of equipment with the to be able to bring out the water, but it seems like because we're able to drill on earth, that we would be able to do it, so I guess well Okay, so I guess, I understand that, like",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Jazmin,"That the water is a big thing that you could drink the water, and you can also it sounds like rocket fuel",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Jazmin,And you can make,,,,response,2,0,2
210,Jazmin,"oxygen and then like to be able to do that, like what they have like a couple plans for how they might do it, it seems very possible to",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Jazmin,"Make it seems like something that they could do, and I know that Farrah and depth, but maybe it will be a long time before they do it, but I guess, I think, maybe could be done really quickly",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Teacher,I think of a lot of people put their minds to it could be done a lot quicker but there's a lot of things like money and time and just everything that goes into it so hopefully it'll get done sooner than that but,,,210.1,remark,2,0,2
210,Teacher,"we'll see, I guess, yes stuff",,,,remark,2,0,2
210,Oliver,"So, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular, I really wanted",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Oliver,"to thank you for helping us first off to like correct our misconceptions because we have a lot of different ideas, but they weren't always like accurate",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Oliver,So you helped us understand like kind of what we needed to focus on,,,,response,2,0,2
210,Oliver,"And you also reminded us to use the evidence from the text and, like even more than that you asked us about how we were thinking about stuff",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Oliver,"So when we talk about how we like think about stuff you know what I mean it helps us to sort of figure out how we got the answer, and maybe make even better answers next time and um yeah it was really interesting",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Oliver,"That you, you really value our our answers",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Oliver,And because of that it was really,,,,response,2,0,2
210,Oliver,comfortable to share,,,,response,2,0,2
210,Oliver,So it probably,,,,response,2,0,2
210,Oliver,"We could share out in the class, even if we were you know wrong because you would help us to learn like maybe what was more correct that was really cool Thank you so much, it was really fun",,,,response,2,0,2
210,Teacher,Thank you so much for that feedback,,,,remark,2,0,2
215,Teacher,"Hi everyone, so",,,,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, We're going to talk about that Luis what's your question,,,120.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,Before even before I answer your question,,,120.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, I'm just gonna review what we're going to go over,,,120.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, So we're gonna talk about the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,,
215,Luis, Like all the stuff about space,,,120.2,response,0,,
215,Luis," So, like, I don't really think I even need to be in this group",,,120.2,response,0,,
215,Luis, I know,,,120.2,response,0,,
215,Luis,"Um, well, I was just gonna say that",,,120.2,response,0,,
215,Teacher, So I think you're going to be a pretty vital part of our group,,,110.3,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,"Well, you can you can then if you know questions that you might know the answers to questions that some of I might need help with or some of our classmates might need help with",,,110.3,remark,0,,
215,Luis,"Yeah, sounds really cool",,,110.3,response,0,,
215,Teacher," So Luis since you said you know a lot about space, can you answer the question for us what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon from our water on the moon text",,,120.4,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, All right,,,120.4,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,Yeah,,,120.4,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, Do you remember what the equipment they used,,,120.4,remark,0,,
215,Luis, So I was I was saying that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and and stuff like that,,,120.4,response,0,,
215,Luis,"Well, yeah",,,120.4,response,0,,
215,Teacher,"Yeah, they definitely use those",,,110.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,who can raise their hand and what isn't it,,,130.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,"Do you, if you look back into our texts called water on the moon,",,,210.4,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,What is a piece of equipment that the scientists use in that text,,,210.4,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,"That Luis didn't say, how about Farrah",,,130.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, What did,,,130.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, What did what equipment and I use,,,130.2,remark,0,,
215,Farrah,"So I believe they use the microscope because you, you said that we should look at the text",,,130.2,response,0,,
215,Farrah, It's like saying that the waters microscopic so like I think that's it,,,130.2,response,0,,
215,Farrah," So why I believe that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to see, and then the text",,,130.2,response,0,,
215,Teacher,"That that definitely is it to a microscope is a tool, but I like Farrah, what you did is they use the word the water they found is microscopic",,,410.3,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,But they never said they need to use a microscope,,,410.3,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, Remember,,,410.3,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, But since they use the word microscopic that kind of infers that they needed to use a microscope,,,410.3,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,For the next for the next person who answers,,,130.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,Kind of look in the text and,,,210.4,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, Who can remember a type of tool that the scientists used while they were on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,"Yeah, Jazmin",,,,remark,0,,
215,Jazmin," So basically, I was in, say, NASA sent this small machine and am I supposed to say like more than that",,,,response,0,,
215,Jazmin,"And so basically, okay",,,,response,0,,
215,Jazmin, So to use the text that you sent,,,,response,0,,
215,Teacher,"Yeah, so I so that the sentence that Jazmin is referring to is in the second paragraph, it says, NASA send a small machine Jazmin",,,210.4,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, Can you read us the rest of that sentence,,,210.4,remark,0,,
215,Jazmin,Yeah okay so,,,210.4,response,0,,
215,Jazmin, So it's the lunar orbiter right,,,,response,0,,
215,Jazmin,NASA sentence,,,,response,0,,
215,Jazmin, She called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,,response,0,,
215,Teacher, Who agrees with Jazmin who agrees that the lunar orbiter was a tool that the scientists use,,,130.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,I think so,,,130.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,They're not saying it would make it more it would make more sense if they said,,,210.4,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, So the scientists did use a tool called the Lunar Orbiter,,,110.4,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,That's right,,,110.4,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,"NASA send a small tool because it's asking us or sent a small piece of equipment, since we're talking about the equipment they use, but a machine is also kind of like the equipment yeah Jazmin",,,210.4,remark,0,,
215,Jazmin,Since I was just,,,210.4,response,0,,
215,Jazmin," You know what I mean like I my original answer was saying like NASA sent a small machine, I was just wondering, like what was, what, what was wrong with that answer",,,,response,0,,
215,Jazmin,I guess I don't understand why my answers were wrong,,,,response,0,,
215,Teacher, So let's look back at the question we're going to answer,,,120.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, Great question,,,120.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher," And I think that might help answer your question, Jazmin",,,120.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,Sure,,,120.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,"So, Jazmin you answered with NASA send a small machine",,,230.3,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,So the question we're answering is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher," So am I right to say that you, you said the equipment they used was a small machine",,,230.3,remark,0,,
215,Jazmin,"Yes, yes, the equipment was the small machine",,,230.3,response,0,,
215,Teacher,Sure,,,420.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher," So, that that is a correct answer a small machine I were just looking, I guess I'm just looking for more specific, so later in the sentence, they get a little bit more specific",,,420.2,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,About what those small machine is called,,,210.4,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, Do you remember what the small machine was called,,,210.4,remark,0,,
215,Jazmin," But I should have said, Like what the actual like machine was and the machine was the was the lunar orbiter right",,,210.4,response,0,,
215,Jazmin,"Yeah, okay",,,210.4,response,0,,
215,Jazmin," Okay, so I think I understand",,,210.4,response,0,,
215,Jazmin," I said, NASA sent a small machine",,,210.4,response,0,,
215,Teacher,Exactly,,,110.4,remark,0,,
215,Teacher," All right, Chris",,,,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,Exactly,,,,remark,0,,
215,Chris," And I wondering like, did they not use those things",,,,response,0,,
215,Chris,"Yeah, I just was gonna say, I was wondering, like, scientists like when my dad took me to NASA, we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and stuff like that",,,,response,0,,
215,Teacher, Who thinks that the scientists only use the equipment that they talked about in the passage or do you think the scientists use other equipment as well as the equipment in the passage,,,210.3,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, So when,,,210.3,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,That's a great question,,,210.3,remark,0,,
215,Teacher, So who thinks,,,210.3,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,Do you think the passage list all the equipment they used or just a few of the common,,,210.3,remark,0,,
215,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,0,,
215,Farrah,"I think just some of the equipment, because they have lots like hundreds, maybe even thousands of pieces of equipment so like how could they",,,,response,0,,
215,Farrah,"You and I mean, I think that's the most an unfortunately we have to go to lunch, but we don't have much",,,,response,0,,
215,Farrah, I just wanted to thank you for,,,,response,0,,
215,Farrah,"Working with us and, in particular, I wanted to thank you for making sure that we were looking at the text and like drawing from the meeting or like what we were saying",,,,response,0,,
215,Farrah, You know what I mean,,,,response,0,,
215,Farrah,And also you look help us understand like we were beginning to sort of clarify and things like this is how we thought about this,,,,response,0,,
215,Teacher,"Yeah, it",,,,remark,0,,
215,Farrah, So thank you so much for working with us,,,,response,0,,
215,Farrah,helped us make sure that we were on like understanding the key words in the question and helping us to use evidence from the text in the answer,,,,response,0,,
215,Teacher,"Yeah, bye",,,,remark,0,,
216,Teacher, I just have a question for you to think about,,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher," When you are giving a response after reading a text, it's always a good idea to include evidence",,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,"Hi, friends",,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher, Thank you for sharing your responses on that reading,,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher, Does anyone know what ways they can include evidence? Luis?,,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group",,,420.2,response,0,,
216,Luis, I already know all about space,,,420.2,response,0,,
216,Teacher, So do you have anything to share about including evidence?,,,120.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher, We are talking about including evidence to support our answers,,,120.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,Oh,,,120.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher," Thank you, Luis",,,120.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher, Right now we are not talking about space,,,120.2,remark,0,,
216,Luis,"Well, I know that we're supposed to do that every time we answer a question",,,120.2,response,0,,
216,Teacher, Does anyone know what that means?,,,210.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,You're right,,,210.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher, Does anyone have any ideas of how we can share evidence? Sometimes we can use a quote,,,210.2,remark,0,,
216,Farrah," OK, I don't know",,,210.2,response,0,,
216,Farrah, I do remember that,,,210.2,response,0,,
216,Farrah," We learned that if somebody says something, then you can say what they said, I think",,,210.2,response,0,,
216,Farrah,Oh,,,210.2,response,0,,
216,Farrah," Oh, yeah, yeah",,,210.2,response,0,,
216,Teacher, It could just be anything that's written on the text,,,210.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher," You can quote someone that said something, or you can quote what the author says, what the text says",,,210.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher, It doesn't have to be a quote of what someone says in the text,,,210.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,"You're right, Farrah",,,210.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher, And can we all think about why we chose to say those things? And see if you can find the part of the text that tells you to say that,,,230.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher, You can go now,,,230.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,"So can we go back right now, and we can all look at our responses, think about what we said",,,230.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,"OK, raise your hand when you're finished",,,150.1,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,"Farrah, what did you add to your thoughts? How are you going to support your thoughts?",,,230.2,remark,0,,
216,Farrah," So when I looked back, I actually circled a quote already from the text because my answer was the last sentence in the story",,,230.2,response,0,,
216,Farrah,OK,,,230.2,response,0,,
216,Teacher,OK,,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher," So sometimes if we just include the quote, we also want to include our own thoughts to make the quote expand our thoughts with the quote",,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher," So it's kind of two pieces you need is your own thoughts and the author's thoughts, the writer's thoughts",,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,"Luis, I know that you talked INAUDIBLE]",,,,remark,0,,
216,Farrah, Mahoney?,,,,response,0,,
216,Farrah,Ms,,,,response,0,,
216,,INAUDIBLE,,,,,0,,
216,Farrah,Yeah,,,,response,0,,
216,Teacher,Yes?,,,,remark,0,,
216,Farrah,I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,0,,
216,Teacher,OK,,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher," So we want to also look at the question because sometimes we might find something that's in the text and we might say it, and it's very true, but it has nothing to do with the question that was asked",,,130.1,remark,0,,
216,Teacher," I don't want you to think about it as right and wrong, but we can always make our answers better, right? So the more details we add can make them better",,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,"Also, sometimes you might answer and your answer is not wrong, but it's not answering the question that was asked",,,130.1,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,"So that's another thing we want to consider when we're thinking of our answers, is does this answer the question that's being asked? Because sometimes our answers are very true and relate to the story but are not related to the original question",,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Farrah,"Yeah, yeah",,,420.2,response,0,,
216,Teacher," And your background knowledge is very beneficial, and I love how you have that",,,310.1,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,Awesome,,,310.1,remark,0,,
216,Teacher," Luis, I know that you were talking about all your knowledge",,,310.1,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,So did you think about how that knowledge relates to the question and the story that we read?,,,230.1,remark,0,,
216,Luis," So that part, I feel like that's how my knowledge relates because I know that they need oxygen tanks in order to breathe on the moon",,,310.1,response,0,,
216,Luis,"Well, how my knowledge relates-- how my knowledge relates to the question and the story",,,310.1,response,0,,
216,Luis," Well, I mean, so I know that the astronauts need equipment in order to go to the moon",,,310.1,response,0,,
216,Teacher,And did you find the part of the story that you could quote that said anything about oxygen tanks?,,,230.2,remark,0,,
216,Luis,"No, I couldn't find anything in there",,,230.2,response,0,,
216,Teacher," And if you have more information to add, that's great",,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher, But we really want to focus on what we're reading,,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,"No? So maybe you already knew that piece of information, but you can find another piece of information from the text",,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher, You can add that later,,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher," So right now we're focusing on stuff you can find from the text, and we always want to do that first",,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,"Because part of what we're doing is not just to learn about science, but it's also to practice reading strategies",,,220.1,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,120.4,remark,0,,
216,Teacher, Do you have something to add?,,,120.4,remark,0,,
216,Chris," I mean, it's about science, though",,,120.4,response,0,,
216,Chris," But I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,120.4,response,0,,
216,Chris, It's not about the story,,,120.4,response,0,,
216,Chris,Yeah,,,120.4,response,0,,
216,Teacher, So that's really cool,,,110.3,remark,0,,
216,Teacher, Thank you for sharing,,,110.3,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,That's really cool,,,110.3,remark,0,,
216,Teacher, And I'd love for us to get a chance for you to share that maybe during a show-and-tell,,,110.3,remark,0,,
216,Teacher," And maybe when we're doing a bigger writing assignment about this unit, we can include some of the details that we already learned from other places, like maybe Luis's read other books about space, and you've been to NASA",,,110.3,remark,0,,
216,Chris,"OK, OK",,,110.3,response,0,,
216,Chris, That sounds really cool,,,110.3,response,0,,
216,Teacher,"Oliver, do you have anything to add? I haven't heard from you",,,120.4,remark,0,,
216,Oliver,"Well, I was looking at my answer when you told us to all look for where we found everything, but I circled the last sentence, just like Farrah",,,120.4,response,0,,
216,Oliver," So I was just trying to think if what you told Farrah, I guess, is the same for me",,,120.4,response,0,,
216,Teacher,"Yeah, so do you remember what I said to Farrah?",,,150.1,remark,0,,
216,Oliver,That she's gotta say stuff in her own words,,,150.1,response,0,,
216,Oliver, She can't just pull the quote from the story,,,150.1,response,0,,
216,Teacher, That way we can back up our answer with evidence from the story,,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher,Exactly,,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Teacher," We want to say both, right? We always want to use our own words and also include some of the author's words or thoughts",,,420.2,remark,0,,
216,Oliver, Ms,,,420.2,response,0,,
216,Oliver,Yeah,,,420.2,response,0,,
216,Oliver," This was really short, but I really appreciate how you really helped us think about how we found evidence from the story and our answer or how we needed to add more work and not just the evidence from the story, like me and Farrah",,,420.2,response,0,,
216,Oliver," Mahoney, I just saw the clock, and it's time for us to go to lunch",,,420.2,response,0,,
216,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,0,,
216,Teacher," Well, we can all line up now and put our tablets away so we can go enjoy lunch",,,,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,"OK, I cannot somehow make the screen big but-- Hi, everyone!",,,,remark,0,,
221,Oliver,Hi,,,,response,0,,
221,Teacher,"OK, so now, hearing back from all of your responses and everything, they sound amazing, but we do have to talk a little bit about getting our minds a little bit deeper in the text",,,150.1,remark,0,,
221,Teacher," Yes, Luis, I believe",,,150.1,remark,0,,
221,Luis,"Yeah, it's me, Luis",,,150.1,response,0,,
221,Luis, I already know all about space,,,150.1,response,0,,
221,Luis," Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group",,,150.1,response,0,,
221,Teacher,"And that's OK, sometimes we need to know a little bit deeper",,,110.3,remark,0,,
221,Teacher, And maybe just help our other classmates to understand just what we're talking about and maybe get our minds going a little bit,,,110.3,remark,0,,
221,Luis,OK,,,110.3,response,0,,
221,Teacher,"So now, we're going to go more into the thinking aspect of answering the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?",,,120.2,remark,0,,
221,Teacher," OK, now, I saw a lot of vocabulary that you guys used in your responses and that's amazing",,,310.1,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,Sounds good,,,310.1,remark,0,,
221,Teacher, And you did a really good job with that,,,310.1,remark,0,,
221,Teacher, Farrah?,,,210.4,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,"So let's talk about the actual tools that were used, which I know some of you used in your explanation",,,210.4,remark,0,,
221,Teacher," Anybody want to raise their hand and just list, maybe, one of the tools that were used, a specific tool that the scientists used",,,210.4,remark,0,,
221,Farrah,"Yeah, I said that they used the microscope",,,210.4,response,0,,
221,Teacher,"And that's right and we saw that in, I believe, the third part of the--",,,210.4,remark,0,,
221,Farrah,"Yeah, in paragraph 3",,,210.4,response,0,,
221,Teacher, You need a scientific tool called a microscope,,,210.4,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,#NAME?,,,210.4,remark,0,,
221,Teacher," OK, and they used that in a specific line which Farrah noticed, when they set the water they found is microscopic, meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you're looking straight at it",,,210.4,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,"Now, when Farrah found that, did you look at the text and reread it to notice that they said a scientific tool?",,,230.2,remark,0,,
221,Farrah," And so that's how I found it there, but I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,230.2,response,0,,
221,Farrah,"Oh, well, I noticed that the first time because I was looking for the word equipment and then I didn't see equipment",,,230.2,response,0,,
221,Farrah," So when I was looking for it, I was looking for anything else that might be equipment and also that it talks about water",,,230.2,response,0,,
221,Teacher,It's not wrong at all,,,110.2,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,"So what you did was you answered the question, but we need more tools to, maybe, think further on our answers",,,420.2,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,"So using the tool that you used, was really good to take equipment and look through the text and examine it, right?",,,310.1,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,So that's what you did,,,310.1,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,Does anybody else have any ideas about tools?,,,130.2,remark,0,,
221,Teacher, You looked through and you tried to find the word that fitted,,,310.1,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,"But maybe we can use another tool like rereading through all of the text, right? And then, if we reread through the text, we can find a little bit more details and maybe even more of the tools that came up within the article",,,420.2,remark,0,,
221,Jazmin,They said that NASA sent a small machine,,,130.2,response,0,,
221,Teacher,"I'm sorry, could you send it one more time",,,,remark,0,,
221,Jazmin,"Yeah, I said that NASA sent a small machine",,,,response,0,,
221,Teacher,"And that is true, they did",,,210.4,remark,0,,
221,Teacher," And we saw that in the second part of the article, number 2, where it said, NASA sent a small machine called-- and you'd see that in the text, they called it a Lunar Orbiter, to investigate what they found on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,So that is just another specific way of looking to see in the text what's happening,,,130.3,remark,0,,
221,Teacher," So like you, Jazmin",,,130.3,remark,0,,
221,Teacher," But if we use the tool of rereading the text, we would have seen that there was a name for it, which is the Lunar Orbiter",,,130.3,remark,0,,
221,Teacher, You explained that they sent a small machine,,,130.3,remark,0,,
221,Jazmin," Yeah, OK, I see that",,,130.3,response,0,,
221,Jazmin,Oh Yeah,,,130.3,response,0,,
221,Jazmin," OK, I see that one right there",,,130.3,response,0,,
221,Teacher," So you're not wrong, it is a small machine, but just to add a little bit more detail and clarification, so it's nice and clear",,,420.2,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,So that would have helped out your answer and made it a little bit more specific,,,420.2,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,It's a Lunar Orbiter,,,130.3,remark,0,,
221,Jazmin, OK,,,420.2,response,0,,
221,Jazmin,OK,,,420.2,response,0,,
221,Chris, I went to NASA,,,,response,0,,
221,Chris,"Well, I went to NASA-- it's me, Chris, right here",,,,response,0,,
221,Chris," So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, and masks, and suits, like lots of different equipment that they need to use to go to the moon",,,,response,0,,
221,Teacher,That is right,,,120.4,remark,0,,
221,Teacher," Now, Chris, would you like to share your answer?",,,120.4,remark,0,,
221,Chris,"Yeah, sure, I said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,120.4,response,0,,
221,Teacher,"Now, you are completely correct that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,410.2,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,"OK, and let's look back at our question to see just what we need to answer",,,120.2,remark,0,,
221,Teacher," So it says, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?",,,120.2,remark,0,,
221,Teacher," That's what our article is about, but what I'm looking for what equipment they used",,,410.2,remark,0,,
221,Teacher, Maybe we could just look through the article to find what they specifically used,,,420.2,remark,0,,
221,Teacher, Like the Lunar Orbiter that Jazmin was talking about or even the microscope that Farrah was talking about,,,420.2,remark,0,,
221,Teacher, We activated that,,,420.2,remark,0,,
221,Teacher, And that you know that they use a lot of different tools,,,420.2,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,"So even though, you do have your background knowledge",,,420.2,remark,0,,
221,Chris,The Lunar Orbiter or the microscope,,,420.2,response,0,,
221,Chris, So my answer is wrong?,,,420.2,response,0,,
221,Teacher, We just need to go in a little bit more detail and make sure that we're rereading the text to answer the question,,,420.2,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,"Nope, your answer is correct, but to answer the actual question that we brought into it, which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,420.2,remark,0,,
221,Chris, OK,,,420.2,response,0,,
221,Chris, OK,,,420.2,response,0,,
221,Chris,OK,,,420.2,response,0,,
221,Teacher, And that tells me that you understood it,,,230.3,remark,0,,
221,Teacher, And that you know that there was water on the moon and the scientists were using tools to examine it,,,230.3,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,"OK, because your answer shows and tells me that you understood what the article was about",,,230.3,remark,0,,
221,Teacher,"But maybe, we just need to look at the question a little bit further to know that, OK, you know what this says, we need to focus on the tools, we're going to focus on the tools",,,210.2,remark,0,,
221,Chris, OK,,,210.2,response,0,,
221,Chris,OK,,,210.2,response,0,,
221,Oliver," I know it's been a very short time, but I wanted to say I appreciate how you helped us look for more evidence in the text to put into our answers",,,,response,0,,
221,Oliver,"Miss Lisa, it's time for us to go to lunch",,,,response,0,,
221,Oliver, Bye,,,,response,0,,
221,Oliver, So thank you,,,,response,0,,
221,Teacher,Bye,,,,remark,0,,
223,Teacher,"Hi guys, how are you doing",,,,remark,0,1,2
223,Farrah,Hi,,,,response,0,1,2
223,Farrah, Good to see you,,,,response,0,1,2
223,Teacher, So right now we're going to kind of discuss your responses that you had about the The story about not the story the reading about the moon,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,Good to see you too,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,"Luis do you need anything, what's up?",,,,remark,0,1,2
223,Luis,"Um, yeah, I was just gonna say like I already know",,,,response,0,1,2
223,Luis, Like all there is to know about space already so I don't think I need to even be in this group,,,,response,0,1,2
223,Teacher,"Well, right now we're working on Olivereloping our responses",,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher, So even if you know a lot,,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher, It's about verbalizing what you know,,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher, So that's what we're practicing right now,,,220.1,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,SO I'M Farrah in your response,,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher," You kind of talked about a tool, did you want to kind of expand and talk with that tool and what it does",,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
223,Farrah,Yeah okay so i i said i was talking about the Microscope is the tool that they use,,,210.3,response,0,1,2
223,Farrah,And I think that because of what they said in the Beginning,,,,response,0,1,2
223,Farrah, You know what I mean?,,,,response,0,1,2
223,Farrah," He said, in paragraph three, you wouldn't be able to see it for the water is microscopic, you wouldn't be able to see it",,,,response,0,1,2
223,Farrah, How could they find the water if they can't see the water,,,,response,0,1,2
223,Farrah, If you were looking straight at it,,,,response,0,1,2
223,Farrah,Reach Every Reader:,,,,response,0,1,2
223,Farrah, So I'm thinking that they could,,,,response,0,1,2
223,Teacher,"Yeah, so they use the microscope has any have, have any of you guys ever use a microscope before,",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,Yes Oliver?,,,,remark,0,1,2
223,Oliver,"And yeah, I've used it",,,,response,0,1,2
223,Teacher, Have you ever,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,So you have used to it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher," What have you used it on usually use it on like a small thing, right",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
223,Oliver," We were looking at, like, really close",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
223,Oliver," Anderson use one and like, was he was looking at, I think it was like, I think he was looking at his spit or something",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
223,Oliver," It was like, something like that",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
223,Oliver,Yeah yeah in science class last year we we saw Mr,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
223,Teacher,So that's a tool that we that you can implement in your responses,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher, Yes,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher, Chris,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher, And what we what we learned in the passage was that we that we were using it to learn to look at the water,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
223,Chris," So I, I noticed that",,,110.2,response,0,1,2
223,Chris,Actually yeah I was gonna ask,,,110.2,response,0,1,2
223,Chris," I was wondering, like, where does that fit in",,,,response,0,1,2
223,Chris,"Like when I was like, went to NASA, that scientists use oxygen tanks at masks and stuff like that",,,,response,0,1,2
223,Teacher,"Yes, yeah, those are other tools that scientists use",,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,But they are tools that you use to help you acclimate to the moon in the gravity,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,And this tools that we talked about in the passage are tools that use to discover something there was another machine,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,"Jazmin, you actually mentioned it in your or just mentioned a small machine in your response",,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher, Do you want to kind of broaden that a little bit,,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
223,Jazmin,Yeah,,,210.3,response,0,1,2
223,Jazmin," When you say, how would I broaden what would that look like?",,,210.3,response,0,1,2
223,Teacher, So when you say NASA send a small machine,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,Okay,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher, Do you know exactly what that machine was called,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
223,Jazmin,"Yeah, yeah, it was called the lunar orbiter",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
223,Teacher,"Yeah, so that's how you would want to broaden your, your, your response",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher," You could say, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,So that could be useful in your response,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,Yes Farrah?,,,,remark,0,1,2
223,Farrah,"Oh, I guess I was wondering why my answer was wrong",,,,response,0,1,2
223,Teacher,but we just need to beef it up a little bit and use a little bit more academic vocabulary,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher," It had all the great all the good pieces in it,",,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,Your answer wasn't wrong,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher, But do you know what we're looking closely at?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,"You said, you'll need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely, which is which is very true",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
223,Farrah,We're looking at the water on the moon,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
223,Teacher,"You might want to add that into your answer as well, to be very concrete and make sure you're using all your resources from the passage",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
223,Farrah,So like,,,420.2,response,0,1,2
223,Teacher," And you agree with Farrah, which is awesome but you kind of want to put it into your own words",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,I kind of wanted to talk to you about your answer,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,"So what would you with our discussion today, what would you say your answer would be, and how would it change",,,530.1,remark,0,1,2
223,Oliver,Mmm hmm,,,420.2,response,0,1,2
223,Oliver," Okay, so if Farrah was like kind of something like Talking about the scientific tool and like more complete is like something",,,420.2,response,0,1,2
223,Oliver," Well, I guess",,,420.2,response,0,1,2
223,Oliver,"It uses academic language by, like, how do I know which language you use?",,,,response,0,1,2
223,Teacher,"Okay, that's a really good question",,,,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher, So anything that is,,,,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher," What or uses is kind of like a tool, maybe one of the tools that we use, because that is in the realm of our academic language that we're using",,,510.1,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher, Yes Farrah,,,510.1,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,There is a part of that article that you haven't really heard before,,,510.1,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher, So a lunar orbiter a microscope,,,510.1,remark,0,1,2
223,Farrah,"Oh, well, actually I was just gonna say that, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,510.1,response,0,1,2
223,Farrah,"Have before we go, I just wanted to",,,,response,0,1,2
223,Farrah,"Add like in particular, I wanted to thank you for encouraging us to use the text",,,,response,0,1,2
223,Farrah,"And also, like that you were helping us",,,,response,0,1,2
223,Farrah,You were very positive as we were trying to think about our answers,,,,response,0,1,2
223,Farrah,Thank you so much,,,,response,0,1,2
223,Teacher, Thank you all have a great time at lunch,,,,remark,0,1,2
223,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,1,2
223,Farrah,Thank you,,,,response,0,1,2
224,Teacher,"Alright guys, so I have some good answers here",,,,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, You told me that NASA center,,,,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, I'm going to start with you,,,,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, But I wanted to see if we can expand our thinking a little so Jazmin,,,,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher," Oh, it's",,,,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, And did you have a question,,,,remark,0,0,2
224,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know a lot about space",,,,response,0,0,2
224,Teacher," Well, I'd love for you to stay and share some of your ideas with the other friends in our group, I think that would be",,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,You know a lot about space,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, So she's will me that NASA send a small machine Jazmin,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,Do you remember why NASA sent a small machine and maybe what it's called,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,"I'm going to ask Jazmin, a question first",,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,You'd be a really great resource for us,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, So why don't you hang tight,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
224,Jazmin,"No, I don't remember",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
224,Teacher,"Okay, so if we look back to our reading",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, Does anyone remember why they sent the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher," It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter a lunar orbiter",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
224,Jazmin,"Oh yeah, I see that NASA sent  small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will end at the South Pole and look for ice deposits and",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
224,Jazmin,So it can land at the South Pole and look for ice to pass it in a large polar crater,,,,response,0,0,2
224,Teacher,Great,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, So I think that would be a great detail to add in your answers,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, So incorporating that information in your answer really shows me that you understand the reading,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Jazmin, You think I have to write down all of those words,,,420.2,response,0,0,2
224,Jazmin,To write down all,,,420.2,response,0,0,2
224,Jazmin, I'm sorry,,,420.2,response,0,0,2
224,Teacher, But if you can put that sentence into your own words that shows me that you understand,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,You don't have to write down all of them,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, Exactly,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, You know what I'm saying,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Jazmin,"Um, you're saying I have to take a big long sentence",,,420.2,response,0,0,2
224,Jazmin," And then I have to write it, but not copy down the exact same word",,,420.2,response,0,0,2
224,Teacher, So let's see what we can come up with together,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, Do you want to go through it together,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,Right,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,So we have NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small,,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,"So, Jazmin said NASA center small machine",,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,"We can build on this sentence by saying, NASA sense and the machine called a lunar orbiter to look for ice deposits in the craters",,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, Is that a little easier,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Jazmin,"Yeah, I guess that's a few less words",,,150.1,response,0,0,2
224,Jazmin, Okay,,,150.1,response,0,0,2
224,Teacher,We want to have enough words to describe what we're thinking,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,Farrah do you have a question,,,,remark,0,0,2
224,Farrah,"Yeah, I don't understand why my answer was wrong",,,,response,0,0,2
224,Teacher, You told me you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,"Let's see, you're right",,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher," Um, let's see, I so your answer wasn't wrong",,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,"However you the you use the words exactly from the passage, so it's good that you showed me that you read the passage and you understand, but I want you to put it in your own words to show me that",,,430.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,"You know why they have to use a microscope, so do you",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, Why do they need a microscope to look really closely,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
224,Farrah,"Oh,",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
224,Farrah, I'm not sure,,,,response,0,0,2
224,Farrah,Much,,,,response,0,0,2
224,Teacher,Do you know what a microscope is,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
224,Farrah,Yeah yeah a microscope is is what you use in science class to look at really small thing,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
224,Teacher,So if you use a microscope,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, Look at really small things,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, Why do you think you would need a microscope to look at the water found on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,Because it's,,,,remark,0,0,2
224,Farrah,It's really small,,,,response,0,0,2
224,Teacher,It's really small,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher," So, saying that in your answer shows me that you understand what a microscope is and that you know that the water on the moon is really small and that you got all that information from reading the passage",,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Farrah, OK,,,420.2,response,0,0,2
224,Farrah,OK,,,420.2,response,0,0,2

224,Teacher,"So Deb, you said you circled the same thing as Farrah",,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Oliver,"Well cause when you asked everybody to say their answers and Farrah said hers, and I realized that she had the same thing that I had, I talked about the microscope and the story, the part where it says that they",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
224,Oliver, You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,0,0,2
224,Oliver,They arm you need assigned the last sentence,,,,response,0,0,2
224,Oliver, That's the same thing but I circled in my answer to,,,,response,0,0,2
224,Teacher,Can you explain a little bit more,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, Why you circle that,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Oliver," And when I read the story that I only saw this was the only time where they talked about an equipment, looking at the water",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
224,Oliver,Yeah possible question asked about equipment and asked about looking at water,,,230.1,response,0,0,2
224,Teacher,Awesome,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2

224,Teacher, So you saw equipment in the discussion question,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher," It's good, it's okay that you chose the same answer that shows me that you guys are highlighting the right answers in the passage",,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,So next time,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,"And you highlighted the microscope, just like Farrah",,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,But I'd like for you to explain why you chose that answer,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, And I think you did a great job of showing me that,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, They did,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,"So Chris also that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, which is absolutely correct",,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,So based off the conversation we're having now could you tell me what equipment they used to find the water and the craters,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
224,Oliver,Oliver said the microscope,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
224,Chris," I mean, I went to NASA",,,,response,0,0,2
224,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,0,2
224,Chris," Um, I guess it's one of those",,,,response,0,0,2
224,Chris," I think, I think you said the Lunar Orbiter",,,,response,0,0,2
224,Chris,Jazmin said I'm a small machine,,,,response,0,0,2
224,Oliver,Mm hmm,,,,response,0,0,2
224,Teacher,That's really good,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher," So, so basically the words that your classmates have been using and what you already know from going to NASA",,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, So our question was highlighting the equipment that science scientists use to find the water on the moon,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,Those are some of the words I want to hear in your answer,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,you're absolutely right that they found water on the moon,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,So next time you answer a question like that,,,520.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, That's what our passage told us,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher," What I want to hear is the actual equipment they were using,",,,520.1,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher, So that's really good,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,So the lunar orbiter the microscope and you said some masks and other oxygen tanks and equipment like that,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,But we need to highlight the equipment,,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
224,Oliver,I'm excuse me teacher,,,410.2,response,0,0,2
224,Oliver, I was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch,,,410.2,response,0,0,2
224,Oliver,But I did want to say thank you so much for giving all of us suggestions on how we can improve our answers and how you you listen to all of our ideas and suggestions I were different for each one of us,,,,response,0,0,2
224,Oliver, So thank you,,,,response,0,0,2
224,Teacher,"Of course, have a good day",,,,remark,0,0,2
224,Teacher,"All right, everybody, so you just answered a question for me about our water on the moon passage or question was what equipment and scientists, you should discover water on the moon, so I want to talk about a couple of your answers so let's start with Jazmin oh Luis you have a question",,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
224,Luis,"I guess, I was just gonna say that I, I I don't think that I need to be in that group, because I don't think I need any help because I already don't our space",,,120.2,response,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"i'm so glad that you know a lot about space, but I think you staying in our group would really benefit our other classmates because maybe you could share some information that you already know about space that sounds good",,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
224,Luis,awesome yeah that sounds great i'm super into that,,,110.3,response,1,0,2
224,Teacher,Good all right i'm going to call on Jazmin first let's talk about Jazmin answer so you told me that NASA send a small machine now where did you get that information,,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
224,Jazmin,I could click to when I will do a new paragraph,,,230.2,response,1,0,2
224,Jazmin,And it basically said paragraph to that let's see NASA send a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investing so I thought this small machine was what they used to find the water,,,,response,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"And you're absolutely right, the small machine is what they used to find the water on the moon it's called a lunar orbiter",,,130.3,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"so next time when we're giving our answers to these questions, we want to make sure that we're including details like the name of the small machine that NASA sent but you're absolutely right now send",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,You yeah,,,,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,That really clarifies your answer,,,,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"It shows me that you understand what you're reading and you understand the questions i'm asking you, but you had a great start to your question to answer, I mean",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"All right, yeah of course Okay, so you told me that you circled the same answer Farrah could you tell me what the answer was",,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
224,Oliver,"um yeah so basically I was saying that they use the microscope in order to find the water, because you know they couldn't they couldn't find the water unless they could see",,,230.1,response,1,0,2
224,Teacher,that's awesome so what Farrah told me is that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"And then, what your answer showed me is the evidence behind that what a microscope does and why we needed to look really closely because it zooms in on the really small molecules in the water right",,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"So, like, I told for Jazmin when you're giving answers you want to make sure you have your evidence to back up your statement as well okay",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
224,Oliver,cool yeah I can do that,,,420.2,response,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"awesome so, then I see you have a question what's going on",,,,remark,1,0,2
224,Farrah,"yeah I was just kind of thinking, as I was listening to you talking to Oliveron everybody, I guess, I was still confused because you know, in our group, this is to help us to understand better um I guess they don't understand like why my answer is like not correct, why it's wrong",,,,response,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"I see Okay, so your answer",,,,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,Is tell me that we need a microscope to look really closely so,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"What that means is the question was what equipment, we used to find the water on the space on the moon, and while your answer told me the equipment that we use to look at the water",,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"and make sure and see how small it is and really scope it out, we need to be able to know the equipment that we use to find the water first before we analyze it ",,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
224,Farrah,Oh,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
224,Farrah,i'm sorry,,,,response,1,0,2
224,Teacher,No go ahead,,,,remark,1,0,2
224,Farrah,"Well, I was just wondering like",,,,response,1,0,2
224,Farrah,"You I I guess it kind of had in my imagination like there was an astronaut, who had a microscope and wasn't looking at the at the water",,,,response,1,0,2
224,Farrah,But Jazmin was saying that there was something else that they use so maybe they didn't have any instruments,,,,response,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"yeah I mean I definitely go to use your imagination, I really like how you visualize the situation before giving your answer that's a really good strategy to answering questions",,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"But what happened first is NASA sent the machine, so there might not have been any astronauts and the machine just went on to the moon, to look for the water",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"So we definitely use the microscope to look at the water, but the question asked which equipment, we use to find the water first",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
224,Farrah,"yeah so they use like some other kind of equipment or tracker or something like the Jazmin said the Lunar orbiter that's what found the right, and then they looked at the water, maybe later after they found it so they didn't use the microscope buying the",,,210.2,response,1,0,2
224,Teacher,Exactly that's correct because the two equipments go hand in hand Chris what's going on,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
224,Chris,"um so I guess, I was just picking",,,210.4,response,1,0,2
224,Chris,up because I went to NASA and I know that scientists is a lot of equipment oxygen tanks and masks and sutent thing I was wondering where that fits in to the reading,,,,response,1,0,2
224,Teacher,So we're fits into the reading let's talk about that so scientists,,,,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,So at NASA they have like Farrah said astronauts so they would use equipment like suits and,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"helmets to go into space and then scientists, a lot of scientists, they were special jackets when they're in the lab and sometimes maybe they'll wear masks to protect themselves",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"So where that fits into our reading if scientists, so we sent the machine into onto the moon, we collected some samples with them lunar orbiter",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"And then that came back to a lab and then the scientists in the lab use the different equipment like maybe a microscope to look at the water that the Lunar orbiter connected from the moon, so it all goes together, like a big web of ideas everything connects",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
224,Chris,"Oh okay that makes a lot of sense so like Okay, so if there was an astronaut on food, maybe they use that, but the truth is that they did it is that right they didn't eat an astronaut, because they sent the small sheet",,,210.4,response,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"yeah so the machine did all the work that an astronaut might have done on the on the moon, but a tiny little machine did it for us, so we didn't have to send anybody up there, that makes sense",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
224,Chris,yeah that makes a lot of,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
224,Teacher,Jazmin what's your question,,,,remark,1,0,2
224,Jazmin,"My next class, but before we go, I just wanted to thank you for working with us, this is really cool because I think we understand a lot more Thank you so much",,,,response,1,0,2
224,Teacher,"All right, so Chris let's talk about the answer you gave me to the question, so your answer was scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
224,Teacher,"So, can you tell me where in the passage you found that answer, where did you get it from",,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
224,Chris,yeah okay so basically when I looked at the end,,,230.2,response,2,0,2
224,Chris,"It ended, I see it, oh in paragraph one on it says that scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these traders are dark places where the sun never shot so that's where I saw the part about",,,,response,2,0,2
224,Teacher,"but I want to reread it again I want to show you a sentence, and I think it's a",,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
224,Teacher,"Okay, so you're absolutely right about craters their work craters on the moon, and there was some water in there,",,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
224,Teacher,Paragraph,,,,remark,2,0,2
224,Teacher,"three, paragraph three, it says that means the moon, is still drier than the driest desert on earth, they found water that is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it",,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
224,Teacher,"So, knowing that now, now that we've rerouted do you think you would change your answer",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
224,Chris,"yeah, I guess, because the question was what equipment right did they use, so I guess, I was talking about the craters because I was thinking that like that's where they had the water, you know, and I mean with the craters so, but the question is what",,,210.3,response,2,0,2
224,Chris,was used is that right,,,,response,2,0,2
224,Teacher,"yeah you're absolutely right, so we talked about that",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
224,Chris,We so,,,110.1,response,2,0,2
224,Teacher,Good,,,,remark,2,0,2
224,Chris,"yeah so I guess, I would say, like the equipment that they use, so it sounds like they use if I was listening to everybody, it sounds like they use on the",,,,response,2,0,2
224,Chris,"lunar orbiter to find it, and then they use the microscope to to study",,,,response,2,0,2
224,Teacher,"Absolutely, and that shows me that you really understood the text and what everybody's saying and before we move on intimacy you have your hand up, but before I answer you",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
224,Teacher,"I just want to say that you want to make sure you don't want to confuse the amount of water that they found in the moon, so there was a very small amount",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
224,Teacher,"So instead of saying it's full of water, the craters are full of water, there was a tiny bit in there that we can look further into using our equipment or microscope all right",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
224,Chris,Oh,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
224,Chris,I see yeah,,,,response,2,0,2
224,Teacher,That make more sense,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
224,Chris,yeah that makes a lot,,,150.1,response,2,0,2
224,Teacher,awesome Luis what's your question,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
224,Luis,"um so I was just gonna say that this has been really fun and I think that i've got it all figured out, so I",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
224,Teacher,"I i'm so glad you're having so much fun, but what I want, I want to talk about your answer, so you told me that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
224,Teacher,"So, which is absolutely true scientists may be using oxygen tanks, but did was that listed anywhere and Article didn't say that we use oxygen tanks",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
224,Teacher,Can you show me where you found that,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
224,Luis,"that's a that's a really good question um, I guess, let me look at see i'm",,,230.2,response,2,0,2
224,Luis,well,,,,response,2,0,2
224,Luis,"I don't see any oxygen tanks, I guess, I was using what I do because you know I visited NASA and i'm even Chris and I went, together with his dad",,,,response,2,0,2
224,Luis,"And so we saw that astronauts have to use the oxygen tanks, but I remember, you said that maybe there weren't any astronauts at all so maybe they didn't need oxygen",,,,response,2,0,2
224,Teacher,"you're absolutely right, so, while your answer is right that scientists do use oxygen tank sometimes when we were talking about water being found on the moon",,,130.1,remark,2,0,2
224,Teacher,"by NASA I don't think we had any oxygen tank so I love, how you use your background knowledge to answer the questions,",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
224,Teacher,but I don't think it answers this specific question and you understand,,,130.1,remark,2,0,2
224,Luis,yeah I think so that you gotta do what,,,310.1,response,2,0,2
224,Teacher,Exactly,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
224,Teacher,what's going on Jazmin,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
224,Jazmin,I was just when,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
224,Jazmin,I was thinking about,,,,response,2,0,2
224,Jazmin,This when I think about and i'm like well they it says like what equipment to they used to discover the water,,,,response,2,0,2
224,Jazmin,"And i'm thinking like well obviously they use the Lunar orbiter have to discover it but, like, I guess, in this case, it seems like there should be more information, like",,,,response,2,0,2
224,Jazmin,"A lunar orbiter like probably has blocked it experiments, but like what are the instruments like how do they find water without without seeing it with a microscope like I can simply use the mask",,,,response,2,0,2
224,Teacher,I understood confusion so and so,,,,remark,2,0,2
224,Teacher,So the Lunar orbiter he looks for the ice deposits in the polar the polar craters and so your question is how exactly the Lunar orbiter looks for that right,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
224,Jazmin,yeah like,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
224,Jazmin,The idea that like Luis and Chris and they were saying that like even I mean like you need other stuff like you up astronauts and other things like that and I guess it just got me wondering like,,,,response,2,0,2
224,Jazmin,Could you use this to find water or do you just need to use the Lunar orbiter,,,,response,2,0,2
224,Teacher,I think that's a great question and I don't think that our reading answers your question completely so that would be a great question to write down and maybe you can we can do some more research about it,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
224,Jazmin,Okay,,,110.1,response,2,0,2
224,Teacher,"All right, Dave do you have a question",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
224,Oliver,"um yeah, I guess, for me, I, so I read that they weren't going to put a moon base on the moon, maybe by 2024 That was the goal, and I was wondering like",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
224,Oliver,Did they will they like us,,,,response,2,0,2
224,Oliver,To you know what I mean to have water for the moon base,,,,response,2,0,2
224,Teacher,"You guys have lots of great questions, and I think you know a little bit more than I do, even about what's going on up in space, but they definitely my I think that's in like I said for Jazmin that's a great question to write down that we can look into as we talk more about",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
224,Teacher,The moon in the water on the moon,,,,remark,2,0,2
224,Oliver,That,,,,response,2,0,2
224,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,0,2
224,Farrah,"So, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but",,,,response,2,0,2
224,Farrah,"I just wanted to take a moment and I wanted to thank you for working with us today and I in particular, I wanted to thank you for pushing us to think about what we were saying",,,,response,2,0,2
224,Farrah,Like you really the first you really listen to what we said so you didn't like cut us off you like really heard what we were saying you let us talk to each other about like what we thought about each other,,,,response,2,0,2
224,Farrah,"And, but you helped us to really understand like what you were looking for and so as a result, I feel like we were able to have a really like in depth conversation, which was really fun interesting",,,,response,2,0,2
224,Farrah,"I feel really interested by this stuff that we've covered to thank you so much, it was really fun to work with wasn't it",,,,response,2,0,2
224,Farrah,Oh yeah it was awesome Thank you so much bye bye bye,,,,response,2,0,2
225,Teacher,start simulation,,,,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,Hi boys and girls,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, And you guys all had wonderful responses,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, So we just finished our small discussion about water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,But now we're going to go a little bit deeper into the text and really think about,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,The question that's being asked,,,120.2,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, So the question that was asked was what equipment do scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,And Farrah,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher," You actually talked about microscopes, which help the scientists to see things closer, is that, sure, you said that right in your response",,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, I noticed that in your response,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
225,Farrah,"Yeah, that was my response",,,230.3,response,0,0,3
225,Farrah, Yeah,,,230.3,response,0,0,3
225,Teacher," See the orbits the craters closer and you connected that to microscopes, which is really good",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher," We do use that in science class, but",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,That was actually really good,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, One thing I noticed was that you took the evidence from the text that scientists wanting to see things,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,"Even though lunar orbiter is, which is what the scientists used to investigate the craters are could possibly have microscopes to give scientists, a closer look",,,130.3,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, What we want to actually,,,130.3,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,"Think of in our answer is the actual equipment that's being used, which is the Lunar Orbiter and that helps us if you look in the text, it looks for ice deposits in large craters",,,130.3,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher," I want you to think about what other things that we might find in look in lunar orbiters that could be helpful for us to have a closer look and Deb, I saw that in your answer",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,Now I want,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, You had similar,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, Is there any tool or gadget that you could think of that would be helpful to have on an orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,"Answer to Farrah, so do",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Oliver," And I thought, basically, that like, um, you know, you would need the microscope, because they said in the reading",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
225,Oliver, So I agree with Farrah,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
225,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
225,Oliver, And so I was thinking like the scientists would have to bring a microscope with them to see the water,,,,response,0,0,3
225,Oliver, And so I guess that's how they found the water,,,,response,0,0,3
225,Oliver,That the water was microscopic and you couldn't see it with your eyes,,,,response,0,0,3
225,Teacher,So in the text,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, It tells us that the scientists actually send the lunar orbiters to to space that they don't actually go there themselves,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,"They send these machines, like you said, Jazmin NASA send a small machine which is called the Lunar Orbiter to Earth",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,"Luis Do you have anything to add, I see your hands raised",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Luis, I don't even think I should be in this,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
225,Luis,"Um, yeah, I was just gonna say that, honestly, like I already know all about space",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
225,Luis, I don't think I need any help,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
225,Teacher, I think that we can always learn from each other,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, And so I think we can,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,"Oh, okay, I understand",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, What you can do is look at the responses of your classmates and see if there's anything that you didn't know which would be really cool,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,And I saw that in your answer,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, NASA,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, I'm fine,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, NASA sent out the lunar orbiters to look at the little to look at the craters in the earth so,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,And as I was talking about with Oliver that the scientists weren't actually sent out to NASA,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, But why do you,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,"In that sense, the lunar orbiter do not need oxygen",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, Why do you think that using the text,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, Why do you think that NASA would send lunar orbiters instead of scientists or astronauts,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,Could anyone answer that,,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Chris,"Oh, that's a really, that's an interesting question",,,120.4,response,0,0,3

225,Teacher, Go ahead,,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, You can respond,,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Chris," And so, I noticed that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks, but it sounds like you're telling us that the lunar orbiter went without any astronaut",,,120.4,response,0,0,3

225,Chris, So like with my dad,,,120.4,response,0,0,3
225,Chris, I went to NASA,,,120.4,response,0,0,3

225,Teacher,"Jazmin, is there anything that you want to add",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,That is true,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, So they send it up to space without the need or help of any astronauts,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher," It was, it's like, it's so as Jazmin was saying it's a machine",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Jazmin,"So basically just what I was gonna say was, I wasn't sure why my answer was, well,",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
225,Teacher, So let's do a sentence spring,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher," So instead of saying, NASA sent a small machine, you could use our vocabulary word Lunar Orbiter",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher," Can you repeat that with me, NASA sent a lunar orbiter",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,"Oh, your answer was not wrong",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, I think that we can add more details to your answer to your answer,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,"And does anyone remember from the text, what the lunar orbiter does",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,0,3
225,Luis,"Um, well, the lunar orbiter like it goes up to the moon and orbits the moon and it studies like different things like beams down stuff",,,,response,0,0,3
225,Luis," And maybe it sends a rover, but it like goes down and looks at, like, what's happening on the",,,,response,0,0,3
225,Teacher," So basically, it gets a closer look",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, I was thinking,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher, Yeah,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,Moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,"That one of the helpful tools could have been a camera right there could be microscopes connected to the Lunar Orbiter, but there could also be a camera that would help scientists here on Earth, get a closer look to the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Teacher,"Farrah, do you have anything you want to add",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
225,Farrah,"Oh, I think I was going to answer the question before, but actually we have to",,,120.4,response,0,0,3
225,Farrah, But before we go to lunch,,,,response,0,0,3
225,Farrah,Go to lunch,,,,response,0,0,3
225,Farrah," I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, in particular, I wanted to thank you for asking us to use evidence",,,,response,0,0,3
225,Farrah,In what we were like saying because that way we were able to back it up using the text and like you were helping us to really understand what the question was,,,,response,0,0,3
225,Farrah,"And I think some of us didn't know quite what what the question was looking at, like, the question was saying like",,,,response,0,0,3
225,Farrah,"You know, if the lunar orbiter was was what they used to invest and discover, and I think that also like you really helped us to like build value",,,,response,0,0,3
225,Farrah, I think we all felt like our opinions were really worthwhile,,,,response,0,0,3
225,Farrah, So thank you so much for working with us,,,,response,0,0,3
225,Farrah, Bye,,,,response,0,0,3

225,Oliver,"All work good, and we're excited to work with you",,,,response,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"i'm excited to do you have a question for us to start, Luis, I see your hands raised",,,,remark,1,0,3
225,Luis,"Yeah, there's nothing,",,,,response,1,0,3
225,Luis,"I am kind of know, like all this stuff already so like I don't really think I need any help, I don't need to be in this group",,,,response,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"Well, the good thing is, we can all learn some more from each other",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"we're gonna actually go to the passage right now, so I have Farrah could you tell us your answer to the question to question one again",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"Right, so our question for number one was what equipment and students us to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"And you're right to say that the scientists need a tool, called the microscope to look really closely",,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,Do you remember from the passage what the scientists are using this tool to look at,,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
225,Farrah,yeah you're looking at the microscopic water on the moon,,,210.3,response,1,0,3
225,Teacher,there's another tool that they used,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"Yes, exactly, and those are found inside the craters right the large pool of craters",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher, Did anyone mentioned that tool in their answer would like to share?,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,Go ahead Jazmin,,,,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"Yes, small machine, the name of that small machine, if you look back into paragraph two, it actually tells us the name of this machine",,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"Yes, the Lunar orbiter and they use this to investigate",,,,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"things on the moon right, specifically the ice deposits",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
225,Jazmin,"I was acutally kind of confused, because I wasn't sure, we're all here because maybe our answers are not fully right",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
225,Jazmin," So, I was kind of wondering like, why is my answer wrong",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"and we can help each other by doing that, by listening to our peers and coming together to make a stronger answer",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"Well, your answer wasn't wrong you actually had a really good answer, but we want to do is add more supporting details to give yourself a stronger answer,",,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"Chris, do you have something to add to our discussion",,,,remark,1,0,3
225,Chris,"yeah so what I realized that Luis and I,",,,,response,1,0,3
225,Chris,"Okay, we both were talking earlier like Luis's answer about how the scientists use lots of equipment, so I was gonna say i'm watching, Luis, do you want to say your answer?",,,,response,1,0,3
225,Luis,um yeah so,,,,response,1,0,3
225,Luis,"Here was the thing like scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and suits and masks and that stuff so I was thinking like you know, like maybe the the reading was missing important like things, like,  do you know what I mean? Because how could the scientists be up there, like getting water,",,,,response,1,0,3
225,Luis,If they don't have a spacesuit?,,,,response,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"The thing is that what we're thinking about is the astronauts who uses oxygen tanks, so the top scientists can create these tools, but the astronaut that are actually using these tools and I think what you were thinking about was",,,,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"The the fourth paragraph, which was talking about how water is used and that's one thing that we talked about in our second question,",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"You connect to the fact that the waters were found on the moon is used for oxygen right,",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"so they could have, so the supply of water couldn't be used for oxygen tanks on the moon, the hydrogen and oxygen",,,,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,We know that water is made from hydrogen and oxygen so that oxygen can be taken out from the water and used for oxygen tanks like you said,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,That is a tool that astronauts use on the moon you're right,,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"What anyone else, want to share their answer? Oliver, I know you had a similar answer to what Farrah said, is there anything else you'd like to add to the group answer?",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
225,Oliver,"um so yeah I thought that Farrah was right and I, I found that evidence myself what I noticed was that",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
225,Oliver,"The microscope okay so Farrah and I talked and we said that you can't find the water, if you can't see it like you'll have to be able to see the water, so we thought like how could they discover the water unless they use the microscope first",,,,response,1,0,3
225,Teacher,Exactly there's a possibility that the Lunar that there's a Microscope on the Lunar orbiter that helps us look at the ashes on the moon,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
225,Oliver,Oh that's all,,,130.1,response,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"yeah, that is, that is interesting right",,,,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,Is there anyone would want to add anything to our conversation? Yes Chris,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
225,Chris,"So I kind of was just well Okay, so I was thinking about that I went to NASA so I, like you were saying, I know that scientists use a lot of equipment",,,150.1,response,1,0,3
225,Chris,"oxygen tanks and masks and suits,",,,,response,1,0,3
225,Chris,"Things like that, so it kind of was making me think like did they not use those to discover the water like they use those like you were saying in the second reading?",,,,response,1,0,3
225,Teacher,Yes,,,210.1,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"Here I think we, we want to answer Question one before we move on to answer question two, so the question was asked us to talk about the equipment that scientists",,,,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"which was the Lunar orbiter and the microscopes and then question two asked us to give evidence on what is found on the moon, and why it can be valuable like the water but there's also tools that the astronauts use on the moon,",,,,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"to find that water and then how that water is used, so we want to make sure that when we are answering question one, that we are sticking to the tools that are used and giving supporting details about those tools, like, for instance, a lunar orbiter,",,,,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"is a small machine right that looks for ice deposits in a large craters,  that's what paragraph told us",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher," Go ahead, Farrah",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
225,Teacher,"Now Can someone give me information on a microscope what does it say that the microscope does, can you look into your paragraph and find that and then you guys raise your hand and when you guys could share with the group",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
225,Farrah,Okay,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
225,Farrah, Basically,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
225,Farrah,i'm sorry,,,,response,1,0,3
225,Farrah,"Unfortunately we have to go to our next class, but we really wanted to thank you for working with us this was really fun, thank you",,,,response,1,0,3
225,Teacher,Alright kids we're actually going to start with Jazmin's question so Jazmin,,,,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,Coule you repeat your question to your classmates your answer your responses to your classmates?,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
225,Jazmin,"yeah, so basically my response was that water is valuble because astronauts keep drinking water,",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
225,Jazmin,You can't survive without water,,,,response,2,0,3
225,Jazmin,and the water help them stay hydrated,,,,response,2,0,3
225,Jazmin,"Right, paragraph four were actually going to hear, to have evidence for what you just said",,,,response,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"right,  paragraph four says water on the moon,",,,,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"would be a valuable or very important resource, it could be useful in lots of ways, for example, future astronauts could drink the water like you said right water is",,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
225,Jazmin,yeah,,,120.3,response,2,0,3
225,Teacher,takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher," Who mentioned this in their response, could you raise your hand?",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"Right and you said water was heavy and that is true, that is part of our response right Chris, but what",,,,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"What do astronauts then do to avoid this, to avoid that the water is too heavy we have we found evidence in paragraph five, no in paragraph four that actually tells us what they do",,,,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"Do you know what this is look into paragraph for the sentence after it says it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft it tells us why it would be good for us to have water on the moon, yes Luis?",,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
225,Luis,So yeah,,,130.3,response,2,0,3
225,Luis,"I kind of know all about this, I think I am good",,,,response,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"Would you be able to read that last sentence for us, then, as a group",,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
225,Luis,"yeah I would love to read that sounds great okay i'm in paragraph five, is that right",,,120.3,response,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"Paragraph four, the last sentence",,,,remark,2,0,3
225,Luis,"Okay, having water available on the moon, we need more room on the spacecraft people and things like oxygen tanks",,,,response,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"All right, let's get back to what Chris was saying about how the water is heavy so this paragraph is that water is valuable because, on the moon water becomes valuable because then astronauts don't have to carry the heavy water inside the spacecraft",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,now they have room for what Chris?,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
225,Chris,"Well, they have room for kind of other stuff so maybe they want to bring different kinds of food or maybe more likely they want to bring like other equipment and stuff like that",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
225,Teacher,Exactly Luis could you now respond and tell us your answer?,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
225,Luis,"yeah yeah I would love to so Okay, my answer and I actually this way, but I also saw in the reading because I did look at the reading this time teacher um I did look at it, and I saw that the water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen",,,110.1,response,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"Yes, so evidence from the text shows us tell us that water can be broken down into two parts, like you said, hydrogen and oxygen and which one of those two do the astronauts use for breathing Luis",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
225,Luis,oxygen,,,210.3,response,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"Yes, so not only is water valuable because we can drink it and it can save space and spacecraft but also because we can use it for what you said oxygen, Luis that's very true that is good observation",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,Farrah could you tell us what that something else is? It's in paragraph five,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,We also talked about the bottom talks about how we can use hydrogen for something else,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
225,Farrah,Okay,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
225,Farrah,"It says that you can use hydrogen, you can use it to make rocket",,,,response,2,0,3
225,Teacher,Rocket! Exactly it says here the moon could serve as a stop for spacecrafts to refill their gas,,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,before heading out into the solar system,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher," So let's review why water is valuable and I know that Oliver had a response as well, what was your response, before we go over the reasons why water is valuable",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
225,Oliver,"Well, so I actually have my opinion is that water um yeah I can see that it's valuable like it's not that it's not valuable",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
225,Oliver,"But it's not ready yet like they talk in the reading a lot at the end, about how hard it would be to figure out like how to even like find the water like they said in the first reading that like it was like there's just like little microscopic particles of it",,,,response,2,0,3
225,Oliver,And you have to somehow get out of the,,,,response,2,0,3
225,Oliver,"dirt and out of the craters, and all this stuff like, that's really hard like we don't have something that can just do that we'd have to invent it and build it, so",,,,response,2,0,3
225,Oliver,"I kind of am thinking that the evidence is not convincing, because just because the waters there doesn't mean that we can use it",,,,response,2,0,3
225,Teacher,I love how you're challenging your capacities to think about what truly makes water valuable and it really is valuable to get from the moon,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"But if you are an astronaut, think about yourself if you were an astronaut wouldn't you want to enable it you found it, even if it was a little amount of water",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
225,Oliver,yeah I yeah I,,,210.3,response,2,0,3
225,Oliver,"I do think it's valuable, but I think, because I was trying to read the question really closely like we did last time, and because it's saying like is the evidence convincing",,,,response,2,0,3
225,Oliver,I don't think it is,,,,response,2,0,3
225,Oliver,"I think that the evidence says that the waters, like, I think it will be valuable in the future, but I don't think it's valuable",,,,response,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"that's true I do love, how you were challenging the question itself, and I think that we, there is reasons to support our evidence that water is valuable and I don't think that",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"The evidence that we put out here is wrong, it is valuable, but then, how do we get that water is also another question, we can ask ourselves to see if that evidence of water being valuable is actually convincing",,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher, Chris just something else to add to the class,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
225,Chris,"I was gonna say I think Oliver and I were talking about this, that they are going to maybe try to make up base by 2024 so maybe they will figure it out by that",,,210.2,response,2,0,3
225,Teacher,yeah that's our hopes right scientists works really hard,,,110.3,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher," Jazmin I saw your hand raised, do you have anything else to add?",,,,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,To make sure that astronauts are given the materials and that they're meeting the requirements so that astronauts can go into space and have a safe travels there,,,,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,Let,,,,remark,2,0,3
225,Jazmin,"Reach Every Reader:Well, I just wanna say that I was a little bit confused because I thought the water was valuable as a Defense argument I actually really think it's a good argument",,,,response,2,0,3
225,Jazmin,But I think you could argue both ways like I think you could say that it's not valuable because yeah because it's really hard to get it out of the way,,,,response,2,0,3
225,Jazmin,"But I think you could also say is valuable because, like sometimes right like you know, like my dad works for",,,,response,2,0,3
225,Jazmin,"Like my dad works for oil companies so like they know that they sometimes look for oil and they don't know where it is yet, but it's valuable, even if they don't have it yet so maybe",,,,response,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"Oliver, has that change your thinking a little bit?",,,530.1,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,Just not a great connection,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"How is what Jazmin said, change your thinking so even though it's hard to get merged, she said, the oil better product strategy part to get",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
225,Teacher,"We still see that as valuable, so I think that, just because we can't it's hard to get does not make it not valuable the water is still valuable not what we're trying to prove in our argument right",,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
225,Oliver,"yeah that's a really good point, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you for working with us i'd like, in particular, I really wanted to",,,210.2,response,2,0,3
225,Oliver,"thank you for helping us clear up like any kind of misconception, we had and making sure that we use evidence in our answers",,,,response,2,0,3
225,Oliver,"And also um you really valued all of our answers, so I think that everybody had time to explain their ideas, and I think like",,,,response,2,0,3
225,Oliver,"Right guys, like everybody thought value right, like everybody was like we all felt really like heard and then like",,,,response,2,0,3
225,Oliver,"Thank you so much for helping us understand like what we needed to work on, because you gave us ideas for how we could improve our answers in both of our classes, so that was so awesome Thank you so much, and bye",,,,response,2,0,3

227,Teacher, What are they looking closely at?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher," Farrah, you say that they need a microscope to look really closely",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher,Awesome,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher," Hi, everyone",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4

227,Farrah," The water they found on the moon, I guess",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
227,Farrah,"Uh, I don't know where",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher," So based off of that, where do we think the water is being found?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher, It says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher, These craters are dark places where the sun never shines,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher,So let's read number one again,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Farrah,In the craters,,,210.4,response,0,1,4

227,Luis,I shouldn't be in this group,,,,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher,"OK, that's great that you know a lot about space, but this is a specific part of space that we just want to talk about",,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher," Being in this group doesn't mean you don't know about it, it just means that I just wanted to hear a little bit more of what you thought",,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher, OK?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
227,Luis,"Oh, OK",,,150.1,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher, So you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher,"So let's actually go to you now, Luis",,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher, What other equipment have they used on the moon with the water?,,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
227,Luis,"Well, they have to wear spacesuits and gravity boots so that they can walk",,,230.1,response,0,1,4
227,Luis, I'm not sure what other equipment they need,,,230.1,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher, Can you read that sentence and tell me what the machine is and what it does?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher,"OK, so let's look at the actual sentences, OK? So we've already talked about the microscope, but if you look at number two, it says NASA sent a small machine",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Luis,"Uh huh, OK",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
227,Luis, NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
227,Luis, This Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
227,Luis," OK, so it's a Lunar Orbiter and it investigates",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher, What does it investigate?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher,Great job,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Luis,Ice deposits,,,210.4,response,0,1,4

227,Teacher, Is that the machine you were talking about?,,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher,"Perfect, great",,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
227,Jazmin,"Yeah, so I don't understand why my answer's wrong",,,230.1,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher, I want to know a lot more of what you know about it,,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher, So tell me about the machine,,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher, I would just like to hear a little bit more detail,,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher,It's not wrong at all,,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
227,Jazmin, NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,230.1,response,0,1,4
227,Jazmin,OK,,,230.1,response,0,1,4
227,Jazmin," OK, I don't remember",,,230.1,response,0,1,4
227,Jazmin," OK, so it's a small machine and it's called a Lunar Orbiter and it investigates",,,230.1,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher,What does it investigate?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Jazmin, Ice deposits?,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
227,Jazmin,(WHISPERING) The Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher,"Awesome, and why do you think it looks for ice deposits? What would the ice deposits tell us?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Jazmin,If it's cold there?,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher,"Yeah, but what would it tell us that involves water?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Jazmin,If the water's frozen?,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher,"Yeah, so can we have ice without water?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Jazmin,"No, because it's just frozen water",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher,"Right, so that proves that there was water on the moon because there's little bits of ice everywhere, right?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Jazmin,"Uh huh, yeah",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher," OK, and let's go to Chris",,,230.2,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher, Can you just tell me a little bit more about that and where in the text it said that?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher," I like that, that is very true",,,230.2,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher," Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,230.2,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher,Good,,,230.2,remark,0,1,4
227,Chris," OK, scientists found evidence that water could be found deep within the moon's polar craters",,,230.2,response,0,1,4
227,Chris,Yeah,,,230.2,response,0,1,4
227,Chris," I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, and masks, and suits, but the crater part was in the beginning of the story",,,230.2,response,0,1,4
227,Chris," Oh, here it is",,,230.2,response,0,1,4
227,Chris, (WHISPERING) No atmosphere,,,230.2,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher, That's really cool,,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher,"Well, I love you bringing in your background knowledge saying that you've been to NASA before",,,110.3,remark,0,1,4

227,Teacher,"That's really cool, I love that",,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher, Did you learn about the Lunar Orbiter at all when you were at NASA?,,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
227,Chris,"No, no, we saw the Mars Rover, but I don't remember seeing anything about a Lunar Orbiter",,,230.1,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher," So why don't you tell me a little bit more about what they did with the water that they found on Mars-- the moon, not Mars",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher," OK, that's really interesting",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher,OK,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Chris,"What did they do with the water that they found on the moon? I don't know, maybe they drank it",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher,"Well, let's look at this sentence right here",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher, It says that the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher, So what would they have to do with the water to know that it was there if it was too small to see?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
227,Chris,"Well, this says that you need a microscope to look at it",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher,"Right, so let's go back to your response real fast",,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher, You said scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher," So if there's just a little teeny tiny bit of water that you have to look through a microscope to see, are the craters really full of water?",,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
227,Chris,"No, I guess not, but the story did say that it was like deep in the craters",,,210.3,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher," Oliver, can you help us out a little bit? I see you raising your hand",,,130.2,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher,Yeah,,,130.2,remark,0,1,4
227,Oliver," I know it was a really short time, but I do appreciate how you helped us really look for the evidence in the story to put in our answer",,,130.2,response,0,1,4
227,Oliver,"Well, I'm sorry to interrupt, I was just saying that it's actually time for us to go to lunch",,,130.2,response,0,1,4
227,Teacher,Perfect,,,,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher," OK, well, have a good time at lunch",,,,remark,0,1,4
227,Teacher,guys,,,,remark,1,1,4
227,Farrah,All right,,,,response,1,1,4
227,Teacher,So Farrah,,,,remark,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,1,1,4
227,Luis,"um so yeah I was just gonna say like I shouldn't be in this group because I already corrected my answer, so I think i'm right, I think I should go go out",,,,response,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"So I agree that you did it correct your answer and I think we're really on the right track, but what I want to talk about right now",,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
227,Teacher," Luis so, can you tell me the difference between your original answer and your second answer",,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"Is a kind of the process of what you did to correct your answer Okay, so why don't we start with Luis",,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
227,Luis,"um yeah OK, so my initial answer, I was saying that scientists like use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that which I knew, because I already knew that and then um",,,120.4,response,1,1,4
227,Luis,"Well, basically, then I did the reading and looked at the reading and once I did the reading I saw that the that the scientists actually well the real answer is that scientists found ice using a small machine",,,,response,1,1,4
227,Teacher,So what i'm hearing from you is you're saying that you used your background knowledge to answer it first right and I love that I love,,,230.3,remark,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"You and people use their background knowledge, because that tells me that you're really thinking about what you already know, but I do you really like that you",,,310.1,remark,1,1,4
227,Teacher, I think that's great do you see,,,,remark,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"went back and looked in the readings, to find a more specific answer",,,,remark,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"The difference between the two answers and what looking back at looking back at the reading told you, can you tell me the",,,230.1,remark,1,1,4
227,Teacher,How this your second answer might be a little bit more detail,,,,remark,1,1,4
227,Luis,"um well I guess cuz, it has to do with the reading because the first time I didn't read it, I just knew the answer, but I guess that wasn't the right answer so I decided to actually read it, and then, when I read it, I got the right answer",,,,response,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"Right so next time you get a question on a text, are you going to use your background knowledge and not read at all, or you going to read the text and then use your background knowledge",,,520.1,remark,1,1,4
227,Luis,"I know a lot about space, so I might still use the background knowledge, but I mean I should probably read it, because maybe I don't know everything",,,520.1,response,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"Right that's good that's why we're in school right because we don't know everything I don't know everything so it's probably good, to use your use your text next time to write",,,520.1,remark,1,1,4
227,Teacher,Let me turn to Farrah,,,,remark,1,1,4
227,Farrah,I change my answer to,,,,response,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"Great, so why don't you tell me a little bit about your answers",,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
227,Farrah,"Okay, so, basically, I said that initially you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely and then I said",,,120.4,response,1,1,4
227,Farrah,"After like we were in class and discussing it and I thought about it, I said scientists use the Lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water craters on the moon, so I found the right answer",,,,response,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"Right, so why do you think that your second answer was the right answer",,,230.1,remark,1,1,4
227,Farrah,"Because, in the first instance I only said that well I said the microscope but that's not the piece of it that actually found the ice the water, like you, like you could study the ice in a microscope when it was the Lunar orbiter",,,230.1,response,1,1,4
227,Farrah,that actually found the water,,,,response,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"place, I really like that, and I agree, so what i'm hearing is that you look back at the question and kind of reread it and saw your mistakes um or what you could improv a little bit right",,,230.3,remark,1,1,4
227,Farrah,"yeah and it was what people were saying to cuz I was listening in class for saying like Jazmin was saying, it was a small machine and you know stuff like that so um",,,230.3,response,1,1,4
227,Farrah,"You know other people had ideas, too, so I was kind of listening to that, and then I was when I understood like what the question meant, then I could understand better",,,,response,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"Right, so what are a few things we can do next time when you're not quite sure if your answers, are all the way there yet",,,520.1,remark,1,1,4
227,Farrah,"Right, ask the teacher",,,520.1,response,1,1,4
227,Teacher,You can definitely ask the teacher,,,110.1,remark,1,1,4
227,Teacher,What do you have any other suggestions,,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"or Chris, do you have any suggestions",,,130.2,remark,1,1,4
227,Chris,"On not not about this, no, I was gonna say that I was gonna say I asked my new answer is ok",,,130.2,response,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"yeah, so why don't you tell me a little bit about your two answers",,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
227,Chris,"Okay, so what I said was initially that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, and then I realized that",,,120.4,response,1,1,4
227,Chris,"That it wasn't full of water, when I read it more closely, I said instead that the the water that scientists found on the moon was microscopic there was only a little bit like I said initially there was like lots of it, but actually there's just a little bit of water",,,,response,1,1,4
227,Teacher,Good and how did you come to that conclusion,,,230.1,remark,1,1,4
227,Chris,"um well, I was because i'm the well because the teacher asked about it, and what I was like asking if it was a lot of water or a little water, and I was saying, well, actually, it was when I had to go back you I saw that it was just a little bit of water",,,230.1,response,1,1,4
227,Teacher, So what do you want to do next time um a teacher asks you a little bit more information,,,520.1,remark,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"Right, so you went back and read",,,520.1,remark,1,1,4
227,Chris,I guess I just won't go back yet,,,520.1,response,1,1,4
227,Teacher,"Good yes, how may I help you",,,,remark,1,1,4
227,Oliver,"um Unfortunately, we have to go to our next class, but I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun bye",,,,response,1,1,4
227,Teacher,bye guys,,,,remark,1,1,4
227,Teacher,hi guys,,,,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher,"hi so Luis, can you tell me a little bit about your answer",,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
227,Luis,"Oh yeah Okay, so I can, I can tell you that, basically, I was saying that yeah that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
227,Teacher,Right,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher,"why don't we look back at the question is just read it one more time, can you read it out loud for me",,,120.3,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher,that's really good information,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
227,Luis,"yeah Okay, it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,120.3,response,2,1,4
227,Teacher,"Right, so you told me that we can split up",,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher,Water into hydrogen and oxygen right,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher,but do you think that that's answering the question,,,410.1,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher,What,,,410.1,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher,part of the question do you think you're missing,,,410.1,remark,2,1,4
227,Luis,"Well, I guess it's answering the question because well it is valuable right like it's really valuable that um that they have like",,,410.1,response,2,1,4
227,Luis,"You know that you can split it into hydrogen and oxygen like that's why I mentioned it, because those are really valuable things in space, because you can do all kinds of stuff with them",,,,response,2,1,4
227,Teacher,"Right, so it seems to me that you really understand what you're trying to say it just, i'm a little concerned that the reader of",,,410.2,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher,"whoever's reading your answer isn't going to be able to make the connection, you know, so if you could",,,410.2,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher," So you could say one way that the that water is valuable is you can split it into hydrogen and oxygen says, what do you think, do you think that sounds better",,,420.2,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher,"A way that I could see you making a response, even better, is kind of adding the question into the response",,,420.2,remark,2,1,4
227,Luis,yeah that makes that makes sense yeah,,,420.2,response,2,1,4
227,Teacher,Good i'm glad okay i'm Farrah why don't you tell me a little bit about your answer now,,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
227,Farrah,"Okay, so I said that no i'm like it like would not be valuable not like, for a long time",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
227,Teacher,"Right um, can you tell me a little bit why you think that",,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
227,Farrah,yeah cuz well basically like um well first off like they only have a little bit of it and it spread over like all sorts of places like,,,230.1,response,2,1,4
227,Farrah,It sort of in craters but it's also kind of all over and we don't really have the technology to like go and like,,,,response,2,1,4
227,Farrah,kind of find everything and like dig it out like it would take so much energy to do it that it doesn't seem like it would be very possible like it seems like we need to invent new technology to really be able to use the water on the moon,,,,response,2,1,4
227,Teacher,"Right, I really like that, just like Luis, I think you have a really good grasp on what you're trying to say, and I think you really understand the text",,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher,"My only concern is when you are answering a question like that you're you're trying to convince your reader of something right, so we always need to give that reason as to why right so that's where the evidence in our text really comes in, so I would go back and",,,430.2,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher,"Keep the first part of your answer, but only make that your first part and then",,,420.2,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher,Go back and try and find a little bit of evidence in the text as to why you think the answer is correct,,,420.2,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher, okay?,,,420.2,remark,2,1,4
227,Farrah,gotcha,,,420.2,response,2,1,4
227,Teacher,"Okay, and Oliver can we talk about your answer a little bit tell me what you answered",,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
227,Oliver,"yeah so I said i'm like Farrah I said no, because it's not ready yet",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
227,Teacher,"Right um so kind of wha,t kind of the same thing I was sent to Farrah, can you tell me",,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher,Why it's not ready,,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
227,Oliver,"yeah cuz Well, we know that the water is super small it's microscopic and it's really like all mixed in with dirt and everything so like i'm thinking that like",,,230.1,response,2,1,4
227,Oliver,"You can't really use it you'd have to do something to it, but like you it's not like just sitting there ready to be used on like hooked up to a gas tank or something so you'd have to get it ready, but it seems like it would be really hard to get it ready",,,,response,2,1,4
227,Teacher,I think it would be really hard to get it ready too,,,420.2,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher, I think that's a really good point but let's think back to what I just said to Farrah do you have any thoughts of how you could make your answer a little bit stronger,,,420.2,remark,2,1,4
227,Oliver,"um well I guess Okay, so I could try",,,420.2,response,2,1,4
227,Oliver,"With evidence, so I think that I would just say like no it's not ready yet, and it would be hard to make it ready because it's microscopic right because that's evidence from the reading",,,,response,2,1,4
227,Teacher,"Right, I really liked that you bought up evidence from the reading I think that's a great idea, so I would look back to your answer and add some more evidence from the reading",,,420.2,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher, Good job,,,420.2,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher,um Jazmin let's talk about your answer a little bit,,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
227,Jazmin,"and see what I said was asking I say yes, that is valuable because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
227,Jazmin,And you can't survive without water,,,,response,2,1,4
227,Teacher,I really like that answer,,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher, I like that you gave reason to why you think that um,,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
227,Teacher,"yeah I think that's a really good answer, I think you could go a little bit further by just maybe quoting the text, just so that you really getting your information from the text Okay, yes Farrah",,,420.2,remark,2,1,4
227,Farrah,"So, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you for for working with us and, like, in particular, I just really wanted to thank you for",,,420.2,response,2,1,4
228,Teacher,Hi everyone,,,,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,So I know that we just read the article water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, And you guys were supposed to answer a question right,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
228,,Yeah we we all answered it,,,150.1,,0,0,2
228,," And then, um, you said you'd give us some feedback on our answers",,,150.1,,0,0,2
228,," And, um, we told you, our answers",,,150.1,,0,0,2
228,Teacher,"Oh, perfect",,,,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher," Okay, so",,,,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,Farrah,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, Can you remind me of your answer,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
228,Luis,Sorry to interrupt,,,120.4,response,0,0,2
228,Luis," I'm sorry but I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,220.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher," Luis But I want to talk about how we answered the questions, not so much the facts about the moon",,,220.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,"Well, it's really good to have background knowledge on space",,,220.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Luis,"Um, how we answer the questions",,,220.1,response,0,0,2
228,Luis, Okay,,,220.1,response,0,0,2
228,Luis, Okay,,,220.1,response,0,0,2
228,Luis, Yeah,,,220.1,response,0,0,2
228,Luis, Yeah,,,220.1,response,0,0,2
228,Luis, Okay,,,220.1,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher, But it's really great that you know a lot about space that's going to be really helpful with how you answer the questions,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,"Okay, so we're going to work on that",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,Alright so Farrah,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, Can you remind me of your answer,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
228,Farrah,"Yeah, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher, One thing that your answer is missing is kind of a connection to that question,,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, So,,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher," And so you said you need a Microsoft microscope to look really closely, but one",,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,That is a really good answer,,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher," So remember, our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,Is there a way that you can add some words to that that would strengthen your response and make it connect to the question a little more,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Farrah,"Um, well, I picked an equipment and it's about water",,,420.2,response,0,0,2
228,Farrah, And so,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Farrah,"And I got it straight from the text, so I know I did all the right things that in the question I'm in",,,,response,0,0,2
228,Farrah,"Um,",,,,response,0,0,2
228,Farrah,And that's what it says in the story,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher, Exactly,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, So you had all of the right information,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher," Like, if I were to answer your question I'd use your exact words I say something like, to discover water on the moon",,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, It's the one thing,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,You're right,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, Right,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, So if I look at it without the question I still know what you're talking about,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, Right,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,You need a specific scientific tool called Microsoft to look really closely,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, So if you just add that little sentence that helps give your answer some context,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,"Yes, yes",,,,remark,0,0,2
228,Jazmin, And I know that the small machine NASA sent was looking for the water,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Jazmin,"I don't understand why my answer is wrong because I when I read it, it said to discover water on the moon",,,,response,0,0,2
228,Jazmin,So that seems like that's the right answer,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher,"You're right, it is the right answer, but we want to just add a little bit more to all of our answers to make them a little bit stronger",,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,"Right, so NASA did send a small machine, but can you add some details like what was that machine called",,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, Do you remember,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,It was called the Lunar Orbiter,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, That was something that was in our text water on the moon,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, And so adding small details like that can really strengthen our response,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,So if we add good,,,,remark,0,0,2
228,Jazmin,"Yes, I sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is that that that would be",,,,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher, Do you see why it's a better answer,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,That is a way better answer,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Jazmin, Because I added more words,,,150.1,response,0,0,2
228,Jazmin,I'm good,,,150.1,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher,You added more words and you added specific details,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,0,0,2
228,Jazmin,Yeah yeah,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher,So when we're gonna fix some of our answers we want to add some specific details from the text and we will so that we can show that we have a really deep understanding of what was that,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,so Chris,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher," Can you tell me what your response was,",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
228,Chris,"Yeah, I bet the creators but but",,,420.2,response,0,0,2
228,Chris, Yeah,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Chris,But something about the creators obey the partner from the printers food,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher, So the as that,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, That is a really good answer,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,You're right,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, And you've told me where on the moon,,,430.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,The question asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,430.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, Right,,,430.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, The water was discovered,,,430.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, So what can you add to your thoughts to just make it a little bit stronger,,,430.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Chris,Where the equipment,,,430.1,response,0,0,2
228,Chris,The equipment,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Chris," Well, I went to NASA",,,,response,0,0,2
228,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks on masks and shoots,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher, But can we try to think back to that text we read in the equipment that excited,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, I can read you the sentence if you'd like,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,Exactly,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,"It's an NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate this this lunar orbiter looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,"So, is there information from that sentence that you can add to your response to just make it a little stronger",,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
228,Chris,NASA sent a small machine,,,420.2,response,0,0,2
228,Chris,Ice deposits and polar craters,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Chris," Oh, okay",,,,response,0,0,2
228,Chris, They found craters for water,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Chris,Price,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Chris,When NASA sent a small machine,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher,That was a perfect response,,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher," Yes, that was a perfect response you used direct language from the text used specific vocab and you provided reasoning",,,510.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, That was a perfect or smart,,,510.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, Good job,,,510.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,Really Alice,,,510.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, It was very specific,,,510.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,"Okay, Oliver",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, Can you tell me,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
228,Oliver,Same thing,,,120.4,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher, So you said that they needed a specific tool called the microscope,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,"Oh, okay",,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Oliver,"Yeah, to look really closely",,,110.1,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher,To look really closely,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, Remember how we talked,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, So is there,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher, Good,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
228,Teacher,To Farrah earlier and gave her some suggestions,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
228,Oliver,On you saturate have to add more details to her thing so I'm,,,230.3,response,0,0,2
228,Oliver,All,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Oliver,I'm more details,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Oliver, I guess that's on your name assigned to a pool of water,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Oliver,We should add the water you need,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Oliver,To look really closely at the water,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher,"Yeah, exactly",,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Oliver,"Okay, okay, I'm",,,110.1,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher,Good,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
228,Oliver,I'm sorry,,,110.1,response,0,0,2
228,Oliver," I didn't mean to interrupt you, but I was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to watch",,,110.1,response,0,0,2
228,Teacher,Talking,,,,remark,0,0,2
228,Oliver,"Yeah yeah you i i really appreciate how you helped us all use evidence from the text to add more details to our, our answers",,,,response,0,0,2
228,Oliver, Thanks so much,,,,response,0,0,2
228,Oliver, I'm teacher,,,,response,0,0,2
228,All,"Thank you,",,,,,0,0,2
228,Teacher,Okay guys so now we're going to work on question number two,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,Is there convincing convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,so Farrah can you remind me of your answer yes Luis,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
228,Luis,I think I got this all figured out so i'm all good,,,120.2,response,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"Well, I want us to work on how we answer the questions, not necessarily the information we already know about the water on the moon um but just how we answer the question okay",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,Farrah let's start with you,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
228,Farrah,"Okay yeah so I said no, not for a long time",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
228,Teacher,So what makes you think,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,there's no water on the moon won't be valuable for a long time,,,,remark,2,0,2
228,Farrah,"Because, at the end of the story, it talks about how it's gonna be really expensive and take a lot of time and a lot of money and they probably won't be able to do it",,,,response,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"Okay, and the end of the article says that",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
228,Farrah,uh huh,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
228,Teacher,Okay that's,,,,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"that's a good point, yes, and last paragraph, I see I see um",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,So,,,,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,but you didn't necessarily write in your answer for me or any of your classmates to see,,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,um that is like a lot of really good evidence that you shared with me in your answer,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"um which is one concern I have for you, although that is a very good point that it's going to cost a lot of money and it might take a very long time for us to get there",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"But you just one concern that I have is that if I was just reading your response and I had no other context, I would say, well, what can't we do for a long time?",,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"Right, so one suggestion that I have for you is maybe i'm being a little bit more specific with your words and even including the evidence that you had ready to tell me in your response",,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"So that right right away, I know exactly what you're talking about right",,,,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"yeah Okay, thank you Luis why don't we look at your response",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
228,Jazmin,Excuse me teacher i'm still confused,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
228,Jazmin,"Okay, so Farrah needed like more information in hers but I put a lot of information in my answer and it's still needs work",,,,response,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"Okay, so let's look at your answers Jazmin so you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water right",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"And that is, that is a very true point um and I think this answer was a really good answer I just know",,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,That we can make it just a little bit better um so one concern I have about your response is that I was just reading your response kinda like I was just reading savannas and I wouldn't necessarily know what the question was asking right because,,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,Am are you defending that there should be water on the spaceships or are you defending why we should extract the water on the moon,,,,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,Do you see how there could be some confusion there,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"So I think yeah yeah, so I think one suggestion I have for you, like the suggestion I had for Farrah would just to be to add a few more specific details, so that I and your peers can",,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,Fully know you're talking about when we read your responses right because you won't always be there to explain it,,,,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"All right, Luis would you like your turn now",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
228,Luis,"Yes, I, like my turn, thank you",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"Okay, so you said water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen and what I like about",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
228,Luis,I was gonna say I took it from the text,,,110.1,response,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"That is what I like about your responses, you took that specifically from the text you",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"And that was my favorite part about your response, but",,,,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,One thing I was thinking is,,,,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"That, how is that valuable, so we can do that right, we can split water water molecules into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen but what does that do for us, how is that valuable to the astronauts that are on the moon",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
228,Luis,Oh,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
228,Luis,Well you can drink well um we need oxygen to breathe so that's important,,,,response,2,0,2
228,Teacher,So let's go back into the text and try to find that specific line that you were referring to,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
228,Luis,Okay,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
228,Luis,important resource,,,,response,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"Oh, I think it's in paragraph number five",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
228,Luis,Oh yeah that's where I found it okay okay astronauts could breathe oxygen okay,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
228,Luis,"See, I said that and oxygen hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel",,,,response,2,0,2
228,Luis,"rocket fuel help spacecrafts to move, just like gas helps cards to Okay, I could say all of that stuff i'd have to write all that down",,,,response,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"You don't so you don't have to take the exact words from the text in your answer, but i'm one of the suggestions I haven't even if you just pick one of those things so um if you, you could pick just that oxygen",,,,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"is needed for astronauts to breathe, and so, if you added that to your response, it would help me and any of your friends, reading the response understand why the water on the moon is valuable to us, yes Chris",,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
228,Luis,Okay,,,420.2,response,2,0,2
228,Chris,There could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,,response,2,0,2
228,Teacher,That would be really cool and maybe we would see some of the stuff that we're reading about actually taking place and we have all this knowledge about it now because we read about it,,,110.3,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,Would you yeah yeah exactly right all right let's look at your response now Chris,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"So you said, water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore so like Luis I really liked this answer because they this is right from the text you took this information, right from the text, and that is a really important part of answering text specific questions",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"And i'm similar to the feedback, I was just giving Luis um I just don't get your answer just doesn't necessarily remind me of the question right like how Is that why water is valuable why it's valuable to get it from the moon, or why",,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,Why it's better to not have it on the ships,,,,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,To restate the question exactly So if you restate the question you say something like,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
228,Teacher,"One piece of convincing evidence that water could be on i'm extracted from the moon, is that it's too heavy to be on the ships, yes",,,,remark,2,0,2
228,Oliver,i'm sorry teacher,,,,response,2,0,2
228,Oliver,"I was looking at five o'clock and I can see that it's time for us to go to lunch, I want to say thank you for how you like made everybody feel valued and you kind of explained when you explain what they needed to work on it give me ideas on how I can improve my answer",,,,response,2,0,2
228,Teacher,i'm happy to hear that,,,,remark,2,0,2
228,Oliver,"Okay, bye",,,,response,2,0,2
229,Teacher, So now that we have all made our,,,,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,All right class,,,,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,Our responses for the,,,,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,Text of the water on the moon,,,,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,"I'm going to go around and yes, Luis?",,,,remark,0,0,4
229,Luis,Excuse me,,,,response,0,0,4
229,Luis,"I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,0,4
229,Teacher,"Yes, I see that you know a lot about space, but we're also going to further what we're going to know about space and use our knowledge about space to figure out more on the water on the moon",,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
229,Luis,Okay,,,150.1,response,0,0,4
229,Teacher,"Okay, so let's start with you",,,410.3,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher, Luis So you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks on the moon,,,410.3,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher," So I in the article I don't recall them saying that they use oxygen tanks, however I know that astronauts do use oxygen tanks",,,410.3,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,Take a look at the second paragraph of the article,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher, What machine did NASA said that they use to discover the water?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Luis,NASA sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
229,Luis,This machine,,,,response,0,0,4
229,Luis, It's a lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,0,4
229,Teacher,"Yes, perfect",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher, So then after they use the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher, What did they use to look at the water?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,Look at the third paragraph,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Luis,That means that the moon is drier than the driest desert on the earth,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
229,Luis,The water they found is microscopic meaning you can't see it if you're looking straight at it,,,,response,0,0,4
229,Luis,You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look real close,,,,response,0,0,4
229,Luis,"The microscope, I think, maybe",,,,response,0,0,4
229,Teacher,"Yes, perfect",,,110.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,"Good job, Luis",,,110.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,"Jazmin, you said that they use a small machine",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher," So great job, recalling that they sent the small machine to discover the water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher, Do you remember what the name of the machine was called?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Jazmin,I don't remember,,,210.4,response,0,0,4

229,Teacher,The other thing they use the other equipment that they used to see the water?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher, So they had to look very closely at at it because it was so tiny,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,"Alright, let's look at the third paragraph",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher, Right,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4

229,Teacher,Your answer is not wrong,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher, So this is a two part question,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,There's two different equipment that they use to see the water on the moon,,,130.3,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,So first they found it with a lunar orbiter right?,,,130.3,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,"Now they're now after they found it, what are they going to use to see the water on the moon",,,130.3,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,Look at the third paragraph,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Luis,"I just read it, Jazmin",,,210.4,response,0,0,4

229,Teacher,Do you remember what equipment do you use to find it?,,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,Great job remembering that they found the water on the moon,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
229,Chris, So I'm figuring that's the right answer,,,110.2,response,0,0,4
229,Chris,"Um, well Jazmin just said the Lunar Orbiter and the microscope and you told her that was right",,,110.2,response,0,0,4
229,Teacher, So can you show me where in the text she found those answers?,,,230.2,remark,0,0,4

229,Oliver,Uh huh,,,110.1,response,0,0,4
229,Teacher, Right?,,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,So Farrah said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
229,Oliver,"Yeah, I circled that same thing",,,110.1,response,0,0,4
229,Teacher," What did you, why did you circle those things?",,,230.1,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,You wrote the same thing,,,230.1,remark,0,0,4
229,Oliver,"Because, well, um",,,230.1,response,0,0,4
229,Oliver,"I was looking for where it said, water, and that was paragraph three was talking about looking at the water",,,,response,0,0,4
229,Oliver,"And then I was looking for equipment and I saw it said microscope, and microscope is equipment",,,,response,0,0,4
229,Teacher,Great job! So that's great job using your skills in the text using the context of the text to find your answer,,,310.1,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,"So can you - before they found the water, what did they use to find it?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher, Great job,,,310.1,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher,So they found the water and used the microscope to use - to see the water because it was so tiny,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Teacher, But what did they do to find it? Do you remember?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
229,Oliver,"Well, it's the same thing that Chris said, right?",,,210.4,response,0,0,4

229,Oliver," Teacher, I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, you know, this was really short, and we just met, but I really appreciate how you helped us look for the evidence in the text to add to our answers",,,110.1,response,0,0,4
229,Oliver,Ms,,,110.1,response,0,0,4

230,Teacher,Hi everyone,,,,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,0,0,3
230,Luis, So I don't really think I even need to be in this group,,,,response,0,0,3
230,Luis, Like all about space,,,,response,0,0,3
230,Luis,"Yes, so I have like already know",,,,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher," Alright, sounds like a plan?",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,"Well, why don't we take a look at your answers really quick and see what we see what you wrote",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
230,Luis,"Yeah, I can do that",,,120.4,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher,Okay so Luis You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher, I think that that was a really great answer in response to the reading and the question,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,But - And I really enjoyed like how you use your background knowledge to help you support this,,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher, Because like you said you know a lot about space,,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher," They didn't talk about that in the, in the passage",,,410.3,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,"but I just -did you -this phrase in general, would you wrote was not used",,,410.3,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,So did you have questions about the passage?,,,410.3,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,or is there a statement that you might think of or an answer to the question that you might have based with evidence from the reading?,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Luis," And so I was thinking like even like if it's not in the reading, then I think the readings leaving it out, you know?",,,420.2,response,0,0,3
230,Luis,"Yeah, I was just more thinking like these are things that I know because I really love space and my dad is an astronaut",,,420.2,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher," That's true, yeah, maybe it is, but I think there's something to think about is that when we're doing these assignments, we want to make sure that we're using the reading to backup our thoughts and to use evidence from the reading",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,Okay,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Luis,"So I should make sure that I'm like I'm using something from from the reading, rather than-",,,420.2,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher,Next time,,,,remark,0,0,3
230,Luis,Okay,,,,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher,Awesome,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher, Does anyone else have any questions about their responses?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,"Yeah, Farrah, why don't you go",,,,remark,0,0,3
230,Farrah,"Um so for me basically um I guess my question was, I don't really understand like right now why my answer is-",,,,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher, I didn't hear the last part of that,,,,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,Why your answer is wrong? I'm sorry,,,,remark,0,0,3
230,Farrah, I guess I just don't understand right now,,,,response,0,0,3
230,Farrah, Like why my answer is wrong,,,,response,0,0,3
230,Farrah,"Yeah, sorry",,,,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher, I think sometimes they can use improvement,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher," But Farrah, I do want to point out that your response",,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,So I think your answers - none of your answers are wrong,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,So you said that you need a scientific tool called the microscope to look really closely,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,I think it was a really great response and you had you used your academic vocabulary and you used something that was stated directly from the text,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,I don't necessarily - you're not all necessarily here because your answers were wrong or bad,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,"But I think Farrah by you being here, you can use - your friends and your classmates can use you as a resource if they have questions in the future about the readings or assignments that we're doing, because it seems like you really understand understand this assignment",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
230,Farrah,That's great,,,110.3,response,0,0,3
230,Farrah, Thank you,,,110.3,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher, Did you have a question?,,,,remark,0,0,3
230,Jazmin,"Well, I was just going to kind of say the same thing",,,,response,0,0,3
230,Jazmin," And I was just wondering, like why my answer was wrong",,,,response,0,0,3
230,Jazmin," Because, like, what, what I said was, NASA sent a small machine",,,,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher, You did use an idea that was stated directly from the text,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,And Jazmin that answer was really great,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,"So like I said earlier, none of your answers are wrong",,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,I think a next time,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher," If there's something we could Oliverelop that a little bit more like talking, you can say, you know what kind of small machine did they use",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,Or different things like that,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher," Just Oliverelop your thought process a little bit more than you already, then you already have",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher, But there's nothing wrong with your answer,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Jazmin,I can't tell - what would a better answer sound like?,,,420.2,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher," Instead of just saying, NASA used a small machine, you could say, NASA used the lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,"So you could say, NASA, so like it said in the reading, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Jazmin, That makes sense,,,420.2,response,0,0,3
230,Jazmin,"Ohhh, okay",,,420.2,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher,"Yeah, Chris or Oliver",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher, Do you have questions?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Chris,"Well, I guess the thing that I was thinking was kind of what Luis was saying before, I still have a question about it because I went to NASA with my dad",,,150.1,response,0,0,3
230,Chris,"And I know that scientists like lots of equipment like you know like oxygen tanks masks and stuff like that and like it just like, you know what I mean",,,,response,0,0,3
230,Chris," Like, that seems really important",,,,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher,"Yeah, it's really - it is really important",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,And but just because they didn't talk about it in the reading doesn't mean it's not important,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,But I want us,,,120.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher," And the question from the assignment was what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon,",,,120.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,"and we want to make sure we're going to, we want to make sure that we're using the text to support our answers",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher, But the goal,,,120.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher," Now, although they did and that is correct, that answer wasn't necessarily answering the question",,,410.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher, Do you understand?,,,410.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,"So your - Chris, your response with scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,410.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Chris,Oh,,,410.1,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher,"Because we were asking about equipment, not what they found",,,410.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Chris,"Okay, that that actually makes that makes a lot of sense, thank you",,,410.1,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher," And Oliver, do you have a question?",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,"Yeah, of course",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
230,Oliver,Well basically I wrote the same thing as Farrah,,,150.1,response,0,0,3
230,Oliver,"So I guess I was wondering, like,",,,,response,0,0,3
230,Oliver,"So is the answer to the question that like that both the Lunar Orbiter and the microscope are used, or is it like one of that is the right answer?",,,,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher,"There's - so as long as you're using evidence to support your answer, there is really there isn't technically a wrong answer",,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher," One second, Luis",,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher," The Lunar Orbiter and the microscope are both pieces of equipment that are used, so that the both of those answers, would be correct",,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,But the Lunar Orbiter,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher, It's not one is right and one is wrong,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3

230,Luis,"Like you really helped us to make sure that we were drawing, like from the reading when we were answering questions and like also like it was really important like when you were asking like",,,,response,0,0,3
230,Luis, But thank you so much,,,,response,0,0,3
230,Luis, And it was really easy for us to understand what you are asking,,,,response,0,0,3
230,Luis,You know when you are helping Chris like understand like how to approach the question like that was really clear,,,,response,0,0,3
230,Teacher,"Well, thank you for working with me today",,,,remark,0,0,3
230,Teacher,hi everyone,,,,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,How are you doing today,,,,remark,1,0,3
230,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"So Luis I'm really glad, you bring up a good point, so the point of this group, I just wanted, I want you guys to know is that",,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"You guys made some really great points, some of the points that you well made all together or your in your work separately um some of them could use a little bit of improvement here and there",,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"The questions were asking for some direct information from the reading and different things like that, and I think some of you might have missed some of it",,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,Because you're in this group doesn't mean that you did something wrong or that you did something bad we're just here to improve the work that you've already done,,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"All right does anyone, excuse me does anyone else have any other questions",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"Alright, so um Farrah do you want to share the answer that you got for the first question yeah sure okay",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
230,Farrah,I said um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"um yeah I so one thing that I noticed from your response, I thought that your response was really well and you wrote it very well and you made the points very clear",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,I will say the there one part of improvement or one area of improvement that I think that you could work on would be looking at all of the tools that they referenced because,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"Yes they did use telescopes but sometimes they also use that there are other tools that they utilize as well, so I just want to make sure you that you're going back and referencing the reading that we have in the assignment to make sure that you're getting all of the points possible",,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,Does that makes sense,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
230,Farrah,Oh yeah I guess,,,150.1,response,1,0,3
230,Farrah,you're saying that I was wrong,,,,response,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"No, you weren't wrong I just think you were not wrong you did make a very clear point and the, you stated that the scientists they use microscopes to look closely",,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,so you weren't wrong I just think that you could build upon your answer to add more to it to make it even stronger,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
230,Farrah,Okay,,,130.1,response,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"Okay um how about Oliver, what did what was your answer",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
230,Oliver,I have that same answer us Farrah,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
230,Oliver,I still don't understand why my answers wrong,,,,response,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"So I don't think that your answer so like I was saying that your answers are necessarily wrong if you're sitting in this group, I think your answers in the work that you did could use some improvement",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,So Oliver so what I noticed by saying you know by you saying that I circled the same thing as Farrah,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,I have my question to you is did you understand the reading completely like did you did you have questions about it?,,,410.3,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,Did you maybe not understand certain parts of the reading?,,,410.3,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,Because we want to make sure that when you are working,,,410.3,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher, Even though you're working with your partner and sometimes when you work independently you won't be able to have the person to bounce ideas off of,,,410.3,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"and so being able to write your own answer is beneficial as well, instead of the same as Farrah in this case",,,410.3,remark,1,0,3
230,Oliver,"I mean, I understood it was just that Farrah went first, so she said her answer and mine was the same",,,410.3,response,1,0,3
230,Oliver,I found the same answer in the story yeah I understood it,,,,response,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"Oh okay well if that's the case and that's perfect and like I, so I would have the same note for Farrah as well",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"and give you the same note that I gave Farrah, although the answer is correct, I think that you could build a deeper meaning and build build upon your answer to Oliverelop it even more and make it even stronger than it already is",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
230,Oliver,"Oh OK OK, I guess I mean what I like I read the whole thing and I looked for all the key words and I found I found that sentence with the key words in it",,,130.1,response,1,0,3
230,Teacher,mm hmm no you're not Oliver you're not I want I want you to understand that you're not wrong,,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"Your answer is correct, I just when i'm looking at the answers I know that there are more parts that you can add to the answer and to make it a stronger answer doesn't it doesn't mean that it's right or wrong, it just can be stronger",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,Okay yeah Chris,,,,remark,1,0,3
230,Chris,um I was looking at the question again and I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"yeah, so I think you're right like because you went to NASA you're able to use your background knowledge and you're able to build off of what you already know",,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,And they do mention in the reading and then the story about,,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"The different thing that they that they need, so they need",,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"They have the oxygen tanks, because they need to be able to breathe",,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,and different things like that i'm lost in my reading i'm so sorry guys i'm,,,,remark,1,0,3
230,Chris,"I mean, some of it came from a story and some of it came from when me and my dad were looking at you know the pictures and the stuff that the astronauts used when they used to go on their space missions",,,,response,1,0,3
230,Chris,So yeah,,,,response,1,0,3
230,Teacher,So I think yeah I mean it's super important and really awesome that you're able to build off of the background knowledge and build off of the knowledge that you already have and what you already know,,,410.3,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"I think some of it, too, so when we are looking at the reading and we are doing the assignment, we want to make sure that when we're working we're we're referencing the information that's in front of us and that's in the reading",,,410.3,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"You know, having a conversation with someone talking about what kind of equipment do scientists need or things like that, then",,,410.3,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"Absolutely, I think it's the perfect time to bring up bubble my dad my went to NASA We saw this that and the next thing right",,,410.3,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"So, but we have an assignment and there's a reading and it tells us the different things that they use and the equipment that they use to make certain discoveries or things like that we want to make sure that we're using what's in the text versus what we already know prior",,,430.3,remark,1,0,3
230,Teacher,Does that make sense to you,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
230,Chris,"yeah yeah it did okay I bought my answer, I did all pull some information from the text",,,150.1,response,1,0,3
230,Teacher,yeah you yep do you want to share with you wrote,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
230,Oliver,"i'm sorry teacher, but I was just looking at the clock and it's time for the next group so we'll have to see you later",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
230,Teacher,"Okay Okay, no worries thanks for working with me guys",,,,remark,1,0,3
230,Jazmin,Okay bye,,,,response,1,0,3
230,Teacher,hi guys,,,,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,I think we're just so we're just going to pick up right where we left off last time we met so Jazmin why don't you go ahead and share the answer that you had,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"Oh hold on one second Jazmin, Luis what's up",,,,remark,2,0,3
230,Luis,"Okay, no, I think I got this all figured out so i'm all good",,,,response,2,0,3
230,Teacher,", alright sound like a good plan?",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,Okay well why don't you stick around for a few more minutes just we can hear because I want to talk about your answer after Jazmin's done,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"Oh Okay, thank you alright Jazmin why don't you go ahead and read your answer",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
230,Jazmin,"Okay, so I said NASA send a small machine",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
230,Teacher,So I so one note that I thought of,,,,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"When I read your answer that like I want, I want to reinforce and I want you to know that your answer is correct you're you're you're not sitting at the table, because your answer is wrong, none of you are",,,110.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"But I feel as though, like with a few of your other parents your answer can use a little bit more umpf, they could have he could have a little bit more to it",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,In the reading it did state clearly what kind of tool um or excuse me what the name of the small machine is Do you remember the name of the small machine,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
230,Jazmin,"Remember the name of it, no",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"that's Okay, so in the reading it referenced i'm the small machine it's called a moon lunar orbiter to investigate",,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
230,Jazmin,"yeah Okay, I see that right there",,,130.3,response,2,0,3
230,Jazmin,it's right in the same sentence,,,,response,2,0,3
230,Teacher,yeah that's that's totally okay um so we just want to make sure that when we are answering our questions that were being as clear as possible,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"You know, we can be concise and still state the machine that they sent up to the moon was the Lunar orbiter",,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"It still has the same, it is the same, it does almost the same thing that your answer had that you wrote down but it just gives that a little bit more power to prove and to show that you are able to go back and reference, the text, while also understanding what you read",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"Does that make sense, do you have any questions",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
230,Jazmin,Still kind of confused,,,150.1,response,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"What do you know, so why don't you what are you confused about why don't you share so we can try to figure it out and work through it",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
230,Jazmin,"Okay, so",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
230,Jazmin,"When you said, I have to just save the name of the machine so that part I understood",,,,response,2,0,3
230,Jazmin,"But then, you were saying",,,,response,2,0,3
230,Jazmin,"That I should add, add more to my sentence, so that has more power?",,,,response,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"yeah so what I, so what I meant by that, basically, is just you want to make sure that you're stating the information that's written in the text, so instead of saying like you wrote",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,NASA sent a small machine next time you can write NASA send a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to the moon instead,,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
230,Jazmin,RER: I have to write more words?,,,130.3,response,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"Okay, does that make more sense?",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"Not yeah more words but you want to make sure that you don't necessarily have it's not always more words you just want to make sure that you're using the text and you're able to reference, the text in your reading",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,awesome um Luis What about you do you want to share your answer?,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
230,Luis,"yeah Okay, so I said i'm scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"So I think that you, so I want to do want to point out",,,,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"That, I think your answer is great, and you did do a great job again i'm clarifying you know, saying that",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,That scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks it's a clear point,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"They talk about in the text, but I think that you can add even a little bit more they do talk about different types of equipment or different things that they could use or that they might need",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"While they're up there, so I think in the future when you're doing your assignment and when you're reading or in your reading and you're filling up the questions and answering",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"That you can add a little bit more that's kind of the whole point of all of you, being in this group today",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"your answers aren't necessarily wrong, but I feel as though that when we go back and that when we do the assignment again you'll have you will know, know for next time that you can sit there, and you can add more",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"information from the texts or like direct quotes or like add the names of the machines, instead of generalizing it yeah Chris",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Chris,I read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024,,,420.2,response,2,0,3
230,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"that's a really, really cool that's really interesting, I wonder, if it will happen, maybe it won't",,,110.3,remark,2,0,3
230,Farrah,"yeah Okay, I only do what you were saying about Jazmin's answer because she didn't say the name of the machine but",,,110.3,response,2,0,3
230,Farrah,I wrote a complete sentence and I pulled mine from the text,,,,response,2,0,3
230,Teacher,yeah and you you're correct Farrah you did do that um,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"I part of what I think with your answer is that although you stated they used a microscope,",,,130.1,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"I think what the question was asking was for you to talk about what kind of tools, help them discover more water on earth, excuse me, not on earth",,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"On the moon, they use a microscope but what but what really helped them discover like what was the tool that really helped them find the water okay",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
230,Farrah,RER: yeah yeah yeah that does make sense okay,,,150.1,response,2,0,3
230,Teacher,does anyone else have any other questions,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
230,Chris,"Okay, this one isn't a question, but now i'm just all thinking about my answer",,,150.1,response,2,0,3
230,Chris,Cuz mine came from the story too,,,,response,2,0,3
230,Chris,Is it the same as savannas?,,,,response,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"So Chris your answer, although it did come straight from the article and the reading that we had",,,130.1,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"Your answer wasn't necessarily answering what the question was so the question was asking, so the first question",,,410.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,"so with  your answer it's as if you just needed to continue writing a little bit more you kind of phrase it as like your sentence starter, but didn't add more to it",,,430.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,So you have written that scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,They found the craters by using the Lunar orbiter helped them find the craters on the moon you just needed to add that little extra bit at the end of it to make sure that you really got the answer,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
230,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,2,0,3
230,Oliver,"yeah it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you for explaining what each of us needed to work on, because it gave me some ideas",,,,response,2,0,3

232,Luis, I have already kind of know all there is to know about space,,,,response,0,0,1
232,Teacher,"Well, I'm glad you know a lot about space already because we know background knowledge is very important",,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
232,Teacher, So maybe there's a few things that you could share with us that you know that may be myself or the other students might not know,,,110.3,remark,0,0,1

232,Luis,Yeah,,,110.3,response,0,0,1
232,Teacher,"Alright so Farrah, you mentioned in the text that scientists use a tool called a microscope",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
232,Teacher, What does that tell us about this stuff on the moon that they're looking at,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
232,Teacher,So if scientists are using a tool called a microscope,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
232,Farrah,"It tells us that it tells us that it's really small, like, whatever it is, because it says it's microscopic",,,210.4,response,0,0,1

232,Teacher,"Yeah, so the small water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
232,Teacher, You can think about things,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
232,Teacher, What else do you think scientists use microscopes to look at it doesn't have to be on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
232,Teacher, Maybe you've used a microscope,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
232,Teacher,Luis have you used a microscope before?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1

232,Farrah,Totally,,,230.2,response,0,0,1
232,Farrah,You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close to you have to like they couldn't find it,,,,response,0,0,1
232,Farrah," Unless you saw it, right, or did they find it another way?",,,,response,0,0,1
232,Teacher,So to find evidence,,,510.1,remark,0,0,1

232,Teacher, I'm glad you brought that up your background knowledge,,,110.3,remark,0,0,1

232,Teacher,So the question we're answering is what equipment do scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,1

234,Farrah," You know, like that that you can't",,,,response,0,1,3
234,Farrah," I think you can't find the water, unless you can see it",,,,response,0,1,3
234,Farrah,"We wouldn't be able to see he were looking straight at it, you need a microscope to look really close, so like I guess that's that seems like really important to me",,,,response,0,1,3
234,Farrah,"Well, I'm not sure why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,3
234,Teacher, Your answer isn't wrong,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher,I just wanted to see where you found it,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher,No,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher," I wanted to have like specific textual evidence, I know you found it in the text, but I wanted you to point it out to the rest of the class knows where to look",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
234,Farrah,Okay,,,410.2,response,0,1,3
234,Teacher, I just wanted everybody to be on the same page,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher, I like there,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher,There was nothing wrong with your answer,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher, I like both of your answers,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
234,Farrah,Sounds good,,,110.2,response,0,1,3
234,Teacher,AND then Chris,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher, so your response says that they found craters full of water,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher," But you didn't really answer the question of what equipment they use, or do they use to find the craters",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
234,Chris, So like I didn't say like what equipment,,,410.2,response,0,1,3
234,Chris,"Oh, like, Oh, I see",,,410.2,response,0,1,3
234,Chris, I just was talking about craters,,,410.2,response,0,1,3
234,Chris," So, okay, that's actually that's really helpful",,,410.2,response,0,1,3
234,Chris," When I know that because my dad took me to NASA, but there's like You know what I mean like I saw that scientists use oxygen tanks and masks and spacesuits kind of like what we're saying",,,,response,0,1,3
234,Chris," And so I guess I'm wondering, like, that's not in the reading",,,,response,0,1,3
234,Chris,So I'm not sure what I mean,,,,response,0,1,3
234,Chris, Here's the thing,,,,response,0,1,3
234,Teacher," So can you elaborate more on like background knowledge that you have? Also oxygen tanks and spacesuits, things like that",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher, So you and Luis kind of have similar responses,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher,"Well, there is always textual evidence, but it's good to bring back our knowledge as well that could help you bring the text to life",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
234,Chris,Like you have to use equipment,,,230.1,response,0,1,3
234,Chris," And I guess I guess the yeah yeah i mean i know a lot about like use like rocket fuel and you have use stuff like that, you know what I mean",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
234,Chris, If you're going into space,,,230.1,response,0,1,3
234,Teacher,You have to actually get to the moon before you actually discover the water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
234,Chris," Yeah, exactly",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
234,Chris,Yeah,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
234,Teacher,"Okay, great response Chris",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher, When I heard your response,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher, You just sent you said that NASA sent a small machine,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher, You were a little vague,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher," What, what was the machine called, what they do",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher,"Now, Jazmin",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher,Can you be a little more specific,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher,"Oh yeah, the machine is called, the machine is lunar orbiter",,,,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher,"And what did the machine do, what is used for?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
234,Jazmin,"You mean the lunar orbiter, it's how they discovered the water",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
234,Teacher, I feel like you have a little bit of surface up,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher,You happen to know what the lunar orbiter is,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
234,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,0,1,3
234,Farrah,"Um, so, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch,  like I wanted to make sure to thank you",,,,response,0,1,3
234,Farrah,"And in particular, I wanted to thank you for helping us to try to clarify answers and, you know, asking us to make sure to use the text when we were responding to your questions to that we had added to thank you so much for working with us was really fun",,,,response,0,1,3
234,Farrah, Bye bye,,,,response,0,1,3
234,Farrah, Thank you,,,,response,0,1,3
234,Teacher,Everyone so after reading all your answers,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,It seems that there's a little bit of confusion,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,You all feel very strongly towards the question of whether they would be or there wouldn't be and it seems that there is a divide between the yes and the no,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,So,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher, Now what part of the text makes you think that the water would be a valuable resource?,,,230.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,i'd like to focus first on those that said that they do that there is sufficient evidence so that would be Chris Jazmin Luis,,,230.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"Yes, okay",,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Luis,yeah actually I think I got this all figured out i'm all good,,,,response,2,1,3
234,Teacher,You do,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,What makes you think you got all figured out,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Luis,"Okay, because you know I mean I already know that they found water on the moon, I already know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff so i'm good",,,230.1,response,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"So is this from prior knowledge that you like read or seen the show, or is it that you, you like you have a really good understanding of the text",,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Luis,"Well, I mean I I read a lot of stuff about space and I watch Nova on PBS so yeah like I have a lot of prior knowledge about this already",,,230.1,response,2,1,3
234,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,Oh,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"that's very good that you have all this like information in your head, so I feel like well I don't know about the rest of the class, but maybe you would have a better and a better answer to go so",,,110.3,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"But, based on the text, what makes you believe that water could be a valuable resource",,,230.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,You said that,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"Water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,What made you say that,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Luis,Okay okay that part I did see somewhere in this store,,,230.1,response,2,1,3
234,Luis,"In paragraph five it's like the second sentence can be broken down into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen",,,,response,2,1,3
234,Teacher," I really like that you could find that specifically in the types that that tells me that you were reading very carefully, and the fact that you remembered where it came from",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,That's great,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"is very good that means you were paying attention, yes, good job",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,So,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher," Now your answer, yes Jazmin",,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"I just wanted to clarify what the question was, so it says that is there convincing evidence that water in the, on the moon could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Jazmin,i'm,,,120.2,response,2,1,3
234,Jazmin,still confused,,,,response,2,1,3
234,Teacher,What are you confused about,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Jazmin,"Well, because",,,230.1,response,2,1,3
234,Jazmin,What Luis got his answer in the text is different from where I got my answer in the,,,,response,2,1,3
234,Jazmin,text,,,,response,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"Really? So i'm trying to clarify Luis's answer, but I will move right on to you after okay",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher, You just stated evidence,,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"Okay, so Luis your answer didn't really say whether or not you agreed that there is enough evidence",,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Luis,Oh,,,150.1,response,2,1,3
234,Luis,yeah yeah yeah okay yeah,,,,response,2,1,3
234,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,Now,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,Does my suggestion makes sense would that have helped you,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,give a different answer,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Luis,"I gotta say if if I think it's a valuable or not, I think",,,150.1,response,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"yeah using evidence from the text, you have to state whether or not it is a valuable resource",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,Because your answer could have gone either way,,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,You could have said no,,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,Because hydrogen and oxygen,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,split into,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"Water splits into this and it wouldn't be a good resource or yes, because it does split this and that, and if you do read on it's leaning more towards the positive, so I assumed that you were agreeing, but I don't want to have to assume",,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Luis,"Okay, I guess i'm not sure if I agree or not okay",,,410.2,response,2,1,3
234,Teacher, How about you read the text and then i'll come back to you later to see if your answer has changed,,,120.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,Okay,,,120.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Luis,Okay okay,,,120.1,response,2,1,3
234,Chris,"Well, I was just reading I read that there could be a piece by by 2024",,,,response,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"By 2024 wow that is very interesting, we never had a base on the moon ever",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Chris,yeah that could be pretty cool,,,110.1,response,2,1,3
234,Teacher,So you and Jazmin both had very good answers,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,I like,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,How you both,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"did have evidence and that you said, why it would be a good thing",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,Chris just one thing,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"just like Luis he didn't really state if it would be a good thing, so I had to assume that the answer was a positive that you did agree",,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"Okay, and Jazmin you were saying that you found your evidence somewhere else in the text",,,230.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher, Where did you find your evidence,,,230.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Jazmin,"Okay, well, I mean",,,230.2,response,2,1,3
234,Jazmin,"it's not like exactly somewhere else in the text, I guess it's still from that same paragraph now",,,,response,2,1,3
234,Jazmin,Let me try to remember where I found it,,,,response,2,1,3
234,Jazmin,"Oh no yeah it was Okay, it was it was in the one above that because I I pulled it from paragraph four, where it says",,,,response,2,1,3
234,Jazmin,"Tfor example, future astronauts",,,,response,2,1,3
234,Jazmin,Could drink this water so,,,,response,2,1,3
234,Jazmin,"I guess I don't know if Luis was right or if I was right, as we get to different as we got it to different parts of the text",,,,response,2,1,3
234,Teacher,well,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"I like that you did state yours like your agreement or disagreement in this case, you would did agree, and then you did say why it would be a valuable resource because there's water on the moon, and they could drink it so your answer, you had a very good answer",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher, I like that was very clarifying,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"um so the text where you find your evidence isn't necessarily important, so long as you can back it up",,,230.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
234,Jazmin,"yeah yeah it does so, so, then I, my answer is right, I just",,,150.1,response,2,1,3
234,Jazmin," Wait actually what was wrong with my answer, because you, you said that I did good because I answered the question and I said yes",,,150.1,response,2,1,3
234,Teacher,Jazmin okay,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,um,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"So the only part that I would, the only suggestion I have for you and this suggestion is for everybody, not just Jazmin",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"Is that in your answers, I would like you to state where you found your evidence next time okay so",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,If I were to use Jazmin's as an example,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,You said yes astronauts can drink the water to stay hydrated,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"A suggestion I would say, is, I know this because, in paragraph four, it states",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
234,Oliver,Okay okay,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
234,Oliver,yeah that's actually,,,,response,2,1,3
234,Oliver,"helpful for me to teacher, I love, looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I really appreciate how you took the time to explain all of their ideas and and and",,,,response,2,1,3
234,Oliver,"And then kind of make, I feel, like everybody thought to feel valued and their ideas and and I also have some ideas from you, explaining what what we need to work on to get answers",,,,response,2,1,3
234,Teacher,i'm sorry I didn't get,,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Teacher,"Or maybe after lunch, we can talk about the answers",,,,remark,2,1,3
234,Oliver,Okay okay thanks teacher bye,,,,response,2,1,3
236,Teacher,"Hi, guys",,,,remark,0,1,4
236,Luis,"Excuse me, teacher",,,,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,0,1,4
236,Luis,I shouldn't be in this group,,,,response,0,1,4
236,Luis, I already know all about space,,,,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher,"Well, we're just going to go through your guys' answers today just to make sure that we can have a full understanding in the broad spectrum of it",,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher," I think you all have a pretty good understanding, but I want to make sure you know fully what's going on",,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
236,Luis,OK,,,150.1,response,0,1,4
236,Luis,"Oh, OK",,,,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher,OK,,,,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher," So can you-- so can-- oh, gosh",,,,remark,0,1,4
236,Luis,You want to hear-- you want me to tell you what I said again?,,,,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher, LAUGHS,,,,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher,"Yes, please",,,,remark,0,1,4
236,Luis," Oh, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,,response,0,1,4
236,Luis,OK,,,,response,0,1,4
236,Luis, No problem,,,,response,0,1,4
236,Luis, So I said-- let me see what I wrote down,,,,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher," But for this, we're wondering what they're using for the water, you know? So we're wondering instead of just in a general sense what they use, we're thinking what are they using for the water",,,210.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher,So they do use oxygen tanks,,,210.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Luis, OK,,,210.2,response,0,1,4
236,Luis,OK,,,210.2,response,0,1,4
236,Luis," Instead of a general sense, what are they using for the water? OK",,,210.2,response,0,1,4
236,Luis," I mean, they need the oxygen tank to breathe on the moon",,,210.2,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher,"They do, but what are we using to get the water and to see what's going on?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
236,Luis, I don't know,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
236,Luis," Yeah, I don't know",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
236,Luis,Oh,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher,"So does anyone want to-- actually, OK",,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher," One second, guys",,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher, OK,,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher," So Farrah, for example, you said that they used a microscope to look really closely, right?",,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher, Sorry,,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher," Oh, Jesus",,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
236,Farrah, Yeah,,,230.3,response,0,1,4
236,Farrah,Uh-huh,,,230.3,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher,So that's an example of what they used in specifically to find the water and to see what's going on because the goal of this question is how we're identifying the water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher," Because remember, they didn't know if we had any, and then they found it",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher,So--,,,,remark,0,1,4
236,Farrah,Yeah,,,,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher,"Farrah, where did you find this? How did you know? Did you find it in the text?",,,230.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Farrah," In paragraph 3, it was the last sentence of the text that I found it",,,230.2,response,0,1,4
236,Farrah,Yeah,,,230.2,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher, That's great,,,410.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher," And then so Oliver, you said you circled the same as Farrah, but I think we want to go deeper into that, and I want you to have your own answer",,,410.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher,So can you give me something different?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher,Perfect,,,410.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher, Perfect,,,410.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Oliver, So I don't think there is another answer,,,120.4,response,0,1,4
236,Oliver,"Well, I mean, it was this-- I think that's the right answer though because it talked about the equipment and what it does, and it's looking at the water",,,120.4,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher,"Well, there is a couple of answers",,,130.1,remark,0,1,4
236,Jazmin,"Yeah, I think my answer is right, so I don't know why my answer is wrong",,,130.1,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher,Your answer is not wrong at all,,,420.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher, It's actually really great,,,420.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher," I loved your answer, Jazmin",,,420.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher, But can you tell me what the machine is? Can you be a little bit more specific about that?,,,420.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Jazmin, Yeah,,,420.2,response,0,1,4
236,Jazmin,Oh,,,420.2,response,0,1,4
236,Jazmin, Lunar orbiter!,,,420.2,response,0,1,4
236,Jazmin, NASA sent a small machine called lunar orbiter,,,420.2,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher," So when we're saying our answers, we want to be as specific as possible to the text because that's really important to give evidence to what we have instead of just the general",,,420.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher, That's perfect,,,420.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher," So if you have a specific thing from the text, definitely include that always in your response because that gives me an idea of how much you can understand what's going on",,,420.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher,Yeah,,,420.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Jazmin,OK,,,420.2,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher,"So your answer was really, really, really great",,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher, And I really enjoyed it,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
236,Jazmin,"Oh, thank you",,,110.1,response,0,1,4
236,,LAUGHTER,,,,,0,1,4
236,Teacher,"And then Chris, we're going to look at your answer",,,130.1,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher,So could you tell me a piece of equipment that they used?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher," And it was really great, and I think that you really understood the text, but I'm not sure you quite understood the question that we were asking",,,130.1,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher,but something that they used in order to find it is the question that we're asking,,,210.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher,I know that they found it and that's really awesome that you picked that up because I think that's a really great piece of information,,,310.1,remark,0,1,4
236,Chris,"Well, I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks and tanks and suits",,,210.2,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher, That's great that you have that background knowledge,,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher," I mean, that's great",,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher," I think that's really, really important",,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher,Yeah,,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher, I really appreciate you adding that to the conversation,,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
236,Chris, Yeah,,,110.3,response,0,1,4
236,Chris,OK,,,110.3,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher,"But do you know-- like Farrah said the microscope, do you know why they use a microscope from the text?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
236,Chris,"Well, when she read it, it said to look at it really closely",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher, Do you know why they have to look at it so close?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
236,Chris," No, I don't know",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
236,Chris,No,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
236,Teacher,So it's because there's so little water that they need to look at it so close,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher,"So when we're looking at our answers, I want you to be able to maybe explain just why they needed this equipment as well",,,420.2,remark,0,1,4
236,Teacher,Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,4

237,Luis,edu: astronauts could breathe oxygen okay that's something,,,,response,2,1,3
237,Luis,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,,response,2,1,3
237,Teacher,"yeah so in the question, the question says what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon, do you think oxygen tanks to help them to discover the water",,,210.3,remark,2,1,3

237,Luis,"edu: Look, for water, if you can't breathe",,,,response,2,1,3
237,Teacher,"yep so you do need oxygen to help them breathe to find the water, but what equipment was used directly to find the water is what we want to know",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
237,Teacher,Oh,,,,remark,2,1,3
237,Teacher,What did you say Jazmin,,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
237,Jazmin,The lunar orbiter,,,120.4,response,2,1,3
237,Farrah,But I said the microscope and the teacher said that was right,,,,response,2,1,3

237,Teacher,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,,remark,2,1,3
237,Teacher,harvard,,,,remark,2,1,3
237,Teacher,edu: So okay so i'm gonna save a lunar orbiter and the microscope,,,,remark,2,1,3
237,Teacher,it's the microscope and the Lunar orbiter so I want you to tell me why you chose those ones now what made you change your thinking,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
237,Luis,harvard,,,230.1,response,2,1,3
237,Luis,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,230.1,response,2,1,3
237,Luis,"edu: Because because that's what i'm Jazmin had and what Farrah had, and you, you told them that was correct",,,230.1,response,2,1,3
237,Teacher,"yep so the microscope and the Lunar orbiter were definitely use, but I want you to go through the text yourself, and I want you to make sure that you can find yourself where that came from and what the evidence is to support that in the text",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
237,Teacher,"Okay, so that we can make sure we are understanding",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3

237,Luis,harvard,,,,response,2,1,3
237,Luis,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,,response,2,1,3
237,Luis,edu: For microscope,,,,response,2,1,3
237,Luis,"edu: They say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close well actually that's looking at the water that's not looking for the water, so I actually think Farrah is wrong, and I think Jazmin's answers right",,,,response,2,1,3
237,Luis,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,,response,2,1,3
237,Luis,harvard,,,,response,2,1,3
237,Teacher,So Farrah was both they're both correct because it used to discover the water it doesn't have to do with,,,110.2,remark,2,1,3
237,Teacher,"Finding the water it's how they found it so they needed the microscope to find the water, because they had to look very closely at it and they needed the Lunar orbiter to find the water because that's where they used to find the",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3

237,Jazmin,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,,response,2,1,3
237,Jazmin,"edu: that's so vague right that the name, so I then I wrote Now this is meant to solve machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and then there was more more that you, you you suggested that I write, but I don't I don't remember how to make what to add to my answer",,,,response,2,1,3
237,Jazmin,harvard,,,,response,2,1,3
237,Teacher,"So one thing you can do to add to your answer is in the text where did you find that answer, so you can say in paragraph two",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
237,Teacher,"I saw that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to find ice deposits in a large polar crater which led them to discover the water, so we can work those into that that you make sure that you have your details and your explanation as to why you chose that answer",,,,remark,2,1,3
237,Jazmin,OK,,,,response,2,1,3
237,Jazmin,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,,response,2,1,3

237,Teacher,"And they didn't use a lunar orbiter which was similar to Jazmin's so all of you, in your responses can add where you found your answers in the text into your response, so we can all say like in this paragraph, I found in your answer",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3

239,Teacher,"But what I want you to work on is just being a little bit more specific with your response, you know what I mean? Just try to pick out details from the text",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
239,Teacher," You know, earlier we did our lesson on comparing and contrasting using context and background information, so make sure with that we look for specific details in the text",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
239,Jazmin,But I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,420.2,response,0,0,3
239,Teacher,"Jazmin, your answer is not wrong",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
239,Teacher, We just want to work to be a little more specific and then we want to work to explain how we know what we know,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
239,Jazmin,"OK, OK, so I guess I don't know how to do that",,,420.2,response,0,0,3
239,Teacher,"All right, so you said that NASA sent a small machine to the moon",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
239,Jazmin,Uh-huh,,,110.1,response,0,0,3
239,Teacher,"So instead of saying small machine, we know that the small machine was called a lunar orbiter, so we want to try to be a little bit more specific",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
239,Teacher, Instead of saying small machine we want to say lunar orbiter,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
239,Jazmin,So NASA sent a lunar orbiter?,,,420.2,response,0,0,3
239,Teacher,"Yeah, NASA sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon",,,110.4,remark,0,0,3
239,Jazmin,"OK, so that's what I should say? NASA sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon?",,,110.4,response,0,0,3
239,Teacher,"Yeah, next time that would be really great",,,420.3,remark,0,0,3

239,Teacher, I know you have so many great thoughts,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
239,Teacher," I love that you kind of collaborated off of Farrah's idea, but what I want to see from you is to articulate something that you found interesting that someone else didn't necessarily say",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
239,Oliver," And I do want to say I only said that I circled the same as Farrah so I wasn't going to say the exact same thing, but I didn't like, circle it because she circled it",,,420.2,response,0,0,3
239,Oliver, I do,,,420.2,response,0,0,3
239,Oliver,I do,,,420.2,response,0,0,3
239,Oliver, I just happened to have the same answer as her,,,420.2,response,0,0,3
239,Teacher,"Were there any other things in the text that you noticed that were different than Farrah's idea? Well, I think the microscope is the right answer because it's such a scientific tool, and the question asks about equipment, so I didn't see any other scientific tool in the story",,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
239,Teacher,"I want you to try to, when you're answering questions about text, I want you to try to look for specific things",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3

239,Teacher," And even if you share the same ideas as your classmate, try to articulate it in a new way and try to explain your thinking",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
239,Teacher, That would be considered another piece of equipment that NASA used,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3

239,Teacher,You understand?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
239,Oliver,"So you're saying if Farrah has the same answer as me, then I should try to find a different answer?",,,150.1,response,0,0,3
239,Teacher," For example, if Farrah has the answer, then you can say the same answer, but just work to kind of say it in your own words and describe what you thought about it",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
239,Teacher,Not necessarily,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
239,Oliver, My English teacher says that to say it in your own words,,,420.2,response,0,0,3

239,Teacher,"All right, perfect",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
239,Teacher, I love how you talked about microscopes and that was really specific,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
239,Teacher," And you even described what a microscope does, which it allows you to see something super up close, which is what they talk about in the article",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
239,Teacher, So that you know where you saw that in the text?,,,230.2,remark,0,0,3

239,Teacher, That was really wonderful,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
239,Teacher, I really liked how you said the specifics about the microscope and you said like you explained that they used the microscope to see water on Earth,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
239,Teacher,You guys have any questions?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
239,Chris,"It's not so much a question, but remember how I was telling you about how I went to NASA with my dad? So yeah, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, too",,,150.1,response,0,0,3
239,Teacher,They do,,,110.3,remark,0,0,3

239,Teacher,Luis you have a question?,,,,remark,1,0,3
239,Luis,"um yeah so here's kind of my question, so I was gonna say like um I kind of already know about space, so I don't think I actually have to be in this group, because I don't really need any help",,,,response,1,0,3
239,Teacher,"um Luis  I saw you guys seen this group, because I think that all your answers showed really good understanding of space, but I think that we could just get a little bit closer a little bit more specific have an answer to the questions",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
239,Luis,"Okay, I guess, I can stick our out",,,150.1,response,1,0,3
239,Teacher,"So first we're going to practice together how to model, a question or not how to model, a question we're going to practice how to break down a question so i'm going to give you guys an example first you guys can see kind of what you want to be looking for",,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,"So, for example the question i'll use is what color is my sweatshirt? So when I look at that question, there are a couple of very important words that question",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,color and sweatshirt,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher, The other words and the question don't really have much meaning,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,"What makes it a question but it's it doesn't connect to anything you can't see what, but you can see color and you can see the sweatshirt",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,"so, can you guys raise your hand to someone to answer my question",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher, what color is my sweater?,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,"So when you're reading a question from about something you want to make sure they look and you want to see, we know what creates this question and what information, am I going to be looking for",,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,i'm Farrah why don't you go first,,,,remark,1,0,3
239,Farrah,"Okay, so your sweatshirt is",,,,response,1,0,3
239,Teacher,"Great jobs and see you use you knew the important words in the question, and then you looked at me and you saw my sweater is right, so we want to use just the same ideas for that and work with the questions that we answered before",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,So let's use the first question on the reading what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,"So we want to look at this question and we want to find and choose one really important word, so I want you to work with your partner",,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,"And I want the person on the left to be the one that starts talking first and then I want the person on the right to go after so I want you to work for two minutes and I want you to look and choose one really important words, the question",,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,"The important words in the question, are the ones that helped create the question and then they connect to what you read, so you want to look in the question and see",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,"Where Am I find these words and the passage alright, so you have two minutes, with your partners",,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
239,Farrah,"Okay, so",,,420.1,response,1,0,3
239,Farrah,So I think i'm gonna go first okay yeah that's fine cuz you're on the left so that's cool,,,,response,1,0,3
239,Farrah,"Okay, so we're trying to break apart the question, if I understand correctly and we're trying to figure out right like what are the important words in the question is that right",,,,response,1,0,3
239,Oliver,"I think so, although actually I think we're supposed to answer the question and figure out what what the important words in the reading",,,,response,1,0,3
239,Oliver,"Like you know what I mean like which were the important words we're supposed to look at, so I think that's what i'm going to figure out because that's what I thought, our answer was supposed to be",,,,response,1,0,3
239,Farrah,"I don't think that's quite right Oliver but you know if you're going to do that, I guess you're going to do that, like what I think",,,,response,1,0,3
239,Farrah,"What I think is basically like Okay, so the important words in the question to be are effectively like",,,,response,1,0,3
239,Farrah,"equipment, because it seems like that they want to find it",,,,response,1,0,3
239,Farrah,And they want to like um,,,,response,1,0,3
239,Farrah,"I guess maybe scientists, because we know that there and then water, those are the most important parts of the question",,,,response,1,0,3
239,Farrah,"Because they're saying that they're asking you what equipment, do they use, and then the The thing that they're finding is water and that's, the most important thing of all so that's what I think",,,,response,1,0,3
239,Oliver,"i'm Okay, so are you done Farrah yeah you can look at it Okay, so what I noticed in the actual paragraph was I thought that the words that were important were um let's see if I look at it, like, I think the main thing that was important was um lunar orbiter water, craters",,,,response,1,0,3
239,Oliver,ice and microscope those are the most important words in the Read eight that I saw okay,,,,response,1,0,3
239,Teacher,Alright guys let's come back together now and let's share let's share the words that we chose in our groups,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,You can raise your hand and i'll pick you so you can share the word you chose,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,i'm Farrah what where did your group choose as the most important word in the question,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
239,Farrah,So we had a disagreement,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
239,Farrah,And we kind of were thinking,,,,response,1,0,3
239,Farrah,differently so I thought that you were asking what were the important words like in the question itself so when I was looking for important words what I said was like,,,,response,1,0,3
239,Farrah,"equipment, scientists and water, because that's what we're talking about right we're talking about finding water and we're talking about the equipment that the scientists use and how they were able to find water",,,,response,1,0,3
239,Farrah,So that's important words,,,,response,1,0,3
239,Farrah,Oliver had something fferent,,,,response,1,0,3
239,Oliver,"um yeah So for me, basically, what I said was that I thought the most important words because I thought you were saying, the most important words in the paragraph, so I thought Okay, the most important words are water,",,,,response,1,0,3
239,Oliver,"like lunar orbiter microscope oh like glass like the glass of water that they use, and I and and like words like that, because those are all words that that have to like that they're asking about you know what I mean",,,,response,1,0,3
239,Teacher,yeah I understand I understand your confusion,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,"on savannas answer was the one that I was more posing the question for, but I understand how",,,210.1,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,"How I phrase, it could have been confusing so next time i'll make sure that I more concisely explain that to you guys",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher,Chris Jazmin or Luis do you guys have an answer to share Chris,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
239,Chris,"um so, unfortunately",,,310.1,response,1,0,3
239,Chris,"We have to go to class, but before we go, I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with you Thank you so much bye",,,,response,1,0,3
239,Teacher,bye,,,,remark,1,0,3
239,Teacher, Start Simulation,,,,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,alright,,,,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,Alright Chris Jazmin Luis and why do you like to share the word that you guys chose for um that was super important and the question or even why you share,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
239,Luis,"So I was just thinking, like, I think I got this all figured out, so I think good to go",,,210.2,response,2,0,3
239,Teacher,so was there a word that you guys picked in your group that you got that you thought was important to a question,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,"i'm Luis I think that you guys all have it figured out, but I think that if we just look at it a little more in depth, we could just get our answers to that much better",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
239,Luis,yeah we thought so Chris and I both thought that equipment was a really important word and that we thought that equipment was the most important for,,,210.3,response,2,0,3
239,Luis,"um and we thought that scientists was pretty important too, because both of us were thinking about how much equipment like has to be you know what I mean so basically um Chris and I thought about a lot about it Jazmin didn't totally agree with us",,,,response,2,0,3
239,Teacher,I think that's a really great response you guys I think equipment is one of the most important words in the question,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,"And I also think that equipment is mentioned in the passage So when I want you guys all to do individually, I want you guys to look at the passage the moon, is a desert",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,"I want you to look, and I want you to circle any equipment that is mentioned in the passage i'll give you guys a minute to do that",,,420.3,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,All right now that you guys circled all the acquit equipment mentioned why don't we look again at all the words you circled and I want you to circle double circle all the words that involve equipment and finding water mentioned,,,420.3,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,So what words are what equipment has mentioned,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,That is also used to find water on the moon,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,Would anyone like to raise their hand and share the word words that they circled,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,um Jazmin why don't you share,,,,remark,2,0,3
239,Jazmin,Um I'm still a little bit confused,,,,response,2,0,3
239,Jazmin,"about part of it, but I think that it started to make a little more sense as we went through this sort of exercise so here's what I am circle, so I circled lunar orbiter and",,,,response,2,0,3
239,Jazmin,then yeah and I kind of circled microscope but I really thought you know orbiter was the only equipment,,,,response,2,0,3
239,Jazmin,"That was used to find water like I guess you could say the microscope was used to study the water but um so I circled that one to like apple circle, but you know what I mean like that's that's what I ended up with",,,,response,2,0,3
239,Teacher,"Jazmin that's a really great job because you look through the text and you found the equipment that's mentioned, which is a lunar orbiter but you also notice that a microscope is mentioned, but you realize that the microscope does not help them find water on the moon",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,Teacher:Oliver why don't you share the words that you circle,,,,remark,2,0,3
239,Oliver,i'm so Farrah and I kind of work together again as we we usually work kind of together and do the same stuff as we think fairly similar and so actually one thing that,,,,response,2,0,3
239,Oliver,"I was thinking is that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and what it made me think is like it made it seem like all the equipment's even more important, so like what I ended up circling I circled microscope I circled glass I circled lunar orbiter",,,,response,2,0,3
239,Teacher,"that's a really great job Okay, we want to make sure that we focus on the text okay that's a little bit of a concern that I have is just",,,410.3,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,"Make sure that we're really looking at the text Okay, we want to focus on what the text says",,,410.3,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,"um lunar orbiter is a really great piece of equipment that you mentioned, however, I also want to make sure that we know that glass is not so much equipment, as it is just something that's mentioned as an object",,,410.3,remark,2,0,3
239,Oliver,"Oh, so they didn't use a glass to measure it",,,410.3,response,2,0,3
239,Teacher,No,,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,"Does anyone else, want to share their answer",,,,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,Alright Farrah and great job and are you guys worked as a partner,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,"Chris, what did you circle",,,,remark,2,0,3
239,Chris,"Okay, so I circled the same stuff like actually I circled microscope and lunar orbiter I didn't circle glass, because what I thought, when I read it was that glass was just like",,,,response,2,0,3
239,Chris,"How much water like 32 ounces not that they actually you know, use the glass, but I added because I thought it was showing or I added a few words at the bottom like spacesuit and oxygen tanks, just because I was still thinking that you'd have to use them to find the water",,,,response,2,0,3
239,Chris,"So I just didn't want to forget that, because it seems like that would be important",,,,response,2,0,3
239,Teacher,"person it's really great job i'm just I would I really wouldn't want to urge you to make sure that we focus on what is mentioned in the moon, is a desert",,,410.3,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,"And I also thought was really interesting how you also mentioned microscope are concerned that I have with you guys, is that we want to make sure that we're really focusing on the equipment that is used by scientists to find water on the moon",,,410.1,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,"a microscope have some study the water and helps them look at it, but the microscope itself did not get it all the way up to the moon okay",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
239,Oliver,"Oh, so they like",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
239,Oliver,"Okay, so I think they're beginning to understand so like they used the",,,,response,2,0,3
239,Oliver,"lunar orbiter to find the water, but like Farrah and I were confused right Farrah",,,,response,2,0,3
239,Farrah,"You know, we were confused because we were thinking that you couldn't find it if you couldn't see it, so we thought like maybe somebody had the microscope and walked around",,,,response,2,0,3
239,Farrah,And they put it on the microscope kind of the dirt and they were like oh look it's a script but that's not that's not right they they studied it after they found it,,,,response,2,0,3
239,Teacher,guys it's a really great job I really love you guys are starting to use the text that you read previously,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,And I also love that you using your new knowledge of equipment and you're realizing you know where where you can get a little bit more specific with your answer and the equipment that they use,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
239,Teacher,"Yes Oliver, do you have another question?",,,,remark,2,0,3
239,Oliver,"um Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you again for working with us and, like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you for",,,,response,2,0,3
239,Oliver,doing a couple things like one thing is that you really helped us to understand like what the words we were looking for in the question and,,,,response,2,0,3
239,Oliver,You were really patient with us as we try to understand your instructions and you really encouraged us to clarify the thinking that we were using,,,,response,2,0,3
239,Oliver,"And you were like offering really, really thoughtful concerns like when you told me what you are a little concerned about how how I was approaching this stuff and",,,,response,2,0,3
239,Oliver,"When you are concerned that we were all mentioning the microscope well, not all of us, I guess Jazmin was mentioned on jazz you really need",,,,response,2,0,3
239,Oliver,But um basically like what really jumped out to me is like that um we had a really strong suggestions for like how to go forward,,,,response,2,0,3
239,Oliver,"And you really kind of like we're able to figure out how we were thinking about each problem, and it really helped us to understand how to how to solve the so that was pretty cool Thank you so much, it was really fun to work with bye",,,,response,2,0,3
239,Teacher,bye,,,,remark,2,0,3
240,Teacher,"hi everyone so today, we are here",,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,And we are going to look at our answers to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,Who can raise their hand if they think they had a great go ahead Luis,,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Luis,"yeah excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"You know all about space, Luis?",,,110.3,remark,1,1,1

240,Luis,Okay,,,,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"All right, so let's start with Farrah Farrah, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,Who agrees with Farrah that you do need a microscope to look really closely at things,,,130.2,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"Oliver you agree Jazmin you agree Chris you agree, I also agree as well, that you do need a microscope to us to look really closely",,,230.3,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"So let's Farrah, why do you think you need a microscope to look at the water on the moon",,,230.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Farrah,"um Okay, a couple of reasons, one we've been using microscopes in science class and our teacher had us look at little water molecules water drops under the microscope so I know that they do that, and then, when I was reading the story in paragraph three, is the last sentence, it says",,,230.1,response,1,1,1
240,Farrah,You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,awesome that's a great answer,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"Okay and Oliver, you said that I, you said I circled the same as Farrah",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,Why did you circle the same as Farrah?,,,230.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Oliver,"Well, I was looking in the story for equipment and looking for water, and in paragraph three, they say the water they found is microscopic so that's the place where they found the water and then the name of the equipment and that one is the microscope",,,230.1,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,awesome,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"And Chris, what did you say",,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Chris,I said that the scientist on crators full of water,,,,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"and then Davy said NASA sent a small machine and Luis said, scientists, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"so let's go back to our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, what is one important word and that question Jazmin",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,awesome,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Jazmin,I think equipment,,,110.1,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"equipment awesome you're right, you're right",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Jazmin,I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,110.1,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,Because we are looking for the specific word of the equipment that they use,,,410.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,So let's go back and our text,,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,So let's go back to the second paragraph,,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"And let's look at moon water found could be useful in other ways, water can be broken down into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen, which is where I think",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,Where I think,,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"Luis's answer came from, because he saw that",,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,Luis Is that why you said that um,,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,You think equipment like oxygen like an oxygen oxygen tank,,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
240,Luis,"So actually I didn't even really read it, because I already know a lot about space and I already know that scientists use oxygen tank so that's how I got that piece",,,230.2,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,awesome,,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,So let's look deeper into that Luis,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Jazmin,"I got my part in paragraph two, I just didn't say the name of the machine, but I had it",,,150.1,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"So um Jazmin, can you tell us the name of the machine from paragraph two?",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
240,Jazmin,I read it it's the Lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,The lunar orbiter So how can we incorporate that word lunar orbiter into our answers?,,,210.3,remark,1,1,1
240,Jazmin,I could just say NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,210.3,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"Chris, how could you incorporate the word lunar orbiter into your answer",,,210.3,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,A lunar orbiter awesome,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Chris,um I could say,,,110.1,response,1,1,1
240,Chris,"Scientists found craters full of water on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter",,,,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,awesome,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,Oliver how about you,,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Oliver,um I guess,,,,response,1,1,1
240,Oliver,I could say,,,,response,1,1,1
240,Oliver,um,,,,response,1,1,1
240,Oliver,"Well, I don't see how I can use it because I thought that the equipment was the microscope",,,,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher, So let's look um,,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"It says your- the microscope is right it is very much right,",,,110.2,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,but we are going to look a little bit deeper,,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Oliver,well,,,110.2,response,1,1,1
240,Oliver,"if the lunar orbiter is right, how can the microscope be right,, too? Which one is right?",,,,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,Well let's look who knows what a lunar Luis do you know what a lunar orbiter is?,,,130.2,remark,1,1,1
240,Luis, I don't know what that one is,,,130.2,response,1,1,1
240,Luis,um no actually okay I don't know that one,,,130.2,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"Okay, who can tell me what a lunar orbiter is?",,,130.2,remark,1,1,1
240,Jazmin,"um well when I was reading the story, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,130.2,response,1,1,1
240,Jazmin, The Lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so the Lunar orbiter it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,130.2,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"Right, so what we know that the ice deposits are very, very tiny, so I lunar orbiter is just another word for a microscope but it's more it's a more specific word for a microscope right",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
240,Chris,"I didn't even realize that was that was the same thing, like a micro a lunar orbiter is a microscope",,,210.4,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,Right so let's think about it,,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,Where do we use a lunar orbiter?,,,210.3,remark,1,1,1
240,Chris,On the moon,,,210.3,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"On the moon, and where can we use a microscope?",,,210.3,remark,1,1,1
240,Chris,anywhere,,,210.3,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,We can use a microscope anywhere right so,,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,How would we make our answers a little bit more specific?,,,210.3,remark,1,1,1
240,Chris,"You know now i'm going to add that to my list of equipment, because I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,210.3,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"Right, so now that we know a lunar orbiter is what we use to discover water on the moon, how can we re re answer this question?",,,130.3,remark,1,1,1
240,Oliver,Can I just say it like how you said? A lunar orbiter was used to discover water on the moon,,,130.3,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,"Farrah, do you agree with that",,,130.2,remark,1,1,1
240,Farrah,um yeah well now that I understand um yeah uh yeah I do,,,130.2,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,Awesome,,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,So let's say,,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Chris,"i'm sorry to interrupt teacher, but I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later okay",,,,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,Perfect Thank you so much,,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Oliver,bye,,,,response,1,1,1
240,Teacher,bye,,,,remark,1,1,1
240,Teacher,Okay hi everyone so in our last lesson we learned that a lunar orbiter is what we can use to find water on the moon does everybody remember,,,220.1,remark,2,1,1
240,Chris,yeah,,,220.1,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,"Right, so we kind of changed our answers a little bit to include the word lunar orbiter into our answer",,,220.1,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,"So let's talk a little bit more about what we can - go ahead, Luis",,,220.1,remark,2,1,1
240,Luis,"yeah i'm sorry to interrupt but I got this all figured out now, so I think i'm all good",,,220.1,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,"All right, well let's try to listen and maybe help our friends along the way okay",,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,"Okay, so we changed our answers a little bit to include the word lunar orbiter into our answer",,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher, What else can we add into our answer to make make it a little bit more credible?,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,The word starts with an e,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Chris,Um,,,120.4,response,2,1,1
240,Chris, Equipment?,,,120.4,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher, We can add some evidence into our answer,,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,"No, Evidence",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,Does everybody agree,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Farrah,yeah,,,120.4,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,"Okay, so let's go back back into the text and find some evidence to include in our answer",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,So Can somebody look and try to see where a good evidence would be to add into our answer,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Jazmin,Okay,,,120.4,response,2,1,1
240,Jazmin,We already have the Lunar already,,,,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,We already had the Lunar orbiter part,,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Farrah,I think I already put evidence in my answer too,,,110.4,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,"What evidence, do you think you put in your answer Farrah?",,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Farrah,"Okay, well, I put the Lunar orbiter and then I added that to what I said about the microscope So then, I have two names of equipment and I have looking really closely, which is from the story and evidence is just from the story right",,,120.4,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher, so let's look,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,Right you're right Farrah,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,"And we, where does the water hide on the moon?",,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Chris,  That one was in my answer,,,120.4,response,2,1,1
240,Chris,In the craters,,,120.4,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,In the craters,,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,Right,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,So what can we what answer can we come up with to use the evidence?,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,To support what we are trying to say,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Chris,"Okay, well, I okay So what about mine, because I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter",,,120.4,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,Right,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,So let's,,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,Try to think about why we have to use,,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher, Farrah kind of touched on that in her answer,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,A lunar orbiter,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Jazmin,i'm still kind of confused,,,120.4,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,When you confused on Jazmin?,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Jazmin,I guess I don't know which evidence i'm supposed to be looking for,,,120.4,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,"So let's look, all together, we are trying to find why we use a lunar orbiter",,,120.2,remark,2,1,1
240,Jazmin,To find water on the moon?,,,120.2,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,"To find water on the moon, and because",,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,Again Farrah kind of touched on it and her answer,,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Farrah,To look at the water on the moon?,,,110.4,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,To look at the water,,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,but also because the water is so small on the moon right?,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
240,Chris,yeah yeah it's microscopic,,,210.3,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,So how can we add those into our answer?,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
240,Oliver,Okay um,,,210.3,response,2,1,1
240,Oliver,"I'm gonna say, okay, so let me look at my my answer before okay um you'd need all scientific tool called a microscope and a lunar orbiter to look really closely because it's microscopic",,,,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,Because it's microscopic awesome Oliver,,,120.2,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,"Chris, how can you change your answer?",,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
240,Chris,"Okay, scientists found craters full of water on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter",,,120.2,response,2,1,1
240,Chris,"Because the water, well if the water was microscopic then how did they find the craters full of water?",,,,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,The water is hiding in the craters,,,140.1,remark,2,1,1
240,Chris,So they're full of water at the bottom?,,,140.1,response,2,1,1
240,Chris,"No, oh man now i'm confused",,,,response,2,1,1
240,Chris,"Scientists have known for a long time -okay well scientists found craters full of water on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter",,,,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,Because,,,,remark,2,1,1
240,Chris,Because the water was microscopic,,,,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,"All right, let's go to Jazmin Jazmin, how can you change your answer?",,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
240,Chris,"Oh, excuse me teacher, I was just thinking about the water on the moon, I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024",,,210.3,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,There could be what?,,,,remark,2,1,1
240,Chris,A base like they might build a moon base,,,,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,Oh that's very cool Chris,,,110.3,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,Maybe maybe we'll have to read about that next time,,,140.1,remark,2,1,1

240,Jazmin,Okay um,,,210.3,response,2,1,1
240,Jazmin,"Okay teacher, how did you know that we should include microscopic in the answer?",,,,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,What Jazmin?,,,120.1,remark,2,1,1
240,Jazmin,"How did you know that we should put the microscopic part in the answer remember when I was saying, like i'm trying to figure out",,,120.1,response,2,1,1
240,Jazmin,Like how do I know what part of the story the evidence I should put in my answer,,,,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,"So Jazmin remember, we said that we use a lunar orbiter on the moon, but a microscope could be used for anything",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher, So which one of those things do you would you think would be more specific?,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,So in this answer we're talking specifically about the moon,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
240,Jazmin,"Definitely, the Lunar orbiter",,,210.3,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,"Definitely, the Lunar orbit are so that's why we're including the Lunar orbiter in our answer",,,110.4,remark,2,1,1
240,Jazmin,Okay,,,110.4,response,2,1,1
240,Jazmin, And then the microscopic word?,,,110.4,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,we're using the microscopic part to prove that we need a lunar orbiter,,,130.3,remark,2,1,1
240,Jazmin,"Oh OK OK, I understand okay",,,130.3,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,awesome So how can we change your answer a little bit Jazmin to include that evidence and then also include the little the Lunar orbiter?,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
240,Jazmin,Okay um NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,210.3,response,2,1,1
240,Jazmin,Because the water is microscopic,,,,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,"Luis, how can you change your answer?",,,210.3,remark,2,1,1

240,Luis,Because the water was microscopic,,,,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,awesome Luis,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,Alright so let's all think what did we learn about changing our answers today?,,,530.1,remark,2,1,1
240,Oliver,um,,,530.1,response,2,1,1
240,Oliver,"Well teacher i'm looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I am thinking about my answer, and I think I learned that we have to be specific",,,,response,2,1,1
240,Oliver,and put in evidence that tells,,,,response,2,1,1
240,Oliver,Why,,,,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,Right Oliver,,,,remark,2,1,1
240,Teacher,Thank you so much,,,,remark,2,1,1
240,Oliver,Oh wow that was right? oh cool okay yeah well thanks teacher for telling us um what what evidence from the text we should put in our answer and and that we how to do that okay,,,,response,2,1,1
240,Teacher,Thank you so much for being so awesome,,,,remark,2,1,1
240,Jazmin,Oh thanks teacher,,,,response,2,1,1
241,Teacher,"Okay, Farrah",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, And your answer was that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, How did you get to that answer?,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, So you answered the question of what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, We're going to start with you,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Farrah, And so I was looking for some things that was equipment,,,230.1,response,0,0,3
241,Farrah,Reach Every Reader:Well I was looking at the at the text,,,230.1,response,0,0,3
241,Farrah, And then the question also asked about water,,,230.1,response,0,0,3
241,Farrah," And so I saw in paragraph three, that they were talking about finding the water and they were talking about the microscope, which is equipment",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
241,Farrah, And I thought about the fact that the question asked about equipment,,,230.1,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher,"Okay, that makes a lot of sense that you put those two together",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,  And that you would need a microscope to look really closely to see that,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, But what paragraph three says is that the water that they found is microscopic,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher," So if you can look at, paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate to discover the water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, Do you see that,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Farrah,"Oh yeah, I see it",,,150.1,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher,What about making is that making more sense to you,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Farrah,"Oh, I don't think I know I don't understand why I'm why it's not the microscope",,,150.1,response,0,0,3
241,Luis,Excuse me,,,,response,0,0,3
241,Luis,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,0,3

241,Teacher,Okay,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Oliver,"Yeah yeah I had the same answer that Farrah did, that  they were asking about finding water and I'm paragraph three talks about finding water",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher, They didn't use it to discover the water,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, It does,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,"Well, you're right",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, It does,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher," The lunar orbiter was used to investigate to look for ice deposits and the big craters that are on the moon, but the ice deposits are very small",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, So they use a bigger they use the machine to find the ice and then the microscope would be used to actually see it to see the water,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Oliver,Okay,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
241,Oliver, They use a microscope to see the water but not to discover the water,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher," Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,0,0,3
241,Jazmin,I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,0,0,3

241,Jazmin,"Oh, okay",,,210.3,response,0,0,3
241,Jazmin,"Oh, she called a lunar orbiter",,,,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher, So that was a small machine that they use to investigate the moon to look into the large polar craters,,,110.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,There you go,,,110.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,Okay so Chris your answer of scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, I had a they did find craters full of water,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, But the question was asking what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,"Can you tell me what equipment they use so Farrah and Oliver, you're not completely wrong",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, But that's not the full answer,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, A microscope is a piece of equipment,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Chris,Ok ok so,,,130.1,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher, Can you tell me what kind of equipment that they used To discover water on the moon,,,120.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,Chris,,,120.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Chris,You told Jazmin that she was close because she said on the small machine and then you asked her what it was called and she said the lunar orbiter so I think you told her that that was the answer right?,,,120.1,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher, Do you remember reading that,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,"Right, and then Farrah and Deb also let us know that they use a microscope as well once they discovered the water",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Chris,"Yeah, yeah, I remember reading, paragraph three, but I didn't think that um that that was it",,,130.1,response,0,0,3
241,Chris," Because, because they said that they were talking about finding the water and I had seen that there was like a lot of water in the craters",,,130.1,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher, Huh,,,120.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,"Right, it can be a little confusing if you don't read over it carefully",,,120.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Chris,"Yeah, I guess so",,,120.1,response,0,0,3
241,Chris," Um, but I do know, like a lot",,,120.1,response,0,0,3
241,Chris, And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,120.1,response,0,0,3
241,Chris, I went to NASA,,,120.1,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher, Right,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,"Right, and that's Luis That was your point",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Luis,Yeah yeah like I know a lot of a lot of equipment stuff,,,110.1,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher,"Okay, so, Luis, what can you tell us about the equipment that the scientists used to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,0,3
241,Luis," You know, when they have to wear their space, shoot",,,120.2,response,0,0,3
241,Luis," Well, I had said that, um, I think they need to use like oxygen tanks in order to go to the moon",,,120.2,response,0,0,3
241,Luis,"Um, well",,,120.2,response,0,0,3
241,Luis," So, and that's equipment tools because they can't breathe on the moon",,,120.2,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher, And thinking about the other equipment that they might use,,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher," You're not just reading the article and just using what the article has given us, you're thinking outside of the box",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,"Right, so you really are thinking outside of the box",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, Yeah,,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
241,Luis,"Yeah, cuz I mean, I read a lot about space",,,110.3,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher,So you like to read,,,140.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Luis,Yeah,,,140.1,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher,"Well that's, well, that's great",,,120.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher," So, Luis, what do you think about the equipment that the article has told us about?",,,120.1,remark,0,0,3
241,Luis,"Um, ah, You mean nothing like that what you told Jazmin about?",,,120.1,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher,Can you find it and that's in paragraph 2,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
241,Luis,Not I sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large bore crater these ice deposits are very small,,,120.3,response,0,0,3
241,Luis,Okay,,,,response,0,0,3
241,Luis,Yeah I yeah,,,,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher, So they use a small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate and they're investigating these these craters on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,So they so let's talk as a group,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, Right,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, So the amount of water that they find is going to be very small,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,"And they're looking for ice deposits, but the ice deposits are very small",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher, Right,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,"So then, in paragraph three, what does it tell us that they use it that they needed to us to look at to see these very small deposits of water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Chris,Um the microscope,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher, So the first piece of equipment that they're using what's called what,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,"Right, the microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,I'm sorry,,,,remark,0,0,3
241,Chris,Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,0,0,3
241,Teacher, And the second piece of equipment was called what,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
241,Teacher,Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3

241,All,"Yeah, I'm good too",,,,,1,0,3
241,Luis, I'm good,,,,response,1,0,3
241,Luis, I had one question,,,,response,1,0,3
241,Luis,Me too,,,,response,1,0,3
241,Luis, I shouldn't be in this group because I already know everything-- I know all about space,,,,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher," But there you've got to remember there is always room for us to grow and improve and learn more, OK?",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,"Luis, you are very smart",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
241,Luis,OK,,,150.1,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher," So the first question as a group is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?",,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,So let's look over our initial questions,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,Does anybody want to volunteer their answer?,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Chris,I'll say mine,,,120.2,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher,"OK, Chris, what you got?",,,,remark,1,0,3
241,Chris,I said that they found craters full of water,,,,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher,And that's great that you were able to gather that information out of the article,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,They did find craters full of water,,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,"But the question was, what equipment did scientists use to discover that? So are craters full of water-- is that a type of equipment?",,,410.1,remark,1,0,3
241,Chris, So I guess no,,,110.2,response,1,0,3
241,Chris,No,,,110.2,response,1,0,3
241,Chris, Craters aren't equipment,,,110.2,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher, What did you say?,,,,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,"I'm sorry, Chris, I couldn't hear you",,,,remark,1,0,3
241,Chris,"I said, since craters aren't equipment, then I guess no",,,,response,1,0,3
241,Chris, No it's not,,,,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher,Does anybody else want to volunteer their answer?,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher, It just wasn't correct for that question,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher, It wasn't a bad answer,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,So that's good,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher, You thought through that,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
241,Farrah,I could,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher,"OK, Farrah",,,,remark,1,0,3
241,Farrah,I said the part in the story where it says that they found-- that they need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher, So that's great that you were able to point that out,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher, It's a piece of equipment that was mentioned in the article,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher, But it's just not the type of equipment that they used to find the water,,,130.3,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,So a microscope is a type of equipment,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher, The microscope would be used to see the water because the amount is so small,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,So a microscope is a piece of equipment,,,130.3,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,"In the article, if you could go back and look, when they used the microscope, they get and use the microscope to find the water",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Jazmin,"Excuse me, Miss Brown?",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,1,0,3
241,Jazmin,I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher,"What was your answer, Jazmin?",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Jazmin,That NASA sent a small machine,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher, NASA did use a small machine,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,They did,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher, Can you tell me what that small machine was?,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Jazmin, A lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
241,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher," So the question of what type of equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, what would be a good full answer, Jazmin?",,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,A lunar orbiter,,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
241,Jazmin,What type of equipment did scientists use to INAUDIBLE,,,210.3,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher,"Now when they discovered the water on the moon, did they discover large amounts of water or just little teeny, tiny amounts of water?",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher, So scientists used a lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon,,,110.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,They did,,,110.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Jazmin,I don't know,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher,Does anybody remember?,,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
241,Chris, But you said craters wasn't equipment,,,130.2,response,1,0,3
241,Chris, I know that they said there's a lot of water deep in the moon's craters,,,130.2,response,1,0,3
241,Chris, So I would think a lot of water,,,130.2,response,1,0,3
241,Chris,I answered craters full of water,,,130.2,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher, And that means that you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking right at it,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher," But Farrah told us that the article says that in order to see the water, we would need what, Farrah?",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,"If you look at paragraph 3, it says the water they found is microscopic",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Farrah,A microscope,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher," So Jazmin, they use the lunar orbiter to discover the water",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher," And in order to see the water, they would need to use a microscope",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,A microscope,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher, So how many types of equipment were mentioned in our article?,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
241,Jazmin,The microscope and the lunar orbiter?,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher," Yes, Chris?",,,130.3,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher, So a good full answer to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon would be scientists used the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon and a microscope to be able to see the microscopic amounts of water,,,130.3,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,"Right, there were two",,,130.3,remark,1,0,3
241,Chris, So I also know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too,,,130.3,response,1,0,3
241,Chris,I just wanted to say that I went to NASA,,,130.3,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher, That's very smart,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,Right,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher, That's a very good thing to point out,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher, There's more than just those pieces of equipment that scientists have to use and the astronauts have to use to get to the moon,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher, But they are pieces of equipment that astronauts absolutely would have to use,,,130.3,remark,1,0,3
241,Teacher,"Our question said, what did they use to discover water? So oxygen tanks and their suits, that wouldn't be part of that answer",,,130.3,remark,1,0,3
241,Chris,"Yeah, OK",,,130.3,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher,"So the second part of our discussion question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?",,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
241,Oliver,"Excuse me, Miss Brown? I'm sorry to interrupt",,,120.2,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher,It's OK,,,,remark,1,0,3
241,Oliver," But of I'll see you later, OK?",,,,response,1,0,3
241,Oliver,I just realized that it's time for us to go to lunch,,,,response,1,0,3
241,Oliver, So I know this time was short,,,,response,1,0,3
241,Teacher,"OK, Thank you",,,,remark,1,0,3
241,All,Bye,,,,,1,0,3
241,Teacher,OK,,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher," And that is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable? Does anybody have any thoughts on that?",,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher, So we're going to discuss the next question,,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
241,Luis,"I just wanted to remind you, my dad's actually an astronaut",,,120.2,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher," Do you have any thoughts about the water on the moon? Do you think that it's a valuable? Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon is valuable, based off of our article?",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher,"OK, that's awesome, Luis",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Luis," So yeah, based on the article, I would say, yeah, water on the moon is valuable",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
241,Luis,Water is valuable,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
241,Luis, We've got to drink it all the time,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher,"Does anybody want to-- Luis, do you want some help from a friend?",,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher,And what does the article tell us about why water on the moon would be valuable?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Luis,"Yeah, I do",,,130.2,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher,Does anybody want to help Luis out? Why does the article tell us that water on the moon could be so valuable?,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
241,, But I don't remember--,,,130.2,,2,0,3
241,,I had an idea,,,130.2,,2,0,3
241,Teacher,"What's your idea, Chris?",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Chris,It was something about how it was talking about water can be broken down into two parts,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
241,Chris,Do you remember what that is? Hydrogen and oxygen,,,,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher,Awesome,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher, So why would it be helpful if it can be broken down into two parts? What could those things-- what could oxygen and hydrogen be used for? What do we use oxygen for?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher," Yep, so smart",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Chris,To breathe,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher,So breathing would be a good use for the oxygen,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher, What about the hydrogen?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Chris,I don't know what we use hydrogen for,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher,Does anybody want to go back and read over in paragraph 5?,,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher,I have to read too because I don't know what we use it for,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher, Astronauts could breathe the oxygen,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher, So we could do it together,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher, And oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher, Do you guys see that?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher," So paragraph 5 says that water can be broken down into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher,Uh-huh,,,120.1,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher," Oh, you know what else?",,,120.1,remark,2,0,3
241,Jazmin,What?,,,120.1,response,2,0,3
241,Jazmin, That would be really nice,,,,response,2,0,3
241,Jazmin,"You can use water to grow things, so that we can have a moon garden on the moon",,,,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher,That might be a good idea,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher,And what did they say was the problem with water and carrying water on the spacecraft?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Jazmin, They could drink the water,,,110.1,response,2,0,3
241,Jazmin,I have to look again,,,110.1,response,2,0,3
241,Jazmin, Water could be useful in lots of ways,,,110.1,response,2,0,3
241,Jazmin,So is water--,,,,response,2,0,3
241,Jazmin, They could drink the water,,,,response,2,0,3
241,Jazmin,So that's something,,,,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher,"Does the article tell us that water is light, or is water heavy?",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Jazmin,Is says water is heavy,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher," And it would take up a lot of space, right?",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher," So taking a lot of water in the spacecraft to the moon, it would be a lot of weight",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher,Water is heavy,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher,Mm-hmm,,,,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher, What does it tell us that the problems could be? What's the issue with the research? It's at the very end of the article,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher,The article tells us that there might be some problems with doing research for finding out why the water-- a convincing argument for why this would be useful,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher,"So astronauts would be able to use the water if it was broken down for oxygen and hydrogen to fuel the rockets, oxygen to breathe, obviously the water to drink",,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
241,All,MUMBLING,,,210.4,,2,0,3
241,Oliver,I just see them asking a question if we think it'd be a good thing,,,,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher, And it would take a lot of money,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher,"But spending the money, building the equipment, and doing the research, do you think that it would be worth it? Is the amount of water on the moon and the uses for the water on the moon valuable enough for NASA to spend the money and do the research?",,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher, They would have to do a lot of studying on the moon's surface,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher," So if NASA didn't have the money or the manpower or the equipment, those things could be a problem",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher,"So in paragraph 6 it tells us that scientists would need to come up with a plan for getting the water out of those big craters, and that making the plan, it would take a lot of time",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher, And they would have to build new equipment,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
241,Oliver," And I feel like if the astronauts were on the moon, and they get thirsty, then they do want to be able to have some water to drink, right?",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
241,Oliver,We need to drink water,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher," So, Oliver, you think that it would be worth it to spend the money and do the research?",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher,"Right, they would need water to drink",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
241,Oliver,Yeah,,,230.3,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher,OK,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher," Farrah, what do you think?",,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
241,Farrah, So I guess I figured they can spend a lot of money because they have a lot of money,,,130.2,response,2,0,3
241,Farrah, I don't know if-- I think NASA has a lot of money,,,130.2,response,2,0,3
241,Farrah, But I don't know if it's worth it,,,130.2,response,2,0,3
241,Farrah,I guess I don't know,,,130.2,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher," But if they do the research, and they spend the money, and then they don't get a lot of water, then what? Do you think they would be upset?",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher,"You are probably right, NASA does have a lot of money",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
241,Farrah," My mom gets really upset if she spends a lot of money on food, and then my brother doesn't eat it",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
241,Farrah,Oh yeah,,,210.3,response,2,0,3
241,Farrah, She gets really mad,,,210.3,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher, So they would feel like maybe they were wasting it,,,210.1,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher,Right,,,210.1,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher," So they have to have enough evidence to show that the amount of water that they could extract from the moon, that the uses that they could use the water for on the moon, that those uses and the amount of water, that it would be worth it to them to spend the money and to build the equipment",,,210.1,remark,2,0,3
241,Farrah,"Yeah, I see what you're saying",,,210.1,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher,Anybody else have a question?,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
241,Oliver," But I was just looking at the clock, and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch",,,150.1,response,2,0,3
241,Oliver,It's not a question,,,150.1,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher,OK,,,,remark,2,0,3
241,Oliver,"But I did want to say, even though we only had a short time together, I appreciate how you asked each of us about what we were thinking",,,,response,2,0,3
241,Oliver, And I feel like for Chris and Jazmin too,,,,response,2,0,3
241,Oliver," And you took some time to explain, like for Farrah, and ask her some questions that made her feel valuable",,,,response,2,0,3
241,Oliver, So thank you so much for helping us think about what we were reading,,,,response,2,0,3
241,Teacher,Absolutely,,,,remark,2,0,3
241,Teacher," Thanks for having me, guys",,,,remark,2,0,3
241,All,Bye,,,,,2,0,3
241,Teacher,Bye,,,,remark,2,0,3
258,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Hello everyone,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Farrah, Good to see you,,,,response,0,0,1
258,Farrah,Hi,,,,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Good to see you too,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, I'm your Teacher,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,So we just read a little excerpt about the moon,,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, Correct,,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Did you guys enjoy water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"Yes, water on the moon",,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, Did you guys enjoy the reading,,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Farrah,Mm hmm,,,150.1,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher,And I want to just go over a couple of your answers,,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"Oh, good",,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher," The evidence in the text, so that we can answer the question",,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, So I just asked you the question and got your response to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, And then we had a circle,,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,And that's why I pulled you,,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Luis,"Guys, excuse me",,,150.1,response,0,0,1
258,Luis,"Yes, me",,,,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Luis,I shouldn't be in this group,,,,response,0,0,1
258,Luis, I already know all about space,,,,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Well that's great that you know so you can help us learn even more things about the space and then maybe you might even learn something new,,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, Thank you for sharing that though,,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, You never know,,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
258,Luis,Yeah okay perfect spot,,,110.3,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"Okay, anybody else have any questions before we dive into our answers",,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"You get alright so let's look at some of your answers and we have that Farrah and Deb, you had similar answers right you both said  You need something like a microscope to look really closely",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,you're right that is a scientific tool that we use during science to see things closely,,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, Right,,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, So that would make sense,,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Farrah, It's because our microscope is equipment,,,310.1,response,0,0,1
258,Farrah, It's like a tool that you use to look at things that are really small,,,310.1,response,0,0,1
258,Farrah,"Yeah, exactly",,,310.1,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher," And some of your science classes, maybe",,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, So if you use one before,,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Right,,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Farrah,"Yeah, in a science lab",,,310.1,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher, I love that,,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"Right, so you're kind of using your prior knowledge and experience to come up with that answer, which is great",,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"I want you to look back into the reading though we need to circle the evidence, where it talks about where you want to answer",,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, You need to have specific evidence in the reading,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, Why don't you look back now,,,230.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"So can we look back into the reading and you see anything about a microscope in any of the sections, you can tell me which section if you see it in like how they're numbered, let me know",,,230.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"And if you don't see it, that's okay too",,,230.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Farrah," It's in part three, paragraph three, they say you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope",,,230.2,response,0,0,1
258,Farrah,It's in it's in part three,,,230.2,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher, So they did use a microscope and night you found that right from the evidence,,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Good to look really closely,,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Were talking about with our question that we were talking about referring to before it was what equipment just did scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, So who can tell me what is discover mean?,,,210.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, Yes,,,210.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,We're talking about discovering the water,,,210.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, Chris,,,210.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Chris,It's like to to find something,,,210.2,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"Exactly, it's divine something",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, So did they use the microscope to find the water in the first place,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, Do you think,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Yes Jazmin,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Or maybe they use something else,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
258,Jazmin, How can you find it if you can't see it,,,,response,0,0,1
258,Jazmin, Yeah,,,,response,0,0,1
258,Jazmin,Yes,,,,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"You're right, but maybe you don't need the microscope to see it because water",,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher," Maybe there's enough of it that they could see it without Jazmin, you have something to add",,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Jazmin,I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,110.2,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher,What we never said you guys answers were wrong,,,110.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"We're just going to look deeper into them and kind of, you can explain your thinking to me",,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher," So then I can understand better and we can help each other, understand better so that sound good",,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"Okay, good",,,230.3,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher," So, Farrah, you made the point That maybe they needed it to see it in the first place to discover it",,,230.3,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher," Can everybody go back and read the number Paragraph to where it starts with NASA sent a small, can you read that those first couple sentences of that paragraph, please",,,120.3,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,But let's kind of read,,,120.3,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,And then I want anybody to know if they want to change their answer,,,120.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,One hand two hands will give everyone else minute read it over and think about it,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"All right, I see Jazmin, you want to share",,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Just go for it,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Jazmin, I don't want to change my answer,,,,response,0,0,1
258,Jazmin,"Um, well, I still think that's the small machine",,,,response,0,0,1
258,Jazmin,You don't want,,,,response,0,0,1
258,Jazmin, It's a small machine,,,,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher, And do you know what that small machine is called,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Good,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
258,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher,It's a small machine and we want to get super specific when we're answering these questions from a nonfiction text,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, You're right,,,110.4,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, So you have the lunar,,,110.4,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Awesome,,,110.4,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Like we're reading now,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,so Jazmin,,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, Your answer was correct,,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, You want to be as specific as we can,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, So it's a real text with real facts,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, So would you want to add that to your answer,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher," But we want to expand on that you add in right from the texts like they said, called a lunar orbiter",,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher," Chris, you have something to add",,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,A small machine,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, That's awesome,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Chris,"Well, I went to NASA",,,420.2,response,0,0,1
258,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,420.2,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"Right, so they might have used a lot of different equipment to get to the moon to survive on the moon field a walk around and breathe",,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, You're right,,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"They have to get us use the spaceship to get there, but we're talking specifically about to discover the water just like it says from the Reading",,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"it says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and that is the specific machine they use to discover the water",,,130.3,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,So I like how in your answer,,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher," Chris, you were specific and you said that they found the water in the Craters of the moon",,,310.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,The question you want to make sure you're answering what the questions asking about the equipment expand specifically,,,410.1,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, So what would you add Chris to your response about finding the water in that specific equipment,,,210.3,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,That they use to find that water,,,210.3,remark,0,0,1
258,Chris, So I guess I would say they use the Orbiter to find the craters full of water,,,210.3,response,0,0,1
258,Chris,"Oh, well I guess what you said to Jazmin is it that is the Lunar Orbiter",,,210.3,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"That's perfect, beautiful",,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, I love that,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, You got to remember it their equipment equipment and then you can add in those details you have those are awesome as well,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, Does that make more sense of how you have to make sure that you're answering the full question when they say equipment,,,420.2,remark,0,0,1
258,Chris,Okay,,,420.2,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher,What makes sense,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, Does anybody have anything else they would like to add or have any more questions,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher, Awesome,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Oliver,"Actually, I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but",,,,response,0,0,1
258,Oliver,Wanted to say thank you so much for coming today,,,,response,0,0,1
258,Oliver,Thank you for,,,,response,0,0,1
258,Oliver,Reminding us,,,,response,0,0,1
258,Oliver," Oh, sorry",,,,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher,"No, thank you, guys",,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Oliver, And we really appreciate how you helped us add more details to our answers in order to make them better,,,,response,0,0,1
258,Oliver,"Well yeah, I wasn't",,,,response,0,0,1
258,Oliver, It was really nice to meet you,,,,response,0,0,1
258,Teacher, I'm glad you appreciate it was nice to meet you guys,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Awesome,,,,remark,0,0,1
258,Teacher,Hello everybody,,,,remark,1,0,1
258,Farrah, It's good to see you,,,,response,1,0,1
258,Farrah,"Oh, hi",,,,response,1,0,1
258,Teacher, I missed a few guys forgot,,,,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,Nice to see you too,,,,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, It's nice to see everybody,,,,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,0,1
258,Luis,"Um, yeah, excuse me, I'm shutting me and that's group",,,,response,1,0,1
258,Luis, I already know all about space,,,,response,1,0,1
258,Teacher, That you know all about space,,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, So you can definitely help add in different things that we may have not even known or not discussed in the article,,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,That's awesome,,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,So that's great,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher," Well, we're all going to just go over answers and see if there's anything to make them even better than they are now",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher," Because you never know, you might even learn something new too",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,Anybody,,,,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,Okay,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher," Okay, anybody else have any questions before we dive into our answers",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher," Okay, so let's see the question that was first asked is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,"No, we're good",,,120.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,So I want you to reread your answer that you gave And then raise your hand if you have any questions or if you think your answer is good or if you want to say something while your answer or ask why we're going to be really looking at your answer,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, So make sure it answers that question,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,"What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,",,,120.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,who would like to discuss their answer first,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher," Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,So we can all learn from each other,,,,remark,1,0,1
258,Farrah, And it sounds like they use it to look at the water,,,,response,1,0,1
258,Farrah,"Yeah, so I feel really good about my answer",,,,response,1,0,1
258,Farrah, And I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so I know that a microscope is a tool,,,,response,1,0,1
258,Teacher," And that's what the question was asking was asking which tools, specifically did they use to find this water, and I believe it did talk about a microscope in our reading right everybody read the reading?",,,110.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, You're definitely right as a microscope is a scientific tool,,,110.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,110.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher," There's another scientific equipment that was used to specifically find the water because the microscopes going to help them maybe look at the water closer or look at other things, maybe just magnified",,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, But they didn't use that to specifically find the water,,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,I want to take a look even closer Farrah,,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,Teacher:,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, Does anybody remember where they found the water?,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
258,Chris, They found the craters of water and the craters were full of water,,,210.4,response,1,0,1
258,Chris,"Yeah, that was part of my answer",,,210.4,response,1,0,1
258,Teacher,"Yeah, exactly",,,110.4,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher," Thank you for sharing Chris, so the water was found in this craters",,,110.4,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, So wouldn't exactly be a microscope that they use to get into the craters to find it,,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher," Jazmin, just something you'd like to add",,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,So the equipment that we're looking for is the equipment that they use to get into these creators,,,130.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Jazmin," So, um,",,,130.1,response,1,0,1
258,Jazmin,"Um, yes",,,130.1,response,1,0,1
258,Jazmin,"Well, I have a different answer from Farrah, and I said that NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,1,0,1
258,Teacher," That's a great answer, because you're right",,,110.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher," I believe it's the first sentence and paragraph two, can you read that whole sentence",,,120.3,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,Can you read the sentence that you found that in,,,120.3,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, They did NASA did send a small machine,,,110.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,"Okay, it's not necessarily wrong at all",,,110.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Jazmin,"Yes, out loud",,,120.3,response,1,0,1
258,Teacher,"Yes, please",,,,remark,1,0,1
258,Jazmin,Okay,,,,response,1,0,1
258,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,1,0,1
258,Teacher,Good,,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, So what do you think you could add to your sentence to your answer to make it even more detailed and more specific to the question,,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,It's small machine called,,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Jazmin,It's called a Lunar Orbiter,,,420.2,response,1,0,1
258,Teacher, So all you have to do is add that to your answer to make it super specific and to somebody who didn't read this article,,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,Awesome,,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,"They would know exactly what small machine, you were talking about, because we all knew because we read the article, but other people who didn't read the article that would definitely help them out to have the specific name of it",,,420.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher," And I think, Oliver",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, You also had a similar answer to Farrah,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,So let's go back to Farrah,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,So you guys said microscope,,,230.3,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,And you weren't wrong,,,110.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, That was a machine that a piece of equipment that NASA uses that the astronaut uses,,,110.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,But do you see how rereading back to the first sentence and paragraph to how the lunar lunar orbiter was something that they use to actually discover the water,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, Do you see the difference between that in the microscope?,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Oliver," Maybe they used both, but I don't really see why it's not the microscope",,,150.1,response,1,0,1
258,Oliver,"Honestly, not totally like I got back",,,150.1,response,1,0,1
258,Teacher,"OK, so the if you read on, in the second paragraph, it talks about how the craters were in  Deposits of ice",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher," Right, so the water wasn't just clear and streaming and flowing",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,And ice is really hard to get through,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,So the ice is something they needed to get through to get to the water get through the crater to get to the water in the ice,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, Do you think that would be the best equipment that they used to specifically find the water?,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,So do you think they would use a microscope to get through these tough exteriors,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
258,Oliver,"Um, no",,,210.3,response,1,0,1
258,Oliver," I guess before you use a microscope, you probably need something else",,,210.3,response,1,0,1
258,Teacher," So what do you remember what it's called with right back into paragraph two,",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
258,Oliver," Yeah, a lunar orbiter",,,210.4,response,1,0,1
258,Oliver,"Oh yeah, um, I will, I will answer",,,210.4,response,1,0,1
258,Teacher,Is that making sense to you,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, Farrah as well,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Farrah,"Yeah, yeah",,,150.1,response,1,0,1
258,Farrah, I understand it better now,,,150.1,response,1,0,1
258,Teacher,"Awesome Chris, you have a hand up",,,,remark,1,0,1
258,Chris," Well, I went to NASA",,,,response,1,0,1
258,Chris,Yeah,,,,response,1,0,1
258,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,1,0,1
258,Teacher, They use all that equipment to to just be able to be on the moon in general,,,130.3,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, So that was helpful for them to be able to be there,,,130.3,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, And then the lunar orbiter was something that they specifically used to Discover that water,,,130.3,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,130.3,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher, Exactly,,,130.3,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,The key words in the question where to discover the water,,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,The lunar orbiter is what they use to get through that hard exterior to find the water,,,130.3,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher," What did they use in that one, that one tool",,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,"Luis How are you doing, because I know you mentioned the oxygen tanks as well",,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
258,Luis,I yeah that is what I had also said yes,,,120.4,response,1,0,1
258,Teacher,Do you understand now how it's more of the lunar order that they use to discover the water,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
258,Teacher,that were discovered was the key word we were looking at,,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
258,Luis, That was pretty good,,,150.1,response,1,0,1
258,Luis,"I mean, that sounds like a pretty good answer",,,150.1,response,1,0,1
258,Luis," I mean, with all the oxygen tanks and stuff",,,150.1,response,1,0,1
258,Luis," I mean, I think also Chris's answer",,,150.1,response,1,0,1
258,Luis, They show how the astronauts like train with their oxygen tanks and in the old the zero gravity chambers and oh yeah,,,,response,1,0,1

258,Teacher, Can you read the next sentence and tell us why is that important that it can be,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher, Why does that matter though to keep reading and see if you can find anything else,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher,"Broken down into two parts, because now we have this hydrogen and oxygen",,,210.4,remark,2,0,1

258,Teacher, The astronauts don't even need to worry about bringing as much or Storing as much on their spacecraft,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher,Do you see how we could use that information,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher,"So then they maybe they can stay longer and do other things such as grow gardens, there are just explore and see what else they can find so that's awesome",,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher,"Oh, Chris, and you have your hand",,,,remark,2,0,1

258,Chris," My answer is well, water is so heavy",,,,response,2,0,1
258,Teacher,"Right, and that's a great answer, because I see you got your information right from the article inch paragraph for that water is heavy",,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher, And it takes up a lot of space,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher,but we do want to add to your answer,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1

258,Teacher,What that water is used for for the astronauts,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher, So the astronauts can what with it,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1

258,Teacher, So I'm glad you brought this point up,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher,Because it does say that it's going to take a lot of time and money to see if they could do these things,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher,But our question was kind of asking more broadly in general is there possibility,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher, Our question is asking if the water on the moon could be valuable,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher, Do you think there are valuable ways we could use the moon water for astronauts and whatnot,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher,So thinking about it that way if there's not think taking the logistics out of it and all the specifics that they've stated in the last paragraph taking all that out of it,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
258,Oliver,I will show like the whole drinking water thing,,,210.3,response,2,0,1
258,Oliver,"On the whole,",,,,response,2,0,1
258,Oliver," Um, so that's really important, but I guess I thought the question was just asking like, if I thought",,,,response,2,0,1
258,Oliver,Like breathing,,,,response,2,0,1
258,Oliver, Yeah,,,,response,2,0,1
258,Oliver,"It was a good idea, like I convinced that we should",,,,response,2,0,1
258,Oliver, I'm like all spend time on the water on the moon,,,,response,2,0,1
258,Oliver, And so I wasn't convinced,,,,response,2,0,1
258,Teacher,Right,,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher,So thinking about such as using the water for oxygen is there evidence that we can break down water into oxygen and hydrogen into two parts?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher," Listen to the word, and is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
258,Teacher," So you weren't convinced, but the question",,,210.2,remark,2,0,1
258,Oliver,Yeah,,,210.2,response,2,0,1

258,Oliver,Definitely,,,210.4,response,2,0,1
258,Teacher,"So those are things we all have our own opinions, but those are things that you can prove to be true",,,210.4,remark,2,0,1

258,Farrah,Letting us do that,,,,response,2,0,1

259,Farrah,"Okay, I'm feeling a little confused",,,,response,1,0,1
259,Teacher,Indeed specifically what kind of equipment is the question asking,,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
259,Farrah, You need a microscope to see it,,,210.2,response,1,0,1
259,Farrah,"Okay so well it's asking for equipment that they use to find the water on the moon, and so on",,,210.2,response,1,0,1
259,Farrah," Well, I said it was the microscope, because if the water is so tiny that on in order to find it",,,210.2,response,1,0,1

259,Teacher,Absolutely,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
259,Teacher,From using a microscope to seem small microscopic bits of water,,,230.3,remark,1,0,1
259,Teacher,I want you to read through the passage and just and see if you can find another example of an equipment that was before the microscope that helped us know that we even should be using a microscope to look very small bits of water,,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
259,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,1,0,1
259,Farrah,"Okay, can do",,,,response,1,0,1

259,Chris," And the, the answer needs to be equipment and so well",,,,response,1,0,1
259,Chris,Mm hmm,,,,response,1,0,1
259,Chris, And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,1,0,1
259,Chris, I went to NASA,,,,response,1,0,1
259,Teacher,Very good,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
259,Teacher, Does any of that equipment that you listed,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
259,Teacher, Do you think that that equipment would be useful for finding water on the moon,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
259,Chris,"Well, I mean, if there's astronauts there",,,210.3,response,1,0,1
259,Chris,They definitely need those things,,,,response,1,0,1
259,Teacher,They need things to even be in space,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
259,Teacher, I understand,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
259,Teacher, And you might discover yet another thing that's that astronauts us,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
259,Teacher, There is some equipment in this passage that maybe you've never encountered before,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
259,Teacher,Try to expand your knowledge about equipments that's astronauts might use they use things beyond suits and oxygen tanks as well,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
259,Chris,"Okay, yeah, I'll look for all look for some new stuff",,,150.1,response,1,0,1
259,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,1,0,1

259,Jazmin,Okay,,,,response,1,0,1
259,Jazmin, So you asked me to expand my answer,,,,response,1,0,1
259,Jazmin, And so I found some more info,,,,response,1,0,1
259,Jazmin," And so while my answer was, NASA send a small machine",,,,response,1,0,1
259,Teacher,"That is very, very, very good",,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
259,Teacher," Jazmin and I, what I like about that is if I didn't know anything about this topic of finding water on the moon, and I had never read this passage I could learn how the astronauts discovered water on the moon from your answer",,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
259,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,1,0,1
259,Farrah,"So it's time for us to go, but I wanted to say thank you for giving each one of us",,,,response,1,0,1
259,Farrah, Instead of just like telling us all to do the same thing because that helped us know that you really read our answers and knew how to help each one of us individually,,,,response,1,0,1
259,Farrah,A different thing that we needed to do to help improve our answer,,,,response,1,0,1
259,Teacher,Thank you very much,,,,remark,1,0,1

259,Teacher, Luis,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher, So we are going to do some discussion of your answers to the second question that was posed to all of you,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher, And one thing that I want to tell all of you guys about this question,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Luis,"Um, I just want to remind do my dad as actually an astronaut",,,150.1,response,2,0,1
259,Teacher," Luis I hope that after today's discussion, you can go home and you can talk to him about some of the ideas that we come up with in our discussion about water on the moon",,,110.3,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,That's really awesome,,,110.3,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,"So one of the things that I'm going to, I'm going to mention about this kind of question about whether or not you think that there If there is convincing evidence that water on the moon might be valuable",,,210.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher, This is a a question that asked for your opinion,,,210.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,"So, people might have different opinions, but all opinions, need to be based all these opinions and to be based on evidence in the text",,,210.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher, Some of us for all going to rely on the actual text that we have in front of us to inform our answers and inform our opinions,,,210.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher, That's okay if you disagree with each other,,,210.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,So we might disagree with each other,,,210.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,I'm going to start with Chris right there in the middle,,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher," Can you tell me what your answer to the question was, remind me, please",,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
259,Chris,"Yeah, okay",,,120.4,response,2,0,1
259,Chris," So I said, water is heavy",,,120.4,response,2,0,1
259,Chris, So it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore,,,120.4,response,2,0,1
259,Teacher,And can you point out some evidence for the texts that tells you that astronauts will be able to not go into space with water on spaceships anymore,,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
259,Chris,"Yeah, I think I found it",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
259,Chris," Oh, oh yeah okay it's here on portal where it says, water is heavy",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
259,Chris, It takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft,,,230.2,response,2,0,1
259,Teacher,Very good,,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher, Could you saying is there anything more that the text says about water and how heavy it is,,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
259,Chris,Having water vailable on the moon would leave more room on the spacecraft for people and things,,,230.2,response,2,0,1
259,Teacher,Very good,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher, So,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,Do you find this to be compelling evidence that the water would be valuable,,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
259,Chris," Yeah, I think that's important that they",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
259,Chris," And so they could make the spacecraft's lighter or maybe bring other other equipment that's, um, that's important to",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
259,Chris, It's really heavy,,,230.2,response,2,0,1
259,Chris,"Oh, yeah",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
259,Teacher, I like that you expanded your thinking,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,"Chris, what I really like what you just did there was that you started with an idea and then you came up with some of your own thoughts, your own thought of maybe If they didn't have to carry heavy water they could carry other things as well",,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,2,0,1
259,Jazmin,So you can use water to grow things so we could have an moon garden on the moon,,,,response,2,0,1
259,Teacher," I want to, I want to see what you've imagined in your head",,,230.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,Could you tell me more about where you think we could have a moon garden or expand on that idea a little bit more,,,230.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Jazmin," Well, if there's water",,,230.1,response,2,0,1
259,Jazmin,Yeah,,,230.1,response,2,0,1
259,Jazmin, I think that's an opportunity that they would have to use the water,,,,response,2,0,1
259,Jazmin,You need water to have plants like you they could grow food and they could make them really beautiful,,,,response,2,0,1
259,Jazmin, And so if there was water,,,,response,2,0,1
259,Teacher, All right,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher, Thank you,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,Was very nice answer Jazmin,,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,Luis can you tell me what your answer was to the question,,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
259,Luis,"Yep, sure can",,,120.4,response,2,0,1
259,Luis," Okay, water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen",,,120.4,response,2,0,1
259,Teacher, And how does that make the water on the moon valuable to astronauts,,,230.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,Excellent,,,230.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Luis,"I can't remember, it sounds pretty cool",,,230.1,response,2,0,1
259,Teacher, Is there anything around it that lets you know why that would be useful to astronauts,,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher, If you go back to the text and you reread the part of the tax the toxin that talks about that gives you that information about hydrogen oxygen being used for fuel,,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,Does I'm pretty cool,,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
259,Luis," Um, it says oxygen and hydrogen could be used for rocket fuel",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
259,Luis, Okay,,,230.2,response,2,0,1
259,Luis," Oh, this is why, this is why I picked this",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
259,Luis,"Oh yeah, okay",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
259,Teacher,And I see how we've made the link between using the water to make hydrogen fuel and oxygen into something that the astronauts use very good,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher, I really liked that you had an answer to what your opinion was of whether or not you think there's compelling evidence,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,Farrah and Oliver,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher, What I want both of you to work on is you absolutely your answer is your opinion,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,The reason I asked Chris Jazmin and Luis for their opinions first was because I wanted you to see what it looks like to give supporting evidence from the text,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,"But I want you to learn a little bit from Chris Jazmin and Luis about giving reasons why you think your, your answer",,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
259,Oliver,Okay,,,420.2,response,2,0,1
259,Oliver, And it did say that it did say that on the story,,,,response,2,0,1
259,Oliver,"Well, um, so I said, um, it's not ready yet",,,,response,2,0,1
259,Teacher," I just, I just need the actual text, please",,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,"Did, can you tell me where it is in story, I believe you",,,230.2,remark,2,0,1
259,Oliver," So, um, and the last part, it says I'm making a plan will take a lot of time and money like you can just go to the moon today and drink this water or anything, because it's not ready yet",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
259,Oliver,"Oh, okay",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
259,Oliver,And so I don't think it's that valuable because they need to spend all this time and money to make it to make it valuable,,,,response,2,0,1
259,Teacher, And are you are you thinking that because it's going to take a lot of money,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,Hmm,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,"That the amount of money that we put into invest in this, we won't get returns",,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
259,Oliver, You can't drink at that there's not there's not a lot,,,230.3,response,2,0,1
259,Oliver," Yeah, well, cuz that's another meaning of the word value like money",,,230.3,response,2,0,1
259,Oliver," Um, so I don't think I don't think they should spend all their money on that",,,230.3,response,2,0,1
259,Oliver," Because remember, there's not even that much water, there's like four cups",,,230.3,response,2,0,1
259,Oliver,On,,,230.3,response,2,0,1
259,Teacher, That there isn't much water on the moon,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,"Oliver, I love how you have said things that you've learned from the text is party to support your answer",,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher, Farrah Have you learned anything from,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher," So I when I tell you to go back and finish up your work, please use that evidence to support your answer",,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,And that it would take a lot of money and investment to even use what water there is on the moon,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
259,Oliver, It's time for us to go to lunch actually,,,420.2,response,2,0,1
259,Oliver,Before you before you talk to them and I'm so sorry,,,420.2,response,2,0,1
259,Oliver,But I just wanted to say this was a really cool discussion because we got to hear so many different ideas and everybody had ideas that that had evidence to go with it,,,,response,2,0,1
259,Oliver, And so that was really cool to see and hear their answers and their evidence,,,,response,2,0,1
259,Oliver, So thank you so much,,,,response,2,0,1
259,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,2,0,1
259,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,0,1

259,Teacher,"so you all have some really great answers, but I want to dig into them a little further",,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
259,Teacher,So let's go ahead and start digging into what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,1
259,Teacher,Yes Luis,,,,remark,0,0,1
259,Luis,yeah okay,,,,response,0,0,1
259,Luis,"Excuse me, I I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,0,0,1
259,Teacher,"Well i'm glad you have an interest in space and i'm glad that you know what but maybe you can contribute a little bit of your knowledge to the rest of the group, so you might find some use there",,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
259,Luis,Okay yeah that sounds great i'd love to do that,,,110.3,response,0,0,1

259,Farrah,"yeah Okay, I can go",,,120.4,response,0,0,1
259,Teacher,"Okay, go ahead",,,,remark,0,0,1
259,Farrah,"Okay, so I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,0,1
259,Teacher,"Yes, okay microscopes are really helpful for letting us see things up close",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
259,Teacher,"And I think someone else circled, the same answer as you",,,230.3,remark,0,0,1
259,Oliver,That was yeah that was me yeah I saw the same thing as Farrah,,,230.3,response,0,0,1
259,Teacher,Either you can explain why did you circle that,,,230.1,remark,0,0,1
259,Oliver,"yeah I can say that, so, well it's right there in the text, and I know we have to find something in the text and well, that is a scientific tool it's equipment and we know we need equipment for the answer to the question",,,230.1,response,0,0,1
259,Teacher,"that's a really good reason, we do need to talk about the equipment in the text did anyone else have any other ideas",,,130.2,remark,0,0,1
259,Teacher,"Yes, go ahead",,,,remark,0,0,1
259,Jazmin,I had a different answer and I said NASA send a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,0,0,1
259,Teacher,So could you walk me through your answer a little bit explain your reasoning behind it,,,230.1,remark,0,0,1
259,Jazmin,"Oh yes, okay well it's it's right there in part two, and it says that NASA send a small machine and it its job was to look in that in the craters at the ice deposits, and I think that means that that's how they found the water",,,230.1,response,0,0,1
259,Teacher,Does anyone want to jump in?,,,130.2,remark,0,0,1
259,Teacher,"Luis I know you had eaten and sorry I know you had some expertise, would you like to share",,,120.4,remark,0,0,1
259,Teacher,"So yes, they did use some equipment to go to the moon, but let's focus in, on the other, bit of what did they use to discover water on the moon",,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
259,Luis,"Oh yeah definitely well, the thing is scientists can use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks too",,,130.2,response,0,0,1
259,Teacher,right they do,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1

260,Teacher, So this is where you would put the equipment that they used to discover that water is on the moon,,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
260,Teacher,So this sentence starter says the scientists used,,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
260,Teacher, And this is where you're going to put the number,,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
260,Teacher, There's a number at the side of the paragraphs and I want to know exactly where you found your answer,,,420.2,remark,0,1,1

263,Teacher,Do we agree or disagree with Chris,,,130.2,remark,1,0,1
263,Teacher," Why, raise your hand",,,130.2,remark,1,0,1

263,Farrah,"Okay, well, so this on this connects to a Jazmin said Jazmin, said the waters really small",,,,response,1,0,1
263,Farrah, And this also connects to my answer,,,,response,1,0,1
263,Farrah, So,,,,response,1,0,1
263,Farrah,"The scientists, they had to use a microscope to find the water you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at it",,,,response,1,0,1
263,Farrah," So, um, I guess I just, I don't really understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,1,0,1
263,Teacher,Farrah,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1

263,Teacher,Is it possible that there's more tools that scientists use to discover water,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
263,Teacher,I think that we should all go back in our text to skim for more detail to see if there's more than just the microscope that scientists use,,,120.1,remark,1,0,1
263,Teacher, What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.1,remark,1,0,1
263,Teacher,"When I say go, I want you to all reread the text and see if you can find more detail that answers the question",,,120.1,remark,1,0,1

263,Teacher,I like how you took your answer correctly from the text,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
263,Teacher,Do you know what this machine is called,,,230.1,remark,1,0,1
263,Teacher,If you're not sure what should I do you can do is go back in the text to where you found that piece of information and see if maybe they use a specific name,,,420.3,remark,1,0,1
263,Jazmin, Yeah,,,420.3,response,1,0,1
263,Jazmin, So it says on that NASA centers small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,420.3,response,1,0,1
263,Jazmin, Okay,,,420.3,response,1,0,1
263,Jazmin,For that piece of equipment,,,420.3,response,1,0,1

263,Teacher,Or someone we haven't heard that much from Luis,,,,remark,1,0,1
263,Luis, It says that the lunar orbiter investigates and looks for ice and the polar craters,,,,response,1,0,1
263,Luis,"Um, yeah, it says it Jazmin right next on what you said",,,,response,1,0,1
263,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,1,0,1
263,Teacher,So you're saying that the lunar orbiter investigates polar craters for ice that's a very strong answer because you look in the text and you quoted the text directly,,,310.1,remark,1,0,1

263,Teacher,Luis I'm hearing that your dad's an astronaut,,,230.1,remark,2,0,1
263,Teacher," Why don't you go back, decide if you think water is valuable, or not and whether or not your evidence supports your answer",,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
263,Teacher," I'm concerned that you didn't answer the question directly, but you provided evidence",,,430.2,remark,2,0,1
263,Teacher,It's good that you are connecting outside information to your answer,,,430.2,remark,2,0,1

263,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,2,0,1
263,Chris,"Okay, well, um, water is heavy",,,,response,2,0,1
263,Chris, So it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore,,,,response,2,0,1
263,Teacher,"So Chris, I'm hearing that You think that water is heavy and that they don't have to carry it on the ships",,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
263,Teacher,Which is good because that provides more space that's a strong answer because it's rooted in the text,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
263,Teacher,I'm wondering if you can push your thinking further and say why having more space on a spaceship is good,,,420.2,remark,2,0,1
263,Teacher,So why don't you go back and reread the text to see if there's any way that having more space would be good,,,420.3,remark,2,0,1
263,Chris," Oh, I'll take a look",,,420.3,response,2,0,1
263,Chris,"Okay, yeah",,,420.3,response,2,0,1

263,Teacher, It's very important to backup your answers with reasoning,,,510.1,remark,2,0,1
263,Teacher,and then you provided reasoning which is you can't survive without water,,,510.1,remark,2,0,1
263,Teacher, What's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this,,,520.1,remark,2,0,1
263,Teacher,I'm wondering what you'll do next time you had get a question like this to arrive that an answer like this,,,520.1,remark,2,0,1
263,Jazmin,"Well I, I got my answer just from from reading the text and I looked for evidence and another thing I did was",,,520.1,response,2,0,1
263,Jazmin,I kind of thought about what made water useful,,,,response,2,0,1
263,Jazmin, So I'm drinking was one thing and another thing that I was thinking is that you could maybe use water to grow things so we could have a garden on the moon,,,,response,2,0,1
263,Teacher,"Jazmin, I'm hearing that you read the text for details and evidence to help support your thinking",,,510.1,remark,2,0,1
263,Teacher, How you even expanded your thinking just now,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
263,Teacher,It's great,,,310.1,remark,2,0,1
263,Teacher, I think it might be great if you write down this process in a notebook,,,520.1,remark,2,0,1

263,Oliver, So I think part of part of the question was having an opinion,,,130.2,response,2,0,1
263,Oliver,"Um, well, okay, I'm Jazmin, she said about how she read it and she she thought about it and look for evidence",,,130.2,response,2,0,1
263,Oliver," And I think I did something similar, but I actually came up with a different opinion",,,130.2,response,2,0,1
263,Teacher,So I'm hearing that you use the similar strategy to Jazmin,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
263,Teacher, It's really good to be able to read a question and it's helpful to be able to read a question and understand what it's specifically asking you to do,,,420.1,remark,2,0,1
263,Teacher,And that you clarified that this question is asking you for an opinion,,,420.1,remark,2,0,1

263,Oliver," So I said, no, there is not convincing evidence because I'm though the water isn't ready yet",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
263,Oliver,"Um, yeah, definitely",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
263,Oliver," I mean, it's not like you could just go to the moon today and I'm drink the water and plant a garden",,,230.2,response,2,0,1
263,Oliver, Okay,,,230.2,response,2,0,1

264,Teacher,Good job,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher,"So, Farrah, and Oliver, how about you two work together and talking to each other",,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher,When you add reading a passage and talk about what you will change and why you change that in your answer,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher,And I'm going to work with other three students in a few minutes,,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher,If you'll finish that it's okay to move to a question two and use the same strategy to find our keywords in question two okay,,,510.1,remark,2,1,2
264,Oliver,Yep,,,510.1,response,2,1,2
264,Oliver, Sounds great,,,510.1,response,2,1,2

264,Chris,"Okay, yeah",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
264,Chris," So my answer to the question was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
264,Teacher,"Okay, I really appreciate that you give us a fact and exactly evidence for all the passage when you answer the question",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher,"Okay, I really appreciate that you give us a fact and exactly evidence for all the passage when you answer the question",,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher,"And you said the crater of water, that is a fact, what made you say that?",,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
264,Chris," Well, it kind of goes along with my",,,110.2,response,2,1,2
264,Chris,"Well, okay",,,110.2,response,2,1,2
264,Chris,My key word because I said the key word was water and the whole story is about water and they found the water like all this water in the crater,,,,response,2,1,2
264,Teacher,"Yes, the water is an overload along a passage",,,410.1,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher, The key words like equipment do agree,,,410.1,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher, But my concern is other students and they circle,,,410.1,remark,2,1,2
264,Chris,I hadn't hadn't heard of that just yet,,,410.1,response,2,1,2
264,Teacher," And so um let equipment is an important words in a question, but you didn't include any equipment in your answer right",,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher,Yes,,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
264,Chris,"Yeah, I didn't include equipment",,,410.2,response,2,1,2

264,Teacher,Yes,,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher," So, how will you revise your answer that include the equipment",,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
264,Chris, I'll have to put some equipment in my answer to make sure it answers the question,,,420.2,response,2,1,2
264,Chris,"Yeah, I'll have to",,,420.2,response,2,1,2
264,Teacher,"Yes, so did you'll find a place in the passage, you can do that",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
264,Chris,"Well, I went to NASA",,,210.4,response,2,1,2
264,Chris, So I know scientists use a lot of equipment actually like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
264,Teacher, I think in the middle the passage,,,420.3,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher,"Yes, let's",,,420.3,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher, And so you can look carefully in the passage to see where is the equipment,,,420.3,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher, You can take a carefully look,,,420.3,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher, A lot,,,420.3,remark,2,1,2
264,Chris,OK,,,420.3,response,2,1,2
264,Chris, OK,,,420.3,response,2,1,2
264,Teacher," How about you, you maybe help us later to help out out Chris and Luis to answer the question, because your answer is NASA sent a small machine, right",,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher,And then Jazmin,,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
264,Jazmin,Yes,,,130.2,response,2,1,2

264,Teacher, It may help Chris and Luis to understand better,,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher,How you will make your answer more specific?,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
264,Jazmin,"Oh, well, what if I use the keyword like I could said I could say NASA sent A small machine to discover the water",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
264,Teacher,But you need a little more specific,,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher,"Yeah, I like it",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
264,Teacher, You had a target to the right place in the passage you for the answer,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2

265,Teacher,"Teacher : That's okay, Luis",,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
265,Teacher,Teacher : So I understand that we read the assignment water on the moon in your discussion question was what equipment and scientists have used to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
265,Teacher,Teacher : Correct?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2

265,Teacher," What did you say, What was your response for The understanding what equipment did scientists use",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
265,Teacher," So, Farrah",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
265,Farrah,I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,120.4,response,0,0,2
265,Teacher, Did you find evidence of that in the text,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
265,Teacher, To look really closely,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
265,Teacher, Okay,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
265,Teacher,Teacher : So a scientific tool called a microscope,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
265,Farrah,"In part three, it talks about the microscope and how the water is really small",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
265,Teacher,"Teacher : so I could see you, how you got confused there",,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
265,Teacher,"Teacher : Yeah, so it says it's microscopic so although microscope or microscopic start with the same beginning they mean two different things",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
265,Teacher," So microscopic means it's really small,",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
265,Farrah,"Well,",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
265,Farrah, It says right after that you need a scientific tool called a microscope,,,,response,0,0,2
265,Farrah,"So that says, right",,,,response,0,0,2
265,Farrah, So I took that word right from the story,,,,response,0,0,2
265,Teacher,"Teacher : Right, so you need a microscope to look at the microscopic particles, because it's so small, but that wasn't necessarily the tool that they use to send to the moon",,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
265,Teacher,"Teacher : And Oliver, I saw that you said you circle, the same as Farrah",,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
265,Oliver,"Yeah, I also thought it was a microscope, because that's a tool and on the question asked for equipment that's equipment",,,230.3,response,0,0,2
265,Teacher,"Teacher : Right, so I could see where that would get confusing",,,310.1,remark,0,0,2

265,Teacher,"Teacher : So I would have liked to see more information, more describing it",,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
265,Teacher,Teacher : Luis You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
265,Teacher, Where did you see oxygen tanks,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
265,Luis,"Oh, well I just know a lot about space because I watch videos on YouTube and I watch stuff about rocket launches and I really know a lot about astronauts",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
265,Luis," So, um, I just know that the astronauts would have needed oxygen tanks",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
265,Teacher,"Teacher : Right, so I don't disagree that you can learn a lot from YouTube, have boats, the scientists and astronauts and rockets",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
265,Teacher, So although I agree with you that they might need oxygen tanks,,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
265,Teacher,"Teacher : But in the article, I didn't see anything about oxygen tanks",,,410.2,remark,0,0,2

265,Teacher,"Teacher : Right, so how did they get there though what equipment do they use to find it",,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
265,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like like oxygen takes like Luis was saying and masks and suits,,,210.3,response,0,0,2

265,Oliver," Sorry to answer because you can told Jazmin, but I still don't really understand why it's not the microscope from Part three, because that's also equipment and they also needed to find the water",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
265,Oliver," I'm like, I know you said that",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
265,Oliver,"Well, um, this is Oliver I heard you say Lunar Orbiter",,,120.4,response,0,0,2

265,Farrah,"Well, because when it says equipment",,,230.1,response,1,0,2
265,Farrah, And so I said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope and so I don't understand why my answers wrong,,,230.1,response,1,0,2
265,Farrah," That means you have to look for, like, a tool for your answer",,,230.1,response,1,0,2
265,Teacher, All right,,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher,"Next, though there was another piece of equipment that was talked about survey",,,120.1,remark,1,0,2

265,Teacher,"All right, Chris and Jazmin, I'll be working with you",,,,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher, It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher,So if we look back at that question,,,120.2,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher,"Okay, so I want you right now to reread the first or the article",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher, Is that clear?,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher," Reread article, and I want you to circle, any word that you might think is equipment",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
265,Chris," We're gonna reread it, and circle all the equipment that we find is that right?",,,,response,1,0,2
265,Chris,Yeah so me and Jazmin,,,,response,1,0,2
265,Teacher,Perfect,,,,remark,1,0,2
265,Chris," Yeah, because I went to NASA",,,,response,1,0,2
265,Chris, So I know that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,1,0,2
265,Chris,Okay,,,,response,1,0,2
265,Teacher,Right,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher, So you have some background knowledge,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher, Okay,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher, So let's read and see if we can find any other pieces of equipment,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
265,Chris,"Okay, yeah",,,150.1,response,1,0,2
265,Teacher,"All right, well, you do that Deb Farrah and Luis Do you have a question",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2

265,Jazmin,"Oh no, no question",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
265,Teacher,You're gonna reread as well,,,,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher,"What about you, Oliver, and Luis Do you feel like you need to reread or what did you talk about in small group",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
265,Oliver,"Well, we agree that the microscope was a piece of equipment and they probably used it to to look at the water and then the only other piece of equipment we saw was the small machine",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
265,Teacher,Right,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher, Do you remember,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher, What was that small machine name,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
265,Luis,"Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know",,,210.4,response,1,0,2
265,Luis, It's the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
265,Teacher,"Yeah, correct",,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher,So you talked about the small machine that they used and what did they use that machine to do,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher, Luis So the Lunar Orbiter,,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
265,Luis,Says that they they used it to investigate and it looks for ice deposits and a large polar crater,,,110.4,response,1,0,2
265,Teacher,"Okay, and Oliver can you reread that first question?",,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
265,Oliver,Okay um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,response,1,0,2
265,Teacher," Do you think that lunar orbiter is the right tool, or do you think the microscope is after doing more research?",,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher," And so, Farrah after hearing the equipment and what it was used for in the question number one",,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher,Okay,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
265,Farrah,"Well, I guess I'm still a little confused like it definitely sounds like lunar orbiter is a good answer, but I guess I still think microscope is a good answer too",,,210.3,response,1,0,2
265,Teacher, Oliver do you have a question,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher,"Okay, so you still think that lunar orbiter is a good job",,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
265,Oliver, Look at that question so closely today,,,110.1,response,1,0,2
265,Oliver,"Oh yeah, well I just actually I wanted to say that it's time for us to go, but I wanted to say thank you for having us",,,110.1,response,1,0,2
265,Teacher,Thank you have fun at lunch,,,,remark,1,0,2
265,Teacher,Hi,,,,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,"So we were talking about the different equipment and Chris and Jazmin were rereading the article so Chris and Jazmin, would you like to share with the group any of the equipment that you circled from the reading",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
265,Chris, I guess because there's the small machine on the,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
265,Chris," So, well, we found the same to that Oliver and Farrah",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
265,Chris,"Oh, yeah, yeah",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
265,Chris, Okay,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
265,Chris, Definitely,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
265,Chris,"Lunar Orbiter and then at the end, it talks about the microscope",,,,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher, Luis,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, So you found the Lunar Orbiter and the microscope,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, Nice,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Right,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Luis,"Yeah, I just wanted to remind you, my dad as actually an astronaut",,,230.3,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher,That's pretty amazing,,,140.1,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, Luis I wonder if your dad has ever seen the lunar escape or the Lunar Orbiter,,,140.1,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,"But so Chris and Jazmin, so that they found the two tools of equipment right so",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Farrah,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, Can you read the question for me that you're trying to answer,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Farrah,Huh,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
265,Farrah," Yes, it's um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.3,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher, Did it help find the water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,"Okay, so let's look at both pieces of equipment",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, So the was the microscope,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Can someone raised their hand,,,,remark,2,0,2
265,Farrah,"I i thought it did because it's like, how can you find something if you can't see it",,,,response,2,0,2
265,Farrah, If it's too small for you to see how can you find it without something like a microscope huh?,,,,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher,"Right, so the microscope helps us see things that is really small, but Not necessarily found the water on the earth right?",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, Farrah,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,"Can you reread the part in the article about the microscope for me, please",,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Farrah,"Yeah, out loud",,,120.3,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Please,,,,remark,2,0,2
265,Farrah,Okay,,,,response,2,0,2
265,Farrah,The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it,,,,response,2,0,2
265,Farrah," If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher,"and then Chris, can you reread the part about the Lunar Orbiter",,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, So you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water they found on moon right,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Awesome,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
265,Chris, Definitely,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
265,Chris," Um, it says, let's see, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and lock her ice deposits and a large polar crater",,,120.3,response,2,0,2
265,Chris,"Yeah, I can do that",,,120.3,response,2,0,2
265,Chris,"Just right there, or do you want me to keep going",,,,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher,"Um, can you read the next two sentences for me",,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Chris," Yeah, okay, these ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water",,,120.3,response,2,0,2
265,Chris,Mm hmm,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Thank you for reading that Chris so,,,,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Luis Can you summarize what the paragraph said,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
265,Luis,I'm the one that Luis read,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
265,Luis," I mean, the one that Chris read",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
265,Luis," Okay, so it said that they sent the Lunar Orbiter and it looked at the moon and it found a water, but it was actually ice and it was in the craters and there's like not that much of it",,,,response,2,0,2
265,Luis,"Yes, yeah",,,,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher," So, you told me the they found the lunar orbiter found the water on the moon, but it was ice right",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Right,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Luis,"Yeah, it was frozen",,,230.3,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher,"Okay, so the lunar orbiter found the water on the moon, and then Farrah, you were saying at the microscope helps us to look at the water right",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Farrah,Right,,,230.3,response,2,0,2
265,Farrah," Yeah, because it's so small, like Luis was saying",,,230.3,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher," The Lunar Orbiter, or do you think the microscope did?",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, Do you think found the water,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,"Right so Jazmin, which tool",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Jazmin, So I still think that's right,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
265,Jazmin, NASA sent a small machine,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
265,Jazmin, And I don't really see what was wrong with my answer,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
265,Jazmin,Well my answer to begin with was the small machine,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher, Small machine,,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher," My concern is, is that there's a better answer and a name for that small machine",,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,"Right, so you have the answer",,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Do you have a name for the small machine,,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
265,Jazmin, We've been talking about it like this whole time,,,230.1,response,2,0,2
265,Jazmin,"Oh yeah, it's the Lunar Orbiter",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher,"Right, so the name of that small machine, you just said is a lunar orbiter",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Chris,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, Do you agree with Jazmin,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
265,Chris,"Well, yeah",,,230.3,response,2,0,2
265,Chris,I agree with Jazmin,,,,response,2,0,2
265,Chris, I think would make sense that the lunar orbiter discovered it because,,,,response,2,0,2
265,Chris, So I'm picturing the orbiter like going around and around the moon and,,,,response,2,0,2
265,Chris,I know from science class or a bit means to like go around,,,,response,2,0,2
265,Chris," So yeah, I think that it saw the Lunar Orbiter and I was thinking I first thought it was these craters full of water, but it sounds like there wasn't that much",,,,response,2,0,2
265,Chris,I can't really see how a microscope kind of fits into that,,,,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher," So Chris, you are using your background knowledge of a definition of Orbiter to be able to apply your answer",,,510.1,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Great,,,510.1,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,2,0,2
265,Chris," Yeah, because we learned that word orbit",,,,response,2,0,2
265,Chris,"Yeah, exactly",,,,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher," What did Chris, say, what does it mean",,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,You learn the word orbit and Farrah,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
265,Farrah,It means to go around,,,130.2,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Farrah,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher," So, Chris shared that the lunar orbiter went around the moon looking for something",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, What was it looking for,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,"To go around, right",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Farrah,The small pieces of ice,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher,The small pieces of ice,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, So did the Lunar Orbiter find the water or did the microscope find the water?,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Farrah,"Oh,",,,210.3,response,2,0,2
265,Farrah," And then, and then they used a microscope to like",,,,response,2,0,2
265,Farrah,"Yeah, that's making more sense that the lunar orbiter is what like I'm a bit like detected it",,,,response,2,0,2
265,Farrah,Look at it and study it,,,,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher,"Right, exactly",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, So what you just said was that the lunar orbiter went around the moon and spotted the water,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, Correct?,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher,"Than you you were able to use the context of your microscope, which is another tool to be able to say that the microscope is going to help study the water which is small pieces",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
265,Farrah,Yeah yeah that makes sense now,,,230.3,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Okay so Oliver,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, Can you summarize what Farrah just said for me?,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
265,Oliver,All yeah I sure can she said that on the,,,150.1,response,2,0,2
265,Oliver, I think it was thought on the lunar orbiter like found it and then the microphone all like looked at it,,,,response,2,0,2
265,Oliver,"Oh, I wasn't really listening",,,,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Luis is Oliver right,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
265,Luis," He couldn't he has to better words, I think",,,130.2,response,2,0,2
265,Luis,"Yeah, I mean, it's like, close enough",,,130.2,response,2,0,2
265,Luis," But yeah, he got the idea",,,130.2,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher,Okay so Oliver and Luis than right he got the right idea,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, Yes Oliver,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
265,Oliver,"Um, well, actually",,,110.1,response,2,0,2
265,Oliver," Yeah, I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now",,,110.1,response,2,0,2
265,Oliver,But I wanted to say thank you so much for listening to us and really helping us connect what we already knew like our background knowledge with the text and also helping us understand,,,,response,2,0,2
265,Oliver,When we were using it to answer the question instead of actually using what's in the article in front of us,,,,response,2,0,2
265,Oliver, Thank you very much,,,,response,2,0,2
265,Oliver, That was so helpful,,,,response,2,0,2
265,Teacher,You're welcome,,,,remark,2,0,2
265,Teacher, Good job,,,,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,Hi everyone,,,,remark,0,0,2

266,Teacher,So I've gotten after hearing your,,,,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher," Oh, yes",,,,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,0,0,2
266,Luis,"Yes, me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,0,2
266,Teacher, No matter what the subject and even if you know all about space right now,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,We're also going to be learning about answering a question fully And making sure that we're giving all the information that's in your head so that everyone knows that you have a full understanding of the topic,,,220.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"Oh yeah, I believe it, but there's always more to learn",,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher, So let's reread the question,,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,The question asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"Can someone read reread paragraph two, for me, where it begins with NASA send a small machine, who can read that for me",,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"So I like a lot of these answers, but why don't we, I think that we need to take a step back with some of these answers",,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Oliver, These are still deposits are very small,,,120.3,response,0,0,2
266,Oliver,It says NASA sent a machine called all Lunar Orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar quarter,,,120.3,response,0,0,2
266,Teacher, What did we learn,,,120.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher, So after reading that statement,,,120.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"Thank you, Oliver",,,120.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,What did NASA do,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2

266,Chris,I was just raising my hand,,,,response,0,0,2
266,Teacher," Very, very cool",,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,Yes,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"So what did the, what was the first thing they did in that first sentence",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,But how did they find that ice is the question,,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"Go ahead, Jazmin",,,,remark,0,0,2
266,Jazmin,And so sent a small machine,,,,response,0,0,2
266,Teacher,Right,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher, It says they sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher, So that was step one,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"So we know that NASA found Ice deposits that were very small, but the first way that they found or the first step in defining that was sending a small machine there",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
266,Jazmin,That's what I said for my answer,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
266,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine,,,,response,0,0,2
266,Jazmin, And so I don't understand why the answer was wrong,,,,response,0,0,2
266,Teacher,It was more that we just need to build more on it,,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,Your answer wasn't totally wasn't completely incorrect,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher, So can someone read the third paragraph out loud to me,,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,but let's read the next step,,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher," So you gave us that step number one, but let's read the next step",,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"Remember, how I was saying that the point of these questions is to make sure we know that you know everything possible about this topic",,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,What about Farrah,,,,remark,0,0,2
266,Farrah, I'll do it now,,,,response,0,0,2
266,Farrah,"Yeah, I can read it",,,,response,0,0,2
266,Farrah,This means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth,,,,response,0,0,2
266,Farrah," If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,0,2
266,Farrah, The water they found is microscopic meaning you won't to be able to see it,,,,response,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"Wow, really cool",,,,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher," I'm sorry, the water is microscopic so it's tiny",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher," And they even explain to us, it means that you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher, So what was the scientific tool needed to see something so small,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,So the moon is so the water that they found,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
266,Farrah,"Well, it was a microscope",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
266,Farrah, That was my answer,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"Right, I saw that man and you did a nice job of explaining that you actually took words from the text, which is great",,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher, Step number two,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher, But now we need to put it all together,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,But you were missing step number one,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher," So, Jazmin did a great job of explaining",,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher, Step number one and you did a great job of explaining,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,To someone want to try to put that into one answer,,,130.2,remark,0,0,2

266,Teacher, I still see a hand Chris,,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
266,Chris, And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,130.2,response,0,0,2
266,Chris,"Yeah, I would have to say, I went to NASA",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
266,Teacher," We need tons of equipment that we don't use down here, right",,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher," Oh, I'm sure that's absolutely right",,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher, They to go up into space,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,Right,,,130.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"However, when we're answering questions related to a text we only need to provide the information from the text",,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher, Does that make sense to you?,,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"If you provided that information that you just told me, Chris, which is great background knowledge, the person who's reading this won't know where you got that information from it doesn't apply to this question",,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
266,Chris,"So,",,,410.2,response,0,0,2
266,Chris,It's because it's not in the story,,,,response,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"That's right, yeah",,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher, It gives us almost like a little step ahead,,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher," But again, that's excellent background knowledge because background knowledge always helps us understand what we're learning about even better",,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
266,Chris,"Yeah, yeah, that's that makes sense",,,310.1,response,0,0,2
266,Chris, Yeah,,,310.1,response,0,0,2
266,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher," Well, I think that, oh, yes, Luis",,,,remark,0,0,2
266,Luis," So I'm wondering, because I don't think about the Lunar Orbiter",,,,response,0,0,2
266,Luis, They're not like walking around looking looking through a microscope on them,,,,response,0,0,2
266,Luis," I don't think it had astronauts on it, so did the astronauts",,,,response,0,0,2
266,Luis," Did they need a microscope, because if there weren't any astronauts",,,,response,0,0,2
266,Luis, Right,,,,response,0,0,2
266,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"Right, so",,,,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,The first,,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher," So I guess if we rewrite the question, what we would say",,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"Is that the equipment that scientists used even though they weren't on the small machine, it was still a piece of equipment right that they used",,,210.2,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,So the equipment that the scientists used included a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,"And microscopes to investigate the small tight, the smallest or I'm sorry, the water that was found this tiny",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
266,Luis, So even though they didn't use it on the moon,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
266,Luis,"Oh, okay",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
266,Luis," It was like, they still had to use it like later",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
266,Teacher,They still had to use it,,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher, Correct,,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
266,Oliver," I just looked at the clock, it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say",,,110.4,response,0,0,2

266,Oliver, We really appreciate that you taught us that today,,,,response,0,0,2
266,Oliver, Thank you very much,,,,response,0,0,2
266,Oliver,Thank you for helping us understand how to put our answers together and make the most specific answer for the question,,,,response,0,0,2
266,Teacher, All right,,,,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher," Well, enjoy your lunch",,,,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,You're welcome,,,,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher, I always love getting thank yous,,,,remark,0,0,2
266,Teacher,Start simulation,,,,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,Hi everyone,,,,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,"My name is Teacher, and today I'm going to be helping you with our comprehension questions from the text that we read about the moon",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, Yes,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, Luis,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, Just a little bit,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,"So we're all here together because there's we all know we all answered the questions individually, but we all could use a little bit of work on just fixing those answers",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Luis,"I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,150.1,response,1,0,2
266,Teacher," I can tell you included some really awesome information, but we're here to make sure that we're answering the question that was given to us and using the text that was given to us",,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,I know I remember that,,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, And based on your answer,,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,So let's start by looking back at the question again,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,So can someone read the question out loud to me,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Chris,"Yeah, I'll read it",,,120.3,response,1,0,2
266,Teacher, Chris,,,,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,"Okay great, thanks",,,,remark,1,0,2
266,Chris,"Okay, the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,,response,1,0,2
266,Teacher,That's right,,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, Can someone try to tell me what the key question what the key word is in that question that tells us what we're looking for,,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,Yeah Oliver give it a try,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
266,Oliver,Okay,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
266,Oliver," Well, I think the key word as equipment, because you have to know that you're looking to find a tool to answer the question",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
266,Teacher, I was thinking more along the lines of which word tells us the exact question being asked so that word that I was looking at is what goes on with equipment,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher," That's a good point, that's definitely an important piece of the question",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,So we're going to be looking for what they used right not how they use something or why they use something just what so but you are right that we are looking for the equipment use,,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, Why don't we start with Farrah,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,So who wants,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, Could you tell me what you actually wrote for your answer,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
266,Farrah,"Oh yeah, sure",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
266,Farrah," Okay, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
266,Teacher," However, we missed a little part of the text in your answer",,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,"So how about Jazmin, could you actually read what you wrote?",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,"And I love that answer, because that's answering the question, we did need a piece that's the piece of equipment that needs to be used",,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Jazmin,"So I said that NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,410.2,response,1,0,2
266,Teacher,With your answer is not completely wrong,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, It's more than it's just missing a little bit of information,,,110.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,So Farrah mentioned that we needed the microscope to look at the water very closely because it's so tiny,,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher," So that's a very, very important piece of information that needs to be included in the answer",,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,But we also need Jazmin's part of the answer that,,,130.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, How did they even get the water down here,,,130.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, They needed that a lunar orbiter to see it,,,130.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,"So we need to, there's two parts of this answer",,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher," And her answer with what Farrah said in her answer, there's two parts",,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, So we need to combine what Jazmin set,,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, So why don't we try to combine those two answers,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,"So sometimes when we're answering a question, even if we think that there's only one part, we just need to be sure that we're reading through the text fully to make sure we don't miss any bit",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,"What do we think is the first piece of information that should what should go first, the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,"Yeah, Jazmin",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, Go ahead,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
266,Jazmin,"Well, I think that it's",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
266,Jazmin,A small machine that has to go first,,,,response,1,0,2
266,Teacher," That's what came first, in the text right?",,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,"Right, I mean you know how I also a good way to test to see if that makes sense",,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher," I can find that right in paragraph two, whereas, I'm sorry, not Farrah Jazmin's answer I can find in paragraph two, but Farrah",,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,Farrah's nswer,,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, Where did you find your answer,,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Farrah,On part three,,,230.2,response,1,0,2
266,Teacher,Right,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, Did you have a question,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher," Go ahead, Oliver",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
266,Oliver," So I'm not sure I agree with Jazmin, because what I'm thinking is, if the water is so small that you can't even see it without a microscope, then how can you find it if you can't even see it",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
266,Oliver,I do have a question,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
266,Oliver, Yes,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
266,Teacher, So the way that I would try to find the answer to that is by looking back in the text,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,That's a really good question,,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,"So let's see, paragraph number two, where we found out about the lunar orbiter that Jazmin's discussing",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,"So it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,"Each ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one top 10 of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day",,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, So I the text actually doesn't really give us that much information as far as how the lunar orbiter would have been able to find the tiny water,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,Hmm,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher," However, it does say that",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher," I'm like, stumbling on my words",,,,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,That's where  Am I allowed to stop,,,,remark,1,0,2
266,Oliver, That's okay,,,,response,1,0,2
266,Oliver,"Oh no, that's okay",,,,response,1,0,2
266,Oliver,You can keep going,,,,response,1,0,2
266,Teacher,Do you have a question,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Chris, So I know that scientists do use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
266,Chris,"Yeah, so actually I went to NASA",,,150.1,response,1,0,2
266,Teacher, That's all really interesting information Chris,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,That's right,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, It helps us understand text a lot more when we have that,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,And I love that you're using your background knowledge to connect to the texts always great,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, We need to be sure that we're just providing information from the text,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,"However, when we're writing answers to comprehension questions about a text that was given to us",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,When we provide information from our own background knowledge,,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, The issue with that is that we don't really have concrete evidence of where you got that information,,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,So even though I might know that you visited NASA if somebody else was reading your response,,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, And they didn't know that they might wonder where you got that information from right,,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,To use evidence from the text in front of us,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
266,Chris,So it has to be a piece of equipment from the story,,,420.2,response,1,0,2
266,Teacher,That's right,,,130.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, So we're going to begin by step one mentioning the Lunar Orbiter and step two would be mentioning the microscope yes Farrah,,,130.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher, That's right,,,130.3,remark,1,0,2
266,Farrah,"Well actually it's it's time for us to go right now, but I wanted to say thank you for reminding us that we have to go back and read the whole thing to make sure that we didn't just pick part of the answer, but we actually find the whole answer",,,130.3,response,1,0,2
266,Teacher,"Of course,",,,,remark,1,0,2
266,Teacher,Hi everyone,,,,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, We're going to be going over,,,,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, Could someone read that out loud to me,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,So why don't we begin by just reviewing the question one more time,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,We're going to be going over our responses to our comprehension question regarding the text on the moon,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, Go ahead,,,,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,Yeah Luis,,,,remark,2,0,2
266,Luis,"Um, yeah, okay, um, before I do that, I just wanted to say",,,,response,2,0,2
266,Luis," Um, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,2,0,2
266,Teacher,I know I'm sure you do,,,110.3,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, I know you have a lot of background information on that since you've read so many books,,,110.3,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, I'm sure see movies or tv shows,,,110.3,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, We want to make sure that we're answering the question that was given to the fullest and making sure we're using evidence from the text that was given,,,220.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,"However, we're working on a few different things in this group",,,220.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,So why don't we all work on that together,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, So could you go ahead and read that question out loud to me Luis,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
266,Luis,Yeah okay um the question as what equipment at scientists to is to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
266,Teacher,Great,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,"Does anyone want to give me just let me know what they answered, or what they think if they even think that they want to change their answer what equipment was used",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, So we're looking for the equipment used,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,"Yeah, Jazmin, what do you think",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
266,Jazmin,So I said that NASA send a small machine,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
266,Teacher,Hmm,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, And where did you find that,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Jazmin,It's in,,,230.2,response,2,0,2
266,Jazmin,Part two,,,,response,2,0,2
266,Teacher, Great,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, Go ahead,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, That's great,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher," Yeah, Farrah",,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, So you have text evidence from the text,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,Does anyone have a different answer or did they find any other information about any equipment,,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Farrah,"Yeah, so I picked a different piece of equipment and Jazmin picked",,,130.2,response,2,0,2
266,Farrah,"And I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,2,0,2
266,Teacher,So do we think that maybe we just should include both of those responses to make one response together,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, I love that answer,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, Great,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, So it sounds like you both found pieces of equipment that were used,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
266,Farrah,That's it,,,210.3,response,2,0,2
266,Farrah,That's all we need to do?,,,,response,2,0,2
266,Teacher,"Yeah, I love that you mentioned the microscope, because that was definitely necessary",,,110.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,And Jazmin,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,but we need both of those things to be looking at the water molecules,,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher," I love that you mentioned the Lunar Orbiter,",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,So it's just a matter of combining your two answers,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,So when we're answering comprehension questions like this,,,510.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, We really need to dig into the text and make sure we're using all the information,,,510.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,"Does someone want to give it a try, and try to combine those two answers",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, Maybe Oliver?,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
266,Oliver,"Oh yeah okay well yeah cuz my, my first answer was the same as some animals about the microscope",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver, I guess you just say on that the scientists used a lunar orbiter and a microscope,,,,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver,To if you put the two together,,,,response,2,0,2
266,Teacher,"That's right, to make a complete sentence, though, we usually we use the words already sorry we usually use the words from the question given to us right",,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,"You can, did you want to give that a try",,,120.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Oliver," Well, before I do that, I just wanted to say I'm Oliver",,,120.1,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,120.1,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver,And Farrah,,,,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver, I don't think I don't think they use a microscope,,,,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver, I think you're wrong,,,,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver," Because, I mean, I know it talks about it like sorry and stuff, but can you",,,,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver,"Can you even picture, like if there was an astronaut and they weren't like walking all around that big giant moon",,,,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver," Like, I can't",,,,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver," What, like a microscope",,,,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver,Imagine that,,,,response,2,0,2
266,Teacher,"Um, I know that does sound funny",,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher," So, what makes you think that the scientists were on the moon with the microscope",,,230.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Oliver,"Like, I mean, that's what I mean that's why i mean i don't think they use a microscope, because I don't think there were any astronauts there",,,230.1,response,2,0,2
266,Teacher,"Um, so the text doesn't imply that the astronauts went to the moon",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher," So, so I'm looking at, paragraph two, right now it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, Right,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,"So it doesn't necessarily say that any astronauts went there, however, that small machine was still necessary because that's what found The ice deposits",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, This lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and the large polar crater,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,So that's what actually found the small little water so that I can and I found that information from the second sentence,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, Luis,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher," Look, examining the water molecules, the lunar orbiter is what found them",,,130.3,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,Does that make a little more sense,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,So even though this astronauts went up there,,,130.3,remark,2,0,2
266,Luis, That's what I thought,,,150.1,response,2,0,2
266,Luis, The lunar orbiter,,,150.1,response,2,0,2
266,Luis,"Yeah, yeah, yeah",,,150.1,response,2,0,2
266,Luis, That's kind of what I thought our first place that it was was most like that,,,150.1,response,2,0,2
266,Teacher,"Right, so then with the microscope in paragraph three, it's suggesting that the scientists were using the microscope When they were examining it back here on Earth",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
266,Chris,"Well,",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
266,Chris,"Surely, so I went to NASA",,,,response,2,0,2
266,Chris," And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, so",,,,response,2,0,2
266,Chris,I don't understand why why that's not the right answer,,,,response,2,0,2
266,Teacher, If we use background information,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,So those are all pieces of equipment,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher," However, when we're answering a question to a text that we've read, we need to be just using evidence from the text",,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, Absolutely,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,The person who's reading your response,,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, Don't know where you got that information right,,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, You may question where you got that evidence,,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, So if he was reading your response,,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher," However, maybe Oliver doesn't know that",,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher, And if it's truly valid right,,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,"For example, I know that you went to NASA, because you've talked about it",,,410.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,So we need to be using the texts given when we're answering a question about the given tax,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
266,Chris,"Okay, yeah",,,420.2,response,2,0,2
266,Chris,Thanks for explaining got it,,,,response,2,0,2
266,Teacher,No problem,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher," I like that you use the background information, though, Chris, it's always great to have that helps us understand and text a little more",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,Does anyone else have any other questions to clarify this response,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,0,2
266,Oliver,What I wanted to try the thing you said where we put it all together,,,,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver, And I'm use the words from the question,,,,response,2,0,2
266,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,2,0,2
266,Oliver,"Okay, so",,,,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver," Then later, like Luis said, they used a microscope",,,,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver,Equipment that the scientists used to discover the water was on the lunar orbiter,,,,response,2,0,2
266,Teacher, That's excellent,,,520.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher," So now when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions, you can use Deb's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use all of the evidence from the text all the information there",,,520.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Teacher,That's right,,,520.1,remark,2,0,2
266,Oliver, So to answer out there was,,,520.1,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver," And actually, it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you for listening to all of our answers and helping us understand how we each had like a part of the answer and how to put them all together and make the best",,,520.1,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver, Awesome,,,520.1,response,2,0,2
266,Oliver,Thank you,,,520.1,response,2,0,2

268,Teacher, Right,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,1,2
268,Luis,"Well, I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,2
268,Teacher, This particular text okay by this author,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher, I just want to make sure that everybody understands this text,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,"Oh, that's wonderful to have your background knowledge",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
268,Luis,"Okay, okay",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
268,Teacher, It shouldn't take too long,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,All right,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher, Okay,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher," If there's just a double, double check that you understand what I want you to understand",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,"Alright, so our question is,",,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher, Tell me one key word one or more key words in the question,,,420.1,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,Can you tell me what they want you to understand,,,420.1,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,0,1,2
268,Farrah, You need to have,,,,response,0,1,2
268,Farrah,"Well, I think that a key word is equipment, because in your answer",,,,response,0,1,2
268,Farrah,Like a tool or something,,,,response,0,1,2
268,Teacher," In an equipment, like you said, Farrah is a tool that they used in order to discover the water on the moon, right",,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,Exactly,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher, The scientists use in order to complete this mission,,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,Let's revisit our text and figure out what specifically what equipment or scientific tool,,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,"All right, I'll give you a few minutes to do that and let me know",,,,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,So we're in the process to reread it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,"Yes, I want you to skim the text and let me know which Equipment",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher," In particular, they used to discover to make this discovery",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher," And once you're done, you can share with the partner, partner next to you",,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,All right,,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,See if you guys got the same answers,,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,0,1,2
268,Jazmin," I said, NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,2
268,Jazmin,So for my answer,,,,response,0,1,2
268,Jazmin, After reading the text again,,,,response,0,1,2
268,Teacher, So let's try to use the text and see what the name of that tool is,,,430.1,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,"All right, it's not that your answer is wrong, particularly, it's not what the question is asking right it's asking what equipment specifically",,,430.1,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,So we want our answers to be as specific as possible,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Jazmin,And so it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,420.2,response,0,1,2
268,Teacher,That's fantastic,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher," Can you help me find out where that is, which which pairs",,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher, We are in the texts,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher, The more specific,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher, Exactly,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Jazmin,I found it in paragraph two in the in the first sentence,,,230.2,response,0,1,2
268,Teacher,Yes Oliver,,,,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,Paragraph two NASA sent to be small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
268,Oliver,"Well, Farrah, and we had a different answer when we talked about it",,,,response,0,1,2
268,Oliver,"We said it was the microscope and they talk about that in the next paragraph, how you would need a tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,1,2
268,Oliver,So that's also equipment,,,,response,0,1,2
268,Teacher,That's very true,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher, That's another tool that they used in order to find water and the moon,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,"I love that you used, you told me, which paragraph you found that evidence, right, the more evidence that we have the stronger our claim is",,,310.1,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,Anybody else find any other piece of equipment,,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,0,1,2
268,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,1,2
268,Chris,Will own I went to NASA,,,,response,0,1,2
268,Teacher, Is there any evidence in the text that you found that kind of That supports that they use oxygen and hydrogen tanks and etc,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,"Wow, that's awesome Background information",,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Chris,"Um, oh, oh, well, no, not in this story, but I just know that if there were astronauts, they would need all of those things",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
268,Teacher,That's a very good point,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,Let's see,,,,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,Yes Luis,,,,remark,0,1,2
268,Luis,Yeah,,,,response,0,1,2
268,Luis," Okay, so I'm thinking what Chris said it just made me think, um, I just reread the textbook as you told us to, you know, it doesn't say anything about astronauts Chris they don't even have the word astronaut and that story",,,,response,0,1,2
268,Teacher,"Yeah, we're talking about the scientists right so it's great to make connections with our past experiences, but also pay attention to what the question is asking, and the context of the text",,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher, So what would you say in your answer,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,"Alright, Chris",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,"The particular equipment that they, the scientists used to discover water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,Can you try,,,120.1,remark,0,1,2
268,Chris,I guess your I can try again,,,120.1,response,0,1,2
268,Chris," Because if I have to pick one from the story, I would say",,,120.1,response,0,1,2
268,Chris,"I go, so I would probably say what Jazmin said about the lunar orbiter because that sounds, that sounds more like like a like a spaceship or something that they would send",,,,response,0,1,2
268,Teacher,Yep,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher," When does it do what is it, what does that tool used for? It's to find water on the moon, but how?",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher," And let's be more specific, so if you look in that paragraph itself tells you exactly what it does",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
268,Chris,It says to investigate and to look for ice deposits,,,420.2,response,0,1,2
268,Teacher, Yes Oliver,,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
268,Teacher,"Yeah, look for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
268,Oliver, And we actually have to go to lunch now,,,110.4,response,0,1,2
268,Oliver, I just locked up a lot,,,110.4,response,0,1,2
268,Oliver,I'm so sorry,,,110.4,response,0,1,2
268,Oliver,"What I just wanted to say thank you so much for reminding us that our answers needed to have evidence from the text and the more evidence you have a stronger your answer is that's going to help us a lot with us close on also our classes, too",,,,response,0,1,2
268,Oliver, So thank you so much,,,,response,0,1,2
268,Teacher, Bye,,,,remark,0,1,2

268,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,1,2
268,Luis," Well, I was gonna say",,,,response,1,1,2
268,Luis,I shouldn't be in this group because I already corrected my answer,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Teacher, I just wanted to take some time today to reflect and make sure,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,"Oh, that's awesome",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2

268,Teacher,That it's really our learning is really set in stone,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher," Okay, so, um,",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,Let's see,,,,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,I am going to give you some sentence starters and,,,510.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,This is going to help us really solidify our learning and reading strategies,,,510.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,"So next time we have, we're answering",,,520.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher, Another question about certain text or maybe a different question about this particular text we know exactly what to do,,,520.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,Alright,,,530.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher," So for example, I can start out saying I started out thinking And you would say your prior response",,,530.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher, And now I think this way because And then you can tell me,,,530.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher, So next time you see a question asking about a text I will do what,,,530.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,"So this is, you think about the thinking and Thinking strategy that you use when you are reading a text and answering a question",,,510.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,Okay,,,530.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher," So, reflect on that process what that was like",,,530.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,"You can take a minute to talk with the person next to you and revisit what that process was like, and then we can share out loud",,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,"Alright, looks like we're ready",,,,remark,1,1,2

268,Farrah,"Yeah, yeah",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
268,Farrah, We'd love to go first,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
268,Farrah,Our answer for this has kind of the same show on we said,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,1,2
268,Farrah, I used to,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Farrah,"Well, what was the first part again",,,,response,1,1,2
268,Farrah, I used to think,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Teacher, You started out thinking a certain way and now you think,,,530.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,"Yo, yo",,,530.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Farrah,"Okay, so we started out",,,530.1,response,1,1,2
268,Farrah,Thinking that the,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Farrah,Answer was the microscope,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Farrah,But now we think that the answer is the Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Farrah,Be because,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Farrah,Oh well,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Farrah,"Because well, it kind of we talked about it and we heard that Jazmin's answer was right",,,,response,1,1,2
268,Teacher, But do you know why that is,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,"Yeah, jazz Jazmin's answer was right",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Farrah,"Well,",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
268,Farrah,It's because that they use the lunar,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Farrah,Lunar Orbiter first and,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Farrah,That's what they used to discover and then they use the microscope to study,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Teacher, It wasn't used to discover the actual water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,"Yep, so you, you didn't find out and learn that the microscope was used for a different purpose of studying the water right",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,Let me ask Jazmin,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher, Can you clarify to us Why you chose the lunar orbiter in your revised answer,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Jazmin,"Yeah, so",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
268,Jazmin,"Well, my first answer was, NASA send a small machine, but my new answer is NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and",,,,response,1,1,2
268,Jazmin,I changed it because,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Jazmin,There wasn't enough detail so,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Jazmin, It could be like anything like a like a toaster or a computer so,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Jazmin,If I just say small machine,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Jazmin,Next time I have a question like this I will look for all the details,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Teacher,Amazing,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher, Yes,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher, It's not specific to the text right,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,So I noticed that Jazmin told me She was able to point out that the small machine could mean anything,,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,"So Farrah, and then you when you change your answer to what Jazmin also wrote, which is the Lunar Orbiter",,,510.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,"Okay, so next time that you see a question like this, asked me about a text",,,520.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher, What are you going to do that,,,520.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,She's going back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used to discover the water and the moon,,,510.1,remark,1,1,2
268,Farrah,I'm okay,,,520.1,response,1,1,2
268,Farrah," I would say next time I see a question like this I will look for, or I'm look for evidence and the text",,,520.1,response,1,1,2
268,Teacher, Do you all agree nod your head yes if you agree to that strategy,,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,Yes,,,130.2,remark,1,1,2

268,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,1,1,2
268,Chris, Is that okay?,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Chris,I want to know is my new answer okay my new answer is the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Teacher,What do we think folks?,,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,"So is that referring to any equipment, that the scientists found or used?",,,210.3,remark,1,1,2

268,Oliver, And the first place,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Oliver, But now we heard more ideas for for how to find the right answer,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Oliver, So thank you for that,,,,response,1,1,2
268,Oliver,"helping us think about how we got our answers and why we changed our answers because Farrah and me, we had just going to change that because we heard the right answer",,,,response,1,1,2
268,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,1,1,2
268,Teacher,Hello class,,,,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher, Thank you for meeting with me today,,,,remark,2,1,2

268,Teacher,"Yes, even",,,,remark,2,1,2
268,Luis, I already corrected my answer,,,,response,2,1,2
268,Luis,"Um, excuse me, I shouldn't be in that scrub",,,,response,2,1,2

268,Teacher, I think it's the lunar orbiter because blank,,,530.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher," So you can say something like, I started out thinking that we needed a microscope microscope was my answer for the question right now",,,530.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,"Okay, so I have some sentence starters that can help you",,,530.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,And so the next time I see a question like this where I have to look at the text again I'm going to talk about a strategy,,,520.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,"Alright, sounds good",,,,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,You may begin,,,,remark,2,1,2

268,Teacher,All right Farrah,,,,remark,2,1,2
268,Farrah," So we, we started out thinking that the scientists used a microscope to look really closely at the water and now",,,,response,2,1,2
268,Farrah,Okay so well,,,,response,2,1,2
268,Farrah, We had the same answer at the start,,,,response,2,1,2
268,Farrah,"Now, we think that the scientists used the Lunar Orbiter to discover tiny bits of on frozen water in the craters, and we think that because, well, um, so it was like",,,,response,2,1,2
268,Farrah," First, they used the lunar orbiter first",,,,response,2,1,2
268,Farrah,We were told that the microscope wasn't right because they didn't use that,,,,response,2,1,2
268,Farrah,But I don't really know how I would have thought of that on my own,,,,response,2,1,2
268,Teacher,"Okay, I appreciate your honesty, I also really like that you are referencing specific parts of the text",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher, That's great,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher, So I see that you said they were looking for Ice deposits right in the poet large polar crater,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,You can use that type of same you're going to reference back to the text in order to find evidence,,,520.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,I am a little concerned because,,,,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,You were talking about which equipment they were using first and let's if I would suggest you revisit the question one more time,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,Can you read what that question is,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
268,Farrah,Yes,,,120.3,response,2,1,2
268,Farrah," So, so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.3,response,2,1,2
268,Teacher," What equipment and scientists used to do what, what is the purpose of this equipment Oliver or Farrah, can you go",,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,"Okay, so you have the equipment part, you know, that part is important, what action which which equipment",,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
268,Oliver,Oh yeah I got it,,,210.2,response,2,1,2
268,Oliver, It's discover,,,210.2,response,2,1,2
268,Teacher,"Yeah, discover and so you're going to go back to your answer for microscope it it's not asking which equipment they used first, what are they asking?",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,"Farrah, can you read?",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
268,Oliver,All okay,,,120.3,response,2,1,2
268,Oliver,"Um, it's, it's what equipment to discover",,,,response,2,1,2
268,Teacher, Does that make sense Farrah?,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,Right,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Farrah,"Yeah, can I try again",,,150.1,response,2,1,2
268,Teacher,Try again,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Farrah," So I guess if I was doing this again, maybe I would do what you had to have just do and look back in the question for an action word",,,120.1,response,2,1,2
268,Farrah,"Okay, so we used to think it was the microscope, and now we think it's the lunar orbiter because that's the equipment they used to discover",,,120.1,response,2,1,2
268,Teacher, Wonderful,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,Exactly,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,What about Chris,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
268,Chris," Okay, so my new answer is the water, the scientists found on the moon was microscopic",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
268,Chris,"Oh, okay",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
268,Chris," Well, I want to know if my new answers",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
268,Teacher,"Alright, let's just let's use the same approach we used for Farrah, and then answer",,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,Can You Do you remember,,,510.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher, Can you restate what their strategy is,,,510.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Chris,They on they read the question and they found the action work discover,,,510.1,response,2,1,2
268,Teacher,Discover and let's analyze your answer and see if that really answers the discover part,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
268,Chris,So I said the water the scientists found was microscopic so,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
268,Chris,I said like,,,,response,2,1,2
268,Chris,what it looked like when they discovered,,,,response,2,1,2
268,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,nod your head yes if you feel like that is the equipment that they used,,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher, Does that make sense,,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,Yes or no,,,,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher, Huh,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher, Alright so next strategy you can do is revisit the text,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,I see some few shaking their head,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher, No,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Chris,"So, so",,,120.1,response,2,1,2
268,Chris,And what should I look for,,,,response,2,1,2
268,Teacher,Why should we look for you worked with Jazmin and Luis right?,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,"Okay, can you help them out",,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher," You guys, what part in",,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
268,Jazmin,"Yes, Chris",,,130.2,response,2,1,2
268,Jazmin,"You want to look for equipment, your answer, nice to say equipment so it needs to have like a thing like an object in it",,,,response,2,1,2
268,Teacher,"Yes, a specific name maybe right so let's look back at the text",,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,And see if you can find something different,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
268,Teacher,"All right, yes",,,,remark,2,1,2
268,Oliver," Um, we have to go to lunch now, but I wanted to say that the way that you had us talk about why our answer changed on really helped us think about",,,,response,2,1,2
268,Oliver,"Um, excuse me",,,,response,2,1,2
268,Oliver,"Not just how to look at the text, but also like how to look at the question",,,,response,2,1,2
268,Oliver, And I think that's a really important first step,,,,response,2,1,2
268,Oliver, So thank you so much for teaching us that today,,,,response,2,1,2
268,Teacher,You're most welcome,,,,remark,2,1,2
269,Farrah,"Hi, good morning",,,,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher, How is everyone today,,,,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Good morning everyone,,,,remark,0,1,2
269,Farrah, Thanks for asking,,,,response,0,1,2
269,Farrah,"Oh, we're good",,,,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher," So today in our small group, we are going to be discussing our reading that we did have about water on the moon",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Awesome,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, Oh,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, Does someone want to,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,So you guys answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, Luis You have your hand raised,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, You have a question,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Luis," I don't think I should be in this group, I already know all about space",,,120.2,response,0,1,2
269,Luis,Excuse me,,,120.2,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher,"Oh, awesome",,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher," Well, then you can help us in talking about space since you are ready and ready to go",,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Do you want to go first then Luis about answering the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,"What, what did you say for your answer",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Luis,"Well, said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,120.2,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Cool,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, And did you get that information from the reading that we did,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Luis,"No, I just I just knew that because I watch all sorts of stuff about astronauts on like YouTube and you know on the internet and stuff",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher,"Right, so that's so cool that you have that extra information",,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,But what I want you to do is I want you to look back at the reading that we did and try and find something from the reading that answers the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Does anyone,,,,remark,0,1,2
269,Luis,Looking at now,,,,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, That will be great,,,,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, Does anyone else want to raise their hand and,,,,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Let's see,,,,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Talk about what they said,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, For when they answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, What did you say,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Farrah,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Farrah,"I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher," Farrah, because you're right to look at something really closely, you would need a microscope",,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,"Um, that's really interesting",,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, But let's think,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, Do you think we would be able to see all of the water on the moon,,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,If we had a microscope in our classroom,,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Or do you need more than that,,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Farrah," So if you don't have the microscope, you can't see it",,,210.3,response,0,1,2
269,Farrah,"Well, they said it's really small",,,210.3,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher,but on what I'm going to do now is I'm going to read out loud,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,"Oh, interesting",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher," Okay, so I love everyone's answers to these",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,The three facts that are out on our paper called the water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, And I want everyone to be listening,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, I want you to be thinking about the question what equipment did scientists use to discover,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,And while you're listening,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, So I want everyone to put on their listening ears to listen to the five figure out,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,"Water on the moon, because in these three facts that I'm going to read out there will be some answers in there",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, So the first fact is that,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,The second one is NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, And then our third fact is that means the moon is still drier than the driest or desert on Earth,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,These ice deposits are very small,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher," If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,"All right, let's see, Jazmin, you have your hand up",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Jazmin, So I listened to the facts and I still don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
269,Jazmin, I said that NASA scientists small machine,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
269,Jazmin,Here,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
269,Jazmin, Yeah,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher, What was the small machine called,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, Do you remember,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher," So your answer isn't wrong they did send a small machine, but I want to see more detail",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, I know that you could pull more detail from this,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Right,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
269,Jazmin,"I think you just said it, it's",,,420.2,response,0,1,2
269,Jazmin,The Lunar Orbiter NASA scientists machine called a lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Does anyone want to add to that anything that they heard while I was reading,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Yes,,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher," Nice job, Jazmin",,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, Good work,,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, That's the equipment that they used to discover the water on the moon,,,110.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, What would you like to add to that,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Oliver,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Oliver," I don't see why it's not the miscroscope, because it sounds like they used that too, right?",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
269,Oliver," as Farrah, and, and I still don't",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
269,Oliver,"I get that they sent the lunar orbiter, but I cricled the same answer",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher, Then they use the microscope to see it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,They did so once they actually found the water,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, Does that make more sense,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, So they needed to use a machine first to actually find the water and then they use the microscope to actually look at the water,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Oliver," And then, and then use a microscope to like study it",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
269,Oliver,It's like first the lunar orbiter goes and that's how they know it's there,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher," I'm Chris, do you have anything to add",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Exactly,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Chris,"Yeah, I went to NASA",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
269,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,120.4,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher,"Oh wow, that's so cool Chris",,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher," How, what it does to look for the water",,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher," Until then, you might be able to help me in telling me what the lunar orbiter does how it looks",,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Do you know we just read about it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, You want me to read it again,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Chris,"I think we know it's, um, well, it's an orbiter",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
269,Chris, So I guess that means like it goes around the moon,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher,"Oh yeah, I think that it goes around the moon and it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
269,Chris,"Was my answer my answer was that the scientists, they found craters full of water on the moon",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher,"Right, they did and they did that through what equipment",,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
269,Chris,Lunar Orbiter I guess,,,210.3,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher," Does anyone else have anything they want to add to this discussion, Oliver",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, What do you want to add,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Right,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, All right,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, Nice job,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
269,Oliver,"Well, actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
269,Oliver,But I just wanted to say thank you so much for listening to all of our answers and helping us understand the difference between,,,,response,0,1,2
269,Oliver, And now I understand what to look for in the text,,,,response,0,1,2
269,Oliver, So I really appreciate it,,,,response,0,1,2
269,Oliver, Thank you so much,,,,response,0,1,2
269,Oliver,What the lunar orbiter did and what the microscope did that was so helpful,,,,response,0,1,2
269,Teacher,"Awesome, thank you everyone",,,,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher, Have a good lunch,,,,remark,0,1,2
269,Teacher,Hi everyone,,,,remark,1,1,2

269,Farrah, Thanks for asking,,,,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher,Awesome,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher, I'm excited to learn some more about water on the moon with you guys today,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,Luis Do you have a question,,,,remark,1,1,2
269,Luis,"Yeah, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Wow, I'm sure you know, tons about space, but we're always open to learning more and more so",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"With that being said, let's talk about all of your answers that you guys gave to the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher," Who wants to volunteer to go first, was what they said for their answer",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Farrah, what, what did you say for this",,,,remark,1,1,2
269,Farrah,"Okay, I said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher, And what made you say that,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Okay, awesome",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher, Farrah,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Farrah,"So they talk about the microscope in, in part, in part three",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
269,Farrah," And they say, the water is microscopic and so you wouldn't be able to see it",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
269,Farrah, If you didn't have a microscope,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Oh, Farrah",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher, I see that you read the text and you were looking for A different machine different types of machines and tools they use,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher, I see how you got that answer,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text and read for a different machine that will allow the scientists to discover water on the moon,,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,Who else would like to share that what they said as their answer,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
269,Jazmin,"I'm ready, I'm ready to go",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher, How about you go,,,,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Okay, Jazmin",,,,remark,1,1,2
269,Jazmin,"Okay, so I said that",,,,response,1,1,2
269,Jazmin,"NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Oh, okay",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher," So first, tell me what made you say that NASA sent a small machine",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Jazmin,Well they say that in part two that they sent a small machine,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher,Great,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text and add more details to your answer,,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher, I can definitely see where you got that because they did send a small machine,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher, What was this small machine called and what was it there to do,,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
269,Jazmin,"Okay, so should I reread it",,,420.2,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Yes, that would be great",,,,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,Who else wants to share their answer and what they got,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
269,Chris,Can I go,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
269,Chris, Can I go,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher, Chris,,,,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,Sure,,,,remark,1,1,2
269,Chris,"Okay, so I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher, What made you choose this answer,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Okay, Chris",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher, So what made you,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Chris, And so I figured the answer should be about the water on the moon,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
269,Chris, It's called water on the moon,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
269,Chris,"Okay, well, so the text is",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
269,Chris, And they found it in the craters like these critters full over water,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"but I, what I want you to do now is I want you to go back to the text and look for specifically a piece of equipment that the scientist used to discover this water on the moon",,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Oh, great",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher," So I can tell that you did the reading and you're really excited to read about the water on the moon,",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Chris,"Okay, looking for equipment",,,310.1,response,1,1,2
269,Chris, Gotcha,,,310.1,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher,Great,,,,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher," Oliver, would you like to go next",,,,remark,1,1,2
269,Oliver,"Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm feeling confused",,,,response,1,1,2
269,Oliver, It's the correct answer,,,,response,1,1,2
269,Oliver," I had the same answer as Farrah, and I still, I don't understand why you told her to look again because I think a microscope",,,,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Oh, okay",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher," So, why, why do you think the microscope is the correct answer",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Oliver,"Well, how can you discover something if it's too small to see",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher,But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the reading and read closely the part where they talk about,,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Okay, I see, I see where you're coming from because you definitely would need a microscope to discover something that's too small to see",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher, So I want you to go back and try and find that machine,,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Discovering water on the moon and the machine that they use to discover it because if you go back and you read that part, you'll actually find that there's a different machine that they use",,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
269,Oliver,Okay I'll do my best,,,420.3,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher,Great,,,,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,And then Luis What did you say for your answer,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
269,Luis,"Ah, I said you need a scientist need oxygen tanks",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher, So you said that the scientists need oxygen tanks and what made you say this,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Okay, awesome",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Luis,"Well, I mean, since I know so much about space",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
269,Luis, They can't do anything if they don't have oxygen tanks and really like lots of equipment and stuff,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
269,Luis, I just know that if if you're gonna have people on the moon,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher, So you were thinking about your own knowledge that you have and what science scientists would need if they were on the moon,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,Right,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"So, that's awesome",,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher, Okay,,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher, But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text reread it and look for equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon,,,420.3,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Awesome Chris, your question",,,,remark,1,1,2
269,Chris, And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like even said and masks and suits,,,,response,1,1,2
269,Chris,"Yeah, well what Luis said it reminded me that I i went to NASA",,,,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"You're right, they do use tons of different equipment",,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,Did you get to find what equipment they use to discover water on the moon,,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
269,Chris,"Oh, like the stuff they say in the story",,,210.3,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,1,1,2
269,Chris,"Okay, so",,,,response,1,1,2
269,Chris, And I see the microscope too,,,,response,1,1,2
269,Chris,"Every night there's like there's two, there's two equipments",,,,response,1,1,2
269,Chris, I see this small machine which Jazmin was talking about,,,,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Oh, okay",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher, So which one if you read further which one is used to discover water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
269,Chris,"Oh,",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
269,Chris,"It doesn't really say the word discover, but",,,,response,1,1,2
269,Chris, It sounds like that's more of a robot kind of thing that might be able to detect the water,,,,response,1,1,2
269,Chris,"If I had to guess, I'd say I probably guessed the orbiter",,,,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher," Chris, so it does",,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Wow, that's a great start",,,130.1,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Um, in that sentence",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher, Can you read through that and then tell me what the lunar orbiter does,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher, It goes on to describe what this lunar orbiter does,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
269,Oliver,"Oh, I'm really sorry I we have to go",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
269,Oliver," But I just wanted to say thank you so much for listening to why we got our answers, instead of just like telling us that our answers were wrong, that really made us feel like like you really heard every single one of us",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
269,Teacher," Thank you, was so nice learning with you guys",,,,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,Great,,,,remark,1,1,2
269,Teacher,"Hi everyone, good to see you again",,,,remark,2,1,2
269,Farrah,Hi,,,,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Alright so what we're going to talk about now,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Did you all get a chance to read through the text again and maybe come up with some new answers about the machine that was used to discover water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Farrah,"Yeah, we all, we all took some time and we read it again",,,150.1,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Great,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, And so what is the answer that you've come up with now,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Would anyone like to share,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
269,Jazmin,"Yeah, I can share",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher,"All right, Jazmin",,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Go ahead,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
269,Jazmin," And I found more details in part two, which is where my answer came from",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
269,Jazmin,"So, you told me to look again and see if I can add more details to my answer",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
269,Jazmin,And so I would say NASA scientists machine called a lunar orbiter which will land at the moon South Pole and look for is deposits in the craters,,,,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher,"Wow, Jazmin",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Looking back at the text and adding more detail,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Good job,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Do you understand why I had you do this,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Jazmin,"Oh no, not really",,,150.1,response,2,1,2
269,Jazmin, I just added more details,,,150.1,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher, So do you understand why your answer might have been not complete last time and now it is,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Great,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
269,Jazmin,Because,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
269,Jazmin,There was more information that I didn't put in,,,,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Right,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Nice job,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Does anyone else want to share maybe they're thinking on what they thought that was the right answer,,,530.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, But now what they know is the right answer,,,530.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Oliver,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
269,Oliver, AND NOW,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
269,Oliver,Okay,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
269,Oliver," Um, so I thought the microscope",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
269,Oliver, IT WAS THE RIGHT ANSWER,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
269,Oliver," Well, now I know about the lunar orbiter is the right answer, but I don't really know how I would have known that I'm without without Jazmin telling us",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher," Okay, so what I want you to do is I want you to right now read me the question that we're trying to figure out",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,"Oh, interesting",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
269,Oliver,Okay um what equipment did scientists use to find water on the moon,,,120.3,response,2,1,2
269,Oliver," Okay, so we're looking for the equipment that scientist us to discover water on the moon",,,120.3,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher,So now what I want you to do is look through the text where it says where it talks about discovering water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Please raise your hand and let me know,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Okay,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, We'll go over together to fit to talk about the equipment that they used,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, And when you get to that part,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Okay,,,120.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Oliver,"Yeah, I'll look",,,120.1,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Does anyone else want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed,,,530.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Great,,,530.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,2,1,2
269,Chris,"Okay, well,",,,,response,2,1,2
269,Chris,"I was, I was thinking about a lot of stuff about NASA and the different types of equipment and the craters and stuff but",,,,response,2,1,2
269,Chris," Well, it has to be equipment and it has to be in the story",,,,response,2,1,2
269,Chris, I would pick out a piece of equipment on like the Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,2,1,2
269,Chris, So I guess if I were to try again,,,,response,2,1,2
269,Chris,You reminded me that the answer,,,,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Great,,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, You do know so many different pieces of equipment that NASA uses,,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher," So, you, you, you're right",,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,But I like that now you're thinking about how your you would look through the story to figure out the question that it was asking,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Did you find anything,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Oliver,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
269,Oliver,"Okay, so, um, I think, a part that you're talking about is the part in part two, where it says about looking for the ice deposits, because I guess the water was not just water",,,120.4,response,2,1,2
269,Oliver, It was ice and they found it as ice ice form,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher," Can you read that whole sentence to me, starting from the beginning",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,"Oh, alright",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
269,Oliver,Yeah okay this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar greater,,,120.3,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher,"Oh, so it says this Lunar Orbiter",,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Will look for deposits,,,120.3,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Oliver,"Yeah, okay",,,150.1,response,2,1,2
269,Oliver, So in the part about where they actually find the water are talking about the small machine,,,150.1,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Oliver,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Nice job,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Yes,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,"Good work, paying close attention to the details of our story",,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Oliver,Yeah,,,310.1,response,2,1,2
269,Oliver," Okay, I think I'm I think if I if I just read it more carefully",,,310.1,response,2,1,2
269,Oliver, Next time I maybe I could find the right answer,,,310.1,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Good job,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,I think definitely you could I think just paying close attention to those small details is really important,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Does anyone else want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading,,,530.1,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Luis,,,120.4,remark,2,1,2
269,Luis,Yeah okay um my answer did not really change like i guess i get i get how you say it has to be in the story and yeah okay they use a lunar orbiter,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher,You're right,,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, If there are astronauts on the moon,,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
269,Luis, Who knows but if there were astronauts there have to be oxygen tanks,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher, You're so right,,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, There needs to be oxygen tags,,,110.2,remark,2,1,2
269,Luis, Maybe they use a microscope,,,120.4,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher,But what is our question asking us,,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
269,Luis,"Okay, why did scientist us to discover why",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher,"Right, what specific equipment",,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Did they use to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,"Did they use their oxygen tanks to just be like, Okay, I'm gonna throw this oxygen tank at the moon's so that it discovered water",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
269,Luis,Okay,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
269,Luis," Well, well, they were using the oxygen tank star for you",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher," They're kind of for something different, aren't they,",,,,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, So they use the oxygen tanks to breathe,,,,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher," Yeah, okay",,,,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, I say what you mean that the oxygen tanks,,,,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,"Okay, okay",,,,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher," But then, I guess",,,,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,"Right, so they're using the oxygen tanks to breathe, breathe, but then they're using a different piece of equipment to actually discover the water on the moon",,,230.3,remark,2,1,2
269,Luis,Yeah yeah,,,230.3,response,2,1,2
269,Luis,"Yeah, I see what you mean",,,,response,2,1,2
269,Luis," Now,",,,,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Do you have a question,,,,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher,"Okay, awesome",,,,remark,2,1,2
269,Teacher, Oliver,,,,remark,2,1,2
269,Oliver,"Um, well, it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say that the way you asked us to think about how our answer changed, like what we used to think",,,,response,2,1,2
269,Oliver, And now what we think that really helped me,,,,response,2,1,2
269,Oliver, So thank you so much,,,,response,2,1,2
269,Oliver, I think I'm going to use that next time too,,,,response,2,1,2
269,Oliver,"At least understand how I could go from a wrong answer to, to a more a more right answer",,,,response,2,1,2
269,Teacher,Great,,,,remark,2,1,2
270,Farrah,Hello,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Farrah, It's good to see you,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Farrah,Hi,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Farrah, Can you repeat what you said you had frozen,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Farrah,"I'm unable to see and hear you at this moment, I think you might have frozen",,,,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,"Oh, sorry about that",,,,remark,0,0,2
270,Farrah,That's okay,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Just finished reading our water on the moon,,,,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,So I see that some of us have said that scientists use lots of equipment,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher, Yes,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher, Luis,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
270,Luis,"I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,230.3,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,"Okay, well, we're just going to talk a little bit more",,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Luis,Okay I love talking about space,,,150.1,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,"Yeah, I do too",,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher, That's our we're gonna all talk a little bit more about this so that we can keep learning,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,So the question that we talked about was what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,"Farrah, you said that people that scientists use like microscope to look really closely",,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,And that's one part of it,,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher, Do you remember any other parts from the reading,,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
270,Farrah,"Well, I read it, I read the whole thing",,,210.3,response,0,0,2
270,Farrah, But that was the piece of equipment that I thought because a microscope is like a tool,,,210.3,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Yeah microscope is like a tool,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Farrah," Oh, I remember one thing I remember",,,110.1,response,0,0,2
270,Farrah, Because in the text,,,110.1,response,0,0,2
270,Farrah,And so that's why I thought it was the answer,,,110.1,response,0,0,2
270,Farrah, It's microscopic and that's why you need the microscope to see it,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Farrah, It's so small,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Farrah,Is isn't the water is really small,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Farrah, I remember that,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Exactly,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,So looking at the reading There's another machine that the scientists use did anyone remember what that other machine that they used,,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,0,0,2
270,Jazmin,"Well, I said that NASA sent a small machine",,,,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Do you remember what it was called,,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
270,Jazmin,"It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter",,,210.3,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,"Yeah, exactly",,,110.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Who remembers what the lunar orbiter looks for,,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
270,Jazmin,"Um, well, I think it looks for the for the water",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Yeah,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Chris, That's what I said that the scientists found craters full of water,,,110.1,response,0,0,2
270,Chris,Was my answer,,,110.1,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,I see,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher," But what was, what was this water like, was it like like a cup of water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,"Or like, What state was this water found in?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Luis, I know,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
270,Luis,"Oh, I know the answer to this one",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,What is it Luis,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Luis, It was ice,,,120.4,response,0,0,2
270,Luis,If ice,,,120.4,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Yeah so wasn't just water,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher, It was ice,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher," So here on earth you might find like giant lakes, full of water, but on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,0,0,2
270,Farrah,"I got that there was the Lunar Orbiter and stuff, but I still don't understand why my answer was wrong",,,,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,So Farrah,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher, I would say that your answer wasn't wrong at all,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher, They also use the machine called the Lunar Orbiter,,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,You just needed a little bit more so in addition to using a microscope,,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
270,Farrah, So it's both,,,130.3,response,0,0,2
270,Farrah,"Oh, OK",,,130.3,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Exactly,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Farrah,Okay,,,110.1,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,"So,",,,,remark,0,0,2
270,Farrah,Did they use them,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Farrah," And that was the Word, and the question discover, but I feel like you have to see it first",,,,response,0,0,2
270,Farrah, Did they use the microscope to on to see the water because I feel like I feel like you have to see it before you can discover it,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,That's a great question,,,,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher, So,,,,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,So the reason that we're thinking about the microscope is because the water on the moon was microscopic,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher, What do you think,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,So when you think of microscopic,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Farrah, You can't even see it,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
270,Farrah,"Oh, like so tiny",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher, So if we're thinking about the water found on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher," Are we thinking about, like,",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,"Are we thinking about, like, huge craters filled with water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Oliver," I think, I think it was awesome",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
270,Oliver,"I heard what Chris said, but I don't think he was right",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
270,Oliver," Chris said full of water, but",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
270,Oliver, Like Farrah,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Oliver,I think it's so small cause,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Oliver, I also said a microscope,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher, So,,,,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,I see,,,,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher, How big do you think the craters were?,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Chris when you've said that you found craters full of water,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Chris,They were pretty big because they're on the moon and stuff and and I actually went to NASA,,,230.1,response,0,0,2
270,Chris,So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher," So even though we're on the moon these ice deposits were in a big crater, but the ice deposits are little",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Chris,"Yeah, so I guess I was picturing like all this water but really it was just like, like a little, little ice deposits",,,150.1,response,0,0,2
270,Chris,Exactly,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Chris, That's different than what I thought in my mind,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Chris, Okay,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher," Because at first I will read something and we'll think will think it's a big crater, because it is a big crater, but then we'll have to talk about our thoughts of it",,,420.3,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,"Yeah, that's why sometimes we have to talk about our thoughts",,,420.3,remark,0,0,2
270,Chris,Yeah,,,420.3,response,0,0,2
270,Chris,Makes a lot of sense,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Jazmin,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher, So you said NASA sent like a small machine,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
270,Jazmin,"Yes, a small machine",,,230.3,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Yeah,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher, So what would you need a small machine for what did they use it for,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Jazmin, That's the word they use in paragraph two,,,230.1,response,0,0,2
270,Jazmin,"What it says, then you start to investigate",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,So they used it to investigate,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher, what makes you think that it's small,,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Jazmin, They say they say NASA sent a small machine,,,230.1,response,0,0,2
270,Jazmin,Just because they use that word in the sentence,,,230.1,response,0,0,2
270,Jazmin," So I was just, I was using that word because it was in the story",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Is that makes sense,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,When you find when you think of this like small machine and you're finding the ice,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
270,Teacher,"What, sorry",,,,remark,0,0,2
270,Jazmin,It's called it's an orbiter,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Jazmin, And that makes me think that it like it goes in orbit like like it's kind of goes around the moon because we learned in science that that's what it means,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Exactly,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
270,Oliver,Excuse me,,,110.1,response,0,0,2
270,Oliver,"Yes, I'm really sorry, but I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch",,,,response,0,0,2
270,Oliver,"I just wanted to say thank you so much for coming here today and for helping us talk through all of our answers because like you said, sometimes we have to talk about it",,,,response,0,0,2
270,Oliver,To help us kind of like think about what we were thinking in our head and hear what other people were thinking in their head,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Oliver, And so it was really helpful just to talk about our answers with you today,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,0,2
270,Oliver,Thank you,,,,response,0,0,2
270,Teacher, Does anyone know what a partial answer means?,,,210.1,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"Okay, so I put all of us into this group because everyone here has a partial answer",,,210.1,remark,1,0,2
270,Farrah,"Well, this is just a guess, but it sounds like maybe it's like you have part of it, but not all of it",,,210.1,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher,Luis What did you want to add,,,,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"Yeah, I like how you use part of the word partial to break it down into something that you already knew",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
270,Luis,"Um, yeah",,,,response,1,0,2
270,Luis," Well, I should be being in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher, Because what's cool about partial answers,,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"Well, Luis This group is actually going to work together to try and learn even more from each other",,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, And if we put some of these answers together and we think about each other's way of thinking we can get more complete answers,,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,Is that everyone has different partial answers,,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, And what you're going to do is you're going to walk answers,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, So you're going to share each other's answers,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"So what I'm going to ask you all to do now is, you're going to turn to your partner",,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"So let's say Farrah, if you are working with Chris",,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, You two would share your answers with each other,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"And then what we're going to do is we're going to read through what we read before, but this time we're going to do some close reading",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, And we're going to make some annotations on our work,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher," So today, what would I want you to underline is where your partner found their answer and something that you think you could add to their answer to make it a more complete answer",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,So that means we're going to underline things that we find,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher," I'm going to go to each group individually, and we're going to discuss your answers a little bit",,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,So as you're working,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,Does everyone understand these instructions,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
270,Luis,"Yeah, I think so",,,150.1,response,1,0,2
270,Luis, So we're talking and sharing and then rereading to find our partners answers,,,150.1,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher, And in addition to finding your partner's answer you're going to also look for things that you would add to their answer,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,Yes,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Luis,"Oh yeah, okay",,,210.3,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher, And then I'm going to go to each of you individually,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"Okay, so go ahead and get started",,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"Okay, Farrah",,,,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, So what did what was Oliver's answer,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,Let's start with your answer,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
270,Farrah,"Okay Oliver said, Well, we actually had the same answer, which was that it was the microscope that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher, Is there anything that you think you might want to add to that,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,I see,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, And as you're reading,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Farrah,"Oh, well, no, not really",,,210.3,response,1,0,2
270,Farrah," I mean, we have the same answer",,,210.3,response,1,0,2
270,Farrah, And I guess I still don't understand why that answers wrong,,,210.3,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher," The, the exerpt and then we're gonna look at it together and see what we can find",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, Let's look a little bit closer at the reading,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher," So I'm going to direct you to one part of the paragraph, not the paragraph",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, Okay,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"Okay, that's fine",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
270,Farrah,Sure,,,210.4,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"Okay, so the part that I'm going direct us to is",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,The second paragraph,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"Where it says, NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, What do you think it talks about what's the main thing,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,In this paragraph,,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
270,Farrah,"Well, I guess it talks about",,,210.4,response,1,0,2
270,Farrah,How the lunar orbiter was looking for ice and how there's not that much of it like it's really small,,,,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"Yeah, I see that you're really getting this idea that there wasn't a lot of ice on the moon",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"I'm what I would like you to see, though, is a little bit more than just how much water there is but also what was looking for the water",,,410.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,   And think about if there were any other tools that were used,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,I'm going to have you look at this paragraph again,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Oliver,"Okay, yeah",,,420.3,response,1,0,2
270,Oliver, You want both of us to look at that again and I will look up part two for more tools,,,420.3,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,And then I'm gonna get back to you,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher," While, Oliver and Farrah are doing that",,,,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,Them,,,,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, Let's go over to Luis,,,,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"Luis, you're working with Jazmin and Chris right?",,,,remark,1,0,2
270,Luis," Yeah, we were working all together, the three of us",,,,response,1,0,2
270,Luis,Uh huh,,,,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher,Perfect,,,,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, So whose answer are you looking at,,,,remark,1,0,2
270,Luis,"Okay, I looked at on Jazmin's answer and she said that NASA sent a small machine",,,,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher,Okay,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, And as you're reading,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, What are you able to see in the reading that you might want to add?,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Luis,"Well, I was thinking that like we could add some other equipment like oxygen tanks, because that was my answer",,,210.3,response,1,0,2
270,Luis, And I'm Chris was talking about how he wants to NASA,,,210.3,response,1,0,2
270,Luis, And so he knows that there's like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff,,,210.3,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"I'm really glad that you that this group was able to make some real world connections, based on your past experiences",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, That's a really good skill to be able to have,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"What I'd like you to do, though, is look a little bit closer in the reading",,,430.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, I want you to also find what exact things what details are in the reading that shows what tools they use,,,430.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher, So as you're reading and you're making those real world connections,,,430.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"So even though we know that they use things like oxygen tanks, that's not specifically in the reading",,,410.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,So we want to find what it says in the reading,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Luis,Oh ok ok so cuz it's because it's not in the story,,,420.3,response,1,0,2
270,Luis, That's why it's not a whole answer,,,420.3,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher,Exactly,,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
270,Luis,"Oh, OK, I see that make sense",,,110.4,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"Yeah, so go ahead and keep reading and see if you can find what details are in the reading that might answer this question",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,"So, Jazmin",,,,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,Which one were you looking at,,,,remark,1,0,2
270,Jazmin, And I think that's not quite a whole answer because he doesn't actually say anything about equipment,,,,response,1,0,2
270,Jazmin, Scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,,response,1,0,2
270,Jazmin,"Okay, well, I looked at Chris's answer, he said",,,,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher,I can see how you're starting to put together what we're talking about here about partial answers and why sometimes we need to just add a little bit more to them,,,210.3,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,I'm going to answer does question really quick and then I'll be right back,,,,remark,1,0,2
270,Oliver,"Yeah, actually I wanted to just say it's time for the next group",,,,response,1,0,2
270,Oliver," But thank you so much, because you really hope to think about what makes a partial answer and the fact that we could keep on going back to the text and look for more to make our answer more complete",,,,response,1,0,2
270,Teacher,I'm glad you're able to see that,,,,remark,1,0,2
270,Teacher,Start Simulation,,,,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,"Okay, so let's continue reading through and seeing what else we found that we can add to our answers",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, I'm gonna keep talking to Jazmin,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,So continue from where we left off,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,"So, Jazmin",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, You were looking at Chris's answer,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Jazmin,"Chris Chris, and he said, scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,150.1,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher,"And when you're reading through what makes you, where do you think that came from in the reading?",,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Jazmin,"Oh well, I wasn't quite sure, because when I was looking at it, it sounded to me like it was just a little bit of water, but maybe he was thinking about the craters, like in part one, it says craters",,,230.2,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher,Yeah Luis What's up,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
270,Luis," And that's, I just wanted to remind you, and also you do that",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
270,Luis, My dad is actually an astronaut,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
270,Luis,"Yeah, I just have something to say",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher,"Wow, that's very interesting even but I'd really like you to focus on The article right now and then you can tell me more about that later",,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Luis,Okay,,,110.1,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,"So, Jazmin",,,,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, Let's see what we can add to it to make it more complete,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,"I see how you saw in the reading that they called them craters, but there was only a little bit of water",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,So now that you see where we got our answer,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,So go ahead and look into the reading and see what you might add to the answer to make it from a partial answer to a complete answer and then I'll come right back to you,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Jazmin,"Oh, OK",,,420.2,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher,So Chris,,,,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,I think the last one,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, So you were looking at Luis's answer right,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Chris,"He looked at Luis's answer, and he was talking about the oxygen tanks and stuff, but it sounds like that's not really the right answer",,,150.1,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher, Where do you think Luis got the answer of the oxygen tanks,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,So as you're reading,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Chris, So here's the thing,,,230.2,response,2,0,2
270,Chris," So we were talking about it because we both know about space, but then when I looked at the at the story again, it didn't actually say anything about oxygen tanks or even like astronauts really",,,230.2,response,2,0,2
270,Chris,"Yeah, well",,,230.2,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher, So that's what's called like texts to real world connections,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,Where we found that from is from outside now,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, So that's a really good skill to have,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher," So, although this answer is right astronauts and to use that what we want to see us in the text",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher," This one is asking for us to see in the text, what tools were used",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,But when we're looking at our question,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, What exactly did NASA use?,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, We will,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Chris,Right,,,210.2,response,2,0,2
270,Chris," Yeah, so that was more like Jazmin's answer cuz she said the small machine",,,210.2,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher,Yeah,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher," And then, as we're looking at Jazmin's answer to what do you think we could add to it",,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Chris, So maybe we could say the lunar orbiter looked for ice deposits,,,420.2,response,2,0,2
270,Chris, Okay,,,420.2,response,2,0,2
270,Chris," Hello, like it says that the lunar orbiter will land up the South Pole and look for ice deposits",,,420.2,response,2,0,2
270,Chris,Oh well,,,420.2,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher,"Yeah, I see how you're using the text and rereading and finding more information that's really great",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,So I'm going to suggest that your group keeps looking through and looking at each other's answer and seeing what you could add to each one individually,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,I'm going to go back over to Oliver and savannas group,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, So keep working,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Chris,"Okay, okay",,,150.1,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher,"So, Oliver and Farrah",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, What did you find when you were reading,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
270,Oliver, But there was one other tool,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
270,Oliver,"Okay, well, um, before we have said down microscope, and I think we still bought kind of think about microscope might be right",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
270,Oliver, And that was the Lunar Orbiter,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher,"Oh, where did you find that in the text",,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Oliver,"To paragraph two,",,,230.2,response,2,0,2
270,Oliver,Like the first sentence of it,,,,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,"Yeah, so I see where you're looking",,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,So this is a really good thing that you were just able to do so when you were rereading you're able to see where you found your answer,,,510.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, And you were able to find another part that you could add to it,,,510.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, I'm going to suggest that you look again at where you found your first answer,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,Now that you've been able to add to your answer,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,"You found your first answer in paragraph three, correct?",,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Oliver,Yeah paragraph 3 is about the microscope,,,230.2,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher,I see,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, So when you read your paragraph again I want you to think about what exactly this paragraph is talking about,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, So,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,Look again and try again and see if you if it's actually talking about a microscope or if it's talking about something a little different,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
270,Oliver, Got it,,,420.3,response,2,0,2
270,Oliver," Yeah, okay",,,420.3,response,2,0,2
270,Oliver,Okay so reread part three,,,420.3,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher, Were you getting the same things as Oliver since you're working together,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,And Farrah,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
270,Farrah, Yeah,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
270,Farrah,"Yeah, we found those two pieces of equipment",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
270,Farrah," The Lunar Orbiter and the microscope, and it also talked about a cup like measuring the water",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher, You found that in paragaph two as well right?,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,"Oh, I see",,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,"For you Farrah, what I want you to do is try again look at paragraph two, and see what they're talking about when they're talking about the cup and maybe why they mentioned that",,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
270,Farrah,Okay,,,420.3,response,2,0,2
270,Farrah,I'll look at that,,,,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,"So, Jazmin Luis Chris",,,,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, Let's look a little closer at Chris's answer,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, So what did you all find when you were reading again and reading closely to see where Chris got his answer and what you might Luis yeah,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,Since we've looked at Jazmin's answer and Luis's answer,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
270,Luis,"Okay, so, um, I don't know where Chris got his answer because if you read the story, it's pretty clear that there weren't any craters full of water or anything",,,230.2,response,2,0,2
270,Luis,"It just says they were there was water like deep in the craters and so I would fix Chris's answer, I would say, um, that the scientists, they found only a little bit of water and it was actually ice and they found it in the craters with on the lunar orbiter",,,,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher, So I can definitely see where Chris got his answer because like you said the paragraph says that this that the walk,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, The ice is found in the crater,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,I see,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,"so I can definitely see where he found his answer, but other than that",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, We just picture like giant things,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,So when we picture craters,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher, Go ahead,,,,remark,2,0,2
270,Teacher,One second,,,,remark,2,0,2
270,Oliver,"Oh god, I'm so sorry to have to say that I looked at the clock and we really have to go on a launch now but I went on to say this was so helpful because you helped us on",,,,response,2,0,2
270,Oliver,Think about like how to keep thinking about our answer and keep going back and see why is this the best answer or why is something else,,,,response,2,0,2
270,Oliver, The best answer,,,,response,2,0,2
270,Oliver, And so by looking at the text again,,,,response,2,0,2
270,Oliver,"And asking ourselves questions that's going to help us make sure we have a fall, and not a partial answer",,,,response,2,0,2
270,Teacher,Exactly,,,,remark,2,0,2

271,Teacher,"Go ahead, Luis",,,,remark,0,1,3
271,Luis,"Well, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher,"Well, good, then you can help maybe our other friends understand some more about the water on the moon, like the text that we read, so I'm going to ask a quick question",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,For everybody so feel free to answer,,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher, And the question will be what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and use the information that you learn from in the text,,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,0,1,3
271,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine,,,,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher, Did they give a name for what the machine was called,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,Good,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher,Good,,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher, I like that you went back in the text and dug a little deeper to see if there was more information,,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,Who else would like to share,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher, Good job,,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
271,Chris,I'll share,,,310.1,response,0,1,3

271,Chris,"Yeah, well,",,,,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher,"Go ahead,",,,,remark,0,1,3
271,Chris,Scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher, And do we know what craters are,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,Wow,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Chris,They're like big on the kind of hard to describe,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
271,Chris, I don't know,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
271,Chris, But it's like it's like a whole but with a bottom and it's above ground instead of underground,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
271,Chris, They're hard to describe,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher," Yeah, I'm looking in the text now and I see that it describes craters as dark places where the sun never shines",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,That was a great description,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Chris,"Oh yeah, that's a good description too",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher, Who else would like to share what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,Thank you,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,0,1,3
271,Farrah,"Well, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher, Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,"So you are right, they probably would need a microscope to see anything that's so tiny that you can't see with your naked eye",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,"Well, so we're looking for what equipment",,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,So if we look back in our text,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,But we're looking to see what equipment they use to discover the water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher, Maybe someone can read from the text,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher, If you have it handy line that would indicate what equipment was used for science to discover water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher, What do you think,,,,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,0,1,3
271,Oliver, I Farrah,,,,response,0,1,3
271,Oliver,"Okay, well, actually I had the same answer",,,,response,0,1,3
271,Oliver," And so I found out in paragraph three, and if you look there and says,",,,,response,0,1,3
271,Oliver,The water they found as microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it,,,,response,0,1,3
271,Oliver," If you are looking straight at it, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope",,,,response,0,1,3
271,Oliver, So I think that's what they use because you have to see something if you are going to find it,,,,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher,"You're right, you wouldn't need the microscope in order to look at the water, but in order to find the water",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,What do we think they used,,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,They said something about investigating what did they used to investigate,,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
271,Oliver,To investigate,,,210.2,response,0,1,3
271,Oliver, Let me look for that water in the story,,,210.2,response,0,1,3
271,Oliver,"Well, it says investigate in part two",,,,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher,"Yeah, and member Jazmin had said that they sent a small machine to investigate",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,"So do you think maybe they sent this machine to investigate and then once they found the water, they were able to use a microscope to see the tiny pieces of water that like it",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher," The text says if you look straight at it, we wouldn't be able to see it",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Oliver,So you're saying like they use thought the lunar orbiter first,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
271,Oliver," After that, on the astronauts to use the microscope, just see it",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher, Does anybody agree,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,That's what I think,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,Chris you have something to say,,,,remark,0,1,3
271,Chris," Well, I went to NASA",,,,response,0,1,3
271,Chris,Yo,,,,response,0,1,3
271,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher,You're right,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher," Yes, scientists that work with NASA need a lot of equipment to be able to be able to safely do their",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher, If they're leaving our earth,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,Expeditions they need oxygen like Chris said they need the proper space equipment,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher, Chris,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher, That's a great point,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,These are all pieces of equipment that scientists might need if they're doing investigations,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,"Luis You said you know a lot about space, you want to share anything else",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
271,Luis,"Yeah, I actually, I do because I know but the word orbit means like vehicles around something",,,110.2,response,0,1,3
271,Luis," So like if there weren't even astronauts, they wouldn't really need a microscope",,,110.2,response,0,1,3
271,Luis, And so I'm thinking maybe that that there weren't asked astronaut spec has it doesn't even say the word astronaut anywhere in the story,,,110.2,response,0,1,3
271,Luis, But that's kind of funny to think about,,,,response,0,1,3
271,Luis,The astronauts walking around the whole moon holding a little microscope,,,,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher, Do we see anywhere in the text that it says that there was an astronaut present,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher," It says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher, So I'm Luis is right,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,That is kind of funny,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher," I think that um Chris, you were absolutely right that if an astronaut got sent",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,I don't see that either,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher, But now that I'm reading the text just like Luis said I din't pick up on this before either,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,"To look at the moon, they would definitely need the appropriate protection to be able to do so",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,  It doesn't look like There was an astronaut,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher," But I really liked that we were thinking maybe the next step, maybe in the next step would be to bring an astronaut",,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,So we probably didn't need the equipment and and oxygen tanks and masks and things like that,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,"So I like that we were thinking, did anyone else want to add something?",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,"What do you say, Chris",,,,remark,0,1,3
271,Chris,Maybe they'll send astronauts back after,,,,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher,Maybe,,,,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher," Yeah, I can",,,,remark,0,1,3
271,Chris,Get the water,,,,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher,"Yeah, maybe I guess we'll have to wait and see",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher," Right, yes Oliver",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
271,Oliver,"Um, well, I just looked up a clock and it's time for us to go to lunch",,,110.1,response,0,1,3
271,Oliver,But I just want to say thank you so much for helping us understand how they use the different equipment,,,,response,0,1,3
271,Oliver,"And to look for that word investigate to find the best piece of equipment for the for a question but also knowing how they use, like all the other kinds of equipment that we had also said",,,,response,0,1,3
271,Oliver," Also know what the right answer was, so thank you so much",,,,response,0,1,3
271,Oliver,"And that really helped us feel like our answers, where we're good, an important one",,,,response,0,1,3
271,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher," Oliver, I hope you have a lunch",,,,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher, And thank you for saying that,,,,remark,0,1,3
271,Teacher,"Hello friends, how are we",,,,remark,1,1,3
271,Farrah, It's good to see you,,,,response,1,1,3
271,Farrah,"Oh, hi",,,,response,1,1,3
271,Teacher," Okay, so today we are talking about our article that we read about water on the moon",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, And I see that you've all answered your questions here,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,You too,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,Luis Do you have a question,,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
271,Luis,"Um, yeah, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,150.1,response,1,1,3
271,Teacher,"Wow, I'm sure you know a lot of space",,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher," But let's go over what our discussion question was, and that question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,So let's just say for this question,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher," It says, What equipment do we know what equipment means",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,"And Luis I see that you wrote scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Luis,Yeah yeah equipment like the stuff he used to do something,,,230.3,response,1,1,3
271,Teacher, Do you think that oxygen tanks were used to discover the water,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, So they're asking what tool,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, Scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,"Yeah, it's kind of like a tool",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,So Luis You answered equipment like oxygen tanks,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Luis," I mean, they might not use the oxygen tanks to discover the water, but they would need to have oxygen tanks",,,210.2,response,1,1,3
271,Luis,"Well, it's like, um, maybe",,,210.2,response,1,1,3
271,Luis,On if there were astronauts there because otherwise they couldn't even get to discovering the water because they wouldn't have any oxygen and they wouldn't be alive and they couldn't discover the water,,,,response,1,1,3
271,Teacher,Absolutely,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, But the oxygen tanks wouldn't be a tool to discover the water,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher," If there were astronauts there, they would need oxygen",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, That is correct,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,So I think we need to do a little bit more digging into the reading and maybe we can look and see if it shows says anywhere in our reading what equipment was used,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,So I don't think it would be oxygen tanks,,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, I do think those would be helpful,,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, But I don't think that that is exactly what the scientists used to discover the water,,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, Luis and look and see if you see anything about equipment,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,So maybe you could go back in the text,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Luis, Yeah,,,420.3,response,1,1,3
271,Luis,"Um, yeah, okay, I'll read it",,,420.3,response,1,1,3
271,Teacher,"Okay, I think that's a great idea",,,,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, You also said that NASA sent a small machine,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,"Now, let's see, Jazmin",,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,Great response,,,110.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Jazmin,Thank you,,,110.2,response,1,1,3
271,Jazmin," Yeah, I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,110.2,response,1,1,3
271,Teacher,"Well, your answer is not entirely wrong your answer was on track, but we're missing some of those details",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,That article had a lot of detail about what that's all machine was and maybe how it helped to discover the water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,So I think it would also be helpful for you to go back into the text and look and see if you can find any more details about that small machine that they named in our text,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.3,response,1,1,3
271,Teacher, Let's see,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, I really liked how you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,"Now, let's see",,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, I'm Farrah,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Farrah,"Yeah, I knew I was looking for equipment and so that's why I found the microscope",,,230.3,response,1,1,3
271,Teacher,"Yeah, and that's a great microscope helped us to look at the water, but do you think it helped us to discover that water",,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Farrah,"Well, I mean, how could you discover something if it's too small to see",,,210.3,response,1,1,3
271,Farrah, You have to be able to see to find it,,,210.3,response,1,1,3
271,Teacher, And I really like that you brought up that point,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,You are absolutely right,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,But if we Investigate a little bit more into the text we might see that there was something that they used before they got to a microscope,,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,Before they even got to look at the water they needed a sense of if there was water and so they sent something into the moon or on to the moon to help them discover that water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,"and so do you think that if we look back in our texts, there's something that says  A piece of equipment that helped us to find that water before we used a microscope",,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Farrah,You want me to read it again or,,,210.3,response,1,1,3
271,Farrah,"Well, I mean, I heard Jazmin, talk about the small machine and stuff",,,,response,1,1,3
271,Teacher,"Yeah, so I see I'm looking at the text to and I in our texts that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,"So the first thing that the scientists did was investigate, they needed to investigate the Moon before they could even go in and see anything else",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,So I think maybe our first step would be to think about what scientists did to prepare themselves what scientists knew or didn't know before they got to the Moon before they got some use a microscope to look at their water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, Yes,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, Chris,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
271,Chris," So I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but also masks and suits",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
271,Chris, So I went to NASA,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
271,Chris,"Yeah, okay",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
271,Teacher, Do we see in the text anywhere that there was any astronauts sent to the moon,,,130.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, Chris and can someone remind me,,,130.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, Does anyone remember,,,130.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,"Yes, that's a very good point as well",,,130.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Chris,"Oh,",,,130.2,response,1,1,3
271,Chris,I don't think it's the word astronaut like and me were,,,,response,1,1,3
271,Teacher,So it does say the word astronaut and it says that water could be valuable for astronauts if there were astronauts present because they could drink that water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,But it doesn't say that they sent any astronauts to the moon to find the water so Chris,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, That astronauts would need those masks and suits to do this,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, I really appreciate that point and you are correct,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher," So we don't want to focus on what they would need, we're just focusing on what the machine needed",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,But there weren't any astronauts present,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
271,Chris," So it was like, Oh, it was an unmanned craft",,,410.2,response,1,1,3
271,Chris,"Oh, okay",,,410.2,response,1,1,3
271,Chris," Oh, I learned that word at NASA to",,,410.2,response,1,1,3
271,Teacher, Do you have any suggestions on your answer how we could improve upon your answer,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,"Oh wow, I'm so impressed that you know that that's awesome Chris,",,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,"Luis, and Jazmin",,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,"Go ahead, Jazmin",,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
271,Jazmin,"Okay, so you said, I have to look for more detail",,,120.4,response,1,1,3
271,Jazmin, So first it said that it was called the Lunar Orbiter and then also it said it looked for the ice deposits and the craters,,,120.4,response,1,1,3
271,Jazmin," And so I found about this machine, a few things",,,120.4,response,1,1,3
271,Teacher, Yes Oliver,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher, I like that you went back into the text and you found specific details to share with us,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
271,Teacher,Good,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
271,Oliver,"On so it's our it's time for us to goal right now, but I wanted to say thank you for paying attention to each one of our answers and giving each one of us something specific to think about and talk about",,,310.1,response,1,1,3
271,Oliver,That really made us feel like you heard us and could help each and every one of us,,,,response,1,1,3

271,Luis,I do,,,110.3,response,2,1,3
271,Teacher,So let me ask you a question,,,,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,"And I see that you answered scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher, Luis,,,,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,Let's take a look in the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,In the text,,,230.2,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher, Do you see anywhere that it says that the oxygen tanks helped to discover the water,,,230.2,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher, You can go back in the text,,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,Why don't you take a quick minute and think about that,,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher," And let's see if we see anything that says that oxygen tanks were An equipment used to discover the water, let's take a minute because that is the question",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,"The question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the moon, the water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,So we want to make sure to understand the whole question,,,420.1,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher, So we understand what they're asking us,,,420.1,remark,2,1,3
271,Luis,"Okay, yeah, I'll read it",,,420.1,response,2,1,3
271,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,3

271,Teacher,Do you notice anything else about the equipment that they mentioned,,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
271,Jazmin,Like about the machine or about other equipment,,,210.3,response,2,1,3
271,Teacher, Did you mean that this small machine helped to discover the water on the moon,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,So you said that they had sent a small machine,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
271,Jazmin," Yeah, so that was my answer",,,230.1,response,2,1,3
271,Jazmin,Yes,,,230.1,response,2,1,3
271,Jazmin, Yeah,,,230.1,response,2,1,3
271,Teacher,"Yeah, so that's a great answer",,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher, But I'm wondering if you can give me any more details for that,,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,You think that you would refer to the text,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
271,Jazmin,Yeah,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
271,Jazmin," And it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it will land at the mood South Pole and look for ice deposits and the polar crate",,,,response,2,1,3
271,Jazmin,"So yeah, so I found it in part two",,,,response,2,1,3
271,Teacher,Good,,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher," Our question was, what, what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher," And you said, NASA sent a small machine",,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher, So now if we look at your answer to our question,,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher, Do you think that there's a way that you could improve upon your answer,,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,Looking at that question now and looking at what you just read,,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher, We read in the text,,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
271,Jazmin,"Well, I guess I could put more more like from the text, so I could add",,,210.3,response,2,1,3
271,Jazmin,Like,,,,response,2,1,3
271,Jazmin,The name and how it works,,,,response,2,1,3
271,Teacher, I think that's a great idea to help us expand upon our answer to add some details from the text to show that we truly understand what we're reading,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,I love that idea,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher," Hi, Farrah",,,,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher, Okay,,,,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher, Jazmin,,,,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,I think that's a great idea,,,,remark,2,1,3
271,Farrah,"Hi, um, I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,,response,2,1,3
271,Teacher, Can you just clarify for me when you said you'd need a microscope to look really closely,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,"Okay, let's take a look at your answer",,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher," What do you mean, what are they looking closely at",,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher, So you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and Farrah,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
271,Farrah,"So they're looking closely to find the water because it says that it's microscopic the water is so they're looking at the, the really small water with the microscope",,,230.1,response,2,1,3
271,Teacher,"Yes, but let me ask you a further question",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher, Could they just send a microscope to space and find water,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,Or do you think that they need some sort of machine to discover the water,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
271,Farrah,Is this about like how there's no astronauts,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
271,Farrah,So they need a machine,,,,response,2,1,3
271,Teacher, They use some sort of other equipment,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,"Well, so if we refer back to the text I do see your point about them needing a microscope in order to see the water, but before they get a microscope",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
271,Farrah,Jazmin was talking about that machine that looked in the craters,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
271,Teacher, And so just like I mentioned to Luis and Jazmin is we want to make sure that we're reading our whole question,,,420.1,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher, Good,,,420.1,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,Yes,,,420.1,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,So we know that they needed the microscope to analyze it and to better see it but they needed something to help them  Understand if they're even was water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,And our question is about the equipment that scientists used to discover the water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,"Oliver, do you want to add something",,,,remark,2,1,3
271,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,,response,2,1,3
271,Oliver," Okay, I think I can help Farrah out because remember how",,,,response,2,1,3
271,Oliver,"Like if there aren't astronauts, then who would even be holding the microscope",,,,response,2,1,3
271,Oliver," But now I see that, like, yeah, you said you can't just send a microscope to the moon",,,,response,2,1,3
271,Oliver,Because like I picked that same answer to,,,,response,2,1,3
271,Oliver, You have done something first,,,,response,2,1,3
271,Teacher, Do we see that they said they sent astronauts in the text,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,Yes,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher," And so, Oliver, did they send astronauts",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher, So what did they send,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,"No, no",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
271,Oliver,"Um, so it has to be that Lunar Orbiter",,,210.4,response,2,1,3
271,Oliver," Yeah, I thought I was the microscope to Farrah, but now I changed my mind",,,210.4,response,2,1,3
271,Teacher,"I think that's a great point, though, Oliver is when we go back and we look into our texts and we remember our question we might better analyze what the question is actually asking us",,,420.1,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,So if the question that asked us what what equipment did scientists use to better look at water we would absolutely say the microscope,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,"So I really liked that you went back in and saw some details, Oliver",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher, And so that machine that lunar orbiter that we talked about helped us to understand if there was water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
271,Teacher,But first we needed to even understand if there was water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
271,Oliver,"Oh, it's time for us to go to lunch",,,310.1,response,2,1,3
271,Oliver, This was really fun class,,,310.1,response,2,1,3
271,Oliver, I'm so sorry,,,310.1,response,2,1,3
271,Oliver,But I just wanted to say on before we go,,,,response,2,1,3
271,Oliver," Thank you so much, because you helped us see whether our answers actually connected to the question arm and that's why I changed my answer because I realized it didn't actually answer the question",,,,response,2,1,3
271,Oliver, Thank you so much for helping I see that,,,,response,2,1,3
271,Teacher,Thank you Oliver,,,,remark,2,1,3

272,Teacher,"Teacher:Okay Luis I want to hear what you have to say it's so important, but I was still asking Farrah if she could build to her answer because I want to know if there's more to the article than just water on the moon",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
272,Teacher,What else was the article about Farrah,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
272,Farrah,"Well, it was also about the fact that the moon is a desert and",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
272,Farrah,The different the tool that they had to use when they found the water,,,,response,0,0,3
272,Teacher,Okay and and,,,,remark,0,0,3
272,Farrah,And my answer was the microscope that they use the microscope,,,,response,0,0,3
272,Teacher,"Okay, friends, usually in my classes when students agree we go like this, but if you agree",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
272,Teacher, Right,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3

272,Luis,"And so, for the question",,,,response,0,0,3
272,Luis, I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,,response,0,0,3

272,Luis,And they have to have the whole of rocket ship and everything that they need to prepare for that,,,,response,0,0,3
272,Luis," Oh, it's so cool to watch rocket launches and to learn about all the astronauts",,,,response,0,0,3
272,Teacher, I love space to I want us to put on our science minds and only think about the article that we read,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
272,Teacher, So in the article that we read a read it out loud for us,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
272,Teacher,Great,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
272,Teacher, The Moon is a desert,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
272,Teacher,It is water on the Moon,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
272,Teacher,Scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
272,Teacher,This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
272,Teacher,I'm going to pause in read the discussion question the discussion question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,3
272,Teacher, That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
272,Teacher,"Okay, I'm going to continue reading number three",,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
272,Teacher," If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
272,Teacher,The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
272,Teacher,The discussion question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,3

272,Teacher," So, Farrah",,,,remark,1,0,3
272,Teacher,Yep,,,,remark,1,0,3
272,Teacher, I'm going to work with you,,,,remark,1,0,3
272,Teacher,So I can see,,,,remark,1,0,3
272,Teacher,"That your answer reads, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
272,Farrah,"Yeah, exactly",,,110.1,response,1,0,3
272,Teacher, If you notice the word so you can explain,,,230.2,remark,1,0,3
272,Teacher,And where did you get that idea from within the text,,,230.2,remark,1,0,3

272,Teacher,I can see this is that you're talking about the water they found is microscopic can you continue reading that paragraph,,,120.3,remark,1,0,3
272,Farrah,Okay,,,120.3,response,1,0,3
272,Farrah," Um, so the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.3,response,1,0,3
272,Teacher," And I love that answer, because I can see that you noticed that the sentence had a scientific tool in it",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3

272,Oliver,Not yet i'm i right now,,,150.1,response,2,0,3
272,Teacher,Do you think that there are more or different kinds of tools that scientists use on the moon,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
272,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
272,Oliver," Um, there's definitely other things like I was working with Luis, and he has had his answer was the oxygen tanks",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
272,Teacher,So did your original answer change in any way after working with Luis,,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
272,Oliver,"No, no, because, um, I don't really think the oxygen tanks have anything to do with discovering water",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
272,Teacher, And why not,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher,Okay,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3

272,Teacher,What,,,,remark,2,0,3
272,Oliver,"Oh, what were you saying",,,,response,2,0,3
272,Teacher,Once scientists are on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher, They use more equipment even more to make more discoveries,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher,So I want you to think of what a scientist does throughout all of the processes,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher, He uses,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher,And think of what different kinds of tools,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
272,Oliver, You want me to take some time and think about it or just try to tell you right now,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
272,Oliver,Okay,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
272,Teacher,"You can brainstorm independently and then go back to text paragraphs one and paragraph two,",,,420.3,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher,And see if you can find more tools at the scientists use,,,420.3,remark,2,0,3
272,Chris,Isn't my turn,,,420.3,response,2,0,3

272,Teacher,"Well, let me just review, do you want to share something",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
272,Chris,Sure,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
272,Chris," So I know that scientists, they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and that connects to what Oliver was just talking about",,,,response,2,0,3
272,Chris,So I went to NASA,,,,response,2,0,3
272,Chris, So I wanted to share it,,,,response,2,0,3
272,Teacher,Excellent,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher, And you can do that independently right now,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3

272,Teacher,"Okay Luis I'll work with you, independently, Luis, what was your answer to the question",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
272,Luis,"Okay, it was, um, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
272,Teacher,Excellent,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher, And what did you did you work with your partner just now,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3

272,Luis,"Um, yeah, it was Oliver",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
272,Teacher,Why not,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
272,Luis,"Well, if there's astronauts on the moon",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
272,Luis, They need oxygen tanks,,,230.1,response,2,0,3
272,Teacher,I agree,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher,Oliver have a different tool that he found,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
272,Luis,"Yeah, the microscope",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
272,Teacher,You agree with that,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
272,Luis,"Um, now I mean, maybe they used it, but it sounded more like it was kind of like after after they found the water than they had to like study it",,,130.2,response,2,0,3
272,Luis," But, um, I think that that oxygen tanks are probably more important",,,130.2,response,2,0,3
272,Luis, Okay,,,130.2,response,2,0,3
272,Teacher,Can you reread the question to me,,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
272,Luis, What equipment did scientists to us to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,response,2,0,3
272,Luis,Yeah,,,120.3,response,2,0,3
272,Teacher,Excellent,,,,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher, So the question asks,,,,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher,"What equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon, not which equipment was more important",,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher,So I work from all the different students that each student found a different tool to use,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher, We all have different ideas and together we can put our ideas and put our ideas together and have a whole list of tools that help scientists discover the water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher,"Right, and no student is wrong",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher,Even I want you to go back to the text and reread pragraphs one and three,,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher,And find different tools that scientists use you can circle hints or I guess I can help you,,,420.3,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,2,0,3
272,Oliver,"Oh yeah nice Teacher, I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but, um, I wanted to say, having us and listen to each other's answers was really interesting",,,,response,2,0,3
272,Oliver,"Because like you said, it sounds like there's a lot of different tools, the astronauts use",,,,response,2,0,3
272,Oliver, It was really fun to hear all about them,,,,response,2,0,3
272,Teacher,Excellent,,,,remark,2,0,3
272,Teacher, I'm happy that you were able to add to your answer and make some changes,,,,remark,2,0,3

273,Farrah, Hi,,,,response,0,1,3
273,Teacher,Good to see you too,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, I think that we should talk about our answers and relating to the text that we just read because I'm on getting the idea that you  May not have completely understood the equipment that was used to find that water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,Teacher:Farrah,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, Can you tell me what you what you thought,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3

273,Teacher,"Um, yeah, I should be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,"But there's a certain Tool and I want us to go back in the text and find where it says, um, that we use a certain that scientists use a certain tool or a piece of equipment, um, to investigate the water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,"Okay, I know it's awesome that you know so much about space and you do you really do know a lot about space",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,So do you have that text in front of you,,,,remark,0,1,3
273,Luis,"Um, yeah, we've all bought it on our tablets",,,,response,0,1,3
273,Teacher,"Okay, awesome",,,,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,So I'm going to give you a moment to reread the text and then I'd like you to give me a thumbs up or raise your hand when you're ready to share,,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,What you think is the piece of technology that we use that the scientists used to find,,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
273,Luis, Okay,,,120.2,response,0,1,3
273,Luis,Oh,,,120.2,response,0,1,3
273,Teacher," Okay, so I'm going to give you one minute to reread or five minutes to read the text",,,120.1,remark,0,1,3

273,Teacher,What would you like to share,,,,remark,0,1,3
273,Farrah,"Well, I said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,3
273,Teacher,"you do need a microscope to find the part, the particles of water that they found  Because it was so microscopic that you needed a microscope to see it",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher," And it's not your answer isn't wrong,",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,Okay,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, So you're absolutely right,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,"But the question that I'm asking is what What piece of equipment was needed in order to find that water they used to different, um, they used a different source of equipment",,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,Did anyone have a different answer than Farrah,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, What did you think,,,,remark,0,1,3
273,Jazmin,"Oh, I'm sorry",,,,response,0,1,3

273,Teacher,"Oh, okay",,,,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, Jazmin,,,,remark,0,1,3
273,Jazmin,"Yeah, cuz I have a different answer from Farrah",,,,response,0,1,3
273,Jazmin,And I said that NASA sent a  small machine,,,,response,0,1,3
273,Teacher,"Yeah, I'm NASA did send a small machine",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, Do you remember what that small machine was called,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Jazmin,"Oh,",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
273,Teacher," Can you read that out loud for us, where",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,Can you go back and yeah maybe if you finish that sentence,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, You might be able to bring us to the right answer,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
273,Teacher,"Yeah, that's absolutely correct",,,110.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher," So the lunar orbiter is what was used, so that the scientists could discover that that water",,,110.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, But when we go back and read the text,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, It was the lunar orbiter that was used to to discover that water,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,"That was what was used, so that they could discover the water when they wanted to observe the water further that was when like Farrah said they used a microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, Chris,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, Yes,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Chris,When I went to NASA,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
273,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
273,Teacher,"Yeah, you're absolutely right here and thank you for making that connection and sharing those ideas with us",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,"Because those are things that we might not know, but because you have that experience with NASA you're able to share that with us and I really appreciate it",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,Does everyone understand that,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, Can you give me a thumbs up or raise your hand if you if that is making sense,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,But with this specific question the answer that,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher," is correct, is, is the Lunar Orbiter",,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, That was the specific source of equipment that was used to determine that there was water,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
273,Oliver,"I'm still a little confused, actually",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
273,Teacher,Okay,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, What are you,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
273,Oliver,"Um, I understand what you're saying",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
273,Oliver," Cause the lunar orbiter sounds like it's still right answer, but I had the same answer",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
273,Oliver," Also Farrah and I guess I'm just not sure, like how I would know that my answer is wrong, without without you telling us it's the Lunar Orbiter",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
273,Teacher, Let me go back,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,So if we go back and the text,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,"Number three, paragraph three, the last sentence says you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, So that is one scientific tool that would be used if you wanted to look really closely at the water,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher, So it's a different source of equipment,,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,"But the question was, um, what what equipment was used, so that they could find the water to begin with",,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,Does that make sense when you go back and look at the question that was asked,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
273,Oliver,"Oh yeah, well, I was thinking, like, how could you find something if you couldn't see it but i i got that maybe you have to find it first and then you can observe it",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
273,Teacher,Does anyone else have any more questions,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,"Yeah, that's exactly right, Oliver",,,110.4,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,Or need more clarification,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
273,Oliver,I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
273,Oliver," Actually, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for coming today and for helping us understand why I'm the lunar orbiter was the best to answer for the question",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
273,Oliver," Um, so thank you so much",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
273,Teacher," Thank you friends, remember to read the questions that are asked really carefully before you answer because it might be easy to jump to the quickest or fastest idea that pops into your brain, but sometimes you have to read the specifically what the question is asking you",,,,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,Of course,,,,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,"Okay, so I hope you all have a great lunch",,,,remark,0,1,3
273,Teacher,"Hello friends, how are you doing today",,,,remark,1,1,3
273,Farrah,"Oh, hi",,,,response,1,1,3
273,Farrah, It's good to see you,,,,response,1,1,3
273,Farrah," We're, we're all doing well",,,,response,1,1,3
273,Teacher, I'm Teacher and I'm going to go over this question based on the text that we read,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"It's good to see you, too",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"So I want us to look at the action word in this sentence, who can give me the action word",,,420.1,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,So I saw that we had the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
273,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,120.2,response,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"Luis I think it's awesome that you know so much about space and I really appreciate you sharing that with me,",,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,but we're going to go over this question together because I think that all of us,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,Had a little bit of misunderstanding with this question,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher, And I want to lead us to the right answer today,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher, So I'm just here to clarify the answer for us,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher," I'm at the question that was asked, it was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"Okay, so can we look back in the text",,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"So what's the action where what is one, one of the action words in this question",,,420.1,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,Raise your hand if you know Jazmin,,,,remark,1,1,3
273,Jazmin,"Well, I think the action word is discover",,,,response,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"Yeah, you're exactly right",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher," Jazmin, so I want us to go back and reread the text, and I want you to look for the action where discover because I think that that will lead us to the answer as to what equipment was used to discover water on the moon",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"Okay, so I'm going to give you a minute to go back into the text",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,Let's see if we can find a new equipment that maybe we didn't write for our answer,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,When you know you can raise your hand and I will call on you,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"What do you think, Farrah",,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
273,Farrah,"Okay, so I'm",,,120.4,response,1,1,3
273,Farrah," Alright, so I think that",,,,response,1,1,3
273,Farrah,Sorry,,,,response,1,1,3
273,Farrah,"Thought well so I couldn't find the word discover in the story, but I think that in order to discover the water that you'd need to find you need the microscope, because how can you discover something if it's too small to see",,,,response,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"Oh, Farrah, you're absolutely right",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher, The word discover isn't here,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher, But I want you to look,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher," Actually, I'm going to give you another minute to look back in the text for a word that is a synonym for a discover",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,And a word that might have a similar meaning,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher," And so I'm going to have you look back in paragraph two,",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Farrah,Okay,,,420.3,response,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"Okay, everyone looked back and paragraph two,",,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"I want to see if we can identify  This this different equipment, because none of us wrote this for our answer",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,1,1,3
273,Jazmin,"Well, so the word",,,,response,1,1,3
273,Jazmin,That's kind of like discover is investigate and I found my answer in the same sentence as that word,,,,response,1,1,3
273,Jazmin," I said, NASA sent a small machine",,,,response,1,1,3
273,Jazmin, So I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,1,1,3
273,Teacher, There's a name for that small machine that you didn't use in your answer,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,Can someone identify the name of that small machine,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,Jazmin your answer isn't wrong NASA did send a small machine but you um if you read on in that sentence,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,Who can tell me the name of the small machine that NASA sent to investigate,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,1,1,3
273,Luis, And the story,,,,response,1,1,3
273,Luis, It is the lunar orbiter Jazmin that's right there,,,,response,1,1,3
273,Luis,"Yep, yep, I totally got this one",,,,response,1,1,3
273,Luis, That's all right there,,,,response,1,1,3
273,Luis, I can't believe you didn't get the name,,,,response,1,1,3
273,Teacher," Let's be kind to our friends, that's really not the way we treat each other in the classroom",,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher," So, um, you're right",,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher, Luis It is the Lunar Orbiter,,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"Oh, Luis",,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher, Either we all didn't write it for our answer,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher, And that's why I'm working with you today to get you to the correct answer,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,But you didn't write that for your answer,,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,The right answer is the lunar orbiter because it is what NASA sent on to investigate the water on the moon,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"Now some of you wrote that, um, the microscope was used to discover the water",,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,It the lunar orbiter is the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,Now they didn't use a microscope to discover the water they use it after they discovered the water to look more closely at it,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher, But the question is asking what equipment was used to discover the water and that's where it gets tricky,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"But friends if we pay attention to the keywords in our question, we can really think more critically about how we're going to answer that question and we can go back in the text and try to find words keywords that stand out to us, Chris",,,420.1,remark,1,1,3
273,Chris," Oh, hi",,,420.1,response,1,1,3
273,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,420.1,response,1,1,3
273,Chris, I went to NASA,,,420.1,response,1,1,3
273,Chris,Yeah,,,420.1,response,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"Yeah, you're absolutely right",,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher, Chris,,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher, We all seem to know a lot about space and about NASA um,,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher, Thank you for sharing with us,,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher, So that should have been the answer that we wrote down,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,But I just wanted to go over that specific question with all of you today so that you can realize that the equipment that they use to discover though that water was the Lunar Orbiter,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,The lunar orbiter is what was used to investigate into find that water and know it gets a little confusing,,,130.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,So we have to really read our texts carefully and look at the key words,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"Because we might think it could be the microscope, because that's another equipment that's thrown into the text right but that equipment was used only after the water was discovered",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,In our question before we write our answers,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher," Does that make sense, Oliver",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
273,Oliver," And I'm actually, it's, it's time for us to go right now, but I wanted to say thank you for really emphasizing the key word discover and how if we look for a word, kind of like it in the story will find the very best to answer",,,420.3,response,1,1,3
273,Oliver,"Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense",,,420.3,response,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"Okay, I'm really glad that I could help you all today",,,,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher, I hope you have a good lunch,,,,remark,1,1,3
273,Teacher,"Hello friends, how are you doing today",,,,remark,2,1,3
273,Farrah, Thank you for asking,,,,response,2,1,3
273,Farrah,We're good,,,,response,2,1,3
273,Teacher, Luis,,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"the question was, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, Yes,,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher," Um, so I want",,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"Okay, I got us into this group because I wanted to clarify a question that we answered, because I want to reread some parts of the text so that we can find the correct answers",,,220.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Luis,"Um, I just want to remind you, my dad is actually an astronaut",,,220.1,response,2,1,3
273,Teacher, I really appreciate you sharing that with me,,,110.3,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,Wow that's so cool,,,110.3,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher," So I want you to go back and reread And look for the word valuable, it can be really helpful friends when we pick out a certain word in our question and we try to go back into our reading and find it in order to find the right answer",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,So I want us to go back in the text and look for the word valuable because that's one of the words that's in our question,,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,So I'm going to give you a minute to go back,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,And look for that word and see if it changes your answer in any way,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,So I'm going to give you a minute to go back and read,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,Ready when you have a new idea,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, You can raise your hand,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,Has anyone is thinking changed,,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, What do you think,,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher," So anyone have any new ideas, Chris",,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,Since we first answered the question,,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
273,Chris,"Okay, so",,,120.4,response,2,1,3
273,Chris,Look for the word valuable,,,,response,2,1,3
273,Chris, So it sounds like the answer is yes,,,,response,2,1,3
273,Chris,"Okay, and I only found it in one spot at the very beginning where it says water on the moon would be a valuable resource",,,,response,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"Yes, the answer is yes",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher," I'm the question, however, access to think about, um, is there convincing evidence",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, Can someone tell me what evidence means,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,What's the evidence mean,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,Hmm,,,,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher," Let's put on our thinking caps, Oliver",,,,remark,2,1,3
273,Oliver,"Evidence is like something from the story, the part of the story that you bought your answer from",,,,response,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"Yeah, you're exactly right",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, So I think the key to answering this question after looking at it and determining,,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"That we're looking for evidence is to go back in the text in look for examples, the texts will be giving us examples of why water is a valuable resource",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher," So if we read on, we can find examples within the text or evidence so that we can answer this question More completely into the best of our ability",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,2,1,3
273,Jazmin, And so my new idea is that you can use water to grow things so we could have a garden on the womb,,,,response,2,1,3
273,Jazmin,"Well, I got a new idea when I read it for the second time",,,,response,2,1,3
273,Teacher, We do use water to grow things,,,130.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, I'm not sure that that would work on the moon,,,130.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, You're exactly right,,,130.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, Water,,,130.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,Wow,,,130.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, Yeah,,,130.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, It's like the driest desert on earth we only have very small microscopic amounts of water that was found on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,Because the moon is is really dry,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, So,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,So I want us to go back and into our reading and find more example,,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,I don't think that we could,,,130.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher," Um, I don't think that we could grow plants per se but water has other uses on the moon",,,130.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"Why is water, an important resource the texts will say it for us if we read on",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, So I want us to go back into the text,,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,So let's do that for another minute,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,I want us to look for examples explicitly stated examples in the text,,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"When you're ready, you can raise your hand",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"When you have an example, raise your hand",,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, Luis What's your example,,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
273,Luis,"My example as water can be broken down into two parts, oxygen and hydrogen",,,120.4,response,2,1,3
273,Teacher, Why does that make it valuable,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"Okay, why does that make it a valuable resource that's exactly true, that it can be broken down into two parts",,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher," But if we read on, and we get the complete idea if we finish the, the thought in the text and we keep reading",,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, We may learn why that's important,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Luis,"Um,",,,230.1,response,2,1,3
273,Luis," So, um, it's valuable because I'm",,,,response,2,1,3
273,Luis,"Okay, yeah",,,,response,2,1,3
273,Luis, So astronauts could breed the oxygen,,,,response,2,1,3
273,Luis," Okay, oxygen, hydrogen could be used for rocket for your wall",,,,response,2,1,3
273,Luis," Um, okay",,,,response,2,1,3
273,Luis, Oh,,,,response,2,1,3
273,Luis," I mean, of course",,,,response,2,1,3
273,Luis," And then, oh, oh, this part is so cool",,,,response,2,1,3
273,Luis,"So it can be broken down into hydrogen, oxygen and then",,,,response,2,1,3
273,Teacher, Luis There's so many different ways that astronauts can use water,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"Yeah, you're exactly right",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, It's such a valuable resource,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"Does anyone did anyone else find other examples, Farrah",,,130.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Farrah, So it says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money,,,110.1,response,2,1,3
273,Farrah," And it's still from the text, there's still evidence",,,110.1,response,2,1,3
273,Farrah, So I was thinking something a little different,,,110.1,response,2,1,3
273,Farrah,"Oh, okay",,,110.1,response,2,1,3
273,Farrah, So I think that,,,110.1,response,2,1,3
273,Farrah,It wouldn't be valuable for a long time,,,,response,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"Yeah, I think you're right",,,130.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher," I think that it might take scientists, a long time to use that water, but that doesn't mean that it's any less valuable because I think that there are lots of different",,,130.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, The text will give us so many different examples,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,Ways that it can be valuable,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, If we look back in the text,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,So I hope that we can modify,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"Luis gave an example, Oliver, do you have an example of why water is valuable for for astronauts",,,130.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, I hope that we can change our answers,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, After reading the text because now we have sources of evidence,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Oliver, So I was thinking it's not valuable because it takes too much money,,,150.1,response,2,1,3
273,Oliver,"Well, I was thinking about another meaning of the word value like I'm like money and it talks about money and it says it would take a lot of money",,,150.1,response,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"Yeah, it's still valuable, though, you're right, value can mean money to that value has a double meaning, but in this sense, the valuable in the question means",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, Is it a good resource and why,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,Is it a good resource that water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, And if we go back in the text weekend find detailed descriptions and examples of why the water is valuable,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"And can we find one more example because I want us to be prepared to re answer this question and in complete sentences, to the best of our ability and finishing our thoughts",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"Um, I want us to go back in and answer our question again",,,130.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, So does anyone have another example that we could use of,,,130.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher,Of convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
273,Oliver,"I wish we had time to hear another answer, but actually we have to go to lunch, but this is a really fun class",,,120.2,response,2,1,3
273,Oliver, I don't want to end,,,120.2,response,2,1,3
273,Oliver,"What thank you because you really helped us think about using evidence, evidence from the text in order to answer the question, and also",,,,response,2,1,3
273,Oliver,You helped us know how to make a complete answer like if you read a little further,,,,response,2,1,3
273,Oliver," Sometimes, and you add more detail your answer can be better and make a lot more sense",,,,response,2,1,3
273,Teacher,"Yeah, exactly",,,,remark,2,1,3
273,Teacher, I really hope that this was helpful and that we can modify our answers so that we can provide evidence that the text gives us in our answers,,,,remark,2,1,3

274,Luis,"I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,0,3
274,Teacher, It's not that you don't know things about space as to why you're in this group because we can have a better understanding,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
274,Teacher,"So right if you know things about space, but there's always more that we can learn",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
274,Luis,Oh ok ok ok that makes sense,,,150.1,response,0,0,3
274,Teacher,Luis Would you like to answer my question of how we can use everything from the tech to support our answers,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3

274,Teacher,That's good,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
274,Teacher, This group wasn't formed because you don't know about space,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
274,Teacher,In small groups are like first of all to work together so we can learn from each other and work on bettering our responses to certain questions,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
274,Teacher, So the first question says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
274,Teacher,So we can strengthen our skills,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
274,Teacher," And the question I would like for you to think, what is the most important parts Of the question that you need to know in order to answer the question specifically with what it's asking",,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
274,Teacher,I would like for you guys to think about that question,,,420.1,remark,1,0,3

274,Teacher,"And Farrah, would you mind talking about how did you get that answer, what in the text caused you to answer that",,,230.2,remark,1,0,3
274,Farrah,"So there's this part on Part three, and it says the water is microscopic",,,230.2,response,1,0,3
274,Farrah, So how can you discover something microscopic if you can't see it,,,230.2,response,1,0,3
274,Farrah, That's why I thought you'd need the microscope,,,230.2,response,1,0,3
274,Teacher,"Yes, that is true that the water on the moon is microscopic but as the first with the first step that we did with reviewing the question",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3

274,Teacher,"Going back to the question what equipment, the scientists used to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
274,Teacher, But that's not what's really being asked of us,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
274,Teacher,"Did they say, did they ask about how do they see the water know they asked what was you to discover water",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3

274,Jazmin," And, uh, my evidence from the text is that astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated",,,,response,2,0,3
274,Jazmin," Okay, so my first answer was yes",,,,response,2,0,3
274,Jazmin, I was also thinking that you could use water to grow things and you could have a garden on the moon,,,,response,2,0,3
274,Jazmin,"And you can't survive without water, and then the more I thought about it like thinking about valuable like convincing reasons, it would be valuable",,,,response,2,0,3
274,Teacher, That's very important,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
274,Teacher,"But yes, your first portion of the answer that astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated",,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
274,Teacher,"That that's not quite really answering the question, like, as we go on",,,130.1,remark,2,0,3
274,Teacher,But going back to the question with the part of the question that says evidence that water on the moon can be valuable,,,230.2,remark,2,0,3

274,Chris, The astronauts need oxygen,,,230.1,response,2,0,3
274,Chris," Um, so they need oxygen",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
274,Chris,"Oh, okay, here it is",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
274,Teacher, And what could the hydrogen,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3

274,Teacher, Oh,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
274,Luis,"Yeah, I'm Chris, you just need to read the next sentence extra right thing or access oxygen and a high to use as a rocket fuel",,,130.2,response,2,0,3
274,Teacher," What are some strategies that we can practice before we even answer the question, what are some strategies that we can practice to make sure we are answering the question that's being asked",,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
274,Teacher,Thank you,,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
274,Teacher," So when reading the question, what are some",,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
274,Teacher, Luis for helping him out,,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
274,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,2,0,3
274,Farrah,"Well, I would say",,,,response,2,0,3
274,Farrah,That you can look at the most important words in the question,,,,response,2,0,3
274,Teacher," And why should we look at the most important parts, someone can raise their hand or Farrah",,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
274,Teacher,Yes,,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
274,Farrah,"Well, I think the most important words in the question they kind of tell you what to look for when you read the story",,,420.1,response,2,0,3
274,Teacher, Farrah for answering,,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
274,Teacher," When answering the question we want to look at important words they manage, do you have something else to say",,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
274,Teacher, That is very true,,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
274,Teacher,"Yes, thank you",,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
274,Oliver,"I'm not, but I have something else to say",,,420.1,response,2,0,3
274,Teacher,One moment,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
274,Teacher,Farrah,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
274,Teacher, If you have something to say,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
274,Farrah,"No, I was done",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
274,Oliver,"Um, well, I looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just, I really appreciate how you taught us how to take a question apart and how you also taught us to really look for evidence that our answers",,,,response,2,0,3
274,Oliver, They have to come from the text,,,,response,2,0,3
274,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,2,0,3
304,Teacher,alright welcome back from lunch,,,,remark,2,1,3
304,Teacher,For our next part of our discussion we're going to talk about why it's such a big deal that water is on the moon,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
304,Luis,um yeah I you know I really got this figured out I think I'm all good,,,150.1,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,Oh go ahead and tell us what you got figured out,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
304,Luis,um I meant more like I have it figured out like I can go back to my seat,,,230.1,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,"Oh well, let's let's talk about your answer because maybe if your answer so great, if we can probably help some of the others who are here",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
304,Teacher,so tell us about why water is why what evidence is there that water could be so valuable to have on the moon,,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
304,Luis,"yeah so you can take water, and you can split it into two parts, you can make oxygen and hydrogen",,,120.4,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,"hmm that's so what, why is that such an important thing",,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
304,Luis,"Well, because you can have those chemicals",,,230.1,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,"yeah I agree that you can do a lot with those too, so my concern is that you did identify an important piece of evidence, but didn't explain why that's so valuable, so my suggestion would be to add a reason for why it's so valuable to have those chemicals",,,430.2,remark,2,1,3
304,Luis,"Oh, like what you can do with them? yeah yeah Okay, I can do that",,,430.2,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,"Great while Luis is revising let's go we'll go we'll start on the other side, so Farrah and Oliver I noticed that, once again, you guys must have worked together, because you have some similar answers",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
304,Oliver,yeah we always work together,,,230.3,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,"You make it it's just a dream team over there on that side of the table, so you you wrote",,,,remark,2,1,3
304,Farrah,I just we're kind of friends but kind of not,,,,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,Oh okay,,,,remark,2,1,3
304,Teacher, it's complicated I got you,,,,remark,2,1,3
304,Teacher,so you both wrote that this isn't that using this water isn't something that's going to happen anytime soon is that right,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
304,Farrah,yeah we were thinking that like maybe it's valuable,,,230.3,response,2,1,3
304,Farrah,"like 50 years in the future, or I don't know at some point in the future but we were thinking that because this question was like is there convincing evidence that water",,,,response,2,1,3
304,Farrah,is valuable and we we thinking like no it's not valuable yet,,,,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,but let's look at the question i'm concerned because you said when you read the question out loud just now,,,,remark,2,1,3
304,Teacher,yeah I like how you're thinking very much like what can we do right now with this with this stuff,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
304,Teacher,"You reread it, as is water on the moon valuable right now, but the question actually says, could it be valuable and that means at some point in the future",,,410.1,remark,2,1,3
304,Teacher,"So my suggestion would be to find some reasons why, even in that long future that you identified why could it be important to have in the future",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
304,Farrah,that's a really good point,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
304,Farrah,"Okay, I think we can do this",,,,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,so let's see Chris and Jazmin who would like to share next,,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
304,Jazmin,Well I can share,,,120.4,response,2,1,3
304,Jazmin,"Yes, that astronauts can drink the water to be hydrated and you can't survive without water",,,,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,"I agree that that's that's crucial piece of information for us here on earth to you, none of us can survive without water for sure",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
304,Teacher,Is that why you found that piece of information as a key piece,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
304,Jazmin,yeah it's like yeah I think that's why water is valuable,,,230.1,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,So you identify why water is valuable,,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
304,Teacher, But one thing that i'm concerned about is that your answer doesn't isn't specific to just the moon and we're really thinking about why is it such a big deal that waters on the moon,,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
304,Teacher,"So my suggestion would be to keep what you have, but now make a connection to why it's important that water is there on the moon",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
304,Jazmin,"Like ok, so like saying why water's important",,,420.2,response,2,1,3
304,Jazmin,And then say like,,,,response,2,1,3
304,Jazmin,"Okay, I think that makes sense, so like looking and saying like, why is it important up on the moon that it's already there",,,,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,"yeah, why is it in, because we know water is important here too, we need to just survive, why is it such a big deal that now water is found on the moon",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
304,Jazmin, Let me take a look,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
304,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,"All right, Chris you're up next",,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
304,Chris,"So I heard, I read on Facebook by uncle posts a lot of stuff",,,120.4,response,2,1,3
304,Chris,"And I read on Facebook that there could be a base on the moon, that there was maybe one already, but there was definitely going to be one by 2024",,,,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,"I would love to go, I wonder, I hope that they're selling tickets soon to the moon base",,,140.1,remark,2,1,3
304,Teacher,so you wrote about water being heavy,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
304,Teacher,what did you mean by that,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
304,Teacher,So that it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore,,,,remark,2,1,3
304,Chris,"Well, like",,,,response,2,1,3
304,Chris,"it's heavy to carry water, and I remember, there was like diet asset that show like where they were all this stuff and they were saying that water was one of the heaviest",,,,response,2,1,3
304,Chris,"And one of the hardest things to carry into space, so if they already have it in space you don't need to bring any with them",,,,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,that's true I agree that's a super that's really helpful for NASA,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
304,Teacher,"So my My concern is that you, your answer is providing a good reason, but my suggestion, but still not complete, so my suggestion would be",,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
304,Teacher,"To explain what benefit can the astronauts or can NASA have that they don't have to carry this water anymore, so what what other benefit does that provide see if you can expand your answer a little",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
304,Chris,Okay i'll take a look,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,so Farrah and Oliver did you find or did you revise your answers yet,,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
304,Jazmin,Oh yeah we did ciz we took a look and say we,,,120.4,response,2,1,3
304,Farrah,we thought about this question cuz it was asking could it be valuable,,,,response,2,1,3
304,Oliver,yeah we were trying to figure out like okay like could it be valuable as opposed to like is it valuable like right now at that was actually really interesting to look at,,,,response,2,1,3
304,Oliver,"So, like basically we want to to revise our answer to say that it would be very valuable um you could use it to make rocket fuel by splitting it into it's",,,,response,2,1,3
304,Oliver,"Like different chemical parts um you could use it to Greek arm, you could like use it for those things and and maybe you could grow a moon garden which they didn't have in the reading, but I thought was an interesting idea",,,,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,I love that then we could have moon flowers,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
304,Oliver,I would love moon flowers,,,110.1,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,yeah yeah Farrah,,,,remark,2,1,3
304,Farrah,"So, fortunately, we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch",,,,response,2,1,3
304,Farrah,"I just wanted to thank you for being with us and, like, in particular, I just wanted to say, like you, really explained like",,,,response,2,1,3
304,Farrah,"What we needed to work on and I thought, maybe that would be hard to hear, but actually it was really how I guys like it's nice to know like",,,,response,2,1,3
304,Farrah,"When we we weren't quite right, and then we were able to be like Okay, because then you have this figure out what we should work, and it was really helpful because then that I knew that I was going to shift and not going a different direction, so thank you so much bye",,,,response,2,1,3
304,Teacher,bye,,,,remark,2,1,3
368,Teacher,hi everyone I am your Teacher and it's so great to see you all today i'm excited to work with you on trying to Oliverelop really complete answers,,,220.1,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,"Based on a text that we read into sort of think about different strategies we can use as well Luis I see you have your hand raised, would you like to share",,,,remark,0,0,4
368,Luis,yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,"Well, thank you for sharing that i'm really glad that you have all of this background knowledge already, and maybe you can help others in our group today",,,110.3,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,"And Luis did your background knowledge help you, with your answer to the question I see that you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, is that did you think about that from your background knowledge",,,230.1,remark,0,0,4
368,Luis,um yeah because if,,,230.1,response,0,0,4
368,Luis,"The astronauts were falling to the moon, to find the water they definitely needed oxygen tanks 100% i'm positive",,,,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,awesome I love how confident you are in your answer and I love that you're thinking about what these astronauts would need to be in space,,,310.1,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,But in another strategy that we can use when we're answering these questions is to really focus on the key words in our question so i'd like all five of you actually to,,,420.1,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,reread our question here what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,"and i'd like you to circle, the key words in our question our action words, the most important words in our texts in our question here, and once you have a key word, you can raise your hand",,,420.1,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,"All right, alright Oliver why don't you start us off",,,,remark,0,0,4
368,Oliver,"Okay, so in the question a word that I circled was equipment",,,,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,"Chris, you also had your hand raised",,,,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,equipment great that's an excellent word to circle Thank you,,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
368,Chris,yeah so the word that I circled in the question is water,,,,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,Water great that's another awesome word in our question,,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,Jazmin did you have another word to share,,,,remark,0,0,4
368,Jazmin,and the one that I picked was discover,,,,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,"So now Luis going back to your response you did a great job talking about equipment that scientists use, but do you think that the oxygen tanks themselves were what was used to disk to discover the water on the moon",,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,discover great that's definitely our action word discover,,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
368,Luis,"Well, what oxygen tanks would do, was they would have the astronaut stay alive, while they were looking for the water",,,210.3,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,"Great guess that's definitely true, but I would like you Luis to reread paragraph two, and try to circle words equipment words that maybe that specific piece of equipment itself was what was used to discover the water okay",,,420.3,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,And while you do that i'm going to have another student share their response does another student want to share their their answer Farrah yes,,,120.4,remark,0,0,4
368,Farrah,"Okay, so um I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,120.4,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,"Alright, and Oliver I see you circled the same as well, so we can address both of you, together here, so can Farrah, can you tell me what does a microscope do",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
368,Farrah,"Okay, well, a microscope and helps you see things that are really, really small and in the story except the water was really, really small microscopic",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,Great that's an excellent strategy to be looking at the text and pulling out those keywords like microscopic so that's amazing,,,510.1,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,But Oliver Do you remember what our key action word in our question was,,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
368,Oliver,"um yeah I think Jazmin said it, and it was discover",,,210.2,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,discover great and Farrah Do you know what another word for discover might be,,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
368,Farrah,Find,,,210.2,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,"Yes, exactly so discover means to find",,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,In a microscope we're talking about seeing things so do we think that the microscope itself helped to find the water or maybe they they looked at the water with the microscope,,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
368,Farrah,"Oh Okay, well, it sounds like maybe they just use the microscope to look, but I guess what I had been thinking is, how can you find it if you can't see it",,,210.3,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,"Yes, that's an excellent point I think here in the text, what they did was they first found the water and they could see the water and then to look even close even a little bit closer they they had to use the microscope okay",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
368,Farrah,Okay okay,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
368,Farrah,yeah i'm i'm starting to get a picture of this now,,,,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,Perfect great now Chris I see your hand is raised,,,,remark,0,0,4
368,Chris,"yeah well, I just wanted to say so, I actually went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,wow that's awesome I love that you have that background knowledge,,,110.3,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,and I think that that's an excellent strategy for anyone to think about when we're reading a text is to think,,,510.1,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,"and so Chris did that help you answer the question, what was your answer",,,120.4,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,What knowledge do I already have that I can bring to this text to help me understand the text better,,,,remark,0,0,4
368,Chris,"At the sulfur for my answer, I said that the scientists found the creator's full of water on the moon",,,,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,awesome great and I love how you're all looking back at the text,,,310.1,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,because the text does tell us that they found the water in the craters,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
368,Teacher,"But I would like, for you to reread for me, the first sentence of paragraph three, can you read that allowed for us Chris",,,120.3,remark,0,0,4
368,Chris,"Oh yeah Okay, it says, this means the room is still drier than the driest desert on earth",,,120.3,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,"Yes, so I see that you had said that the craters were full of water on the moon, but does it seem like there's a lot of water in these craters or maybe just a little bit",,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
368,Chris,"Well, I mean that part definitely just a little bit",,,210.3,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,yeah definitely and I think your answer is really telling us where they found the tech where they found the water but def I see you have something to say,,,230.3,remark,0,0,4
368,Oliver,yeah so um I just actually looked at the clock and,,,230.3,response,0,0,4
368,Oliver,"We have to go to lunch now, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to carefully explain the different action words for the different tools i'm using that key word really helped me in Farrah figure out that microscope part, so thank you so much",,,,response,0,0,4
368,Teacher,"Great you're welcome i'm glad that you had a good time today, it was great meeting you all",,,,remark,0,0,4

376,Luis,yeah yeah okay,,,110.1,response,1,0,2
376,Chris,So here are my answer was a scientist on craters full of water on the moon,,,,response,1,0,2
376,Teacher,"Yes, can you tell me like",,,,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,How can you come up with this answer?,,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
376,Chris,um yeah so I was looking for the,,,230.1,response,1,0,2
376,Chris,"Words like equipment and finding or discovering water on the moon, and it was in the first paragraph, that I saw that they said um let's see",,,,response,1,0,2
376,Chris,"Okay, this indices scientists have found evidence the water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters so they talk about finding water on the moon in that sentence and scientists to",,,,response,1,0,2
376,Teacher,"yeah yeah I see Chris, I really liked that you",,,,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,"Use the technique core like locating the keywords and to find help you find the answer, but my",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,Concern would be like,,,,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,In that question,,,,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,Like,,,,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,Is they are asking what equipment good scientists to use to discover so maybe you can just,,,,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,"Look, for some synthesis related",,,,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,To what the scientists use,,,430.1,remark,1,0,2
376,Chris,Oh yeah I guess I forgot about that part,,,430.1,response,1,0,2
376,Teacher,"yeah it will be great if you look back to the second paragraph, so can you just look closely about this for up and I go back to you later",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2

376,Teacher,"Okay, so, can you tell me",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,"Again, what your answer is",,,,remark,1,0,2
376,Jazmin,yeah I said NASA sent a small machine,,,,response,1,0,2
376,Jazmin,Okay that's right out of the,,,,response,1,0,2
376,Jazmin,"second paragraph, which you told Chris to look",,,,response,1,0,2

376,Teacher,Locating this into the second paragraph,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,That,,,,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,yeah he i'm,,,,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,worry about like,,,,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,"The in the question, the scientists asked what equipment did scientists they use so, can you tell me like what exactly equipment, the scientists to use I saw you just say a small machine, can you tell me the name of the machine",,,430.2,remark,1,0,2
376,Jazmin,I don't remember the name of it um lunar orbiter okay it's a lunar orbiter,,,430.2,response,1,0,2
376,Teacher,"Okay, great so",,,,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,"Next time, that if you see this kind of question, so please just be more specific, as specific as you can to answer the question okay",,,520.1,remark,1,0,2

376,Teacher,yeah Chris it's great all right i'm so glad that you have so much background,,,510.1,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,about this,,,,remark,1,0,2
376,Teacher,was a necessity to,,,,remark,1,0,2

386,Teacher,"But, you know, something that we can do is just like to pay attention to the titles and subtitles and these titles and subtitles can give you more information about about the main ideas of the text",,,420.3,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,But so the you have another thought about what could be another main idea of this text,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
386,Oliver,I offer one,,,210.4,response,1,1,4
386,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,1,4
386,Oliver, So I think the point as actually that even though they found water on the moon,,,,response,1,1,4
386,Oliver, And the subtitle is a moon is a desert,,,,response,1,1,4
386,Oliver," Oh, also, it's ice and not water",,,,response,1,1,4
386,Oliver, It's really small,,,,response,1,1,4
386,Oliver,So you said the subtitle,,,,response,1,1,4
386,Oliver, There's not that much of it,,,,response,1,1,4
386,Teacher," So yeah, we're going to discuss more of this later",,,110.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,"Oh yeah, you're correct",,,110.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,"Okay, so what is the other subtitle that we can discuss about",,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
386,Oliver,I don't know,,,210.4,response,1,1,4
386,Teacher,What is the other main idea that we can learn,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,Farrah?,,,,remark,1,1,4
386,Farrah,"Are you talking about the part that says, water is a valuable resource",,,,response,1,1,4
386,Teacher, So what do you think about that,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,"Yeah, I'm talking about",,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
386,Farrah,"Well, actually I'm still a little confused about the first part",,,210.4,response,1,1,4
386,Teacher," Okay, so in the beginning, I just wanted to know if you have the main ideas, clear and then we can talk more about it",,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,"Okay, so we will also talk about it later",,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher, Okay,,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,So the first question that I want to tell you is what equipment if scientists used to this cover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,Okay,,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher, So can you tell me where the main words of this question?,,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher," But first of all, I want you to pay attention to this question, hey, pay attention to all the words in the details",,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Farrah," And so, my answer was you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why that answer is wrong",,,420.1,response,1,1,4
386,Farrah,"Yeah, so I thought the main word was equipment",,,420.1,response,1,1,4
386,Teacher,Is not wrong Farrah,,,110.2,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,"You know, like we have to pay attention to another key word that is in the question",,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,"So the, you know, another keyword that is under question that they can help us to answer this question?",,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,Is your answer is enough,,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher," Okay, Jazmin?",,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
386,Jazmin,Farrah,,,120.4,response,1,1,4
386,Jazmin," I know you said equipment, and I think that's important",,,120.4,response,1,1,4
386,Jazmin," But actually, I think the more important word is actually discover",,,120.4,response,1,1,4
386,Teacher," Yeah, there is another important we're in this question",,,110.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher, Thank you Jazmin,,,110.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher, So coming back to you Farrah,,,110.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,"Okay, thank you",,,110.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher, Okay,,,110.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,"So can you tell me what is it, what is in the microscope for",,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,"Okay, so you say that a microscope is the equipment that they used to discover water on the moon",,,230.3,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,We have two main questions too many words in this question is discover and equipment,,,210.2,remark,1,1,4
386,Farrah,It's to look really closely at really small things,,,210.4,response,1,1,4
386,Teacher, And also we use microscopes to observe and to analyze right,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
386,Farrah,"Oh, yeah",,,210.4,response,1,1,4
386,Farrah,You're right,,,,response,1,1,4
386,Teacher,"Yeah, so maybe the microscope we didn't they didn't use a microscope to discover water, but maybe they use the microscope to observe to analyze the water after they discovered that water",,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher, Chris,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,So we have to think about another equipment before that helped them to discover water since the beginning,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
386,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,210.4,response,1,1,4
386,Chris,"Yeah, so I went to NASA",,,210.4,response,1,1,4
386,Teacher," Well what in the text makes you think that within the next, what do you see that maybe that can be an equipment, for this idea?",,,230.2,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,"Yeah, that's right",,,230.2,remark,1,1,4
386,Chris,From the story?,,,230.2,response,1,1,4
386,Teacher, So what in the text makes you think about they need oxygen tanks to discover water,,,230.2,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,"Yeah, from this story like for this case for this specific case, we're talking about discovering water in the moono",,,230.2,remark,1,1,4
386,Chris,"I, well, I guess, those aren't from the story, but I just thought because we were talking about equipment",,,230.2,response,1,1,4
386,Chris,That that's equipment that scientists sometimes use,,,,response,1,1,4
386,Teacher," Well, you're right",,,110.3,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,Yeah,,,110.3,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher, Chris and I really value that you have knowledge about this topic,,,110.3,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher, But that's when they,,,130.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,You're right that oxygen tanks are equipment that sometimes they need to go to go to the moon,,,130.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,When they need astronauts and they need human beings because human beings human beings needs oxygen over there,,,130.1,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,"Okay, and Farrah",,,,remark,1,1,4
386,Farrah,"So it's time for us to go, but I just wanted to say thank you for helping us think about where we found our answers and then whether or not being worked with that word discover that was really helpful",,,,response,1,1,4
386,Teacher,"Okay, so I hope that everybody understood that everybody doesn't have any more questions about",,,,remark,1,1,4
386,Teacher,Hello,,,,remark,2,1,4

386,Teacher,Hi,,,,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, It's nice to see you again,,,,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher," OK, so the you read the water on the moon text already, raise your hand if you read it",,,150.1,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,"Okay, so yeah",,,150.1,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,  I'm going to be your teacher today,,,150.1,remark,2,1,4

386,Teacher," I'm, I have a question for you",,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,You want to say something about the text Luis?,,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
386,Luis," I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
386,Luis,"Yeah, I do",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
386,Teacher, Okay,,,110.3,remark,2,1,4

386,Teacher,You can give us more information,,,110.3,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, We have to pay attention to the question and we have to know what is exactly the thing that they are asking for,,,420.1,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher," But remember, in order to have an answer",,,420.1,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher," Okay, so what are the main words of this question",,,420.1,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,And pay attention to these question,,,420.1,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,Oliver?,,,,remark,2,1,4
386,Oliver,"Okay, so I said a main word in the question was, equipment, because you know that the answer has to be like a thing a tool",,,,response,2,1,4
386,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher," So what in the text makes you think that that's a, that's a main word",,,230.2,remark,2,1,4

386,Teacher,You say equipment,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
386,Chris,Okay,,,210.2,response,2,1,4
386,Chris," So I said, the main point was water",,,210.2,response,2,1,4
386,Teacher,"Yeah, there is another important word in this question because we're, we're talking about finding water on the moon",,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, Okay,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,But there is another another word that I want to talk about it,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,What equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,What is the verb of this question,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,Jazmin?,,,,remark,2,1,4
386,Jazmin,"And so a verb is an ACTION word and the action word in the question is discover, and that's what I thought was the main word",,,,response,2,1,4
386,Teacher, So now we have discover water and equipment,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,"Okay, so thank you",,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher," Okay, so let's think about it",,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, So now let's think what equipment this science is used to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,Can someone told me where is your answer according to the text,,,230.2,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin?",,,,remark,2,1,4
386,Jazmin,"And my answer is NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,2,1,4
386,Teacher, And I'm glad that you are you are ready to read the text that that tells me that you read the text and that you understand the meaning of these facts,,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher," Okay, so, um, I know that sometimes can be difficult to remember scientific words",,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,Answer is not wrong,,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,I know that you get it,,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, I know you know that they sent a small robot to find water on the moon,,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,Can someone remember what is the specific name of this robot?,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
386,Luis,"Yeah, I know",,,210.4,response,2,1,4
386,Luis, Come on,,,210.4,response,2,1,4
386,Luis, It's the lunar orbiter Jazmin,,,210.4,response,2,1,4
386,Luis, That's one,,,210.4,response,2,1,4
386,Teacher,"Yeah, no, Jazmin, got it",,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, Good answer,,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, And it was a robot in the name is lunar orbiter right,,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher," Also, it's also good",,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, So there was a small machine,,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,Okay so they found  this equipment to discover water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, What happened next,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,So when they discover water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, What is the next step when they discovered these ice deposits in the craters?,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
386,Chris,"Next step, like so, after they after they find the water in the craters",,,210.4,response,2,1,4
386,Chris,"Well, so on",,,,response,2,1,4
386,Chris," So maybe after they found it, they measured it",,,,response,2,1,4
386,Chris," It talks about how there's not very much of it, so maybe they measured it because it says there's 32 ounces",,,,response,2,1,4
386,Chris, After the part about the Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,2,1,4
386,Teacher," After that, they have to",,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, Right,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, They have to make an observation,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher," And how can you observe this water and someone told me what is another woman on maybe they can, they, they will need to observe this water",,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,"Yeah, Farrah",,,,remark,2,1,4
386,Farrah,"Um, well, I think that was my answer the microscope",,,,response,2,1,4
386,Teacher,"Yeah, the microscope",,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher," Um, what do you use the microscope for?",,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, So can you tell me what is the main,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
386,Farrah,"Well, I thought, who was the answer to the question about, about what they use to discover the water",,,210.4,response,2,1,4
386,Farrah, I guess I'm not quite sure why,,,210.4,response,2,1,4
386,Farrah,Why the microscope isn't just the whole answer,,,,response,2,1,4
386,Teacher,So you think that the microscope is the only equipment that they use to discover this water,,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
386,Farrah,So I guess it sounds like maybe they have to use both,,,230.3,response,2,1,4
386,Teacher, The Lunar orbiter,,,130.3,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,"Yeah, they have to use like the first step to discover water was it the this mall machine",,,130.3,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,So that's the main idea,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, That's the main equipment that we use but everybody has excellent ideas and now I know that everybody read this text and everybody has knowledge about this,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher," So I am very impressed with your, with your answers",,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,2,1,4
386,Oliver,"So I looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you for helping us think about the main words in the question because that helps us find the very best answer in the text",,,,response,2,1,4
386,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, Thank you,,,,remark,2,1,4
386,Teacher, Have a nice lunch,,,,remark,2,1,4

387,Farrah, It's nice to meet you,,,,response,0,1,4
387,Farrah," Oh, good",,,,response,0,1,4
387,Farrah,"So, so we just finished reading the water on the moon",,,,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher,So our discussion question today is going to be what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,4
387,Luis," Um, I shouldn't be, and this group, I already know all about space",,,120.2,response,0,1,4
387,Luis, This is Luis,,,120.2,response,0,1,4
387,Luis,"Excuse me, excuse me",,,120.2,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher,"Yeah, um, it's definitely good that you have that understanding and that you're confident in your knowledge about space",,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,I just pulled you all together so that we could have a discussion about that question I wanted to go through each of your responses and talk a little bit about what evidence you are using to back up what you said,,,220.1,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,"So Farrah, you said you end up both said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,"That's a very great response and great observation, based on the text",,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,"I wanted to prompt you to think about what happened before they looked through the microscope in order to look through the microscope, you need to have a sample",,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,You too can work together to figure out how the scientists got the sample,,,130.2,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,Is that clear,,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
387,Farrah, So should we just talk to each other or,,,150.1,response,0,1,4
387,Farrah,Okay,,,150.1,response,0,1,4
387,Farrah,What do you want us to do,,,,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher,You can turn and talk and you can look at the first two points and think about how they may have gotten the sample to look at through the microscope,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,That clear?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
387,Farrah, Okay,,,150.1,response,0,1,4
387,Farrah, Thank you,,,150.1,response,0,1,4
387,Farrah, Yeah,,,150.1,response,0,1,4
387,Farrah,Yeah,,,150.1,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher,"So Chris, I wanted to speak to you about your response",,,,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,"Okay, you said that scientists found craters full of water in the moon",,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
387,Chris,"Yeah, I thought that was so cool",,,110.1,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher," Um, can you look at bullet number three and read the first sentence out to me",,,120.3,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher," Um, I wanted to point a specific area I wanted us to read together",,,120.3,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,"Yeah, that's interesting",,,120.3,remark,0,1,4
387,Chris, You said the first sentence,,,120.3,response,0,1,4
387,Chris, Okay,,,120.3,response,0,1,4
387,Chris, It says that means the moon is still drier than the dryest desert on Earth,,,120.3,response,0,1,4
387,Chris," Oh, part three",,,120.3,response,0,1,4
387,Chris,Okay,,,120.3,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher,When you think of a desert,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher," Do you think of what do you think, what do you see",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
387,Chris, And the sun beating down really hard and like cactuses and stuff,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
387,Chris,All like like lots of sand as far as the eye could see,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher,Yeah I noticed that you didn't,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher, You didn't mention any water,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,Do you want to rethink your response and see and see if that maybe makes sense to you that if the moon is drier than the driest desert,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher," Do you think there's water on the moon, a lot of water",,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
387,Chris,"Well, there's definitely water but",,,210.3,response,0,1,4
387,Chris,"Hackers maybe the craters are full of water, like I was kind of picturing that in my head that they were full of water like little pools, but I guess if it's like a desert, it must be a lot smaller and harder to see",,,,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher, So how about you take a deep read of the three points and see if you can figure out what equipment they might have used to get that really small bit of water out,,,120.1,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,Yeah,,,120.1,remark,0,1,4
387,Chris,"Okay, I'll read it",,,120.1,response,0,1,4

387,Jazmin,"Yes, I said that necessity",,,120.4,response,0,1,4
387,Jazmin," A small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,120.4,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher,Your answer is not wrong,,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher," That's not, that's not why you're in this group",,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher, I just wanted to talk to you a little bit more about that machine,,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher, And we read past that first sentence,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher, If we look at I'm at point two,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,Can you maybe think of what that machine did in order to get the water,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,Can you read the second sentence out loud to me,,,120.3,remark,0,1,4
387,Jazmin,"Okay, the second sentence on this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit handle large polar crater",,,120.3,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher, So what do you think that it's doing once it finds those ice deposits,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
387,Jazmin," Next, I don't think it's",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
387,Jazmin,"Don't really know because I know that it looks for them, but I don't really know what it does",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher, What do you think that might mean,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,"Yeah, it doesn't say that",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher, But if we read between the lines that I'm the machine is sent to go and look for them and then they're able to look at them underneath the microscope,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
387,Jazmin,Maybe they're studying it,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher,"Yeah, they're definitely studying it in order to find the water, um,",,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
387,Jazmin,So that's not answer right just the small machine,,,110.1,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher,"It's definitely your that's correct, that it was a small machine that they sent To find the ice deposits or just trying to look A little bit deeper into What the machine was doing in order to discover the water on the moon",,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
387,Jazmin," So, just add some more to my answer",,,110.2,response,0,1,4
387,Jazmin,"Oh, oh, okay",,,110.2,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher,"Yes, thank you",,,,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,0,1,4
387,Chris,Yeah,,,,response,0,1,4
387,Chris, So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,1,4
387,Chris," Well, I was thinking about equipment",,,,response,0,1,4
387,Chris," And actually, I went to NASA",,,,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher,"Yeah, they use a lot of different equipment in order to go on these missions to find out more about the solar system",,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,"So, did you find any anything in this text to backup that there was oxygen tanks",,,230.2,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,"When we read, we want to make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text",,,510.1,remark,0,1,4
387,Chris,"Oh, you mean the story",,,230.2,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,0,1,4
387,Chris,"No, it doesn't say oxygen tanks in the story",,,,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher," Um, so every single time that we're using information from a text in order to answer discussion question",,,520.1,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,Yeah,,,520.1,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher," We want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text, even though we might know a lot about the subject reading the text as our basis for discussion",,,520.1,remark,0,1,4
387,Teacher,So just keep that in mind,,,,remark,0,1,4
387,Chris,"So I need to pick up, pick up a piece of equipment from the story",,,,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,1,4
387,Chris, Yeah,,,,response,0,1,4
387,Chris,"Okay, that makes sense",,,,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher,Farrah and Oliver were you able to find out more information  through working together?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
387,Oliver, So thank you so much,,,120.4,response,0,1,4
387,Oliver,"On actually I just looked up clock and we have to build a lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for having us look back at the text and look for really detailed answers on that was really helpful",,,120.4,response,0,1,4
387,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,1,4
387,, Thank you for sharing your responses to,,,,,1,1,4
387,,"Hello, everybody",,,,,1,1,4
387,Teacher,I'm going to work with you in two different groups Farrah and Oliver,,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher, I'm going to start with you first,,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,To my question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,I was wondering if you could tell me where you what made you say your response have you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,230.2,remark,1,1,4
387,Luis," Excuse me, excuse me, I have my hand up",,,230.2,response,1,1,4
387,Luis,I'm,,,230.2,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher,Luis I will get back to you in one minute,,,110.1,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher, You can reread the passage right now,,,110.1,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher," Okay, thank you",,,,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,"Oh, okay",,,,remark,1,1,4
387,Farrah,Okay,,,,response,1,1,4
387,Farrah, So you asked us where where we found the microscope,,,,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher,Yep,,,,remark,1,1,4
387,Farrah,"Okay, so it's in part three, and it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher,"I was wondering if we could look a little bit deeper into the first, excuse me, the second paragraph and find out if there's a more specific tool that we can That you can use as evidence for this answer,",,,420.2,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,"Okay, that's great evidence to support it",,,310.1,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,I'm concerned that that we need to find something a little bit more specific,,,410.2,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,"Okay, can you two reread the second paragraph and see if that changes your answer",,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
387,Farrah,"Yeah okay, we can look at it",,,210.4,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher,"Okay, Chris Jazmin and Luis Luis You had a question for me earlier",,,,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher, Can I answer that for you,,,,remark,1,1,4
387,Luis,"Yes, please",,,,response,1,1,4
387,Luis," Um, so I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space",,,,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher,I know that you know a lot about space and I'm happy that you can bring that knowledge with you,,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher, I just wanted to work with the three of you to see if we can dig a little bit deeper into this question,,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,You all brought your background knowledge to answer this question and I'm happy that you are able to do that,,,310.1,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,I wanted to work with you three to look a little bit further into the question,,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,"I want you to reread it and think about what the most important part of the question is, and circle that okay?",,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
387,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.1,response,1,1,4
387,Farrah,"Okay, we looked at Part two again",,,,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher,"Okay, did you have any different thoughts",,,210.3,remark,1,1,4
387,Farrah," It talks about a machine, but I don't really understand why my answer is wrong",,,210.3,response,1,1,4
387,Farrah,"Well, I guess, in part two",,,210.3,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher,"Your answer isn't wrong because It answers the question, but we want to see if there's maybe a better answer",,,130.1,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher, Sometimes there's two answers and one of them's a little bit more specific,,,130.1,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher, The discovering is the aspect that we want to be focusing on,,,210.2,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher," So was the tool that they use to discover the microscope, or was it maybe the Lunar Orbiter",,,210.2,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,"So if we are trying to answer the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,1,1,4
387,Farrah,Oh well,,,210.2,response,1,1,4
387,Farrah,"I mean I guess I kind of thought it was the microscope, because if the water so small, how can you discover it until you can actually see",,,,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher,That's a really good point,,,310.1,remark,1,1,4
387,Oliver, I kind of agree because like,,,310.1,response,1,1,4
387,Oliver,"Yeah, I'm on the same page as Farrah here",,,310.1,response,1,1,4
387,Oliver,If you need,,,,response,1,1,4
387,Oliver," I, I guess",,,,response,1,1,4
387,Oliver,To discover it,,,,response,1,1,4
387,Oliver, Yeah,,,,response,1,1,4
387,Oliver,"That's why I picked a microscope, because it seems like that's the tool, you'd need to see it",,,,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher, So we're focusing on how they found the sample,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,"Yeah, in order to see it, you would need to but first they have, they have to find the sample to look at",,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,Can you find some evidence about how they found that first sample?,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
387,Oliver,"Oh, I, I don't see the word sample on in the story, but it talks about the",,,210.4,response,1,1,4
387,Oliver,Ice deposits,,,,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher, So how did they find those ice deposits,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
387,Oliver,Okay um they the lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits,,,210.4,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.3,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher," So, does that sound like an answer to the question that we are trying to answer",,,210.3,remark,1,1,4
387,Oliver," Yeah, that sounds like they use the Lunar Orbiter to help find the water, but I don't know if I would have picked it the first time",,,210.3,response,1,1,4
387,Oliver,"Um, I guess",,,210.3,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher,"Yeah, so that's why I wanted to pull you into this group so that we can have a little bit of a conversation about how to answer the question, fully",,,220.1,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,Jazmin Chris and Luis,,,,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,"What part of the question, did you pull out as being the most important part",,,210.2,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,1,1,4
387,Chris," So I know that scientists, they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,1,1,4
387,Chris," Well, I actually, I went to NASA",,,,response,1,1,4
387,Chris,"Okay, so I said the word equipment was the most important part and on",,,,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher, Since we're trying to use evidence from the reading to support it,,,410.3,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,"Yeah, they definitely use a lot of equipment when we want to make sure that when we're answering the question we focus on what we see in the reading",,,410.3,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,"So can you try and reread and think about what equipment, other than The oxygen tanks and masks they used to find the water on the moon?",,,430.3,remark,1,1,4
387,Chris,"Oh, so like equipment that's in the story",,,430.3,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,1,1,4
387,Chris,"Okay, yeah, I'll look at",,,,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher,Jazmin and Luis What did you pull out as being the most important part of the question,,,210.2,remark,1,1,4
387,Jazmin,I picked discover,,,210.2,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher,"Discover, why did you pick the term discover",,,230.1,remark,1,1,4
387,Jazmin,Because it sort of tells you what the machine what the equipment does,,,230.1,response,1,1,4
387,Jazmin,So that sounded that sounded important because it's like the action,,,,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher,Can you now take a look at the passage and see what that small machine that you brought up when you first,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher," Then, what, what was that doing was that maybe discovering something be able to",,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher, Thank you for for responding,,,110.4,remark,1,1,4
387,Teacher,Yeah definitely is very important,,,110.4,remark,1,1,4
387,Oliver," Before we go, I wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to listen to us and help us understand the importance of the word discover for our answers",,,210.4,response,1,1,4
387,Oliver, But before,,,210.4,response,1,1,4
387,Oliver," But, um, it's, it's actually time for us to go now",,,210.4,response,1,1,4
387,Oliver,"Come, I'm so sorry",,,210.4,response,1,1,4
387,Oliver,Thank you,,,,response,1,1,4
387,Teacher,Hello class,,,150.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, Thank you for joining our group today I wanted to start off by reading the question to everybody and then thinking about what the most important part of the question is,,,150.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,everybody take a second and think about what the most important part of that question is,,,420.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,"The question is, there is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, Thank you,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Luis I will answer your question in a minute,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Did everybody take a second to pre read the question and circle the most important part,,,420.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, Okay,,,420.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,"Jazmin, what did you say was the most important part of the question",,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
387,Luis,"I still have to say I just want to remind you, my dad is actually an astronaut",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher,"Well, thank you, Luis, that will definitely help our conversation",,,110.3,remark,2,1,4
387,Luis,I thought so that's why I had to say it,,,110.3,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Thank you,,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher," Jazmin, what were you gonna say was the most important part of the question",,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
387,Jazmin,"Okay, so I think the most important part of the question is evidence",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Evidence,,,130.2,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, Does anybody agree with Jazmin about evidence or does somebody have a different idea,,,130.2,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, Thank you,,,130.2,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Oliver?,,,,remark,2,1,4
387,Oliver,"Okay, well, um, I thought that the most important part of the question, was the word convincing because it seems like when you're thinking about the question you need to be convinced whether the water on the moon is going to be good",,,,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher,So while we're working together,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Great,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, I want you to to you all to keep those two points clear in your mind that you need evidence and that you need to be convinced,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, Those are two important aspects to focus on,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher," I want to, to ask you why you think that the water is not ready yet or isn't going to be for a long time",,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, What made you say that,,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Farrah and Oliver,,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Farrah, Part six because it says that in order to use the water it will take a lot of time and money,,,230.1,response,2,1,4
387,Farrah,"Well, I guess I think I got it from the last part of the of the story",,,230.1,response,2,1,4
387,Farrah, So it's not like they could just go to the moon and drink the water today,,,230.1,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Yeah,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher," It's, it's, um,",,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, Thank you for pointing that out,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Oliver,,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, What made you say that it's not ready yet?,,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,It's an important piece of evidence to point out that they will need Time and money to get the water on the moon,,,,remark,2,1,4
387,Oliver," Um, I think it was the part",,,,response,2,1,4
387,Oliver," And there, there wasn't that much water from like the first part of the story",,,,response,2,1,4
387,Oliver," Yeah, I'll kind of the same",,,,response,2,1,4
387,Oliver, Like Farrah sad,,,,response,2,1,4
387,Oliver,"Um, yeah",,,,response,2,1,4
387,Oliver," Yeah, at the end because it sounds like it's going to be really expensive",,,,response,2,1,4
387,Oliver,So it just seems like a waste of money,,,,response,2,1,4
387,Oliver, And it's just not ready,,,,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher, What exactly makes it be so expensive and take so much time for them to get the water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,"Yeah, so I see both of your points",,,310.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,"Um, I wanted to ask you to dive deeper into what would be required for their to find water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, Okay,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
387,Oliver,"Yeah, we'll do that",,,310.1,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,"Okay, um,",,,,remark,2,1,4
387,Jazmin,I have an idea,,,,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
387,Jazmin,"Well, I think you can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher, I wanted to speak with you about,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, I'm thinking about how,,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,"Yeah, that's, that's definitely something that could happen if there was enough water on the moon",,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, Okay,,,430.3,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, I'm concerned that you don't that you didn't read deep enough to see how how difficult it would be to get the water,,,430.3,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,How they would get to the water on the moon,,,430.3,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher," So I want you to take another look at the reading and see what evidence, you could find to Support it being worthwhile to get to the water on the moon, why it's so important to use all that time and effort and money to get to the water",,,430.3,remark,2,1,4
387,Jazmin, You want me to read it again,,,430.3,response,2,1,4
387,Jazmin,"Yeah, I'm sorry",,,430.3,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher, Read it again and think about why it would be worthwhile to spend the money and to use the time,,,420.3,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Yeah,,,420.3,remark,2,1,4
387,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.3,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
387,Chris,Water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen,,,120.4,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Yeah you and Luis both brought up points about the fact that water was heavy and that water can be broken down into two parts,,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,I wanted to clarify with you to what other functions of water are there,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Besides for drinking,,,,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher," Um, what other functions, water has",,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,And to find the evidence that it would make it worthwhile for them to mine for the water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,1,4
387,Luis, I got one,,,210.4,response,2,1,4
387,Luis,"Yeah, I got one",,,210.4,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher, Luis,,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Yes,,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
387,Luis,"Yeah, so I know you could drink it",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
387,Luis," Well, it doesn't sound like there's a lot",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
387,Luis, You could use it to make a rocket fuel,,,,response,2,1,4
387,Luis,"Of drinking, but it also said, Like what the hydrogen and oxygen",,,,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher,"Yeah, so that's one of the purposes that they That they pointed out",,,110.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, Does that mean that you think that it would be worthwhile or not to find it,,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,when you said just then that there wasn't a lot of it,,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Luis,"No, I didn't really think of that",,,230.1,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher, So remember when we first started we talked about the question and how it asked you to be convinced based on evidence that it's worthwhile,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Yeah,,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Do you think that that would convince you that it's worthwhile,,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Luis,"You know, I think the rocket fuel on the sounds pretty useful, but I think",,,230.1,response,2,1,4
387,Luis,"I might have to learn a little more about cars if that was more water, it might be useful",,,,response,2,1,4
387,Luis, That doesn't sound very useful,,,,response,2,1,4
387,Luis," But if it's only one, is it felt like a murmur four cups",,,,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Yeah,,,120.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher, So how about you look back into the passage and see if you can find any more information in any more research,,,120.1,remark,2,1,4
387,Teacher,"Oliver, you have a question",,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
387,Oliver,"Yeah, so, um, we have to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you because you listened to each one of our answers and you asked every one of us",,,120.4,response,2,1,4
387,Oliver," You asked us to think maybe wouldn't be so we all have to think about the question from both, both sides",,,,response,2,1,4
387,Oliver, You asked us to think maybe it could be,,,,response,2,1,4
387,Oliver, And if we said it was valuable,,,,response,2,1,4
387,Oliver, And that was really cool,,,,response,2,1,4
387,Oliver, Like if we said it wasn't valuable,,,,response,2,1,4
387,Oliver,To think about our answer in a new way,,,,response,2,1,4
387,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,2,1,4

388,Teacher, So thanks again for work,,,110.3,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"Well, that's actually awesome that you know about space because maybe you might you might know some things that you you your classmates don't even know",,,110.3,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher," So you can help, help me teach them about space and you might even learn some new things too",,,110.3,remark,0,0,4

388,Teacher,The question,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher," Let me ask you again, actually, who did you guys enjoy this",,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, Anyone want to share,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,See some head nods,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Chris,Here this is Chris,,,150.1,response,0,0,4
388,Chris," I thought it was really cool that scientists, they found craters full of water on the moon",,,150.1,response,0,0,4
388,Chris,I never knew that before,,,,response,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"anyone else take anything from the text that was the main idea, but anything anyone else notice anything or think anything was cool",,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"Yeah, so really cool thing",,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,Oliver,,,140.1,remark,0,0,4

388,Oliver,Thank you,,,140.1,response,0,0,4
388,Oliver,"Well, I just thought it was really interesting that the moon was a desert, because I never really thought about like what the moon was made off on like what what it felt like and looked like and stuff",,,,response,0,0,4
388,Teacher," I think we all see the moon as something far away and we hear certain things about it and we see pictures, you know, the big round objects with the craters",,,140.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,I agree,,,140.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,But we never think about how it would be to actually exist,,,140.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, There are walk around on the moon,,,140.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, So I agree with you,,,140.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, I think that's a really cool thing,,,140.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, We were asked you guys what equipment and sciences us to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,So does anyone,,,120.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,So let's talk about the prompt,,,120.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, I have any ideas about that,,,120.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, Does anyone want to volunteer in a response to that question,,,120.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, Go ahead,,,,remark,0,0,4
388,Farrah,"I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"Jazmin,, Go ahead, thanks for raising your hand",,,,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"Hmm, that's a good answer",,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, Does anyone else have any any any ideas about that before we get into talking about it?,,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Jazmin,"Well,",,,110.1,response,0,0,4
388,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine didn't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,0,0,4
388,Teacher, So I'll go back to submit,,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher," So that is the answer the question for us, but I'll come to yours",,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher," So your answer was, I'm going to look back at at the answers you guys bad",,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"Hmm, okay",,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"So she said, you need a scientific tool called a Microsoft to look really closely",,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"That's actually a good answer, because it talks about the water they found on the, on the, on the moon was microscopic",,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,so actually like that at this moment that's not exactly what the the object that they use is called,,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, So I like that answer,,,310.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"but that's a good answer, because it does refers to something back in the text",,,310.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,But we're looking for,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"And Jazmin, you said NASA sense a small machine",,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher," Okay, and you know it you're actually correct",,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, But,,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, Does anyone remember what that's called,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, This is this specific name of that machine,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,That's a great place to start as and thank you,,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,Does anyone remember what it's called,,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Luis, It's called,,,130.2,response,0,0,4
388,Luis,"Yeah, I got this",,,130.2,response,0,0,4
388,Luis, It's called Lunar Orbiter,,,,response,0,0,4
388,Luis,A lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,0,4
388,Teacher,Or good Luis I like that it's out prefer if you raise your hand so we can keep that same routine gone but thank you,,,110.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, You're correct,,,110.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher," So, good job",,,110.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, Can you guys just remind me,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,And can someone remind me exactly what a lunar orbiter does,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, What did they use it for just,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, So like you said,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, They said the small machine,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,Go ahead,,,,remark,0,0,4
388,Oliver,"Well, I guess story",,,,response,0,0,4
388,Oliver," It says they use it to investigate but but I circled the same as Farrah about the microscope, because you need that because the water is so small, like",,,,response,0,0,4
388,Oliver,Can you find that if you can't even see it,,,,response,0,0,4
388,Teacher, So that's actually a great connection you made because since the water so microscopic maybe us humans can't see it,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"Well, that's a great point",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, So the lunar orbiter is in helping investigate,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, So we need to use that piece of technology to find the water,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher," Where's the, where's the water exactly on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,Does anyone remember,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, What part of the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4

388,Chris,Yeah,,,130.2,response,0,0,4
388,Chris,"RER: I can because, yeah, go ahead, go ahead, American",,,,response,0,0,4
388,Chris," Yeah, that's my answer",,,,response,0,0,4
388,Chris,They found the water in the craters and they found the craters full of water,,,,response,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"So yes, that they're in these big craters",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher," The large polar craters, but the so the ice deposits are in the creators",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, So,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,I like your,,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, That's a good answer,,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"I like to answer their they're in the craters and we, the amount of water, however, like Farrah said is microscopic",,,410.3,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher," So we need to use that scientific tool called, like you said, a microscope to look at the water really closely",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"It's very, very, very small",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Chris, And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
388,Chris," Well, I went to NASA",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
388,Chris,Go ahead,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
388,Teacher, Absolutely,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,Hmm,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, They do,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, Those are all part of the process of going up to the moon and using the Lunar Orbiter to find the end the microphone and a microscope To find the small amounts of water in the crater,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, We didn't necessarily talk about in this text,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, Or in this section of the text,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"So that's actually, I'm glad you said that because that's part of the process",,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, So thank you for adding that,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,But that is exactly something that's a big part of it as well,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher," I just want to come together and see if someone can give me A refined answer from what the what everything we just talked about, like, another answer maybe building on the original answer that you had to the question",,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"I just want to, uh, before I wrap it up",,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"So I'm going to say the question one more time, which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,So I wanted someone to elaborate on their first answer,,,120.1,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, Go ahead,,,,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, Thank you for volunteering,,,,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"Let's see who we can, we got here, Jazmin",,,,remark,0,0,4
388,Jazmin,I can try,,,,response,0,0,4
388,Jazmin, And then they had to use a microscope and the astronauts also use all the stuff that Chris talked about too,,,,response,0,0,4
388,Jazmin,So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,0,4
388,Teacher,Absolutely,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, Great job,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"So, they, they, the scientists, they go into the moon and they use the Lunar Orbiter to find the the water which is in the craters",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher," So again, great",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"And then there's a microscopic amount of water, super, super, super, super small",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher," Like, what Farrah their first answer using the microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, Think about a desert,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher," The, the text itself",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, When you think about the climate of the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"They need to use a microscope to be able to see the water, the small amounts of water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher," So again, if you if you're thinking about now going forward",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, Said that the moon is drier than the dry desert on Earth,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, So when you think of like the feeling of the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, Think of that,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, It feels like a desert,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher, That's something that can help you remember this information,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,So even if you think as a moon because it's in space as like dark and it might look different than the desert,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
388,Teacher,"So yeah, I think you guys did a great job with the text Oliver",,,110.1,remark,0,0,4

388,Teacher,There are many volunteers,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
388,Farrah,"Um, I said that she would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.4,response,1,0,4
388,Teacher, What made you say that as your answer what stuff,,,230.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,I actually have a follow up question for you,,,230.1,remark,1,0,4

388,Teacher," Um, what made you",,,230.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Farrah,So it's in,,,230.1,response,1,0,4
388,Farrah, It's in paragraph three,,,230.1,response,1,0,4
388,Farrah,And they talked about a tool called a microscope and they talked about how the ice was really small,,,,response,1,0,4
388,Farrah,And so you can all see it if you didn't have a microscope,,,,response,1,0,4
388,Teacher," So you really focus on the word microscope, that's something that you really focused on",,,230.3,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,"Ah, OK",,,230.3,remark,1,0,4
388,Farrah,"Yeah, because",,,230.3,response,1,0,4

388,Teacher," It is a tool, you're correct",,,110.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, I'll keep that in note and I'm going to move on to someone else and see what they had,,,110.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, So let's right let's write that down,,,110.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, But thank you for volunteering,,,110.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,Can I have another volunteer to tell me what they said,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,"Yes, Chris, nice to hear from you",,,,remark,1,0,4
388,Chris,"Yeah, so I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,,response,1,0,4
388,Teacher,Full of water on the moon good observation,,,110.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, What made you focus on that specific part in relation to the question that it was asking,,,230.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,So I'm also going to follow the same question for you,,,230.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher," Yes, I remember that from the text as well",,,110.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, Good job,,,110.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Chris,"Oh well, okay",,,110.2,response,1,0,4
388,Chris," So in part one, they talk about",,,110.2,response,1,0,4
388,Chris,Water can be found deep within the moon's polar crater,,,,response,1,0,4
388,Teacher, Good,,,110.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,Hmm,,,110.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, Remembering yes it does say that,,,110.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher," So that's a great piece of information that we can actually all use To help answer the question, even better,",,,110.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,even though I did like your answer,,,130.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, I think we can do even better job of answering the question,,,130.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher," I'm gonna ask one more person for what their answer was, so I can gather all this information, we can use it to work together to find an even better answer",,,220.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,"So, thank you",,,220.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,Jazmin go ahead,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
388,Jazmin,"Okay, well, I said that, yes, I sent a small machine and don't understand why my answers wrong",,,120.4,response,1,0,4
388,Teacher," There's always extra information, we can find in different language that we could use To answer the question even better",,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, I would just say that it's something that we can improve on,,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,"Well, I wouldn't say it's wrong",,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,So I'm glad you said that,,,230.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher," So I'm going to follow up with you with the same question I had, which event and Chris, what exactly what language or what part of that",,,230.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher," Did you see and think, oh, that's the answer to the prompt that has given me",,,230.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Jazmin,Well they talked about it in part two,,,230.2,response,1,0,4
388,Jazmin, And I guess I know I was looking for some kind of equipment from the question and a small machine,,,230.2,response,1,0,4
388,Jazmin, That's where I found my answer,,,230.2,response,1,0,4
388,Jazmin,Seemed like a piece of equipment and and they described describe how it looks for ice,,,,response,1,0,4
388,Teacher, So that's a great process,,,510.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,So that's great that's a great segue,,,510.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher," So what I wanted to ask you guys, next because you just gave specific evidence of what the question said  And you analyze that and picked an answer, based off that specifically",,,510.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, So I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you guys a question again,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, So Chris go ahead,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, And I think that's something that we could all use,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,Teacher:,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
388,Chris, So I went to NASA,,,120.4,response,1,0,4
388,Chris, And I know that scientists use all sorts of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks,,,120.4,response,1,0,4
388,Chris,"Oh, yeah",,,120.4,response,1,0,4
388,Teacher,You've gotta go ahead,,,,remark,1,0,4
388,Chris, I just saw all this stuff at NASA,,,,response,1,0,4
388,Chris, And so since we're talking about equipment,,,,response,1,0,4
388,Chris,"Oh yeah, no, that's it",,,,response,1,0,4
388,Chris, I was thinking that they probably used all that stuff,,,,response,1,0,4
388,Teacher,"So that's a great observation, but to that, I would say we need to focus on the specific question that it's asking so it's asking us",,,410.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,What equipment do they use for this specific job so they do have different kinds of equipment that they use for different things,,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,"But it's important to look at the language of the question and say, oh, is this the is this, am I looking for an oxygen tank",,,420.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, Is that going to help them find water?,,,420.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,Or is it something else that I actually can see in the text,,,110.3,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, We have a lot of experts in this class,,,110.3,remark,1,0,4

388,Teacher, One more time,,,120.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,So the next thing I would ask you is when you read the actual question I'm going to read the prompt,,,120.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, Okay,,,410.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, Okay,,,410.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, So I'm going to give you guys 20 seconds 30 seconds to think about it,,,410.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, And that word should be the one that will help you find the answer to the question,,,410.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher, And then I'm going to ask someone to volunteer,,,410.1,remark,1,0,4
388,Teacher,So I want to ask all of you guys take 20 seconds 30 seconds to think: What word what one word jumps out to you when you read that question,,,410.1,remark,1,0,4

388,Teacher," Now you can raise your hand, but I will wait 15 seconds to let everybody think",,,420.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,"And identify one word to focus on that when you go back into the text, you can use that word to think about to help you answer the prompt or the question, if you have an answer ready for me",,,420.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Luis, But I just wanted to remind you that my dad is actually an astronaut,,,420.1,response,2,0,4

388,Chris, What equipment to find water on the moon,,,130.2,response,2,0,4
388,Teacher, We can have different answers,,,130.2,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher," I like that, too",,,130.2,remark,2,0,4

388,Jazmin,Discover,,,130.2,response,2,0,4
388,Teacher," So we have equipment we have water we have discovered, we put all those things together",,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,Good discover,,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,I think we have the perfect three words so we can combine the words you guys all said: equipment to discover water,,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, I'm going to give you guys two minutes to read the text,,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,"Okay, so that's what I want you to think about when you go back into the text",,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, I want you to have a revised answer,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,And when you come out of that,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,"So maybe your answer is already right but maybe I want a little more, maybe your answer is not really right",,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, And you can just change it completely,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, So go back into the text,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,Two minutes and read and just and while you're reading you can highlight underlined some words that might help you but I want a sentence for out of everybody for a revised answer,,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,"Ready, set, go",,,,remark,2,0,4
388,Jazmin,Can I ask something,,,,response,2,0,4
388,Teacher, Go ahead,,,,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,Absolutely,,,,remark,2,0,4
388,Jazmin, But I don't know how to fix my answer cuz i don't i don't know why it's wrong because I picked the equipment to discover so what do I do?,,,,response,2,0,4
388,Jazmin,I know you want us to reread again,,,,response,2,0,4
388,Teacher,"So for you, I would say, Read we read that part and see if you can add another like detail on to it",,,420.2,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,"Maybe think about The equipment's looking for water, but maybe",,,420.2,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher," Where's the water or maybe something to that effect, we can really make a more detailed answer",,,420.2,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher," So maybe, maybe some new information that people found to help me answer the prompt",,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,"Alright, I see people looking up",,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, So I think we're gonna I'm gonna ask for some provide answers,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,Any volunteers,,,,remark,2,0,4
388,Jazmin,I guess I can try,,,,response,2,0,4
388,Jazmin,To add more detail for my answer,,,,response,2,0,4
388,Jazmin, So I guess I would say on that the equipment they use to sign the water was a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,,response,2,0,4
388,Jazmin,So when I looked at again,,,,response,2,0,4
388,Jazmin, I found a few details about the machine and it said the center small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,2,0,4
388,Teacher, I love how you went back and you found specific you even found even more evidence than you already had that was very impressive,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,Great answer,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, Jazmin,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, And what it did was it three great things,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, He told us what equipment they use and what it was called,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, That was awesome,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, Thank you for that,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, I love your answer,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, Go ahead,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,"Anyone else have any information that they can share with me, Oliver",,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, Exactly,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,And you use that to make a complete answer,,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Oliver," Um, so using those three words we picked, I would say the equipment to discover the water was a microscope",,,210.3,response,2,0,4
388,Oliver, Okay,,,210.3,response,2,0,4
388,Oliver, Yep,,,210.3,response,2,0,4
388,Oliver,I,,,210.3,response,2,0,4
388,Teacher,What made you say that?,,,230.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Oliver," Remember, yeah, it's in paragraph three, and it says",,,230.1,response,2,0,4
388,Oliver,Paragraph three,,,230.1,response,2,0,4
388,Oliver,That says on waters microscopic and you need a microscope to see it's so the equipment used to discover water was a microscope,,,,response,2,0,4
388,Oliver," Oh,",,,,response,2,0,4
388,Teacher,"Yes, it's that so it said that if we're reading the text it says the water they found is very microscopic microscopic means small right?",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,"Yeah, so it says",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, It says it will you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,So we're actually looking for the piece of equipment that they use to find the water,,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,"So we need to look at that word discover, and you wouldn't be able to get to the water, unless you had this Lunar Orbiter",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, That would be like the best answer I can ever ask for,,,130.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,So I think if you included a microscope in your and your answer with the Lunar Orbiter,,,130.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher," And if you want it bad microscope, you can",,,130.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,But it's important that we add that we have both things,,,130.1,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, Okay,,,130.3,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,But the thing that we're really looking forward to the Lunar Orbiter,,,130.3,remark,2,0,4
388,Oliver,Okay,,,130.3,response,2,0,4
388,Oliver, Can I do another answer,,,130.3,response,2,0,4
388,Oliver," Um, can I try again",,,130.3,response,2,0,4
388,Teacher,I would love for you can do that,,,,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,2,0,4
388,Oliver, I would say the equipment to discover the water was first a lunar orbiter and then a microscope,,,,response,2,0,4
388,Oliver,"Okay, so I would say if I was putting it all together",,,,response,2,0,4
388,Teacher,Great,,,130.2,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher," So you could say they discovered the water, let's bring this to a consensus, I think only have like 30 seconds or a minute left",,,130.2,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,So to wrap this all up,,,130.2,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, And we use the information we we went back and discovered,,,130.2,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, It's important that we're on the same page,,,130.2,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,"To put into one general idea to answer this question, so also the question more time what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,And what I heard from you guys is that they used a lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon,,,110.4,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, I think someone mentioned that great piece of information,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,That was in that was in lunar craters,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,And the water is microscopic it's so small that they might even need a microscope to find that water,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher," They might have had to use a microscope, because there's such small amounts of water",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, So even when they got there with the Lunar Orbiter,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, We have for the answers,,,,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, Go ahead,,,,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,So that's the idea,,,,remark,2,0,4
388,Oliver,"Oh, yeah",,,,response,2,0,4
388,Oliver,"It sounds like you're wrapping up and we have to go to lunch to, um, but you can finish what you were saying",,,,response,2,0,4
388,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, Yes,,,,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, I just wanted to complete that general idea,,,,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher," And I also wanted to say it was a pleasure working with you guys and I'm, I'm glad that you guys are students who are willing to not only",,,,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher,"Put an effort to rethinking your answer, but also to formulate it into a new idea because taking a new information as part of the part of being a good student and you guys are all doing that",,,,remark,2,0,4
388,Teacher, So thank you,,,,remark,2,0,4
388,Oliver, So we could make with all of the details that we need,,,,response,2,0,4

404,Teacher,I'm so impressed all set to go,,,150.1,remark,0,,
404,Teacher,Because sometimes when there's so much information in the text,,,220.1,remark,0,,
404,Teacher, We want to make sure we know what we're looking for with information,,,220.1,remark,0,,
404,Teacher,So one tool to help us is to make sure we look at the question really carefully that's going to give us some clues or some science to what look for,,,150.1,remark,0,,
404,Teacher,Oliver,,,150.1,remark,0,,
404,Teacher,So our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,,
404,Teacher, Do you remember that question from yesterday,,,150.1,remark,0,,
404,Oliver,"Yeah, yeah, I do",,,150.1,response,0,,

404,Teacher,I would like you some of the tools that help us focus ourselves to make sure we're finding the information and our reading is to look at the question in this and figure out what is it asking us,,,420.1,remark,0,,
404,Teacher, So I'd like you to take a minute,,,420.1,remark,0,,
404,Teacher, What you think is the most important word in the question that's going to help us know what to look for,,,420.1,remark,0,,
404,Teacher,Take your take your pencil and circle,,,420.1,remark,0,,
404,Teacher, So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,420.1,remark,0,,
404,Teacher,So what's one important word take a minute and circle that on your question and I'm going to ask you what you circled,,,420.1,remark,0,,
404,Teacher,Chris's all set,,,,remark,0,,
404,Teacher, I see your hand hairs to,,,,remark,0,,

404,Teacher,"Okay, well, you know, I think these words are going to really help us when we're looking",,,210.2,remark,0,,
404,Teacher, We're looking for this information in the test,,,210.2,remark,0,,
404,Teacher, So what if we turn those words into the beginning of a statement and figure out if the rest of the information is in the text,,,420.2,remark,0,,
404,Teacher," So, Oliver",,,420.2,remark,0,,
404,Teacher," What's up,",,,420.2,remark,0,,

405,Teacher, Okay,,,150.1,remark,0,,
405,Teacher,I see that you understand a little about what a microscope is and but I'm a little concerned,,,410.3,remark,0,,
405,Teacher,"That while the microscope is a tool, but it didn't really discover the water on the moon",,,410.3,remark,0,,
405,Teacher,So can you go back to the text and think about the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,remark,0,,
405,Teacher,So I suggest you go back to the text and maybe underline what you find again,,,420.3,remark,0,,

405,Teacher, Are you able to tell me what the question is,,,410.1,remark,0,,
405,Teacher,But I'm a little concerned that you did not connect the question to the text,,,410.1,remark,0,,
405,Luis,"Yeah, it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,410.1,response,0,,
405,Teacher, So now I suggest that the two of you go back to the text and circle the answer your new answer after looking for that,,,120.1,remark,0,,
405,Teacher, Are you able to do that for me,,,120.1,remark,0,,
405,Teacher, Yes,,,120.1,remark,0,,
405,Teacher,Great,,,120.1,remark,0,,

405,Teacher," And so even though that's an equipment, you're going to be looking for",,,410.2,remark,0,,
405,Teacher, Luis So Luis You talked about scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,410.2,remark,0,,
405,Teacher,"Yes, a new answer",,,410.2,remark,0,,
405,Teacher," So that's a great detail that you found, but I think you need to look for a little bit more detail",,,410.2,remark,0,,
405,Teacher,Another the main equipment,,,410.2,remark,0,,
405,Teacher, Okay,,,410.2,remark,0,,

405,Teacher,I liked where the path that you were taking but I'm a little concerned that you need just a little bit more detail in your answer,,,410.2,remark,0,,
405,Teacher, Something else that links with that to help further your answer,,,420.2,remark,0,,
405,Teacher,So I suggest you go back to the text underline what answer you just gave me and then I want you to circle,,,420.2,remark,0,,
405,Teacher, Can you do that for me,,,420.2,remark,0,,
405,Jazmin,"Okay, my answer and then circle start",,,420.2,response,0,,

405,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,,
405,Teacher,"Farrah, and Oliver were you able to find a little bit more information about what equipment",,,210.3,remark,0,,
405,Teacher,Did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,remark,0,,
405,Farrah,We looked at it all in,,,,response,0,,
405,Farrah," Well, I mean, I still feel like my answer was right",,,,response,0,,
405,Teacher,Mm hmm,,,,remark,0,,
405,Oliver,Yeah me too,,,,response,0,,
405,Teacher,Was there any other equipment that was used in the text,,,210.4,remark,0,,

405,Farrah,"Um, well, I mean, when I was looking at it",,,210.4,response,0,,
405,Teacher,"Okay, tell me a little bit more about that machine that you read about",,,210.4,remark,0,,
405,Farrah,"Oh, okay",,,210.4,response,0,,
405,Farrah," It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will end at the South Pole and look for ice deposits or large pool of crater",,,210.4,response,0,,
405,Farrah," These two positives, very small",,,210.4,response,0,,
405,Teacher,"Okay, so do you believe that this could have been part of the equipment that was used to discover water on the moon",,,210.3,remark,0,,
405,Farrah,"I mean, I'm",,,210.3,response,0,,
405,Farrah, It also talks about them looking for water with a microscope so,,,,response,0,,
405,Farrah,"Like, it could be",,,,response,0,,
405,Farrah," But, but the question asks about water and I'm in my part",,,,response,0,,
405,Farrah,And I don't see anything about water in this,,,,response,0,,
405,Teacher,"Okay, so what we're, we will take a little bit more time and dig into that in a bit",,,150.1,remark,0,,
405,Teacher,But I think I want you to know that you are on the right track with the lunar Lunar Orbiter,,,420.3,remark,0,,
405,Teacher," Well, yes, Chris",,,420.3,remark,0,,
405,Teacher," Okay, so read a little bit more, and maybe take some time to underline some key words in your Texts",,,420.3,remark,0,,
405,Chris,"I went to NASA, which I know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks suits",,,420.3,response,0,,
405,Teacher,"Yes, that's awesome",,,110.1,remark,0,,
405,Teacher, We can talk about your experience and you can share that with the class,,,110.1,remark,0,,
405,Teacher, And maybe at another time,,,110.1,remark,0,,
405,Teacher, I think that they would learn a lot for me,,,110.1,remark,0,,

405,Chris,Okay,,,,response,0,,
405,Chris," Um, yeah",,,,response,0,,
412,Teacher,"Alright class, so I heard all your answers and I thought you know I really liked how you put a lot of thought into it",,,110.1,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,But how about we look once again at the text you know,,,120.3,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,What is I yes Luis,,,,remark,0,1,
412,Luis,"um yeah excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,"Oh well, you know the great thing about being in groups is that you might know a lot about space somebody else might",,,150.1,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,"not know as much, but then tomorrow when we're covering biology, you know somebody might know all about the jungle and you know you might not know as much so we kind of all help each other, learn that way",,,,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,But so i'm curious if we can look through the text again,,,120.3,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,"and see the exact name like if anybody can help me find the exact name of the machine that they use to detect the water, how you talk over it for about two minutes",,,210.4,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,And whenever somebody thinks they have the answer just raise your hand and i'll call on you,,,150.1,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,0,1,
412,Farrah,"Okay, so um the name for the equipment that I found is microscope",,,,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,See um well I do see that the size of the water they found was actually microscopic but,,,210.4,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,"If we look in paragraph two, can do you see any other name of a machine",,,120.1,remark,0,1,
412,Farrah,um,,,120.1,response,0,1,
412,Farrah,"Well Okay, you said, part two, on it says a small machine called a lunar orbiter I don't know what that is",,,,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,"yeah well that's the cool thing about this text, so it kind of explains it um Chris, do you mind reading section two out loud",,,120.3,remark,0,1,
412,Chris,On yeah I can do that okay,,,120.3,response,0,1,
412,Chris,It says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small,,,,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,awesome Thank you so much so that kind of shows you that the machine that they were using is called the Lunar orbiter kind of describes what it does,,,130.3,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,"And you know what's been I was wrong i'm sorry about that I just realized that said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so the microscope was part of the equipment, so you are also right, so thank you for that as well",,,110.2,remark,0,1,
412,Farrah,Okay,,,110.2,response,0,1,
412,Farrah,So they're both the right answer yep,,,,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,They both have the right answer they're both,,,110.2,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,"they're both part of the equipment that was used see yeah yeah because you need the microscope to see the water, since it was so small",,,210.4,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,0,1,
412,Jazmin,"yeah so i'm wondering That was my answer that NASA such a small machine, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,um well your answer actually isn't wrong they're both right because the small machine the Lunar orbiter and also the microscope were both correct so that was just all the equipment they used,,,110.2,remark,0,1,
412,Jazmin,"Oh Okay, so if I just put NASA sent a small machine then i'm right",,,110.2,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,"Well, you are right, but I also just want you to be able to you know, see the bigger picture and kind of say that was one part of the equipment, but",,,150.1,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,you know because they probably couldn't have done it just with the Lunar orbiter so they needed the microscope as well,,,130.3,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,You know what else did they use,,,210.3,remark,0,1,
412,Jazmin,Oh OK so it's kind of like they a tool like work together,,,210.3,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,Exactly yep exactly yeah what did what would you have said Chris What was your answer the second time you,,,120.4,remark,0,1,
412,Chris,"Well, so well, my first answer was scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,120.4,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,Sure yep yeah,,,,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,"Oh, did you have a second answer, maybe or any thoughts new thoughts that came to mind after reading through it",,,120.4,remark,0,1,
412,Chris,yeah well actually I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,120.4,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,"and now, what about you Luis did you, you know learn anything new from this paragraph, I know you love space, but you know",,,210.4,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,Oh cool,,,110.1,remark,0,1,
412,Luis,"um yeah I mean, so my answer was kind of like what Chris just pass I said, scientists, he has a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,110.1,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,"yeah cool and how are you deaf did you, you know have anything that you learned from this paragraph and maybe anything about the equipment that scientists use",,,210.4,remark,0,1,
412,Oliver,"On your so well, I said the same thing I said about the microscope and I guess i'm just not quite sure why you need to have both on",,,210.4,response,0,1,
412,Oliver,"Both the orbiter and the microscope because I mean the question asked her about what equipment they use to discover the water, and I still think of some microscope, because how can you discover something if you can't even see it",,,,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,"yeah well that's you know I think that's kind of like the bigger question here, I think the orbiter was part of the first step, they had the thought I wonder if there's water on the moon, they sent the orbiter to kind of you know",,,210.4,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,"Just do the initial discovery or initial I guess investigation and then the microscope was really what cinch the deal, and what",,,210.4,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,"You know they looked really closely once the orbiter got the larger body of evidence that there could be water, so I think they you know they both work together",,,210.4,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,0,1,
412,Oliver,yeah so that's kind of like they use First they use the Lunar orbiter and then I use a microscope,,,150.1,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,yep exactly you said it perfectly yeah,,,110.1,remark,0,1,
412,Oliver,Thanks,,,110.1,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,"So Luis did you did you like reading over this paragraph, or you know, did you find it interesting or any thoughts",,,140.1,remark,0,1,
412,Luis,"yeah I thought it was a really interesting because I didn't actually know that there was water on the moon, before I read this and I thought it was so cool how they sent that lunar orbiter",,,140.1,response,0,1,
412,Luis,"And it was like this robot that found the water for them, I really want to help make something like that one day cool",,,,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,yeah and Jazmin like was this the spark any interest in you or yes,,,140.1,remark,0,1,
412,Oliver,"i'm i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us see both the big picture and the sort of specifics of the equipment um That was a really helpful way, to put it Thank you so much",,,140.1,response,0,1,
412,Teacher,"You guys, this has been wonderful",,,,remark,0,1,
412,Teacher,So I liked your answers class I liked the line of thinking,,,110.1,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,But OK so Farrah let's think about I like that you said microscope that was part of the equipment they use,,,110.2,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,let's look a little bit earlier in the text and see if they use anything else to to find the water,,,120.1,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,Can you can you read a little bit earlier in the text for me?,,,120.3,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,1,1,

412,Teacher,"Oh well, you know that's the great part about being in a group, we all have different strengths, we bring to it, so you may know a lot about space, but you know I think there's always something you can learn",,,150.1,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,"So, Svaannah have you found anything yet about an any other equipment?",,,120.4,remark,1,1,

412,Chris,"edu: Okay, it investigated and it looked for ice deposits",,,,response,1,1,
412,Teacher, So there seems like there's two steps to this right? there's first the investigation period with the Lunar orbiter and,,,210.4,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,"cool so that's kind of, what do we think class? that's kind of the first step",,,210.4,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,Jazmin can you explain what the microscope did like what they use the microscope to do in this process,,,210.4,remark,1,1,

412,Jazmin,edu: let's see for this one these it to look really closely at the water,,,,response,1,1,
412,Jazmin,harvard,,,,response,1,1,
412,Teacher,yeah so,,,,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,"Oliver, can you kind of explain - it seems like there's two parts, Do you kind of see what i'm saying here there's two parts to this with the Lunar orbiter and the microscope",,,210.4,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher," Can you explain to the class, you know how those two work together?",,,210.4,remark,1,1,
412,Oliver,harvard,,,210.4,response,1,1,
412,Oliver,edu: Okay um so what you said is that um,,,210.4,response,1,1,
412,Oliver,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,210.4,response,1,1,
412,Oliver,harvard,,,,response,1,1,
412,Oliver,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,,response,1,1,
412,Oliver,edu: Farrah was right and Jazmin what Jazmin read and Chris read was right too,,,,response,1,1,
412,Oliver,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,,response,1,1,
412,Oliver,edu: because there are two pieces of equipment: lunar orbiter and a microscope,,,,response,1,1,
412,Oliver,harvard,,,,response,1,1,
412,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,"Yeah, yeah so there's two, so I think it could be seen, like the Lunar orbiter went first and did the big picture work to see if there was water and then the microscope came in afterward and did the more smaller picture",,,130.3,remark,1,1,
412,Farrah,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,130.3,response,1,1,
412,Farrah,edu: I still don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,130.3,response,1,1,
412,Farrah,harvard,,,130.3,response,1,1,
412,Teacher,"and the Lunar orbiter could be seen as the bigger picture, so the Lunar orbiter they're both the pieces of equipment that the scientists use to look for water",,,130.3,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,Well your answer is actually not wrong it's just half of the piece,,,130.1,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher, So yours was more of the smaller picture,,,130.1,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,Okay cool,,,,remark,1,1,
412,Farrah, Yeah,,,150.1,response,1,1,
412,Farrah,Yeah,,,150.1,response,1,1,

412,Farrah,harvard,,,,response,1,1,
412,Farrah,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,,response,1,1,
412,Teacher,yeah so Luis did you learn anything from this from this reading,,,120.4,remark,1,1,

412,Luis,harvard,,,,response,1,1,
412,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,What did you think about the you know,,,,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,The potential uses of water? Was that exciting? or like did you think it would be useful if there was water on the moon?,,,210.4,remark,1,1,
412,Luis,harvard,,,210.4,response,1,1,
412,Luis,"edu: Well mean I think any place that there's water would be good, because people always get thirsty and they want to drink stuff",,,210.4,response,1,1,
412,Luis,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,210.4,response,1,1,
412,Luis,edu: Yeah,,,,response,1,1,

412,Luis,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,,response,1,1,
412,Teacher,Of course,,,,remark,1,1,
412,Chris,edu: You know I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,1,1,
412,Chris,harvard,,,,response,1,1,
412,Chris,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,,response,1,1,
412,Teacher,yeah so,,,,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,I mean technically those would all be part of the like the equipment that the scientists use for this discovery of water let's think,,,110.2,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,Did you think of could you think of any reasons besides just drinking that the water like looking at the text that water on the moon could be helpful,,,210.4,remark,1,1,
412,Chris,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,210.4,response,1,1,
412,Chris,harvard,,,210.4,response,1,1,
412,Chris,"edu: Wait um so teacher, I didn't I didn't write the microscope or the Lunar orbiter in mine so",,,210.4,response,1,1,
412,Chris,"edu: I guess I don't know what's wrong with my answer, or how to fix my answer",,,,response,1,1,
412,Chris,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,,response,1,1,
412,Chris,harvard,,,,response,1,1,
412,Teacher,"Oh okay so um you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon well, so your answer was true it wasn't wrong",,,110.2,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,But the question was specifically asking what equipment they used to discover the water,,,210.2,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,so that's why you know the Lunar orbiter and the microscope were kind of the more accurate answer to the question,,,130.3,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,"but technically, your answer was right they did find -oh i'm sorry they",,,110.2,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,found craters of water so,,,,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,look back i'm looking back at the text as well,,,,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,"So they actually yes look let's look back at the text together the ice deposits are very small so so I guess you did say that the they found craters full of water, and there the text says that there was actually very small ice deposits",,,210.4,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,"and actually the total quantity of water on the top layer of the moon's surface is only about the equivalent to the amount of water, you or I would drink in a day, so you know actually I like the spirit, you know you tried to answer the question, but unfortunately",,,210.4,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,and it says that there's it's drier than the driest desert on earth so yeah,,,210.4,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,Does that kind of make more sense about where you're kind of going and what we're looking for with the question?,,,150.1,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,You know there's actually very little water really on the moon,,,410.3,remark,1,1,
412,Chris,Um,,,210.4,response,1,1,
412,Chris,"edu: I guess you're seeing that the it wasn't a lot of water, but I guess well I got mine from a paragraph and it saysum they found water water that can be found deep within the moon's polar craters and if I go swimming and in the deep in the deep end of the pool that's not a lot more water",,,,response,1,1,
412,Chris,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse,,,,response,1,1,
412,Chris,harvard,,,,response,1,1,
412,Teacher,that's true well,,,,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,"that's more of like I know you mean i've been in i've been in like a crater like swimming as well, but that's different than on",,,140.1,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,A moon crater you know those are deep craters but they only found a small quantity of water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,
412,Teacher,Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,1,1,
412,Chris,edu: yeah yeah I guess,,,150.1,response,1,1,

414,Oliver,Hello,,,,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,um so I know that we just talked about this question right what equipment and scientists use discover water on the moon and Luis,,,120.2,remark,0,0,
414,Luis,um yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,120.2,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,So even if you know all about space right I think it's still useful to be able to read articles like this and find evidence for questions that we're trying to answer so hopefully you'll still get something out of this group today does that sound okay,,,150.1,remark,0,0,
414,Luis,That sounds okay,,,150.1,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,Great thanks Luis,,,110.1,remark,0,0,

414,Luis,yeah yeah that's my answer,,,230.3,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,"Okay i'm wondering if you can read the question out loud, for me, can you do that",,,120.3,remark,0,0,
414,Luis,question asked what he did scientists to us to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,So Luis i'm wondering about your answer,,,,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank is not the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon,,,210.3,remark,0,0,
414,Luis,um well yeah because if there's astronauts up on the Mon discovering water they definitely have oxygen tanks 100%,,,210.3,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,"um yeah Okay, I see what you're saying",,,310.1,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,and maybe check back in with the text and see if we can,,,420.3,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,and wondering if we can get a little bit more specific,,,420.2,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,"pin down exactly what they used to discover water on the moon, knowing that oxygen tanks might have been there and part of the process,",,,,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,but i'm wondering if we can get a little bit more specific,,,420.2,remark,0,0,
414,Luis,um okay um So what should I do next,,,420.2,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,"So Would you mind reading the text for me and seeing if using something different, at the end",,,120.3,remark,0,0,
414,Luis,yeah,,,120.3,response,0,0,
414,Luis,i'll do that,,,,response,0,0,

414,Jazmin,to watch a final water I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,420.2,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,I don't think your answers wrog Jazmin i'm just wondering if we can find a little bit more evidence for this small machine that you're saying that they send,,,420.2,remark,0,0,
414,Jazmin,"out okay so well, I found it in the story, I found it in paragraph two",,,420.2,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,"Oh awesome do you want to go back to paragraph two, with me really quick, can you read that first sentence for me",,,120.3,remark,0,0,
414,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate,,,120.3,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,Oh,,,,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,"Well, I think your answers right there right, so you said NASA send a small machine I would include the rest of that sentence in your answer, so what was that small machine called",,,420.2,remark,0,0,
414,Jazmin,lunar orbiter,,,420.2,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,does that sound right,,,150.1,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,awesome yeah I think that's really important information to include because that's the machine that they use to discover the water,,,420.2,remark,0,0,
414,Jazmin,yeah,,,150.1,response,0,0,
414,Jazmin,"Yes, that sounds right, so I just add the name and then, my answer is done",,,,response,0,0,

414,Teacher,That feel like a little bit more of a complete answer to you,,,150.1,remark,0,0,
414,Jazmin,yeah yeah I think it makes my answer more complete yeah just like you said,,,150.1,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,"Chris i'm wondering about your answer to you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, is that right",,,230.3,remark,0,0,

414,Chris,yeah it's so cool,,,310.1,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,"yeah right, I thought it was super cool to i'm wondering if we can go back to the question right, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,Do you think that your answer answers that question,,,210.3,remark,0,0,
414,Chris,"Oh, what a scientist use to discover",,,210.3,response,0,0,
414,Chris,"Well, well so i'm actually I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,"yeah definitely scientists use a lot of equipment, especially, especially when they're going into space right",,,110.3,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,So i'm wondering if you can make your answer a little bit more specific so we're looking for the equipment that they use to discover water on the moon,,,420.2,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,And I know they might have used a lot of other equipment to get there right but was there a specific piece of equipment that helped them make that discovery,,,210.4,remark,0,0,
414,Chris,"Well, I mean the thing Jazmin was talking about sounded pretty good",,,210.4,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,yeah can you remind me what that was called,,,210.4,remark,0,0,

414,Chris,Okay yeah i'm,,,,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,awesome yeah was that what they used to discover the ice as a water,,,210.4,remark,0,0,
414,Chris,um well I guess so,,,210.4,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,awesome why don't you talk with Jazmin and you guys can figure out if that,,,130.2,remark,0,0,

414,Oliver,yeah yeah we saw the same thing on the microscope,,,230.3,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,yeah okay so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,230.3,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,"wondering if you guys wouldn't mind going back and rereading the text and seeing if we can use, we can find a more specific answer so",,,420.2,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,"What equipment, did they use to discover water on the moon you guys found the equipment that they would use to look at what they discovered right but it feels like we skip this step somewhere in there, so can you guys look back and tell me what you think",,,410.2,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,The equipment they use to discover the water wall,,,,remark,0,0,
414,Oliver,"Well, how come you discover something after you can't see it",,,,response,0,0,
414,Teacher,Oh that's a good question right,,,,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,i'm wondering if there might be some equipment that we missed in that text,,,410.3,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,so maybe you guys can take a look at that does that sound good,,,150.1,remark,0,0,
414,Teacher,"That told us how they were able to discover it, so I had the same question when I was reading it right, I was thinking, how did they find it they can't even see it",,,310.1,remark,0,0,
414,Oliver,Okay yeah sure,,,150.1,response,0,0,

415,Oliver,hi,,,,response,0,1,
415,Teacher,hi Luis do you have a question,,,,remark,0,1,
415,Luis,"um yeah so I just have this this quick kind of question and mostly it's just because um well okay, so I kind of already know everything there is to know about space already",,,,response,0,1,
415,Luis,So I don't think I need to be in this group,,,,response,0,1,
415,Teacher,"Okay Luis well, I think that we are all here to learn from each other we're all here to learn from the article",,,150.1,remark,0,1,
415,Teacher,"You guys read the the article about water on the moon, is that correct?",,,150.1,remark,0,1,
415,Luis,"Yeah, we read that",,,150.1,response,0,1,
415,Teacher,Okay um so Farrah um i'm going to well i'm going to ask the question the,,,,remark,0,1,
415,Teacher,"The question that we're thinking about today, that is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,
415,Teacher,And we're circling evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question,,,120.4,remark,0,1,
415,Teacher," So Farrah, can you tell me what you thought on what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.4,remark,0,1,
415,Farrah,"So my my answer was that I thought that they use, they would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so I believe that they use the microscope to find the water",,,120.4,response,0,1,
415,Teacher,"Okay um in the text, what did they What were they using the microscope for?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,
415,Farrah,"Well, they were using it to see because the water were these, I think the word microscopic type like little ice crystals they couldn't see it with just like the naked eye, so they had to see it in the microscope, because it was so small",,,210.4,response,0,1,
415,Teacher,"Definitely, so they said that the water was microscopic so they needed to find- they needed to use a microscope to be able to see it",,,230.3,remark,0,1,
415,Teacher,"Um, did they discover the water with the microscope or did they find something else to find the sort of source of the water?",,,210.3,remark,0,1,
415,Teacher,yeah Jazmin,,,,remark,0,1,
415,Jazmin,"Um, so I guess I was just confused because actually I feel like I answered this question, so I was kind of wondering like why my answer was wrong or like not correct, because I, I think I had an answer to this question, but I guess i'm not sure",,,,response,0,1,
415,Teacher, Is that correct?,,,230.3,remark,0,1,
415,Teacher,"Oh Jazmin okay i'm just looking at your answer right now so Jazmin, you said that NASA sent a small machine",,,230.3,remark,0,1,
415,Jazmin,yeah,,,230.3,response,0,1,
415,Teacher,"Okay, so NASA send a small machine",,,210.4,remark,0,1,
415,Teacher, What was that machine called?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,
415,Jazmin,It was the Lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,1,
415,Teacher,"yeah and what was the purpose of that machine, so we had a small machine, it was called the Lunar orbiter What did it do what was the purpose of it?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,
415,Jazmin,"I thought the Lunar orbiter was what found the water like that's to me like when I read that that that text really closely, it looks like they use the Lunar orbiter like maybe a sensor or something on it to find the water",,,210.4,response,0,1,
415,Teacher,yeah they definitely used the Lunar orbiter um to find the source of the water um so I wanted to talk to um,,,110.4,remark,0,1,
415,Teacher,"Chris um, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon right?",,,230.3,remark,0,1,
415,Chris,yeah that's yeah that's what I said,,,230.3,response,0,1,
415,Teacher, Can someone tell me what that word was again? there was one word that described the water -how how much water there was,,,210.4,remark,0,1,
415,Teacher," Yeah, Oliver",,,210.4,remark,0,1,
415,Teacher,"Okay, so when the scientist on the water we talked about that one word that was in the article that we read um that describes the water",,,210.4,remark,0,1,
415,Oliver,"um well, it said that there was um well first off that the water was microscopic so like you could only see it",,,210.4,response,0,1,
415,Oliver,"Through a microscope, but they also said that there wasn't very much like they were talking about how they were taking the glass and measuring the water and there was only like very little water in the like, I think it was like a ton of dirt or something",,,,response,0,1,
415,Teacher,um so they found a very small amount of water right like um they found a very like a microscopic amount of water that they needed to use the microscopes then to look at right?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,
415,Teacher,um yeah so um yeah Chris,,,,remark,0,1,
415,Chris,I guess,,,,response,0,1,
415,Chris,"I guess, I was just wondering like I know cuz I went to NASA with my dad that astronauts use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits kind of like what Luis was saying, and I guess i'm confused because I added that to my paper because it seemed like they were missing that in the reading",,,,response,0,1,
415,Chris," It didn't mention it, and it seems like that would be really important",,,,response,0,1,
415,Teacher,um so what in the article um made you think of oxygen tanks?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,
415,Teacher, um that's that's good thinking that you that you did not notice that,,,310.1,remark,0,1,
415,Teacher,yeah it does seem like that would be really important,,,310.1,remark,0,1,
415,Teacher,so you and Luis were saying that they found or that they used equipment like oxygen tanks,,,230.3,remark,0,1,
415,Chris,"Well, the fact that they were on the moon, and the fact that, basically, like there's no oxygen on the moon for them to breathe",,,230.3,response,0,1,
415,Chris,"So I was like well if they're going around with the microscope and the Lunar orbiter, and all this stuff like they better have oxygen tanks, because otherwise they can't hold the microscope up to the to the ice, you know?",,,,response,0,1,
415,Teacher,"Definitely um yeah, Oliver",,,110.1,remark,0,1,
415,Oliver,"um so, unfortunately I know it was a really short time, but we really enjoyed working with you but it's time for us to go to lunch and",,,110.1,response,0,1,

415,Luis,"Oh yeah so I don't think I have to be in this group, because I already corrected my answer I changed my answer to scientists found ice using a small machine",,,,response,1,1,
415,Teacher,huh yes and a couple of you guys did revise your answers and you did a great job with that revision,,,110.1,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher,"what we're doing today, why have you guys in a group is because we're trying to go even further we're going to",,,220.1,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher,"Try to elaborate on and expand our answers a little bit, I want to know what you guys",,,220.1,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher,are thinking on both with your original answer and your new answer um so i'm going to be asking each of you,,,220.1,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher,What your initial answer was if you have a new answer what that answer is um and we're going to talk about it a little bit so while i'm asking one of your classmates,,,220.1,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher,I want all of you to listen to what they have to say and think about their answers and see if it can help you get a little bit of new insight into the text,,,220.1,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher,or even thinking beyond today some tools that we can use for future texts like these,,,520.1,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher,um so Farrah I want to start with you um can you read your initial answer for me,,,120.4,remark,1,1,
415,Farrah,Oh yeah absolutely so what I said in the first one was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close,,,120.4,response,1,1,
415,Teacher,Okay um so Farrah can you explain are your what were you thinking on when you came to that answer,,,230.1,remark,1,1,
415,Farrah,"yeah so I was thinking that basically like Okay, so it says what equipment did the scientists right",,,230.1,response,1,1,
415,Farrah,"And I was like okay so i'm gonna find equipment and I found that my personal and I thought this is definitely the right equipment, because how could they find the water which they said was tiny microscopic and then like how could they find the water if they couldn't see it",,,,response,1,1,
415,Farrah,So that was kind of my thinking,,,,response,1,1,
415,Teacher,hmm I definitely understood that um you were looking for different,,,310.1,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher,"equipment that they use and they do use microscopes right they use microscopes to study that water now um, can you tell me oh Jazmin do you have a question",,,,remark,1,1,
415,Jazmin,I just wanted to say that it,,,,response,1,1,
415,Jazmin,"was great the first time, but I also added some details of the meeting, I said that scientists used me she called the Lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon",,,,response,1,1,
415,Jazmin,just to ask um Farrah What was your revised answer,,,120.4,response,1,1,
415,Jazmin,"Okay, thank you for that Jazmin i'm i'm glad that you were able to revise your answer as well um so I Jazmin really quick, I just wanted to go back to Farrah for a little bit",,,110.1,response,1,1,
415,Farrah,"So what I said when I revised it was that scientists use the Lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water craters on the moon, I ended up with the same answer",,,,response,1,1,
415,Teacher,um so Jazmin i'll ask you first um when you came up with your new answer um what made you come to that knew the answer,,,230.1,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher,How great so you guys have the same answer in the end that they use the Lunar orbiter,,,230.3,remark,1,1,
415,Jazmin,"It was actually Okay, so I knew in the first and, today, I said that the scientists sentence small machine but I realized that I looked up the name of the machine",,,230.1,response,1,1,
415,Jazmin,"And then I realized, after listening to them and Farrah talk about how small the water was that, like microscopic I thought that the best answer would include",,,,response,1,1,
415,Jazmin,"Like what they were like so like they said the Lunar orbiter and like what they sent it to you, so that seemed like that was the right answer",,,,response,1,1,
415,Teacher,"Okay um so when you're thinking about your original answer and your new answer, what do you think the difference is between those answers",,,530.1,remark,1,1,
415,Jazmin,"Well, I think the main thing that I I added with detail like first I added the detail of the of the object, so I didn't just say like kind of what it was I said, like specifically what was it that makes sense",,,530.1,response,1,1,
415,Teacher,And I,,,,remark,1,1,
415,Jazmin,"Also, like basically I I added detail about like what they were discovering because I just said, the sense that the small machine",,,,response,1,1,
415,Jazmin,"But but there's more to the answer because it's saying like what you know what equipment, did they said to discover and I thought, like well it's an even better answer says what he said",,,,response,1,1,
415,Teacher,"Yes, so when we're thinking about answering questions like these later in the future um I think that what you said about details, is very important, especially when we're asked a certain question",,,520.1,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher, Thank you Jazmin yes Chris,,,,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher,making sure that we pay attention to the details and add those into our answers very important,,,,remark,1,1,
415,Chris,"Well, I was just I actually had a question I just heard what Jazmin and Farrah said and It made me think",,,,response,1,1,
415,Chris,"I had a question, so the water that the scientists found was it was microscopic like it wasn't like a lot of water, it was just tiny water?",,,,response,1,1,
415,Teacher,"Oh, that is a good question so i'm text it's said",,,,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher,That um,,,,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher,"The ice deposits in the moon were very small right, so we can tell that um it said in the text and didn't it say? Can someone actually answer this for me in the text, when we were reading it um What did it say anything about the amount of water that was on the moon?",,,210.4,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher,"The amount of water, yes Oliver",,,,remark,1,1,
415,Oliver,"I remember, because I was, I was what I was seeing that it said that there were only",,,,response,1,1,
415,Oliver,"32 ounces of water in a ton of the top layer like the dirt on the moon, and so they said that was just four glasses of water, like in a ton of dirt, which is a lot of dirt",,,,response,1,1,
415,Teacher,"Yes, a lot of dirt and not a lot of water right um so Harrsion definitely and there's not a lot of water, we can see that but can someone describe how the water",,,210.4,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher,"Why did they need a microscope, why do they need a microscope what was the the property of the water that made them need to use a microscope yeah Farrah",,,210.4,remark,1,1,
415,Farrah,Oh,,,210.4,response,1,1,
415,Farrah,"I would love to answer, but we have to go to our next class but",,,,response,1,1,
415,Farrah,"I just wanted to thank you so much for working with this, this was",,,,response,1,1,
415,Farrah,really fun,,,,response,1,1,
415,Farrah, Thank you bye,,,,response,1,1,
415,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,1,1,
415,Teacher,hi again everyone um,,,,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,So I want to pick up where we left off um,,,,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,"let's see, Luis do you have a question?",,,,remark,2,1,
415,Luis,"um yeah so I got this all figured out, so I think i'm good to go",,,,response,2,1,
415,Teacher,"Can you tell me um, what do you have figured out, can you explain that to me?",,,230.1,remark,2,1,
415,Luis,"yeah so Okay, so my initial answer when I didn't know was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that, but then after we work together and I actually looked at the reading, and all this stuff I said okay scientists found ice using a small machine",,,230.1,response,2,1,
415,Teacher,Okay Luis so you said i'm scientist use a small machine right um so,,,230.3,remark,2,1,
415,Luis,"Yeah, they found ice using a small machine",,,230.3,response,2,1,
415,Teacher,"but I want to, we talked a little bit about um adding in those details so remember when I was talking to Jazmin about",,,420.2,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,"Okay, so we have that ice detail there, which is good that we are adding details",,,310.1,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,adding in those important details that really fully answer the question right so um let's can we look at the text and try to come up,,,,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,so you said that they have a small that they're using a small machine but,,,210.4,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,Luis i'm going to have you look at the text for a second and try to come up with an answer that's a little bit more detailed,,,420.2,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,let's get a little bit deeper into that I think we can expand our answer a little bit um So yes,,,420.2,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,What was that machine,,,,remark,2,1,
415,Luis,What was the machine well,,,420.2,response,2,1,
415,Luis,The machine was on the you know the the rocket ship,,,,response,2,1,
415,Luis,The thing you call it,,,,response,2,1,
415,Teacher,"Okay Luis so in the text on do you um I so either i'm going to have you can you please read over the text, and try to find what that machine is called and then i'm going to if you have it right now",,,420.3,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,You can definitely tell me or okay,,,,remark,2,1,
415,Luis,I got it okay it's the Lunar orbit,,,,response,2,1,
415,Teacher,"Yes, it's the Lunar orbiter so um can you restate your answer, for me, now that we have that information can you restate your answer to that initial question?",,,120.4,remark,2,1,
415,Luis,"yeah Okay, so I would say that my revised answer is a scientist found ice using a lunar orbiter",,,120.4,response,2,1,
415,Teacher,"Yes, so that use the Lunar orbiter so Luis what on what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer that you have",,,530.1,remark,2,1,
415,Luis,"Well Okay, so you said that I needed to use details in the answer, and so, when I went and looked back in the in the reading",,,530.1,response,2,1,
415,Luis,"I saw that the small machine was actually called the Lunar orbiter like it wasn't a rocket ship, but I mean it is a rocket ship but it's also like that's the actual name for it so that's what that seemed like the answer to be",,,,response,2,1,
415,Teacher,so what I would say um is that it seems like with our first the first answers that we had um what we were definitely coming up with,,,230.3,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,yeah great job Luis,,,110.1,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,but it seemed like we weren't looking close enough in the text to really take,,,410.2,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,equipment that they were using,,,,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,so when we have a question that tells us to use the text,,,420.2,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,Those answers that are stated in the text for our question,,,,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,To come up with a specific answer we want to make sure that we really look deeply at that text to make sure that we include those important details um and use that to expand our answer,,,,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,so make sense Luis?,,,150.1,remark,2,1,
415,Luis,"yeah so like I should make sure that I, I guess, like look closely at the reading is, that is, that is, that right?",,,150.1,response,2,1,
415,Teacher,"So maybe not literally looking very close at the reading, but you definitely want to make sure that you're doing a close reading you're looking at the language that they're using certain words that might be important and using that to",,,420.3,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,really come up with a complete and detailed answer,,,,remark,2,1,
415,Luis,yeah okay that actually makes a lot of sense so,,,,response,2,1,
415,Luis,"Okay, I think I understand",,,,response,2,1,
415,Teacher," Um Farrah I wanted to touch base with you um again, I asked for your initial response um but can you please tell me what your revised response was?",,,120.4,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,"Great, great job Luis",,,120.4,remark,2,1,
415,Farrah,"Oh yeah sure, so my revised response was that students use the orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water on the moon",,,120.4,response,2,1,
415,Teacher,"Okay Farrah, and Oliver and Chris i'll get your questions in just a second um but Farrah,  and I just wanted to ask you um what made you change that answer for me to change",,,530.1,remark,2,1,
415,Farrah,"Well Okay, so the first time I thought Okay, the microscope is the equipment, you have to use",,,530.1,response,2,1,
415,Farrah,"But then I realized after we had class together that actually the Lunar orbiter was but discovered the water, so I realized that I had to read the question really close and because I was focused on the finding the equipment,",,,,response,2,1,
415,Farrah,"not on what the equipment was doing, because the question wasn't like how did scientists study the water, it was how did they discover the water that so that was really different and once I realized that I realized, I have to look really closely at the question like what it was asking",,,,response,2,1,
415,Teacher,"that's great Farrah and i'm glad that you were able to really think deeply about on how you were answering that question, and what you can do moving forward that's fantastic",,,310.1,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher, And Oliver you have your hand raised before,,,310.1,remark,2,1,
415,Oliver,"Well, I was just gonna say that I think that they're gonna try to build a base by 2024 which would be really cool",,,310.1,response,2,1,
415,Teacher,"Oliver I want to or Chris, you had your hand raised also can, can you tell me what you were thinking?",,,120.4,remark,2,1,
415,Teacher,Oh wow that would be really cool,,,110.1,remark,2,1,
415,Chris,"yeah absolutely so, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you and I in particular, I really wanted to thank you for working with us",,,120.4,response,2,1,
415,Chris,"Like you really helped us to understand like what we needed to think about in terms of our strategy, so we were able to like",,,,response,2,1,
415,Chris,"Think about how we found our answers and I never thought about that, but it was really useful",,,,response,2,1,
415,Chris,"So I honestly right guys like I found it really useful to like have the time to really think about like Okay, so how did I even come up with my answer, because I come up with some pretty good answer but I never thought about like how did I come up with that, so thank you so much",,,,response,2,1,
427,Teacher,"Hello students, my name is Teacher, how are you doing today",,,,remark,0,0,1
427,Farrah,Oh nice to meet you Teacher oh we're doing great we're really excited for your class,,,,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"Thank you so much, I appreciate that Farrah so hey first before we get to your specific oh Luis, what can I do for you what's going on",,,,remark,0,0,1
427,Luis,um yeah well I just I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"I appreciate that, and you know I I really look forward to using some of your knowledge to you know help grow our students knowledge",,,110.3,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"But part of why we're here really yeah thanks is is honestly to understand you know one another's perspectives and maybe there's something that say Chris can share, about space that you know that I don't know or that Oliver doesn't know and vice versa,",,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,So I think we're all here just to support each other's learning and understanding each other's perspective so thanks for raising that Luis,,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Luis,Okay okay,,,150.1,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"awesome thanks Luis okay so first briefly before we you know tackle your guys's responses, I wanted to know just by raise of hands, who would love to go to the moon someday",,,140.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,any of you,,,,remark,0,0,1
427,Luis,"definitely want to go to the moon, I want to be an astronaut so bad",,,,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,that's so great,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"Luis, why do you want to go to the moon",,,140.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Luis,"Oh man well what just be such a cool experience to feel like zero gravity up there, I can't wait, I really want to go to space camp, because you get to kind of try it out like almost before you get to be an astronaut, and I want to discover new planets and galaxies too",,,140.1,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"Absolutely me too, so you know some of you didn't raise your hand, so why wouldn't you want to go to the moon, if anyone wants to share",,,140.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Jazmin,"Yes, I can share",,,140.1,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,Thanks,,,,remark,0,0,1
427,Jazmin,"Well I'm really just more passionate about the earth and saving the earth and and I really think we should focus on this planet, the one that we have in the one that we're living on and saving it while we live here",,,,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,really great and Would you mind sharing with me is your name pronounced Hosni or Jazmin,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Jazmin,Jazmin,,,110.1,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,Thanks for thanks Jazmin I appreciate that,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1

427,Teacher,Oh no Please go ahead Jazmin,,,,remark,0,0,1
427,Jazmin,See I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,yeah totally so let's let's dig into that now,,,150.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"We want to talk about how we know that there's water on the moon and you'd mentioned, and your response Jazmin that scientists into small machine to discover water on the moon right?",,,230.3,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,Can you share more about what you mean by that by scientists spent or sent a small machine,,,230.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Jazmin,"Yes, Okay, well, I found that in our in our story in reading and in part two it said necessary the small machine called",,,230.1,response,0,0,1
427,Jazmin,A lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,so let's let's kind of unpack lunar orbiter for a minute for a minute there does anyone have by chance in this group speak Spanish by raise of hands anyone,,,140.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,Very good that's exactly right,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,No one speaks Spanish no worries okay so,,,,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"Each okay well um you know the word for what is the word for moon in French, do you know",,,140.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Farrah,it's something we can like lune,,,140.1,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,yeah so in Spanish it's Luna,,,140.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"So when we think about lunar as like an adjective as a descriptive word that's like basically of the moon, and then does anyone know the definition of orbiter or orbit can anyone share that with me",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
427,Luis,"Oh yeah up I got this one I bought this one, we talked about it on orbit means to like on to go around something like the planets orbit the sun, because we go around it",,,210.4,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"Exactly exactly so when we combine those two things we're talking about something that goes around the moon right, so that is the equipment that NASA send or scientist sent to the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"And it circles around the moon and analyzes data collected at the moon now one other item here, you know that that could be a little bit confusing is that so if this piece of machinery is",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"Not on the moon surface, how do you guys imagine that it actually was able to analyze dirt on the moon if it's above the ground essentially does anyone know that Farrah",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
427,Farrah,"Well, I guess, I don't know I guess that's my question because I thought the answer was the microscope but if it's not on the moon, how can they get a microscope there and look at the little water particles",,,210.4,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"exactly right, and you know what you were onto something with your microscope response because, by the way, that is a really essential part of analyzing the dirt on the moon, however, the microscope is not how we got the dirt to analyze Chris what's up",,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Chris,"Oh well, I just wanted to say, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,130.1,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"Absolutely you're totally right,",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"When astronauts do go outside of their spaceships they do need to utilize that equipment in order to you know, be able to breathe effectively in space because there isn't enough oxygen to breathe",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"And so you know, going back to how we found out that you are found evidence that there's water on the moon, is that you know they actually",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"Implemented a really interesting strategy, they basically threw a piece of the Atlas rocket at the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"Yeah they did, and this caused a big crash",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"That sent a plume of dust 10 miles into the atmosphere from the moon surface and then, as we talked about that lunar orbiter it's in the air, you know circling the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"And it was able to collect or analyze the dirt from that plume, and this is where your points Farrah comes in",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,Which is where they're based basically able to take that dirt and analyze the dirt where they found that there's a 5% water content in that dirt so that's where the microscope comes into play,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
427,Farrah,That microscopes not on the moon,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,that's correct the microscope is not on the moon,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"You know, to Chris's point utilize you know the oxygen equipment, because it wasn't actually astronauts that were on the surface of the moon collecting that dirt it was the Lunar orbiter the equipment and the Oliver what's up",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
427,Oliver,i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock and,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
427,Oliver,"We actually we have to go to lunch, right now, but I just wanted to say when you just told us about how the Lunar orbiter works that was",,,,response,0,0,1
427,Oliver,"That was so interesting and I wish the story told us that, because I think I think I would have been a lot more excited if I knew about the throwing of the stuff in the and the smoke bloom and all of that stuff so thank you for teaching us that",,,,response,0,0,1
427,Teacher,"you're so welcome, and I think sometimes these informational texts can be a little bit challenging for everyone and sometimes it just takes us all getting together putting our heads together and talking through it",,,,remark,0,0,1

427,Teacher,"i'm so pleased to work with you today, I always learned so much from each of you, so I wanted to let you know, so why we're here so based on the responses and I i've identified some areas that I think that we can revisit The text together to just really strengthen our understanding",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,yeah Luis what's what's up,,,,remark,1,0,1
427,Luis,"i'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,1
427,Teacher,Luis you know what,,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,i'm excited for you to you know help share with us what you know about space and,,,,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,i'm so interested to hear everything that you have to share so and I hope that you do,,,,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"is I just wanna let you know that I brought you into the space, because you and your peers because",,,,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,Really ultimately there's always opportunity for each of us to grow our understanding on any topic so,,,,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"As I mentioned, I learned from you guys every day so we're here to work together to just deepen all of our understandings on the text",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"And, based on the responses that each of you provided, I do think that there are some areas which i've identified where we can revisit and strengthen your understanding about space about the moon, and about water on the moon that sound okay",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
427,Luis,um yeah okay,,,150.1,response,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"Okay, very good, so we all responded to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and I think one area here that we could work on briefly",,,,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,is really instead of going straight to the text let's really know that we understand the question so before we turn that to the text  let's Can someone tell me exactly what the question is asking what is it asking us to find,,,420.1,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,yeah go ahead Oliver,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
427,Oliver,um the question is asking what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.4,response,1,0,1
427,Teacher,that's that is precisely it so we're not looking to discover water ourselves right on the moon we're leaving that up to NASA,,,210.1,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"what we're looking for is the equipment that's in the text that we read, so I want to turn now to some of your responses",,,210.2,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,Farrah Would you mind sharing with us what your response was,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
427,Farrah,"yeah Okay, I said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,120.4,response,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"Okay yeah that's all right so let's can you maybe clarify your statement, for me, certainly a microscope is involved in analyzing water crystals on the moon, but could you just clarify why you provided that response",,,230.1,remark,1,0,1
427,Farrah,"yeah Okay, so in part three, they say, the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at so they have to use the microscope to discover it otherwise they can't see it",,,230.1,response,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"Okay yep and that's that's a valid argument there, but you know, I think",,,310.1,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,My concern is is that your answer doesn't specifically answer how NASA got to the moon to discover the ice crystals that needed to be examined by by by microscopes,,,,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"Let's look back at paragraph two, to re review and see and you know, specifically how scientists got to the moon, to have that top soil to to analyze and",,,430.2,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,let's let's consider for a second tow just reflecting on this,,,,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,can anyone maybe chime in on that,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,some of these texts are pretty pretty dense pretty complex if we only read them once what could be the consequence of that how that,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,What might be the effect that where we just read a text one time,,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,Jazmin please,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
427,Jazmin,"Well, if you only read it once",,,210.3,response,1,0,1
427,Jazmin,Like you might not remember everything by the time you get to the end you might forget the beginning,,,,response,1,0,1
427,Teacher,That is precisely it you know what it's extra difficult when something is unfamiliar to us and,,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"gosh I know that Luis you know you, you know a lot about space and you've learned a lot about space,",,,110.3,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"but for a lot of us and spaces just totally for, and I mean let's be honest, none of us have been there before right",,,150.1,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"So when we're not drawing on our prior knowledge these things can be complex in reviewing them a couple times is important Chris, you have something to add",,,510.1,remark,1,0,1
427,Chris,"yeah well I didn't go to space, but I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,510.1,response,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"Oh, my gosh yes you're absolutely right so",,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"When you went to NASA and you looked at those those items and did you by chance, learn anything about them discovering water on the moon",,,,remark,1,0,1
427,Chris,"Oh no, no, I didn't know that part till I read the story",,,,response,1,0,1
427,Teacher,got it got it and Chris Would you mind sharing with us your response to question one,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
427,Chris,yeah I said i'm scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,120.4,response,1,0,1
427,Teacher,yeah so you raise such an interesting point there in your response to the question,,,,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,And you know what it's it's very true that they they actually did find craters full of water,,,,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"so can anyone explain to me how the water that was found on the moon, is perhaps different than the water that we have here on earth",,,210.3,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"but my concern, though, is is that maybe the way the form that the water is in on the moon, is a little different than the way that we see perhaps a lake full of water here on earth,",,,410.3,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,Oliver go ahead,,,120.4,remark,1,0,1
427,Oliver,um yeah so um they said it's microscopic um they also said it's ice,,,120.4,response,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"That's so smart okay so um you know that that information is specifically contained in paragraph two, and that really goes back to you know the comment that Farrah raised about about microscopes, so there is water there",,,,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,But it's tiny right and it's actually in the soil within the craters so you couldn't see it if you were just looking at it you'd need the scientific equipment to analyze it more closely,,,210.4,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"So you know, I think that also brings back the point of you know if we you know only read a text or we read it quickly, we may not catch all of these really fine details, I also wanted to you know switch over to oh go ahead",,,230.3,remark,1,0,1
427,Oliver,Oh yeah um before we keep going um I want to let you know actually it's time for us to go,,,230.3,response,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"Okay, well, thank you so much, and I appreciate you keeping an eye on the clock, and it was such a pleasure speaking with each of you and I appreciated learning from you and with you, so i'll See you in a little bit okay",,,,remark,1,0,1
427,Teacher,"Hello students, how are you doing today",,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Farrah,Good thanks for asking,,,,response,2,0,1
427,Teacher,Thanks excellent so,,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"I brought you here because I would love to discuss with you, your responses to some of the questions after we read our article about water on the moon, yes Luis",,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
427,Luis,yeah um I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,150.1,response,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"Luis you know I certainly welcome your input about space and i'm excited to learn about what you've learned about space, I think that we can all certainly learn from one another and",,,110.3,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"So I wanted to let you know that I brought you into the group because there's always opportunity for us to grow our understandings of a topic, even if we know a lot about them",,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"And you know i'm excited actually Luis to learn, you know from you and you learn from one another,",,,110.3,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"so let's dive back into this text and I think I do want to bring up that after my review of your responses, I did identify some areas that we can revisit and where we can make them",,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,Or we can strengthen your responses,,,220.1,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,does everyone understand that,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
427,Luis,um yeah okay yeah,,,150.1,response,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"Okay, great Luis okay so",,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"let's take a look now at the question that's being asked, because oftentimes it's difficult to respond accurately, you know",,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,Does anyone want to volunteer and answer,,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"If we don't have a really solid understanding of what is being asked so with That said, what is the question asking us to find in the article that we read",,,420.1,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,Okay well oh yeah go ahead Jazmin,,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
427,Jazmin,And it's it's asking us to find an equipment,,,120.4,response,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"you're exactly right exactly right so when we are going back through the texts, and we are looking for equipment, specifically, and I would like, for everyone to write down in their learning journals equipment okay let's just write down that word real quickly",,,420.3,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,And then I want everyone to take just a minute here to review let's do the first three paragraphs of our reading and see if you guys can just jot down some of the equipment,,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,i'd like for everyone to write down say two things,,,420.3,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"Excellent, Farrah, could you read us what your response was to question number one, please",,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
427,Farrah,"Okay, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,120.4,response,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"Okay well how about if you just clarify for us to be in it, you tell me why you believe that your answers right okay does that sound okay",,,230.1,remark,2,0,1
427,Farrah,"Well Okay, they said the waters microscopic on So how can you discover something that's microscopic without a microscope",,,230.1,response,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"Totally, so we're going back to the question, so what what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon,",,,120.3,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,and I would say that you're certainly right that a microscope is essential to see those microscopic water crystals,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,But i'm concerned that your answer doesn't specifically address how NASA got to the moon to discover that the ice crystals were there in the first place,,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"So I recommend that you look back at the text to identify the machine that they used really to get after to analyze the soil in the first place, and can you can you answer what what that piece of equipment once",,,430.1,remark,2,0,1
427,Farrah,I don't know yet,,,430.1,response,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"that's Okay, and I think we will get there, but um yeah I really appreciate you trying",,,110.1,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"and you know, I think, from your response Farrah, we can really just understand some insights into how we learn right",,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,You know it's very natural that you know upon first read of a text that we might miss some details and that's just totally natural,,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"I admit science is not or science space, the moon water on the moon, these things are foreign to me as well, so I need to read the text a couple times",,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"To really comprehend what's going on there,",,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"so um, I would like, for Chris, please, if you would mind sharing what your response was that would be great",,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
427,Chris,"Okay i've said that scientists found craters, full of water on the moon",,,150.1,response,2,0,1
427,Teacher,yes and that's such a wonderful insight so,,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,let's think about that for that for a second,,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"So these craters are full of water as the article indicates, but i'm concerned that we might be thinking about water",,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"or a crater being full of water, the way that we might expect a lake to be full of water here on earth",,,410.3,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,so Chris we'd love for you to share with us if you if you would um how water exists on the moon differently than it does on earth do you happen to know the answer to that,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
427,Chris,Oh okay oh it's in craters its in craters on the moon,,,410.3,response,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"Okay, it is in craters",,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,We actually do have water and craters here on earth,,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"does anyone can anyone else, help and let us know what different form water might be in on the moon, rather than liquid like it like we might expect okay how about",,,130.2,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,Luis,,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
427,Luis,"yeah okay Chris, so the water on the moon it's not like water like a pool or like an ocean um it's like this tiny, tiny little tiny little pieces of water tiny little pieces of ice you can't even see them",,,120.4,response,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"Exactly so oh my I love that you brought that up so if you were standing there at that crater, which is presumably full of water is what they're claiming right",,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"You wouldn't even know that it was there, why because it's microscopic and it's actually mixed within this soil and that really goes back to",,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,you'll find that water inside the soil so it's actually invisible to the human eye and so okay yeah go ahead Chris,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,Farrahs point about the microscope where you're going to need a microscope to look at the soil,,,230.3,remark,2,0,1
427,Chris,"yeah we'll talk about that, like the microscope and stuff um I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,210.4,response,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"Yes, that is you're absolutely right and and why Chris, do we need oxygen if we're going to be in space or on the moon, for that matter",,,140.1,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,Why would you need oxygen,,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Chris,Well yeah for people to breathe for the astronauts to breathe,,,,response,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"Exactly, so there is not enough oxygen for us to breathe without oxygen tanks on the moon, and that actually brings up a fantastic point about",,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,can anybody share with me what water can be broken down into this was in the article yep go ahead Oliver,,,210.4,remark,2,0,1
427,Teacher,You know the potential prospects of finding water on the moon,,,,remark,2,0,1
427,Oliver,"On I really wish we could keep going but it's time for us to go to lunch now, but before we go, I just wanted to say thank you so much for reminding us to read the text on more than once, so that we can understand all the details I think that's going to be really helpful next time",,,,response,2,0,1
427,Teacher,"Thank you so much, I use that tool all the time, so thank you guys it's a pleasure to hang out with you today i'll talk to you later okay",,,,remark,2,0,1
428,Teacher,Hello everyone how are you,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Farrah,Hello oh we're great we're really excited to work with you today,,,,response,0,0,1

428,Teacher,I assume,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,Okay Farrah,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Farrah,"Okay, so I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,0,1
428,Teacher,"Oh okay Oh, I see, let me hear other other people",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,"And Chris, you had the hands on I guess you can tell me why you think",,,120.4,remark,0,0,1
428,Chris,"Okay, so my answer is um scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,120.4,response,0,0,1
428,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,"Well, who else Jazmin you had a answer also when",,,120.4,remark,0,0,1
428,Jazmin,I said that NASA send a small machine,,,120.4,response,0,0,1
428,Teacher,Okay um,,,,remark,0,0,1

428,Teacher,"So so Luis what are you what's what you have in your mind, then",,,120.4,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,For your answer yes,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Luis,Okay um I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,,response,0,0,1
428,Teacher,Oh unfortunately I don't think they use a oxygen tank in this time,,,130.1,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,and,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,and,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,So oh wait,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,So Chris so your answer was scientists found the crators full of water in the moon,,,230.3,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,"I don't think they found the for like a big amount of just water liquid water, they found various little small thing that you cannot even seen with the human eye",,,410.3,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,So they use a not use a little,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,Small machine,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,"And as Jazmin was saying, small small machine to see the particle and then find the water in the moon, yes",,,230.3,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,"Yes, yes",,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Jazmin,"Yes, so",,,,response,0,0,1
428,Jazmin,"Well, what about my answer NASA to small machine I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,0,1
428,Jazmin,"cuz I thought, if we were in this group",,,,response,0,0,1
428,Jazmin,Our answer was wrong so,,,,response,0,0,1
428,Teacher,Oh,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,"Sorry, I was wrong",,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,they put the microsope,,,130.3,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,"it's not the machine but the microscope, they use to find a water",,,130.3,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,So the answer for Farrah was correct one right,,,110.4,remark,0,0,1
428,Jazmin,"So, how did they use that machine, though, because they talked about that too didn't they use that to investigate",,,110.4,response,0,0,1
428,Teacher,So you they found the,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,"Water and moon by, but you can only look at in the human eye, so we just go look at your day I we weren't able to see it and",,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,You need a,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,Very scientific tool to,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,"Oh yes, Chris",,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Chris,"yeah so since we're talking about equipment um I wanted to say, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks like Luis said, but also on masks and suits",,,,response,0,0,1
428,Teacher,"yeah they use a lot of equipment, so the research on things to find",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher, I think so,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,Water particle,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,yeah you,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,yeah so that's quite I mean they use a lot of tools and then my my machine and then microscope or those still thanks to particle to find a water on them,,,210.4,remark,0,0,1
428,Chris,yeah I I bet they need a lot of different tools to to find the water probably probably more than one right,,,210.4,response,0,0,1
428,Teacher,yeah yeah,,,,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,"I believe so, yes",,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,And then one of them is a microscope to look at it closely to find a water,,,130.3,remark,0,0,1
428,Chris,"Right yeah because you said, well, that the craters you said they're not full of water, like, I thought right because the water is so small",,,130.3,response,0,0,1
428,Teacher,that's good,,,110.1,remark,0,0,1
428,Teacher,"Yes, Oliver",,,,remark,0,0,1

428,Luis,"No, I didn't really read it cuz I figured I already knew everything so",,,,response,2,0,1
428,Teacher,So Please go back and read it again and then find out something you may find something new,,,150.1,remark,2,0,1
428,Teacher,or at the same time or you can help other classmate who they may not have on,,,110.3,remark,2,0,1
428,Luis,okay okay,,,110.3,response,2,0,1
428,Teacher,"They you might find something that you classmate may you may find something that you don't know and your classmate may know so, you should stay okay?",,,,remark,2,0,1
428,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,1
428,Teacher,So,,,,remark,2,0,1
428,Teacher,um,,,,remark,2,0,1
428,Teacher,Chris what what was your answer?,,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
428,Chris,um I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,120.4,response,2,0,1
428,Teacher,"Okay um that's good they found the water, but how much I don't think we they didn't find it full a lot of water",,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
428,Teacher,No does anyone can answer the how much water they found,,,130.2,remark,2,0,1
428,Chris,they didn't?,,,130.2,response,2,0,1
428,Teacher,I don't think,,,,remark,2,0,1
428,Teacher,Does Anyone know,,,,remark,2,0,1
428,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,1
428,Farrah,"My in my section is said it was microscopic um so that means that it was really, really small amount of water",,,,response,2,0,1
428,Teacher,  Chris,,,110.4,remark,2,0,1
428,Teacher,"Yes I think we today, you need to see microscope, so it is very small amount they found the water or I think",,,110.4,remark,2,0,1
428,Chris,Okay well in the part that i've read it said that they found the water deep in the moon's polar craters and when I go swimming in the deep part of the pool there's more water in the deep part of the pool than in the shallow part of the pool,,,110.4,response,2,0,1
428,Teacher,"Yes, yeah it's true when you go swimming you go, you have to go through in the deep water, so that you know you have fun, but what they don't they they found in deep location in the moon not  in the deep water they went to the",,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
428,Chris,okay,,,130.3,response,2,0,1
428,Teacher,How much water they had too so Chris you can go back and then look at how much water their own says they have found I think they say that okay,,,420.3,remark,2,0,1
428,Teacher,"Okay, so you can really look deep",,,120.2,remark,2,0,1
428,Teacher, Hi ya Jazmin yes,,,120.2,remark,2,0,1
428,Teacher,You can look your answers are there you are correct  they had water,,,110.2,remark,2,0,1

428,Teacher,Your answer what was your answer,,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
428,Jazmin,I said NASA sent a small machine,,,120.4,response,2,0,1
428,Oliver,I think your answer is wrong because me and Farrah have the right answer the microscope is the right answer,,,,response,2,0,1
428,Teacher,What Was your right answer was? Oliver,,,120.4,remark,2,0,1
428,Jazmin,but the teacher didn't say that you had the right answer Oliver,,,120.4,response,2,0,1
428,Oliver,I think the microscope is the right answer,,,,response,2,0,1
428,Oliver,"Well, I think that we're right and you're wrong",,,,response,2,0,1
428,Jazmin,"Well, I don't know that's why I asked the teacher",,,,response,2,0,1
428,Farrah,"Well, I mean you didn't actually say the name of the machine Jazmin I said the microscope is the name",,,,response,2,0,1
428,Jazmin,"Oh well, it's I got it right out of the story",,,,response,2,0,1
428,Chris,"I think that Jazmin's one is right, because um in in the part where it talks about the microscope",,,,response,2,0,1
428,Chris,"It says that they're looking at the water in in in Jazmin's section, it says that they're investigating and I think investigating is closer to um what's the word in the question oh discover, I think, investigate this closer to discover than looking at something",,,,response,2,0,1
428,Chris,"Also, I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,2,0,1
428,Teacher,"Oh yeah but I don't think they This time they sended those kinda equipment equipment, because on the moon, they just um yeah they use those kind of equipment in time to time for different for different researches, but not this time I don't think",,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
428,Chris,Well they need them to breathe on the moon,,,130.3,response,2,0,1
428,Teacher,"yeah true yes, if they go to the moon, yes, they do have those tanks and wearing those big thing, for the oxygen reasons but",,,,remark,2,0,1
428,Teacher,Do they go to the moon? The astronauts? Or is it the machine was sent to moon? What do you think Chris?,,,210.3,remark,2,0,1
428,Chris,Oh,,,210.3,response,2,0,1
428,Chris,"I don't know I just thought the astronauts went to the moon, but I guess in the story",,,,response,2,0,1
428,Chris,"Well, it says scientists scientists have found evidence",,,,response,2,0,1
428,Teacher,"yeah scientists found the evidence, but scientists found the evidence, but it doesn't mean that science went there to find it the machine could be sended there and  then found the thing right",,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
428,Chris,Oh,,,130.3,response,2,0,1
428,Chris,I didn't think about that,,,,response,2,0,1
428,Teacher,"It is scientists, they did find it but",,,,remark,2,0,1
428,Teacher,"They went sent the machine to put the moon and , then they found some water right, yes, Oliver",,,130.3,remark,2,0,1
428,Oliver,um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch,,,130.3,response,2,0,1
428,Oliver,I wanted to say thank you for what you said to Chris at helping me think about looking more closely at,,,,response,2,0,1
428,Oliver,the story to try to understand more of the details of the story,,,,response,2,0,1
428,Teacher,"Okay, thank you, thank you for your time okay have a good day bye",,,,remark,2,0,1

429,Teacher,i'm excited to work with you guys too,,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"So you guys just got done with reading the moon, is a desert",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Luis,yeah yeah but I I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,0,3
429,Teacher,yeah you do know a lot about space,,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"So you when we went through and circled the evidence from the text about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon, what did you say again Luis",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
429,Luis,um well I sat at scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,120.4,response,0,0,3
429,Teacher,And Luis that's totally right the scientists do use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks on the moon,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"When we were thinking about what we were what scientists were using specifically to find water, though, do you think that there's anything else that maybe they could have used that wasn't oxygen tanks",,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
429,Luis,"um I mean there's probably some other staff what I know that if there are astronauts on the moon, they definitely have oxygen tanks",,,210.3,response,0,0,3
429,Teacher,yeah you're right if scientists on the moon don't have oxygen tanks that's not any good ISM,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"um do you Luis or any of our other friends, do you guys know where can you guys look at your texts and see if you can find anything else about",,,120.1,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,When scientists were looking for water on the moon,,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,yeah Farrah,,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Farrah,"Well, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope",,,,response,0,0,3
429,Farrah,To look really closely because in the story and said that the water they found was microscopic,,,,response,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"yeah they That is exactly what the story said, and that was a really good observation",,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"before they found that water What were they what tools, were they using to look in try to get that water out of the ground",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
429,Farrah,"Well, I don't know because I thought it was the microscope, because how can you find something if it's too small to see",,,110.2,response,0,0,3
429,Teacher,You know what Farrah that's a great point can we all look at our text and look at the second paragraph,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Jazmin,"yeah I found my answer, and the second paragraph, and I said that NASA to small machine and I don't understand why my answer is from",,,,response,0,0,3
429,Teacher,Jazmin your answer is completely correct you're totally right when you said that NASA a small machine,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,could you guys look at your text and see if you can find any more specific information in that second paragraph,,,420.3,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,I was wondering if you guys could be any more specific with that,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Oliver,"Okay, second paragraph right we're Jazmin was talking about at SAS NASA simple small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,,response,0,0,3
429,Teacher,yeah that's a great observation good job deb Thank you so much that's exactly the kind of answer we were looking for when we are trying to figure out,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"What equipment scientists use to discover the water on the moon, but all of our other observations were also really close so",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,you're right Farrah when you said that they need to find they would need to use a microscope because the water was microscopic they probably did have to use a microscope but that's not necessarily what they were using to find to discover that water right,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
429,Farrah,"Okay, so you're saying",,,130.1,response,0,0,3
429,Farrah,They had to use this orbiter to find the water before they could see it,,,,response,0,0,3
429,Teacher,Exactly,,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Farrah,"Oh okay well that's really cool, but how, how could I have figured that out, on my own like without Jazmin's help",,,,response,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"yeah so a really good way to think about that, when we're reading Our question is it says, did they used to discover water on the moon, and you can look",,,420.1,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,Through the paragraphs and try to find things that,,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"Are that words that are similar to discover or can be associated with the word discover, so the second paragraph, said this lunar orbiter looks and another way to when you're looking for something and then you find that you're discovering it right",,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,So looking for keywords like that,,,420.1,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,You find specific,,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,Questions answers to specific questions yeah Chris,,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Chris,"Oh well, I I went to NASA so I know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like even said, but also on masks and suits",,,,response,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"yeah that's absolutely right, I am not sure if, when we were when the scientists were using the Lunar orbiter to investigate if they had any",,,410.2,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"but they definitely if there are astronauts on the moon they're definitely going to need things like those big helmets and their space suits and oxygen tanks, those are super important for people if they're going up in space",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,astronauts on the moon at that time,,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Chris,Okay,,,,response,0,0,3
429,Chris,So there's no astronauts hmm,,,,response,0,0,3
429,Luis,um yeah I just looked at that story Chris and it doesn't even say anything about astronauts actually,,,,response,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"yeah it doesn't necessarily say anything about astronauts, but it is a lot more fun to kind of imagine that there was astronauts in there up there",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"And I think when we hear the word NASA we our minds automatically are like Oh, we can think of the scientists and the scientists in spacesuits right that's what I think of at least I think of an astronaut",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"But lately, especially NASA has been using a lot of other tools and a lot of the other equipment, like some of the other things that we were talking about and the small machines, the Lunar orbiters Jazmin that you helped us find",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,"And they have been able to send those things in space, instead of just people",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,That as Sao Paulo,,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,I agree i'm a huge fan of space,,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Oliver,"i'm i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now, but before we go, I wanted to say thank you so much for helping us think about",,,,response,0,0,3
429,Oliver,"The words in the story that we're like the word discover because I really thought it was a microscope, but when you put it that way, it really made a lot more sense, why it was the Lunar orbiter so thank you so much",,,,response,0,0,3
429,Teacher,you're welcome Thank you guys for an awesome class,,,,remark,0,0,3
429,Teacher,good morning class,,,,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,So we just read the water on the moon passage in class right?,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,1,0,3
429,Luis,"Um excuse me teacher, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"Yes, that is, I love that you already know a lot about space Luis",,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,but we are talking about the moon specifically today and I just want to go over a couple of our response questions that we can make sure we all understand the vocabulary that we learned in this lesson and we can all be on the same page does that sound good,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
429,Luis,yeah okay,,,110.3,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,Do you know anything that's super fun about space what's your favorite space fact,,,140.1,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,Maybe you can help us with a couple things Luis,,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
429,Luis,"Okay um that there's no gravity in space, you know so like if you go there, you can kind of almost like fly like a superhero",,,110.3,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,yeah Luis Do you know anything else about the moon,,,140.1,remark,1,0,3
429,Luis,"um not Really, about the moon, no",,,140.1,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"What about anybody else does anybody else in our group know anything specific about the moon, that we didn't read in our activity",,,140.1,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,Chris yeah,,,,remark,1,0,3
429,Chris,"yeah I know that they're doing a lot of work to try to see If the moon could be inhabitable or if they can study some of the geology on the moon, to see how we can use it to help us here on earth",,,,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"yeah that's very true Chris, I, like the vocabulary word geology you used, could you tell our friends, what the word geology means because you could you help us figure out what that word means",,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
429,Chris,yeah geology is like the study of rocks,,,110.3,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"yeah awesome Thank you so much, and we know that the moon is kind of one big rock so it seems like there's a lot of geology that's going to happen going on in the moon, huh?",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,let's look at our discussion questions so we were supposed to think about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,And I wanted to check in and see what evidence you guys circled maybe you guys could give me the number that you circled in our readings for where you found that answer,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
429,Chris,"Um, I found mine in paragraph one",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
429,Jazmin,I found mine in paragraph two,,,,response,1,0,3
429,Oliver,Um me too,,,,response,1,0,3
429,Farrah,Mine was in paragraph three,,,,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"Okay, so friends let's think we all seem to get really different answers and that's always so interesting there's A couple of words that I really wanted to focus on when we were thinking about our discussion questions when we think of the word discover what does that word mean can we think about what maybe it means to discover something?",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"So um, for example, if I was going to start if I wanted to discover a new element or a new planet Luis we've been learning, you said you really like space and there's been a lot of planets that have been discovered recently right So if I, what do you think that means?",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
429,Luis,um so like when they discover new planet it's like they find out that it's there they they find it or yeah something like that,,,210.2,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,yeah so to to discover some things means to find or to locate something,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,so when we read our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,Jazmin did you have a question?,,,,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"I want us to think about what equipment like what things did scientists use to find water on the moon right, we want to make sure we are thinking about how they found it specifically",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
429,Jazmin,"yeah um, so I think that's why I picked the answer from paragraph two, so I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,210.2,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"Farrah or Jazmin That was a great point, could you read out the part in paragraph to that you thought gave you your answer",,,120.3,remark,1,0,3
429,Jazmin,yeah it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter line at the south Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater,,,120.3,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,can we think of what the specific name of that small machine is I want us to get as specific as possible when we're thinking about this specific equipment,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"Awesome Jazmin Thank you so much so, you said that NASA sent a small machine which is very true and that's exactly what we were looking for",,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
429,Jazmin,yeah it's called the Lunar orbiter,,,,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,The lunar orbiter,,,,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"so um Farrah I saw I know that you thought you were thinking about the microscope and I love that you notice that, from what are one of the other paragraphs, the third paragraph right, it was Farrah and Oliver you guys found that in the third paragraph yeah?",,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"yeah so um I love that you guys were thinking about them that equipment, because that is an important tool but  were they using it, the microscope to find it or to look at it",,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
429,Farrah,"Well, I know they were using it to look at it, because that's exactly what it says in the answer um",,,210.3,response,1,0,3
429,Farrah,"Oh, if they were using it to find it on I don't know",,,,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"Ya, Oliver?",,,,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"You don't know so i'm going to read you guys, paragraph three, and then I would love to hear you guys I would love to hear if you guys think that the microscope was used to help find it or maybe to discover it",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
429,Oliver,"Okay well in paragraph three, they do use the word found it says All water they found was microscopic",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"Yes, that is very true so that the word microscopic is a little bit different than the word microscope right, so the water they found is super tiny, and if they want to see it, they would need to look really close with a microscope right",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
429,Oliver,Oh okay okay,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"yeah So if I was going to if we were going to completely start over, and I was going to ask you guys what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon, what would you guys tell me",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,The lunar orbiter,,,,remark,1,0,3
429,Jazmin,um I guess i'd use Jazmin's idea uh the Lunar orbiter,,,,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"Chris, what about you",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
429,Chris,um you know I went to NASA so I know that scientists use of lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"Yes, um what What about the paragraph that or the sentence that Jazmin helped us find in paragraph to do you think you could look at that and then maybe think again about what specific equipment that the Lunar that the Scientists are using",,,120.1,remark,1,0,3
429,Chris,Okay yeah um so it's a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,120.1,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,The lunar orbiter and what did that lunar orbiter do Chris,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
429,Chris,It looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"Yeah, Oliver?",,,,remark,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"Yes, and that's how they found the water on there right",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
429,Oliver,"yeah oh cuz ice yeah sorry teacher, I was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll see you later okay",,,,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"Okay, thank you",,,,remark,1,0,3
429,Chris,Bye teacher,,,,response,1,0,3
429,Teacher,"hi friends, how you doing",,,,remark,2,0,3
429,Chris,"Hi teacher, I'm good",,,,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,So I want to focus on the second discussion question um so the can is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,Luis?,,,,remark,2,0,3
429,Luis,"Okay, I think I got this all figured out now so i'm all good",,,,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,Can you tell me what your answer is too is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
429,Luis,"yeah so I said water can be split up into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,Can anyone tell me what they think the word valuable means?,,,,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"Yes, so Luis I see how you got that from our text and you focused on our fifth paragraph and talked about what what water is made up of",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,I want to focus on the word valuable specifically,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,That can be one way to think about it,,,,remark,2,0,3
429,Oliver,Um valuable is like when something costs a lot of money,,,,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,so to be valuable is similar to what Oliver said it to have great worth it to be worth a lot and that could be money like um how we think of it often or it can be in other ways,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"so um Luis you were talking about the parts of water; hydrogen and oxygen, why are hydrogen and oxygen helpful what makes those things valuable?",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
429,Luis,"um okay cuz you know, like accident, we gotta breathe man, we need oxygen to breathe, so that automatically it's like really valuable cuz we'll die",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,2,0,3
429,Luis," I don't know we learned that it's a gas, but I don't know what we use it for",,,,response,2,0,3
429,Luis,"Hydrogen? I don't know, I mean",,,,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"Um Farrah I liked how you were thinking about the future and how we were talking about the future in our readings right that right now we can't do some of these things, but in the future, we might be able to",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"I want us to focus on how it could be valuable right now, like if we could just We could transport to the future and we're on the moon, and we have all these things, and we know that there's water there, what can we do what would be valuable about having water there, why would having water there be helpful for us, I want to draw your guys's attention to the fourth, yes, so the fourth paragraph",,,210.1,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"And then also I want Farrah Oliver and Chris, will you guys look at the fourth paragraph and then Jazmin and Luis will you guys look at the bottom, the last two sentences in the fifth paragraph?",,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"And then, when you guys are done, I would love for Chris, I want you to tell us a little bit about what you found in the fourth paragraph that made you think that water having water on the moon can be beneficial or valuable and then",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,Jazmin I would love for you to tell us why what you found in the fifth paragraph,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,Jazmin?,,,,remark,2,0,3
429,Jazmin,"Okay, so um in the fifth paragraph, it says that like rocket fuel helps spacecrafts to move and the moon can serve as a stop for spacecrafts but I don't, I'm still confused",,,,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"Yes, sorry I think I drew your attention to the wrong part of that paragraph, will you read the i'm going to read it to you that way I don't have to keep telling you which sentence ""moon water could be useful in other ways, water can be broken down into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen""",,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,Just like you said Luis right?,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher," Rocket fuel can help spacecrafts to move,"" just like a gas helps cars",,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"""astronauts can breathe oxygen, oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel",,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"so friends, what about other than just helping astronauts breathe, what else can hydrogen and oxygen be used for?",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,2,0,3
429,Luis,"Okay, I heard this one, and so it can like help spacecrafts to move like fuel",,,120.3,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"um Oliver and Farrah and Chris you guys read the fourth paragraph right What did you guys think could be useful, there are, what did that tell you about the water",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
429,Chris,"Okay, well, it says that the astronauts could drink the water um and it says it's the water is heavy I mean I already had that part in my answer",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,yeah so,,,,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,Go ahead,,,,remark,2,0,3
429,Farrah,"Well, I didn't have either of those so I guess I could see how they could drink the water and that'd be important, maybe they'd have like a water fountain up there, or something",,,,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,So I want us to really think about how heavy water can be if water is really heavy and we have to send something all the way out into space Using lots of rocket fuel and we spend lots of money on that do you think it makes sense to try to carry up all of that stuff with us if we already have it on the moon?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,No,,,,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"Do you guys think it would be helpful If we already had if we didn't have to Make rocket fuel here and take it up take extra up with us, do you think it'd be helpful to have it on the moon already too",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"yeah so I want you guys to think about and I want you guys to use this sentence frame, I want you to say I started thinking started out thinking Blank and then you can put your answer that you start you had at the beginning, and now I think  Blank So what do you guys think now that we know that water can be super useful for breathing and for drinking for astronauts and for rocket fuel and so net how that can help you for the future",,,530.1,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,Farrah?,,,,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,Yeah,,,,remark,2,0,3
429,Farrah,"yeah okay um I started out thinking well in the future it will be valuable as well it's in the right now, it won't be valuable because it's not ready yet um but now i'm thinking that maybe if they can get on of water, then they could like have something to drink and they could like make fuel up there too",,,,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"And what about that, and when you guys are thinking about that what parts can we use in the future when we're reading a question like this do you think that there's any of the words that we understand better now or anything about this about space that we under, or about the moon, that we understand better now or water?",,,520.1,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"What do we did we learn about water is it super light and easy, can I carry a bunch of water around super easily",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
429,Chris,"No, so we know that it's heavy you know what teacher, I was reading that through could be a base on the moon by 2024",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,No way Chris that's so cool would you guys like to go to the moon,,,140.1,remark,2,0,3
429,Chris,yeah yeah,,,140.1,response,2,0,3
429,Chris,"Man I would love to go to the moon, I don't know about y'all",,,,response,2,0,3
429,Chris,yeah yeah we would yeah,,,,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"So I would love to hear from Oliver Oliver, what do you think what was something can you give me the sentence frame I gave you guys just a bit ago I started out thinking, and now I think so now next time I can",,,530.1,remark,2,0,3
429,Oliver,"Okay um well I started out thinking, but there wasn't gonna be there's no way that we're gonna have any water on the moon so that's not valuable, but now I think I think that they might be able to make it happen um and so part",,,530.1,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,"I would love to hear a little bit more about what do you think what different ways, could we use water, why is it valuable",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
429,Oliver,"Okay um and it's it's it's valuable cuz we could drink it on the moon, and we can make fuel on the moon and um it's really heavy to carry so, then they won't have to carry it on the spaceship",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,yeah exactly,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
429,Teacher,do you guys have anything else that you think that hasn't already been shared by Farrah and Oliver that you think that is super exciting that you think now that you didn't understand before?,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
429,Oliver,"Um Actually teacher Oh, something that is super exciting is that it's time for lunch",,,150.1,response,2,0,3
429,Oliver,But I wanted to say thank you for asking some questions about like how my thinking um it's kind of changed because I guess I wasn't really thinking about like what,,,,response,2,0,3
429,Teacher,Awesome,,,,remark,2,0,3
429,Oliver,"All those other parts of the story, but since you were asking us all those questions now I realized that there's a lot more information on that I kind of missed in the story",,,,response,2,0,3

430,Teacher,awesome i'm really excited to work with you all to my name is Teacher you can call me Teacher if you'd like um and I wanted to get right into discussing the passage that you guys read yes Luis,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
430,Luis,um yeah Teacher I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,150.1,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"Oh well, Luis that's awesome because you know what I had to do a little bit of research myself to learn about space and so maybe since you're here in this group",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"You can help your classmates and maybe even helped me to learn a little bit more to I think you'd be a really great resource for us, what do you think",,,,remark,0,0,3
430,Luis,Oh yeah that sounds great I would love to,,,,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"amazing all right, well, I was just wondering if anyone wanted to share just their thoughts on the text, what did you think about it were you interested in learning about water on the moon, is it something that maybe isn't your favorite subject any any thoughts um let's see Chris",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Chris,yeah she,,,120.4,response,0,0,3
430,Chris,thought it was amazing,,,,response,0,0,3
430,Chris,"That they found these craters full of water on the moon, I never imagined there being water up there, it is so cool",,,,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,and you know what when i'm looking at your response to the question which was about,,,120.2,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"yeah Chris, I had a similar, but I did not know that they could find water on the moon",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"I really liked how you pointed out that they did find water and that they found water in craters because that's exactly right that's where they found the water, but I was wondering Chris",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,What equipment to the scientists use to discover the water,,,,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"Based on what you read, could you maybe tell me how they found the water, what did they use to find the water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Chris,um I,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
430,Chris,uh huh,,,,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"Okay that's Okay, if you guys have the texts in front of you, we can look where it says number two do you see where it says number two i'll read it for you, it says NASA",,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"A small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar crater and these ice deposits are very small so based on those couple of sentences Chris, what do you can you tell me what the name of the equipment they used was",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Chris,"um well, I think the name I heard was",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
430,Chris,um listen we're better,,,,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"yeah Chris that's exactly right, so that is the machine they send actually was called the l cross mission, but they sent a space to try and discover where the water was on the moon awesome, thank you for sharing that with me Chris, that was a great job let's see Farrah",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Farrah,"Okay, so I said something different, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,And you know what's the banner that could be a little bit confusing,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,and you know I think deb also had a similar response right death,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,0,0,3
430,Oliver,I saw the same thing about the microscope,,,,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"yeah and so we'll first let's see raise of hands, how many of you have used a microscope before",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"yeah right so in depth, maybe our friend, can you share with you some of their experiences, but like you said Farrah microscopes are used to kind of blow things up and make them larger to our eyes that we can see them",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,Right and so that is correct it and they needed the microscope to see the water but they had to use something different find the water,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,Do you understand the difference,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
430,Oliver,"Well, how can you find something if you can't see it",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"And that's a really great question that's what I bought to Farrah, but when I read about the",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,mission that they had what they used was a piece of a rocket and they put that rocket into that piece into the crater which was,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,A big kind of like almost like an explosion of dirt and debris and dust and inside of that puff and cloud of debris and does,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"That is where they found the hydrogen and where they found the water, but do you see how they needed that lunar orbiter in order to put that piece inside the crater and then they use the to look even closer and see how much water they bound",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Oliver,wow,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
430,Oliver,Reach Every Reader:thats so cool,,,,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"yeah, and so I also want to circle back to Jazmin because Jazmin I think that you circled right away that NASA sent a small machine so did you notice that that's what they use to find the water",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"yeah right and but seeing Luis, you said you know so much about space, I was wondering if you could share a little bit about your your answer to the question and then dead i'll get to you, right after Luis okay",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
430,Jazmin,"um yeah so I said that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, because if they're scientists up on the moon, they definitely need oxygen tanks for sure",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"mm hmm and that's what scientists definitely need oxygen tanks, because even what is oxygen and help us do we need oxygen to what",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Jazmin,to breathe,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"To breathe exactly, and so the question is asking about what the scientists use to discover the water because does anybody know what water is made up this might be a tricky question for some of us",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,hmm I mean,,,,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"Are you hearing person what is water, made up of",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Chris,Water is H two o,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,that's right h2o does anyone know what he stands for,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Chris,"yeah yeah it's hydrogen, then the always oxygen because when I I went to NASA and I saw lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"Exactly that's exactly right and so that's why they're so excited for this discovery of water, because if they find water, then they can use the hydrogen and oxygen",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"to fuel the rockets, or they can use it to help us breathe so Luis that was correct in saying that the scientists they use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,does that make sense to Luis,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"But, did you understand that the question was asking how did they find the water and what did they use and so that's why Jazmin circle, the Lunar orbiter the small machine",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
430,Chris,Ah um yeah I can see that,,,150.1,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"yeah but I like even how your mind was thinking about other types of equipment that scientists use that shows that it's something that really interests, you and I really liked it that's where your",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,thought process when when you were answering the question that was a good thought to have,,,,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"All right, dad i'm so sorry for keeping you waiting What would you like to share",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Oliver,What okay um I just had a quick question because all that stuff about the plume of dust and everything that's really cool but I don't know how I want to know that i'm,,,120.4,response,0,0,3
430,Oliver,"Otherwise, like if you didn't tell us, I think what i'm still a microscope because I didn't know any of that",,,,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"You know what I think that's right dead and my research, I actually was able to watch a video about discovering water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,So that's where I found that extra knowledge and maybe I could even share that video with you all some time to it seems like something you might be interested in,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"But, based on the text right you're right did they did not talk about the food in the text, so if we're looking back at the text and we're really thinking about the question",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"Right, the question doesn't ask us how did the scientists see the water, the question asked us what equipment that they use to discover the water",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
430,Teacher,so when you think about it that way does it make a little bit more sense that the answer would be the Lunar orbiter,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
430,Oliver,"Okay yeah i'm starting to see the arm oh oh I just looked at the clock on so sorry we have to go to lunch, right now, but I just wanted to say thank you so much",,,210.2,response,0,0,3
430,Oliver,for helping us understand how the Lunar orbiter works and how the question works to that was so helpful when you helped us see the difference between finding the water and seeing a water Thank you so much for teaching us today,,,,response,0,0,3
430,Teacher,"Thank you, I had so much fun listening to you all and hearing your thoughts and hopefully we'll have more time at a different class to talk more about the moon and more about science",,,,remark,0,0,3
430,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: Hello,,,,response,1,0,3
430,Teacher,hi everyone how are you doing today,,,,remark,1,0,3
430,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: we're so excited to work with you,,,,response,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"Yes, i'm excited to see you all again as well",,,,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,1,0,3
430,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: i'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,3
430,Teacher,And that's amazing because you know what if then i'm thinking that maybe because you know so much about space already you can kind of be almost like an expert for us today and for our lesson,,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"Because I can maybe refer to you, if I have any questions and your classmates can also ask you questions about the knowledge that you already have because you know so much about space, what do you think",,,,remark,1,0,3
430,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: That sounds great,,,,response,1,0,3
430,Teacher,awesome,,,,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"Alright, so first I was wondering what did everyone think about the passage that we read about water on the moon Is anyone have any thoughts or any ideas about what they read let's see Farrah",,,140.1,remark,1,0,3
430,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: Well um I just found it surprising that there was water on the moon, I never thought about that, before, so I was very surprised",,,140.1,response,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"Farrah, I completely agree with you, I also was very surprised I did not know that there was water on the moon, so this text was very illuminating for me that I learned something new",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"Oliver or Chris, I know you also had had your hands up was there, something that you either one of you wanted to share",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
430,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: Oh yeah well I sort of like Farrah it really blew my mind that there was all this water on the moon like these craters full of water oh it's so cool to picture and I really want to go and see it one day,,,150.1,response,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"that's amazing I really hope that you can Maybe you can be an astronaut, one day, and actually get to go on the moon, that would be amazing to know that what am I students got to visit the moon, that would be incredible",,,140.1,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"um so let's see as i'm looking at your responses, I think that you all had a good understanding of the text and it seemed that you all enjoyed reading the text",,,,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,But what I want to help you and walk you through today is helping you to think about what exactly the question is asking you,,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"Because a lot of times when we answer questions we might get extra information or answer questions that that weren't being asked, so I think that right now",,,,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,it's a good idea to think about exactly what the wording of the question was and think about the vocabulary and the words that were presented to us so that we can figure out the best way to answer the question without,,,,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"wasting your own time, because we really want to think about moving forward in the future, how to answer questions to the best of our ability",,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"So before we get started, what I really want all of you to do is look at the question that was being asked and circle, what do you think are the most important parts of the question so circle words that you think make the most sense and the words that you think are most important for you to answer the question correctly",,,,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,So i'm going to give you all about a little bit less than a minute just to do that read the question and circle what you think the most important words are in the question,,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"OK, so now that giving you that time would anyone like to share what words to use circle that you think are the best words that will help you answer the question",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,1,0,3
430,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: And I said he is the most important word would be and discover,,,,response,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"Jazmin that's a great word, you know i'm gonna write that down to make sure that I remember that discover",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,That is a great word that will help us answer the question and said what equipment was used to discover water on the moon great Jazmin Thank you,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
430,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: yeah and so i'm just wondering, because I know that's the question and my answer was NASA send a small machine and X equipment and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,120.2,response,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"You know Jazmin when I read your answer, I actually thought that your answer completed the question correctly",,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"The, the question was what equipment was used to discover wate",,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,so I think you circling discover is a great Just a great choice for yourself,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"I think that what you said, made perfect sense that the Lunar orbiter is what equipment with us to discover water on the moon,",,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"I think that let's see what some other of your classmates circled as well, but I do think that your answer made complete sense when I was reading over the question,",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,so thank you for being our first brave volunteer to share thanks Jazmin,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
430,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: Thank you,,,110.1,response,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"All right, let's go Chris, what did you circle",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
430,Chris,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, so um well I circled equipment, because well, so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits so I picked equipment",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"Yes, I think equipment is a great word to circle",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"Because what we're trying to figure out is what the equipment was right, what is the tool, what is the actual object right that the scientists use to discover the water",,,,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"We're not asking how they got there, we're not asking how much water was that we're asking the question is asking what exactly did they use what equipment that's a great word i'm going to write that down on my paper as well, what equipment didt the scientists use?",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,Great Chris Thank you so much for sharing,,,,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"All right, let's move our last one Farrah What did you circle",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
430,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, well, I circled two is that okay",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
430,Teacher,Of course,,,,remark,1,0,3
430,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: I circled it equipment, just like Chris, and I also circled water",,,,response,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"Yes, exactly because equipment, again, that is a good word just circle because we're trying to figure out what object what tools they use to find",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"And the water, of course, that is the object that they were, that is what they were trying to find is the water so it's important to know",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"What equipment they used and what they were actually looking for and water like you said Farrah is what they were looking for So yes, i'm also going to write your word down as well",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"And so, this is a tool that you can all use whenever you're answering questions to circle vocabulary or words within the question that you think",,,,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"are most important for you to focus on and are most important for you to look back at the passage to try and determine what the best answer to the question is, is always helpful to circle key words in the question Oliver, what do you think",,,510.1,remark,1,0,3
430,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: um well,,,510.1,response,1,0,3
430,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: Actually, we have to oh I just looked at the clock, but thank you for teaching us this strategy today oh",,,,response,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"Of course i'm sad I don't have more time with you all, but I really hope that letting you all know how important it is to identify or select which words are most important within the question is always going to help you",,,,remark,1,0,3
430,Teacher,"determine the answers that is always going to be a key strategy to figuring out the best way to answer any questions so it seems like you all have a good grasp of that and i've really enjoyed our time with each other, today, so thank you",,,,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,hey team is awesome to see you guys today how are you guys doing,,,,remark,0,0,3
431,Farrah,we're great we're really excited to meet you,,,,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"i'm really excited to meet you guys too and i'm also really excited to talk about this reading i'm a science teacher, so I thought this was super cool did you guys read anything that you thought was interesting in that passage",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
431,Chris,yeah I I thought it was so amazing how how the scientists they found craters full of water on the moon,,,150.1,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"yeah that was wild Chris,  anyone else read something that I thought was interesting",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
431,Luis,"um yeah well, excuse me um I I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,110.1,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,what's your favorite thing about space Luis,,,140.1,remark,0,0,3
431,Luis,"Oh, my oh wow oh that's really hard um I think my favorite thing about space as how um Pluto used to be a planet and then they said it was a dwarf planet",,,140.1,response,0,0,3
431,Luis,it's not even a planet ,,,,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"yeah that's that's pretty crazy too thanks for sure that Luis i'm glad we have such a space expert here, so I was really excited to talk to you about this say I read a little bit about",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,Your guys's responses for what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon i'm wondering if anyone could share out one of the tools that they remember reading about,,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,For that scientists use during that research method mission,,,,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah get started",,,,remark,0,0,3
431,Farrah,"Okay, I said, you need a scientific tool called him microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"yeah and why did the scientists day to be able to look so closely in this case, does anyone remember reading that",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
431,Oliver,yeah I remember,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,yeah Oliver share with us,,,,remark,0,0,3
431,Oliver,"yeah well okay um I still felt the same as Farrah for the answer, and the reason they need the microscope as because the water well actually it's ice and it's really, really, really small like you can't even see it if you don't have a microscope",,,,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"mm hmm yeah so i'm wondering if anyone can help us dive a little bit deeper into this were there any other tools that the scientist needed for this mission, other than a microscope that we just heard Oliver and Farrah talk about a little bit yeah Jazmin",,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
431,Jazmin,"Okay, well, I said NASA send a small machine, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,130.2,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,Well let's get a little bit deeper into that what was the job of that machine once it actually got to the moon yeah Jazmin you can,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
431,Jazmin,"yeah I think it said he investigated, and then it found the ice deposits in the polar crater",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"Okay, and was there any other tools are parts that machine that helped it do that make it had to get it's all from the moon that you're talking to you had to discover some more ice so",,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"So how to do that Jazmin either you can answer, or maybe Chris or Luis could help you out with that",,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
431,Luis,"um I I I didn't oh okay well i'm My answer is oxygen tanks, I said oxygen tanks",,,130.2,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"Okay, so even were in the passage do you hear them talking about oxygen tanks",,,230.2,remark,0,0,3
431,Luis,yeah that's something I didn't,,,230.2,response,0,0,3
431,Luis,"I didn't really read this one, but it's just not because I already know so much about space I just knew that the equipment was oxygen tanks cuz, how can you go to the moon, without",,,,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,Luis i'm wondering if you to take another look because i'm hearing about some really interesting tools from your classmates,,,420.3,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"That, I think, might you might actually learn something new and it might be really interesting so let's take another look in the passage and see if we can find other tools that the scientists use beyond the",,,420.3,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"The robot that Jazmin was mentioning for them, the small machine",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,What tool do they use once they got that small machine on to the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
431,Jazmin,I I looked at again,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,I just see lunar orbiter and microscope,,,,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"Okay, what was the second one Jazmin",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"microscope, that's what Oliver and Farrah said",,,,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"and where in the passage Chris, can we find one of those",,,230.2,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"yeah exactly Okay, so what i'm hearing from you guys now is, we have two different tools that are really important in this",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,Either one which sentence,,,,remark,0,0,3
431,Chris,"Well, the microscope part that's part three",,,,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,Part Three okay cool and what about our orbiter where do we see evidence that that was an important tool for our scientists,,,230.2,remark,0,0,3
431,Luis,"Oh okay I got it, I read that passage and it talks about that orbiter thing Oh, it sounds amazing and it's in part two",,,230.2,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"Alright cool Luis so now looking back at our original responses what's one thing you think you would be able to change to make a response, a little bit more specific to what you read today",,,530.1,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,yeah Chris start us off,,,,remark,0,0,3
431,Chris,"Well, to to change my answer, so I first I didn't we didn't really talk about equipment in my answer, but now i'm thinking, I need to put equipment and on so I went to NASA actually",,,,response,0,0,3
431,Chris,"And I know that scientists, they have to use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like Luis said but also masks and suits, so I would add, those equipment pieces to my answer",,,,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"Okay, so here's what i'm hearing so much about your experience going to NASA and I definitely want to hear more about that",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,But i'm wondering if we could make sure we circle back right to that passage what are their information in the passage might help you build a stronger answer to the equipment scientists needed for this specific mission,,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
431,Chris,"Sure, the equipment has to be from the story",,,420.2,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,yeah for this one yep,,,,remark,0,0,3
431,Chris,"Okay, well then, I guess, I guess, I picked a microscope I think",,,,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,  right so that's where we're focusing on those tools in particular,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,cool yeah because in this question we're really trying to address how they discovered the water on the moon,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,or revise I should say yeah Oliver,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher,Does anyone else have a reflection on how they would go back and try to edit their answers,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
431,Oliver,yeah yeah okay from from what we talked about it sounds like there's kind of two right answers like you could say um so they sent the Lunar orbiter and then the Lunar orbiter used a microscope,,,210.3,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"awesome so, how would that How would you need to revise your answer to include those two ideas",,,530.1,remark,0,0,3
431,Oliver,"Okay um well, I would say to discover water on the moon scientist used a lunar orbiter with a microscope",,,530.1,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"Okay, so i'm realizing I might have asked a specific question, because that answer sounds wonderful and you're definitely, including those two ideas in a passage i'm wondering how do you feel like that compares to your first answer what was different about those two",,,530.1,remark,0,0,3
431,Oliver,"Oh Okay, well, I think what's different is I added I added the other piece, so that it had it had all the pieces, instead of just one piece",,,530.1,response,0,0,3
431,Oliver,"Oh i'm so sorry I really want to keep going because this class is really fun, but I looked at the clock and actually we have to go to lunch now",,,,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,gotcha that's important,,,,remark,0,0,3
431,Oliver,yeah we're getting hungry so but before we go I just I really wanted to say thank you so much for coming and for listening to,,,,response,0,0,3
431,Oliver,"All of our responses and helping us understand what were the pieces from the story that we could pull out and and how they fit together on that was really helpful to remember, we had to find them in the story",,,,response,0,0,3
431,Teacher,"yeah, of course, it was really nice to meet you guys look forward to talking again soon",,,,remark,0,0,3
431,Teacher," Teacher, it's really nice to get to talk to you guys today how are you guys doing",,,,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,Good morning team I'm Ms,,,,remark,1,0,3
431,Luis,"Um I'm good, Ms",,,,response,1,0,3
431,Luis," Teacher, but um excuse me, I shouldn't be here, I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"All right, thank you for sharing that Luis let's dig into the question a little bit, then",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"When you guys read this article, what did you guys think was the most interesting parts of it?",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
431,Chris,I thought about,,,110.1,response,1,0,3
431,Chris,How they're looking for water on the moon is pretty cool,,,,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,yeahm did anyone else find something else that they thought was interesting,,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"Yeah, Farrah",,,,remark,1,0,3
431,Farrah,"Well, I guess",,,,response,1,0,3
431,Farrah,That they're,,,,response,1,0,3
431,Farrah,That they I don't know I guess I wasn't really thinking about interesting or just kind of answering the question,,,,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"Jazmin What about you, did anything stick out as interesting to you?",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,Okay cool,,,,remark,1,0,3
431,Jazmin,um,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
431,Jazmin,"Well, I guess, I do think it's interesting that they're looking for water on the moon cause I don't know if they expect that we're going to have to like live on the moon, you know, because if we destroy our Earth, then we can't live here",,,,response,1,0,3
431,Jazmin,I don't know,,,,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"Would any of you guys be excited to live on the moon, if you could?",,,140.1,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,yeah that's definitely interesting to think about,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
431,Jazmin,I mean i'd like to live on the moon,,,140.1,response,1,0,3
431,Jazmin,"But I don't think that we can, and I would rather that we take care of the earth that we have",,,,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"Oliver, what do you think? Would you want to live on the moon?",,,140.1,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,yeah that's pretty important,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
431,Oliver,"um yeah I mean that'd be pretty cool you know, and then I could just kind of look down at earth and I can be like hey everybody down there i'm just chilling up here, even though they probably couldn't hear me but it's a pretty cool thing to do",,,140.1,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"yeah I think so too i'm really excited to get to talk to you guys about this text today because i'm a science teacher, so I thought this article was really, really interesting so let's dig in a little bit to our question today",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,Our question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,Does someone think they could start us off by rephrasing that question in their own words?,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"Yeah, Farrah",,,,remark,1,0,3
431,Farrah,Okay um What did the scientists,,,,response,1,0,3
431,Farrah,What did the scientists use to find water on the moon?,,,,response,1,0,3
431,Farrah,Oh yeah okay that's mine,,,,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,Well Jazmin what were you thinking,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
431,Jazmin,um,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
431,Jazmin,"I guess, I was, let me try something different",,,,response,1,0,3
431,Jazmin,What did this scientists from NASA use,,,,response,1,0,3
431,Jazmin," You know I feel like I answered this question, so I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,,response,1,0,3
431,Jazmin,To define water on the moon? I guess that similar to um Farrah's,,,,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"Okay well let's dive in a little bit, thank you, thank you guys, both for repeating the question, it's okay that it sounds similar",,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"So Jazmin, what answer did you write for this question?",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
431,Jazmin,I said NASA sent a small machine,,,110.1,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"Okay, so I hear that you found some specific items from the text",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"but i'm worried that that's not the whole story, could you look back to the text to the text and try to find some more evidence that supports that?",,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
431,Jazmin,More evidence?,,,310.1,response,1,0,3
431,Jazmin,"I mean, I could say the rest of the sentence: NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,,response,1,0,3
431,Jazmin,Is that enough,,,,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,Well let's think a little bit more clearly about that question right so we're trying to see what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon right like you rephrased,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher, so when the Lunar orbiter actually got there,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"I wonder if we could find out more about what tools it actually used to find the water, right?",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"Oliver, do you have an idea?",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
431,Oliver,"Okay yeah I was saying, I was thinking well it says it'll land at the south Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
431,Oliver,"So I mean, on one hand, that means that it's looking for it, but then my answer was about the microscope cause then it says you know at the end you know the water they found is microscopic",,,,response,1,0,3
431,Oliver,"Meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so that was my answer",,,,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"yeah so awesome that you found that really specific name for the tool right that microscopic water, you need a special instrument in order to find it but",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,i'm I was concerned at your response that that wasn't the whole story,,,410.2,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,so I wonder if we could expand our thinking a little bit more about that process of discovering the water,,,120.1,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"Right so let's when we go back to the text, the microscope didn't get there on the on its own, and the Lunar orbiter didn't find the water on its own",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,Chris What was your thinking for this question,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
431,Chris,"I was, I actually found my information in the first paragraph, because that's where they were talking more about the water on the moon",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"Okay, so what else, what did what did you say, for how the scientists found the water",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
431,Chris,"Oh, I said that they found craters full of water on the moon",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"Okay, and you already shared where you found that from in the first paragraph, but i'm",,,,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,what was the question actually asking us to determine about this NASA mission?,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,yeah i'm worried if the response doesn't actually answer the question,,,410.2,remark,1,0,3
431,Chris,"Um what equipment that scientists used to discover oh what equipment, I forgot the equipment part",,,410.2,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher," hang on Chris i'm going to give you guys all second to go back and revise then I want to hear from Farrah and to else haven't I heard from yet, I think",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"yeah awesome Okay, so how would you revise your answer to include that equipment part?",,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,i'll give you guys all a second,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,Luis have I heard from you?,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
431,Luis,Nah but I'm ok,,,150.1,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher, so Luis What did you share for the equipment scientists use?,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"Ok well, Luis let's talk about your response, we'll jump over to Farrah and then we'll all get a second to revise our responses",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
431,Chris,"um I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, you know I went to NASA so I know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"Okay, so that was evidence you got from your own experience",,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
431,Luis,Yeah,,,230.1,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,cool always so interesting to apply your outside knowledge to what we're learning in class,,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"i'm concerned that your response isn't focused on the reading in this case, so I would suggest you go back and try to find evidence from this particular reading that would answer this question",,,430.2,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher,Oliver what are you thinking?,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
431,Oliver,"Yeah sorry to interrupt you teacher, but I was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go so well i'll see you later okay",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
431,Teacher,"Okay, thank you Oliver",,,,remark,1,0,3
431,Teacher," All right, i'm glad we can jump jump right back into it",,,,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,Hi Team,,,,remark,2,0,3
431,Luis,"Excuse me ah, I think I got this all figured out now",,,,response,2,0,3
431,Luis,So I'm all good,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,Luis can I pause you for one second,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher, we're going to hear what Farrahs was thinking and then we're all going to get a chance to revise before we continue okay,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
431,Luis,Okay,,,150.1,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,"Thank you for your patience, I really appreciate it",,,,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,alright Farrah what were you thinking,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
431,Farrah,um yeah so um,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
431,Farrah,Oh man Teacher I don't remember what we were saying before we went on our break,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,Ok,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher, Farrah I just asked you to share out your response to the question of what equipment,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher, Um,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,Scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
431,Farrah,"yeah yeah so I I thought it was a microscope because I read this part where it says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.2,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,but i'm concerned that that might not be the whole story,,,410.2,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,Okay cool so I can hear the specific evidence from that you use your response it's clear in the text where you got that from,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,I would suggest you go back to the text and try to find a little bit more detail about how the scientists were using the microscope to make this discovery,,,420.3,remark,2,0,3
431,Farrah,"Okay, I know you had told",,,420.3,response,2,0,3
431,Farrah,"Oliver that he didn't have the whole story, so I went back because we have the same answer but I don't see",,,,response,2,0,3
431,Farrah,"I feel like it answers all the parts to the questions the WHO and the what and the why I mean, I guess, I could add about to look really closely at the water, do you want me to like do I have to say, water in the answer?",,,,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,Does anyone else think they could answer Farrah's question?,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
431,Chris,"Well, I know I didn't have equipment in my answer, so I had to add that, um but for Farrah's answer I guess she is saying the equipments",,,130.2,response,2,0,3
431,Chris,And she's,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Chris,"got her action word that they're looking really closely um, maybe it is water part, she she has to add a detail about the water itself, maybe",,,,response,2,0,3
431,Jazmin,i'm still confused,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,Thanks for sharing that Jazmin so going back to the text,,,,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,"Did the did the NASA astronauts just send the microscope up to the moon, on its own?",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
431,Jazmin,No,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
431,Jazmin,"cuz that's why I have my answer the small machine because that's they sent that, first, I think",,,,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,"yeah so Jazmin, why was the small machine so important in this example?",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
431,Jazmin,"Because that's what they use to investigate that's what they use to look for the ice deposits, right?",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,Yeah thanks for sharing that,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher," So looking back at the text, are there any other details that you might want to include now",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,"So Oliver, you also wrote your response about the microscope",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
431,Oliver,"Well, I, since you were telling Jazmin the thing that she said was was the right one, then I think i'm gonna change my answer from the microscope to um the lunar orbiter",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,So you think you should shift totally from the microscope to the Lunar orbiter to clarify,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
431,Oliver,"Okay, let me see um well because I thought it was a microscope but then Jazmin just said that they use a lunar orbiter to look for the ice deposit",,,230.3,response,2,0,3
431,Oliver,So,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Oliver,I,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Oliver,Think it's the Lunar orbiter not the microscope maybe?,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,So Oliver where were you getting that idea from because i'm,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,i'm concerned that i'm hearing ideas from your,,,410.2,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,so let's go back through reread and really try to find an idea that's connected to the text,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,"peers, instead of ideas from the text",,,,remark,2,0,3
431,Oliver,Okay,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Oliver,"Okay, so",,,,response,2,0,3
431,Oliver,"In the first paragraph that's what Chris had said, but there is no equipment in that one um so in the second paragraph",,,,response,2,0,3
431,Oliver,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate okay,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Oliver,um the Lunar orbiter will land on the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater well then that's why I think that's the right answer cuz,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Oliver,Cuz it's looking for the ice deposit and that's what the question is asking us what what equipment are used to look for the water,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,"Okay, so if you got to -when you revise your response, what do you think you'll change?",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
431,Oliver,"um Okay, so I was saying that it was the microscope that they're looking at the water closely at, but now I think it's the Lunar orbiter that they're looking for the ice with",,,210.3,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,Does that shift anyone else's thinking about their response to here Oliver explaining where he found that in the text?,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
431,Chris,Okay um I think I didn't even think about that second paragraph because of I was looking for water,,,130.2,response,2,0,3
431,Chris,But now I guess,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Chris,"Now well because both Oliver and Jazmin have the Lunar orbiter and it does say it's looking for ice deposits, so I think that's it too I think that's the right one",,,,response,2,0,3
431,Chris,"And you know what teacher um I read that there might be a base on the moon by 2024 um so maybe maybe they the do need to find the water, so that they can like start drilling for water or something",,,,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,yeah that's definitely what's so important about this right Chris thanks for sharing that,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,So what do you think you would do next time to,,,520.1,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,When you're answering a similar question,,,,remark,2,0,3
431,Chris,me?,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Chris,"Okay, well, I guess i'd make sure that I I have all of the parts to the question in my answer, because I forgot about the first part",,,,response,2,0,3
431,Chris,"yeah, so I think that's what I do is have all the parts of the question in my answer",,,,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,"Okay, great",,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,let's take a minute right now and try to revise our answers and then Luis let's start with you for sharing out a revised answer to this question,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
431,Luis,"Okay um Okay, so I think i'll say",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
431,Luis,That,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Luis,Scientists use a lot of equipment,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Luis,to discover water on the moon like the lunar orbiter,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Luis, yeah I like okay that's my answer,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,"Okay, so what was different about that answer versus your first response?",,,530.1,remark,2,0,3
431,Luis,"Well, I I",,,530.1,response,2,0,3
431,Luis,"I use the name of the equipment from the story because, instead of my background knowledge and",,,,response,2,0,3
431,Luis,"I added the part about discovering water, because that was in the question, like Chris said",,,,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,Jazmin is there anything else you would want to add to Luis's response to make sure that it fully answers the question?,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,Okay cool,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
431,Jazmin,um well I kept the part I put about NASA cuz that's in the story too so,,,110.1,response,2,0,3
431,Jazmin,He said scientists and I said NASA so I said NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to look for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,"Okay, so",,,,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,What do you think from that you would stick with you for next time you're answering a similar question like this?,,,520.1,remark,2,0,3
431,Jazmin,"Hmm what would stick with me is that I have to say, the name of the thing",,,520.1,response,2,0,3
431,Jazmin,And to put more of the,,,,response,2,0,3
431,Jazmin,"details from the story in my answer, or from the question, in my answer",,,,response,2,0,3
431,Teacher,Great,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher,Farrah,,,530.1,remark,2,0,3
431,Teacher, what about you? how did your answer change when you were able to revise it?,,,530.1,remark,2,0,3
431,Oliver,i'm so sorry to interrupt you again teacher but it's time for us to go to lunch,,,530.1,response,2,0,3

431,Oliver,"Thanks for for asking us some really good questions cuz I I hadn't really thought about like why would I change my answer, and how would I change my answer, I was just trying to make it more of a right answer, based on what what Chris and Jazmin said, and then you were like okay Oliver but",,,,response,2,0,3
431,Oliver,"I want to hear from all of the story, and not just from about the people and so then I had to kind of like go back to the story, you know and try to figure out um yeah Oh, why so",,,,response,2,0,3

432,Teacher, That was your answer correct?,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
432,Teacher,Farrah so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
432,Farrah,"Yes, that's what I said",,,230.3,response,0,0,3
432,Teacher, What kind of tool are they using to find that water that we would use a microscope to look at?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
432,Teacher,"Okay, so in our article that we had, talking about water on the moon, I agree that you would need a microscope if you were to look at the stuff those scientists found",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
432,Farrah,"Well, I, I guess, I thought the microscope was that tool because um how, how can you find something if you can't even see it",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
432,Teacher,Take a look specifically at paragraph two,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
432,Teacher,"I agree that is very difficult, but if we were to find that water right we're looking at the water and we're using a microscope, how do we get the water?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
432,Farrah,"Okay well um paragraph two, it says there's a small machine",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
432,Farrah,And it goes to the craters,,,,response,0,0,3
432,Teacher,Very good what's this small machine called?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
432,Farrah,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,0,3

432,Teacher, Does that make a little more sense to you?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
432,Oliver,"Oh, I think so um but I guess um I don't know how I would have picked that I think I think I still I still would have picked the microscope um until you told me to look at paragraph two",,,150.1,response,0,0,3
432,Teacher,"Okay, so we're still thinking about that microscope right? What makes you think that they want to use a microscope?",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
432,Teacher,Is it because you know what a microscope is?,,,,remark,0,0,3
432,Oliver,"Oh well, yeah we we know what a microscope is we use it in science class",,,,response,0,0,3
432,Teacher,Excellent so we're using the stuff that we're learning in science class and bringing it to this discussion right?,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
432,Teacher,"So we're talking let's look at that microscope right so we're using the microscope to look at the water when our question's asking us how we discover water on the moon, when the microscope is used to dis-",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
432,Teacher,hmm let me rephrase Oliver so,,,,remark,0,0,3
432,Teacher,we're focused on the microscope,,,,remark,0,0,3
432,Oliver,I mean I guess I get it now I get that I got that the Lunar orbiter is is how you'll find the water but I guess what i'm saying is,,,,response,0,0,3
432,Oliver,"I don't know if I would have been able to find that, on my own",,,,response,0,0,3
432,Teacher," um let's move on to Chris, and then Oliver I'll come back to you if you're still confused by the end of it okay",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3

432,Chris,"Oh well, um a desert it's really dry",,,210.4,response,0,0,3

432,Teacher,Right so maybe there's not a lot of water,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
432,Teacher, And now let's go back to that question so we're asking what scientists use to discover that little itty bit of water that we can find what tool do you think they are using to find that teeny bit of water?,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
432,Teacher,Jazmin do you want to jump in,,,,remark,0,0,3
432,Jazmin,"yeah so my answer was the small the small the small machine, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,0,3
432,Teacher,Jazmin let's give Chris one more second okay so Chris double check that,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3

432,Chris,well,,,120.2,response,0,0,3
432,Chris,I guess it's that lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,0,3
432,Teacher," Alright Jazmin um your answer was almost there and you've got just half of it, I want you to be a little more specific, so you told me that NASA sent a small machine which is absolutely true, can you tell me what that small machine was called?",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3

432,Chris,And because I am,,,,response,0,0,3
432,Chris,I actually went to NASA and I know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,0,3
432,Teacher,right they do and that's exactly what Luis told me right so Luis you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right?,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
432,Luis,They sure do,,,230.3,response,0,0,3
432,Teacher, Now they use these types of equipment for very specific things right? So an oxygen tank is something that we use when we can't breathe really well,,,210.1,remark,0,0,3
432,Teacher,And that is absolutely true scientists do use all those kinds of equipment,,,210.1,remark,0,0,3
432,Teacher,"So if a scientist is looking for just a little bit of water on the moon, like all the rest of our friends here said, think about what kind of equipment that kind of scientists would use to look for water on the moon",,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
432,Luis,"Okay, I think I get what you're saying like um all astronauts need oxygen tanks, but um certain astronauts need something different to find the water",,,210.3,response,0,0,3
432,Teacher, You need different tools for different tasks right? Oliver,,,210.1,remark,0,0,3
432,Teacher,Possibly,,,210.1,remark,0,0,3

432,Oliver,That really helped me see why my answer wasn't quite the right answer and so thank you so much for helping us understand that,,,,response,0,0,3
432,Teacher,"Well, thank you for working with me",,,,remark,0,0,3
434,Teacher, I want us to backtrack and think about what exactly is equipment,,,210.2,remark,0,,
434,Teacher, So you gave really great responses to this question,,,210.2,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,Hey everyone,,,210.2,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,"Luis, what do you think equipment is",,,,remark,0,,
434,Luis,"Well, actually, I wanted to say I shouldn't be in this room already know all about space",,,,response,0,,
434,Teacher,"that's awesome Luis that you have previous experience you know it's really important that in our group, we work together so maybe you can help out your classmates to understand this text, a little bit better",,,110.3,remark,0,,
434,Luis,Oh yeah I can definitely help out,,,110.3,response,0,,
434,Teacher,"So Luis, do you want to try answering that question for us, what does equipment mean",,,210.2,remark,0,,
434,Luis,um yeah okay so as it's like a tool and it's something you use to do something,,,210.2,response,0,,
434,Teacher,"does anyone else, want to add on to what the word equipment means",,,130.2,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,that's a great definition Thank you so much Luis,,,110.1,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah go ahead",,,,remark,0,,
434,Farrah,um,,,,response,0,,
434,Farrah,"So sometimes equipment could be something old, but sometimes it could be, maybe, something you wear on your body",,,,response,0,,
434,Teacher,that's also a really great idea Thank you so much Farrah for sharing that with us,,,110.1,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,Does anyone else have any other ideas about what equipment is,,,130.2,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,"Alright, I see some head shakes",,,110.1,remark,0,,
434,Teacher, those are both really great definitions that we got from Luis and Farrah,,,110.1,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,"So in this text, we learned that the scientists needed to use equipment on the moon, why do you guys think they needed to use equipment, why couldn't the scientists just look with their eyes or touch with their hands? Go ahead Oliver",,,210.4,remark,0,,
434,Oliver,"So actually in the text it says the water, because we know that are looking for water is really, really, really, really, really small so they can't just look at it, they need equipment to help them find it",,,210.4,response,0,,
434,Teacher,"that's a great idea what type of equipment, do you think they would need to look at water",,,210.4,remark,0,,
434,Oliver,"Um so me and Farrah um we had the same answer, and it was the microscope",,,210.4,response,0,,
434,Farrah,um yeah,,,,response,0,,
434,Farrah,We agreed it's the microscope on because you can't look at it at the water without the microscope so I don't understand why is our answer wrong,,,,response,0,,
434,Teacher,"I want to push you a little bit to think about what the scientists, be able to use the microscopes on the moon?",,,210.3,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,"it's a great answer scientists absolutely use microscopes all the time to look at really small things like, for example, water so that's a great idea that both of you had",,,110.2,remark,0,,
434,Farrah,"Oh well, I mean, I guess, I thought they did on",,,110.2,response,0,,
434,Farrah,yeah I thought so but maybe maybe not since you're asking about it,,,,response,0,,
434,Teacher,Have you ever used a microscope Farrah,,,210.4,remark,0,,
434,Farrah,Oh yeah yeah we use them in science class,,,210.4,response,0,,
434,Teacher, the microscope is a really great tool that lots of scientists use,,,110.1,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,"that's awesome um so how about we just like put a quick pin it, we're going to come back to this microscope idea",,,110.1,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,"um Chris, you have your hand raised earlier, do you want to maybe add on to what Farrah and Oliver have shared so far",,,130.2,remark,0,,
434,Chris,Oh yeah well so i'm in terms of equipment actually I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,130.2,response,0,,
434,Teacher,"yeah and why did, why did NASA astronauts need all those things",,,230.1,remark,0,,
434,Chris,Uh well those things they all they help them stay alive when they go out into space and they keep them safe,,,230.1,response,0,,
434,Teacher, What do they look like?,,,230.1,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,yeah could you tell me a little bit more about those suits,,,230.1,remark,0,,
434,Chris,"Oh, they they kind of look like sleeping bags with arms",,,230.1,response,0,,
434,Chris,they're all white they're kind of poofy um they've got a big kind of backpack looking thing on the back and then they've got the helmet with the with the circle of glass that you can see through,,,,response,0,,
434,Teacher,yeah awesome that's that's a really great description of a space suit i'm really glad you have that experience Chris,,,110.3,remark,0,,
434,Teacher," Farrah, you said that you have used a microscope before right?",,,230.3,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,"um so Oliver and Farrah, i'm going to come back to you guys",,,230.3,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,"So an astronaut or a scientist if they were to use a microscope on the moon like Chris said they would need to wear one of those big suits to keep them safe, do you think it might be a little challenging to use a microscope with a big suit or do you think they'd be totally okay",,,210.3,remark,0,,
434,Farrah,It seems like that'd be pretty hard,,,210.3,response,0,,
434,Teacher,"yeah right, so what type of other equipment, do you think they might need to make it a little easier to look at water",,,210.4,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,Is there something else that they maybe brought?,,,210.4,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,"Farrah, is it okay if Jazmin helps you out this question?",,,130.2,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,"Yes, please",,,,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,awesome Jazmin go ahead,,,,remark,0,,
434,Jazmin,"Okay, so I said and I found this in the story that NASA they sent a small machine to help them find the water",,,,response,0,,
434,Teacher,"yeah that's, what can you tell us which paragraph you saw that in? See they're numbered 1, 2, 3",,,230.2,remark,0,,
434,Jazmin,I found it in paragraph number two,,,230.2,response,0,,
434,Teacher,"awesome great yeah we does everyone see in the first sentence and paragraph two, it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbit to investigate great i'm seeing head nods",,,120.3,remark,0,,
434,Teacher, Do you think that's something that scientists would be able to use to help with the big suit problem?,,,210.4,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,"So coming back to you Farrah so Jazmin helped you out, you pointed out this small machine",,,210.4,remark,0,,
434,Farrah,"yeah yeah it sounds like the microscope it'd be kind of hard, maybe to hold um and look through with the with the circle last thing that Chris was talking about, so it sounds like they might need another tool instead",,,210.4,response,0,,
434,Teacher,"Oliver you started out the same answer as Farrah, do you agree with what you said you want to add on?",,,130.2,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,yeah that sounds great,,,110.1,remark,0,,
434,Oliver,"Oh yeah I agree, but i'm also um I don't really know how I would have figured that out if Chris hadn't told us about the suits and things, how would I have figured that out just on my own",,,130.2,response,0,,
434,Teacher,That's a great question,,,,remark,0,,
434,Teacher," Luis we haven't heard from you, since the beginning",,,130.2,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,Maybe let's come back to Luis,,,130.2,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,can do you think you could answer Oliver's question? How would he know that scientists would face some of these problems with the big suits and having to survive on the moon,,,130.2,remark,0,,
434,Luis,"Um well, I mean it helps to know a lot about space, like me and I guess Chris he kind of knows a lot about space too",,,130.2,response,0,,
434,Luis,"But I would say, when you read about space just try to like picture it in your head and really see it um come to life, and then you can imagine the astronauts calling them microscopes um or using the machine or orbiting the moon, or all of that stuff just picture it in your head Oliver, come on",,,,response,0,,
434,Teacher,"Oh Oliver, I see you raised your hand, do you have a question?",,,,remark,0,,
434,Teacher,Thanks Luis,,,110.3,remark,0,,
434,Teacher," I know you already know a lot about space, but not everyone has necessarily had that experience um, can you tell us -",,,110.3,remark,0,,
434,Oliver,um well actually I looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now all but I wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to all of our answers and taking the time to help us understand the meaning behind the text and the microscope that was so helpful Thank you so much,,,110.3,response,0,,
434,Teacher,Thank you for being great students have a good lunch,,,,remark,0,,
435,Teacher,hi everyone i'm i'm so glad that everybody had shared their answer and I want to call on Farrah could you explain more about what in the text me do you find your answer,,,230.2,remark,0,0,3
435,Farrah,"yeah okay well i'm so on the third paragraph at the bottom, it says that the water is microscopic so you need a microscope to look really closely",,,230.2,response,0,0,3
435,Teacher,"So  what does everyone else think, do you guys agree that the microscope is the technology and the equipment that is needed In order to discover water on the moon, or do you disagree and might think it's something else?",,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
435,Teacher,I see that Luis has his hand up so i'll take your hand and then we'll get back to debating Luis,,,,remark,0,0,3
435,Luis,yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,0,3
435,Teacher,"Well, that I mean we all have parts of knowledge that we love and are passionate about, but I just want to make 100% I just want to be 100% clear that we all have gotten it and understood it",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
435,Luis,Oh yeah oh OK that's fine,,,150.1,response,0,0,3
435,Teacher,"Okay, so back to savannas claim, she said that",,,,remark,0,0,3
435,Teacher,"The scientists need a microscope in order to look really closely at  At the finding water on the moon, is that something that you agree with or disagree with based on the text, and when you answer I want you to be able to find exactly where in the text he found your answer",,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
435,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,0,0,3
435,Oliver,yeah so actually I circled the same as Farrah about the microscopes and,,,,response,0,0,3
435,Oliver,"She she showed us the part in part three, where it talks about arm a water being microscopic um and let's see what else does it say um yeah so you wouldn't be able to see it as if you were looking straight at it",,,,response,0,0,3
435,Teacher,"Yes, so you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, can you read the next sentence out loud, for us, please",,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
435,Oliver,Okay um so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,120.3,response,0,0,3
435,Teacher,So just using that one sentence Oliver and i'm really like i'm really glad that you're making sure that you prove your answer with a point that one sentence you just read you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
435,Teacher,"Why would you need a microscope according to that sentence, what are you going to do with the microscope in that one sentence",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
435,Oliver,"i'm gonna look at really, really small bits of water",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
435,Teacher,"So, yes you're 100% correct So if you need to look at those really small bits of water does that help you discover all of the water on the moon, or just bits and pieces of that water",,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
435,Teacher,Jazmin?,,,,remark,0,0,3
435,Jazmin,Oh yeah Thank you so I I kind of disagree about this microscope part and in my answer it was that necessity to small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,0,0,3

435,Teacher,I want to combine Chris to answer with Luis's answer and kind of marry them together and the Lunar orbiter was a Chris was 100% correct when he said it's there to investigate right,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
435,Teacher,"And what it's investigating is what Luis shared with us from paragraph to sentence to that it's looking for ice deposits in a large polar crater if it's looking for ice deposit, what do you think it's looking for what are ice deposits",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
435,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,0,0,3
435,Oliver,"Well, ice and is the same as water that's like frozen water",,,,response,0,0,3
435,Teacher,So what can the Lunar orbiter help us find,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
435,Oliver,Oh so that helps you find the water or really small water,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
435,Teacher,yeah,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
435,Oliver,"yeah um I just looked at the clock, actually, we have to go to lunch, right now, but I just wanted to say",,,110.1,response,0,0,3
435,Oliver,Before we go Thank you so much for really helping us look at the text and find the words and the parts of the of the story that we're going to help us find our answer that was so helpful,,,,response,0,0,3
435,Teacher,Thank you so much I enjoyed being with you guys today have a great line,,,,remark,0,0,3
435,Teacher,"hi everybody Thank you so much for coming over to the table, we are going to go over and check our journals responses about water on the moon",,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"So I know that first up, we have the first question we answered in our journal, which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"When I say go, you are going to turn to your table partner so right now, we have an odd number of people so Farrah and Oliver you two will be together and then Chris Jazmin and Luis you will make a group of three yes Luis",,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: um excuse me, I should have been desperate I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,3
435,Teacher,Well we're just going over our journal answers to talk and discuss in maybe learn more from our friends who are in our class with us,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,So that is why we're all together at our table so,,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"When I say go we're going to go to our table partners so again, since we have an odd number Farrah and Oliver you two will be together",,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,Chris Jazmin and Luis you guys will be a group of three when I say go you're you are going to have the partner that is closest to the big window in the back,,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,and share their answer first with what they think the answer to number one is then share their evidence and prove why they're right,,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,okay any questions before I say go,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"Alright awesome So when I say go turn and talk to your partner, we have a group of three person closest to the window goes speaks first says their answer evidence go",,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: On okay i'm i'm closest to the window and I said microscope and I think it's because in part three, it says the water is microscopic so that means you can't see it without a microscope",,,,response,1,0,3
435,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: Okay um My answer is that scientists found craters full of water on the moon on and I found my evidence in Part one um it says that scientists found evidence of water in the moon's polar craters,,,,response,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"So, give me a thumbs up if everybody has had a chance to share in their group awesome so let's bring it back in 3210",,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"All right, so can I have someone raised their hand and share what answer that they got for number one",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"so First, I see a Jazmin could you share what your answer was please am the evidence",,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,and where they found the evidence in the tax alright,,,230.2,remark,1,0,3
435,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, my answer is NASA Center small machine and the evidence is the first sentence and paragraph two, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,230.2,response,1,0,3
435,Teacher,So um what makes you think that your answers wrong,,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
435,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: um well since i'm in this group,,,230.1,response,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"Just because we're in a group together doesn't mean that your answers wrong, we always do small groups in order to make sure we deeply understand everything that we're doing in our class so just because you're here doesn't mean that you're",,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,That you're necessarily wrong we're just going and pushing our thinking to think more deeply about what we're reading about does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,right also,,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: makes me feel better,,,,response,1,0,3
435,Teacher,awesome so with some confidence of what did you get for number one and where did you find your evidence,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
435,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, I got NASA sent a small machine and I found my evidence at the beginning of paragraph two",,,120.2,response,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"Okay, so I noticed that you definitely look for those key vocabulary words and",,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,can I have somebody else share their answer please,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"You also made sure that it matched lunar orbit orbiter which has to do with the moon so like I love, how you really use the key vocabulary, to help you find your answer so really great job,",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,Alright Chris your it's your turn what did you get for number one and where did you find your evidence and proof,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
435,Chris,"Agile Teacher Lab: Oh well, so this isn't what I said for number one, but now I realized number one is talking about equipment",,,120.2,response,1,0,3
435,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: And I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"yeah it seems like you have a ton of background knowledge about what equipment that astronauts use, could you tell me specifically because we learned something really cool about water on the moon",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"Could you tell us specifically what piece of equipment, did they use in this reading in order to find that water on the moon,",,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"and you said that you change your answer, could you tell me your first answer then what you changed it to",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
435,Chris,"Agile Teacher Lab: mm hmm okay so well, first, I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon and that's still true, but when I talked to Jazmin and Luis they both were talking about equipment on so since you said Jazmin had the right answer I think it's a lunar orbiter",,,120.2,response,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"Oh, so I should be clear, I didn't say necessarily that Jazmin had the right answer um I liked how she used the important vocabulary in the text to help her find her answer",,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"um but would you still say even if i'm if I said i'm we don't have a correct answer yet, would you still agree with Jazmin or would you",,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,Or would you go with your first answer,,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
435,Chris,"Agile Teacher Lab: um well i'm not sure I think my first answer is right, but um I know it doesn't say equipment, but I don't really know what the equipment is I just listened to Jazmin",,,130.2,response,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"Okay, I really loved how you really listen to your partner during the discussion, and you know you guys are really thinking about hmm who is right, and sometimes it's not easy to you know, have a different answer than someone else",,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"but I love, how you both had different opinions and said your evidence, and went there, yes Oliver",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
435,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: On i'm sorry but it's time for us to go,,,310.1,response,1,0,3
435,Teacher,Oh no so soon,,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,Okay well,,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"We will continue this conversation I think after lunch and then, when we come back from lunch or really going to sit and think about okay what evidence proves the the most correct answer right and then okay we'll talk about that",,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: All right, see on",,,,response,1,0,3
435,Teacher,"All right, bye",,,,remark,1,0,3
435,Teacher,hi it's nice to see you all again and I am excited for us to dig deeper and understanding about water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"so Chris, could you repeat your answer for us, please",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
435,Chris,"Agile Teacher Lab: mm hmm so my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon, but when I talked to Jazmin and Luis they were both talking about equipment so on i'm not really sure what the right equipment is",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"So Chris is a little confused about what actually is the right equipment does anybody have a suggestion for what Chris to do next, Luis?",,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
435,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: um yeah well, I just wanted to say um I think I got this all figured out so I'm good",,,130.2,response,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"So, can you help us move our thinking forward what is something Chris to do to confirm his thinking",,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
435,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay i'm Chris, you need equipment and your answer, so I said oxygen tanks, because that is definitely equipment that scientists use on the moon",,,130.2,response,2,0,3
435,Teacher,Could you tell me where you found that in the text,,,230.2,remark,2,0,3
435,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: um okay well I just know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for this water, I definitely have oxygen tanks",,,230.2,response,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"I mean you're 100% right and using that background knowledge, but when we answer questions, especially questions about a text, we always want to make sure that our answers on have evidence that are found directly from the text so i'm",,,510.1,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"I am actually going to put on a timer for everyone, and when I say go I want everyone to go back into the text and",,,,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,Make sure that their evidence talks about one like Chris was saying a piece of equipment and to it also talks about how it helps scientists find water on the moon,,,,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,does anyone have any questions,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"So when I say go you guys are going to pick up your pencils and work by yourself, look back in the text and really make sure that the evidence you put a circle around really has the specific equipment that is needed to find water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"Alright, so go, I am now looking for the best piece of evidence that matches and talks about equipment to find water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,Give me a thumbs up when you are done,,,,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"Alright perfect so now, when I say go, I want you to turn back to your same groups your same partners",,,,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"And the same person who was by the window closest to the window sorry is going to speak first, and I want you to share with your partner, the exact piece of evidence that you circled in the text, this time around, and if it changed tell your partner, why all right go",,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
435,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay um my answer didn't change, it's still microscope and I circled the word microscope because it is in the third paragraph",,,130.2,response,2,0,3
435,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: i'm okay I um I circled small machine because, like Jazmin said small machine it's a piece of equipment",,,,response,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"hey let's bring it back in 54321 and zero So can I have a friend raise a silent hand and share with the team what evidence, they circled for this time around",,,,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,Farrah,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
435,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: Okay yeah I circled you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"Tell me more, why does that make you think that that is what helps find water on the moon",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
435,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: Well, actually i'm i'm still kind of confused",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"Is anybody else confused um I don't know if you guys can do, and I agree sign, but we that's that's what I do in real life so i'm Oliver",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
435,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: On yeah i'm confused too because, while we both said microscope and there's evidence and the text but there's also the machine and I don't know what the right answer is",,,150.1,response,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"Yes, that's totally fair so on paragraph three i'm looking and everybody else should be looking in their texts that paragraph three, just so we can all look and think critically about this piece of evidence, to see if it matches our question um",,,220.1,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,i'm noticing that the sentences around the microscope word helped me understand exactly what the microscope was used for,,,,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,So let me read them out loud and while i'm reading I want you guys to read silently with me and think about is the microscope actually the machine that helps scientists find water on them get water on the moon,,,,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"Apologies so the water they found and i'm on the second sentence, paragraph three, the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it",,,,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,You do need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so friends in those two sentences what I was looking at the words all around microscope,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"And that helped give us something called context um after looking at that context do is sorry, excuse me, does the microscope actually help get water out of the moon",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
435,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: And, well, it sounds like that helps someone look for the water and look out for water, because you can't see it without the microscope",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"yeah that is that is 100% correct, but can I have somebody read question one out loud for us again",,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,2,0,3
435,Chris,"Agile Teacher Lab: yeah Okay, the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and well, I read that there could be a base on the moon by 24",,,,response,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"Yes, thank you, but we are looking specifically for how were they able to find that water on the moon, and the way that they were able to find that water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"um let's see if paragraph three answers that and i'm looking around, where it says the water they found is microscopic",,,,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,I know when I see the water they found is microscopic they're describing what the water actually looks like,,,,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,"So when they said, meaning, you want to be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd have to use a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely my brain is thinking",,,,remark,2,0,3
435,Teacher,Is that actually telling me how they got they were able to see the water or describing how small the water is,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
435,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: That explanation makes sense, but they're just describing the water um, but I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
435,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: On but before we go, I wanted to say thank you so much, because you really explained what each one of us need to work on and give us a really good ideas for how to think about the text and the question and a new way Thank you so much",,,,response,2,0,3
435,Teacher,Thank you have a great day,,,,remark,2,0,3
436,Teacher,Luis could you point out in the text where you saw that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
436,Luis,"Oh well, actually, well, I was just gonna say I I shouldn't even be in this group, because I already know all about space",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
436,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,"So while we're using space as a context for this actually our classes more about learning how to extract information from readings so it's more of a reading exercise, rather than a space exercise",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,"So if i'm looking right now, the text, if you want to show me where in the text it says that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks that would be helpful for me to understand",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,for answering the question on what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
436,Luis,"um well um okay well um I guess it's um I didn't circle anything in the reading um, but I just know that after scientists are astronauts on the moon, I know they need oxygen tanks 100%",,,120.2,response,0,1,3
436,Teacher,"Okay, and that's correct, do you think the oxygen tanks help them discover water on the moon",,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
436,Luis,"wow they need the tanks to stay alive, while they discover water on the moon",,,210.3,response,0,1,3
436,Teacher,Correct yeah that's great and then do you think that there's other equipment that they probably used in order to discover the actual water,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,Or do you think,,,,remark,0,1,3
436,Luis,yeah probably,,,,response,0,1,3
436,Teacher,Okay um,,,,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,"Someone else, I think",,,,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,"or actually Farrah um, do you agree with Luis that",,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,That oxygen masks were what was used in order to actually discover the water on the moon,,,,remark,0,1,3
436,Farrah,"Well Okay, I think Luis has a good point about how the astronauts probably used to the oxygen tanks, but I think for discovering the water, I found a different tool which is on the microscope, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,3
436,Teacher,"No, no one said, your answers necessarily wrong, but could you point out in the text where you saw that the scientific tool that was used for the water was the microscope",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
436,Farrah,yeah so it's in part three,,,230.2,response,0,1,3
436,Teacher,and specifically what is the sentence say,,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
436,Farrah,"yeah it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.3,response,0,1,3
436,Teacher,Right so,,,,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,Is there a difference between you would need and,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,NASA used the scientific tool called a microscope,,,,remark,0,1,3
436,Farrah,"Well, I guess, I just kind of thought, when they said you would need that it meant the scientists would need a microscope",,,,response,0,1,3
436,Teacher,Okay um,,,,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,So do you think this piece was written for the scientists or for us to read,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
436,Farrah,Oh,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
436,Farrah,"Well, I think, for us right the scientists don't need this",,,,response,0,1,3
436,Teacher,"So then, when it's saying you",,,,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,"That would be referring to us, we would need a microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
436,Farrah,Oh,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
436,Farrah,"whoa okay I I didn't even think of that that's so interesting, so the scientists they didn't need a microscope",,,,response,0,1,3
436,Teacher,So maybe there was another equipment that they used in order to discover the water,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,let's move to,,,,remark,0,1,3

436,Jazmin,And okay so NASA such a small machine and and,,,230.1,response,0,1,3
436,Jazmin,"Let me say, and it says",,,,response,0,1,3
436,Jazmin,them a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,0,1,3
436,Teacher,And what is the Lunar orbiter look for,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
436,Jazmin,"I think Oh, I said I know this Okay, it says it looks for ice deposits",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
436,Teacher,And what is ice,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,how's that is it related to water,,,,remark,0,1,3
436,Jazmin,yeah because I was just frozen water,,,,response,0,1,3

436,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,"Going back to you i'm wondering, do you see Jazmin so Jazmin talked about this lunar orbiter that is looking for frozen water on the moon does that sound like something that maybe",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,The scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
436,Farrah,"yeah cuz, I think, with what you said, with the part Jazmin read it says NASA NASA scientists war machine",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
436,Teacher,Right so perfect Chris,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
436,Chris,yeah well actually Farrah I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like will like oxygen tanks like Luis said but also masks and suits,,,110.1,response,0,1,3
436,Teacher,Right that's very true,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,"Now, does this specific piece of writing does a specific article mention any of the other equipment that we that was used",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3

436,Teacher,Right now,,,,remark,0,1,3
436,Teacher,"Did they use the microscope for discovering the water or is the water so small that if a person had to see it, maybe they would have to use a microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3

436,Teacher,"Hi Everyone, so our question today was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,Luis Can you explain to me how you came to your answer,,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
436,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah well actually I was just gonna say that I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,230.1,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,Well that's wonderful,,,230.2,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"But specifically going to the text, what did you see in the text that led you to your answer",,,,remark,1,1,3
436,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: um well I just I just know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for this water, they are definitely using oxygen tanks",,,,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"Right, and I think it's great that you're bringing your knowledge from all the studies that you've done on space, which is amazing",,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,But i'm concerned that we're not looking and finding the proof from the text and we're using outside knowledge,,,,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"Which maybe your classmates might not have so if we could redirect yourself to the text, I suggest rereading it and picking out the exact line where it says what equipment scientists or NASA us to discover water",,,430.2,remark,1,1,3
436,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: Okay um I guess I should read it yeah okay,,,430.2,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,And while you reread that Luis out i'll move on to Jazmin ,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,Jazmin What in the text drove you to your answer,,,230.2,remark,1,1,3
436,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: OK, so my answer is NASA sent a small machine and I found that at the beginning of like paragraph 2",,,230.2,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"what i'm concerned with is that you've left it at small machine, I suggest kind of maybe going on",,,,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"Perfect so I love, how you identified that like NASA sends a small machine and I think you're on the right track,",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,To the second part of this sentence and to identify what specifically was the small machine that they used,,,430.2,remark,1,1,3
436,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, it says it's called a lunar orbiter",,,430.2,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"Yes, exactly",,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"Now, Farrah, yes?",,,,remark,1,1,3
436,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: Can I go next because I I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,Right so Farrah where in the text did you find the microscope?,,,230.2,remark,1,1,3
436,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: On part three,,,230.2,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,Part Three okay,,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
436,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: Ya there's a sentence It says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's where I found it",,,110.4,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"Right, and I think it's great that you're identifying that as non scientists, we would need a microscope in order to see that water right",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"But what my concern is is that the text doesn't necessarily say the scientists at NASA used a microscope right, and so what I suggest you to do is go back and reread it to see what NASA and the scientists specifically used in order to investigate and find water",,,430.3,remark,1,1,3
436,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: Okay,,,430.3,response,1,1,3
436,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: I can try that,,,,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"And Chris, do you want to, in the meantime, while Farrah and Luis reread the text, do you want to Talk about how you came up with scientists finding creators of water on the moon?",,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
436,Chris,"Agile Teacher Lab: yeah yeah so um there's this part okay it's near the beginning, paragraph one, it says um well, let me find it Okay, it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters",,,230.1,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,Right no and that's a great,,,,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,that's a great sentence to point out because that's the whole point of our question right is,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
436,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah exactly it's all about the water,,,310.1,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"yeah but, but something that i'm concerned about is that this answer doesn't answer the question which the question is looking for the equipment right",,,,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"What was the equipment that they use to find the water, so this answers the question the fact where they found the water, not what they use to find the water, so I just suggest kind of going back into the text, and looking at what equipment was used to find the water",,,430.1,remark,1,1,3
436,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah well I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,430.1,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,yeah and I think that's great I think bringing your own first hand experience is wonderful and that's exactly what you should be doing,,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"I think in this exercise, we want to stick to the text",,,,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"Because some other classmates might not have that context right, and so this exercise is specifically what this article, says the scientists use",,,430.2,remark,1,1,3
436,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: So it has to be in the story,,,430.2,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,yeah my suggestion is that we just use evidence from this story,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
436,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: Oh okay yeah I understand,,,420.2,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,Luis have you found were in the story you want us to focus on,,,230.2,remark,1,1,3
436,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, so um I found these two there's two pieces of equipment that they name in the story and one is lunar orbiter and the other as Mike ruskell um so I guess i'd probably say those two things",,,230.2,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"Okay sure so for the microscope part, so I think the Lunar orbiter is is correct, because it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and the sentence before that talks about the craters that have the water in it right",,,,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,And then the sentence after it says this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"Now ice, what is ice I guess",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
436,Luis, Um water,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
436,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: Oh,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,ya?,,,,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher, now in the microscope part this is kind of what Farrah and Oliver were pointing out,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"Yes, perfect so ice is water",,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
436,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: um well I just I realized it's time for us to go now, but thank you for taking the time to work with us",,,230.3,response,1,1,3
436,Teacher,"Sure, no, thank you for having me",,,,remark,1,1,3
436,Teacher,Luis so you're explaining about the two pieces of equipment that you saw,,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher,And I had a question,,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher," If you could, if you were able to hear, what I had suggested to Farrah earlier",,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: um yeah I think I got this all figured out so i'm good,,,,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,Perfect So what have you figured out,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
436,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: um the answer is the Lunar orbiter,,,230.1,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,Would you be able to describe why it's not a microscope,,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
436,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: um, no",,,210.3,response,2,1,3
436,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: I don't know I just figured it was lunar orbiter from listening to the conversation,,,,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,OK Can someone else explain why the microscope was not an equipment that the scientists and NASA use,,,130.2,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: And Okay, I can try, so the Lunar orbiter it says in the story they use it to investigate",,,,response,2,1,3
436,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: But the microscope it just says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope so I don't think that means that the astronauts actually used one on the moon",,,,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,Does that make sense to everyone,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
436,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: um I have a question,,,150.1,response,2,1,3
436,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: Yes, so my question is if there's no microscope on the moon how, how can you discover something if you can't see it if it's too small to see don't you need a microscope",,,,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,"Right so humans as humans might need a microscope right To see it, but they used a machine so machines don't always need a microscope",,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher,They can identify molecules,,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher," without having to see it, because you know machines can't physically see anything",,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher,Farrah does that make sense?,,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher,"But they can identify it without a microscope the machine can, but we cannot as humans",,,210.1,remark,2,1,3
436,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: Um i'm still kind of confused,,,,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,So what is confusing to you about that,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
436,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: So there's no people it's just the machine,,,230.1,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,"yeah, so there are astronauts but they send out this machine called the small machine called the Lunar orbiter which kind of looks through these",,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher,These craters that they talk about these polar craters and it does analyses right in order to see it kind of samples the ground to see if there's any molecules but the machine itself doesn't need a microscope,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
436,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: that's really cool I I wish the story said that,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,yeah well um I guess it's implied here that the Lunar orbiter has some sort of technology that is able to investigate and identify water through the ice deposits,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher,"Yes, Oliver?",,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: that's so cool um yeah so I, I understand that, now that makes a lot of sense what you said about the Lunar orbiter how we can just do it without a microscope so they don't really need a separate microscope but um I don't know how I would have figured that out, on my own",,,,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,"Okay, which is very fair",,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher,"So um going back to the text and the question, so the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon, right, now, who are the scientists working with?",,,210.1,remark,2,1,3
436,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: Um NASA,,,210.1,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,"and they so we're looking for something with NASA right or scientists right, where it says scientists use or NASA used or sent or deployed or something where it says that the scientists are NASA right",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher,yeah perfect that's great so the scientists are working with NASA,,,210.1,remark,2,1,3
436,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: haha OK OK that's like the part Jazmin read that says scientists sent a small machine,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,Right exactly,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
436,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: Oh so is anybody using a microscope,,,110.1,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,"Well, probably as humans, it says in the text right",,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher," You wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, so you and me, would not be able to see it, you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to really look closely",,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher,Right that's what the text says,,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher,So we would need a microscope,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
436,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: that's really cool and I would love to go to the moon and look at the water and a microscope and I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,that's very cool that's very interesting,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher,"now my question for you all, is how did your thinking change about the text and about the question that we've discussed",,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher,yeah Luis,,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: um OK, so my thinking changed because, well my first answer um didn't come from the story and I guess I hadn't read it very closely and then, when I read it  um closer, I found equipment that was actually in the story",,,,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher,Great,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
436,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: On my thinking it changed because first,,,,response,2,1,3
436,Chris,"Agile Teacher Lab: I didn't know it had to be about equipment, but then",,,,response,2,1,3
436,Chris,"Agile Teacher Lab: When you pointed out, for me to look again I realized, I had to talk about equipment",,,,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,And Farrah,,,,remark,2,1,3
436,Teacher,Great,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
436,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: On okay my thinking changed because I thought it was the microscope but then,,,,response,2,1,3
436,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: When you explained how it works, and when you said I had to look for what the scientists used that's how we can know lunar orbiter is the right answer",,,,response,2,1,3
436,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: And I I looked at the clock, just now, and we have to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for helping each one of us understand what we could do to help make our answer even better",,,,response,2,1,3
436,Teacher,"Of course, and enjoy your lunch see you soon",,,,remark,2,1,3
437,Farrah,"Hello hello, how are you today",,,,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,"i'm good, how are you?",,,,remark,0,0,3

437,Chris,"I can, I can I",,,150.1,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,yeah Chris OK,,,,remark,0,0,3
437,Chris,"So the article is about how NASA and the scientists they used to think the moon was a desert, it was totally dry, but now they know that there's water on the moon, and they found it in these craters full of water",,,,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,Oh that's a great answer Chris,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
437,Teacher,What else do you remember from the article,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
437,Farrah,Oh,,,150.1,response,0,0,3
437,Farrah,"Right remember yeah that the water it's it's ice it's frozen water and it's really, really small pieces so small, you need a microscope",,,,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,"Oh, and what is a microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
437,Farrah,"It it's a tool, a piece of equipment and that's why I picked it for my answer, because it said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,What are some other things you could think of that you might use a microscope for,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
437,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,0,0,3
437,Oliver,"up well, you could use it to look at like bacterial and cells and other tiny teeny things",,,,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,Oh that's a great answer Oliver,,,110.4,remark,0,0,3
437,Teacher,Has anyone seen a microscope before,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
437,Oliver,Oh yeah we use them in science class in the lab,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,And what do you use them for in science class,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
437,Oliver,"Obviously, one time we took a dirt sample outside and then we analyzed it and we looked at under the microscope and we could see so much more than we couldn't we just looked at it with our eyes",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,"Oh, what kind of stuff did you see",,,140.1,remark,0,0,3
437,Oliver,"Oh, all sorts of things lots of teeny tiny little brains and everything was so much smaller than I thought it was",,,140.1,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,"wow that's awesome and what kind of things, do you think you'd see if you looked at some dirt from the moon, or the water, the frozen water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
437,Farrah,well,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
437,Farrah,I think,,,,response,0,0,3
437,Farrah,"yeah i'm i'm not really sure what you'd see but i'm a little confused because we're talking so much about the microscope but I thought we were here, because our answers are wrong and and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,I just wanted to hear more about what you thought and to see if we can take your answers and to sort of expand them a little more,,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
437,Teacher,"Well, your answers aren't wrong,",,,110.2,remark,0,0,3

437,Teacher,"And I know you know, and I just need you to help me to understand",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
437,Teacher,"So, going back to the article, and now that we know about the microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
437,Teacher,What can you tell me about the machine that NASA sent to the moon? The lunar orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
437,Teacher,oh Jazmin?,,,,remark,0,0,3
437,Jazmin,"Yes, this was my answer, I said NASA sent a small machine",,,,response,0,0,3
437,Jazmin,They used to look for the ice deposits in the craters,,,,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,"Oh great, and can you tell me more about the ice craters because you have to like I don't know anything about the ice crater so I need you to explain it to me oh",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
437,Jazmin,"Okay, let me look at the reading Okay, well, it says that they're really deep and they're really dark",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,But how would you describe an ice crater if,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
437,Teacher,I know they're deep their dark they have ice in them,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
437,Teacher, What do you think they look like?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
437,Teacher,but are they like the grand Canyon like deep holes in the ground,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
437,Chris,Well isn't a crater like a hole but above ground kind of,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,"yeah so it's a, it is a hole off the ground, it's kind of elevated",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
437,Chris,yeah cuz I went to NASA actually I went to NASA and and when I was there I saw I saw all sorts of equipment that scientists to use like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,Oh that's awesome,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
437,Teacher,Since you went there and did it make you want to join NASA and go to the moon,,,140.1,remark,0,0,3

437,Jazmin, it just it's just really makes me wonder like will there ever be a life there one day,,,,response,0,0,3
437,Jazmin,"I think that's really interesting because here on earth we, we need to really focus on saving our planet and our oceans and the water and to think that the moon is even dryer",,,,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,"Oh yeah that's interesting, how do you think you could work that into your answer",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
437,Jazmin,"let's see I could say NASA sent a small machine and it found water but it's really, really small frozen water nothing like the oceans on earth",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
437,Teacher,"Right and how do you think you could you were just talking about life on the moon, and maybe how we need to do more on earth to protect our planet, do you think you could work that into your answer",,,140.1,remark,0,0,3

437,Luis,i'm good but I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,"Oh, what do you know about space",,,140.1,remark,1,0,3
437,Luis,"Okay, I know that astronauts use space suits so that they don't like freeze to death in space, and I know that there's no gravity up there, so if they're walking around they have to wear like gravity boots so that they can walk on the moon, and a bunch of other stuff too",,,140.1,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,"Okay, well, it sounds like you know a lot about space, but you can stick around in this group, just to help everyone else learn what you know",,,110.3,remark,1,0,3

437,Teacher,that's a great answer um,,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
437,Teacher,What else did you learn about the moon from the article,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
437,Chris,Oh,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
437,Chris,let's see um,,,,response,1,0,3
437,Chris,That they need a microscope to look at the water um that it can only fill like a couple of cups or something like that,,,,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,And what is a microscope,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
437,Chris,is a tool that we use in science class to look at like teeny tiny things,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,And why do you think the people would be looking for water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
437,Chris,Oh,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
437,Chris,"Maybe cause, you know we're gonna have to live on the moon, maybe in the future, or something if we if we destroy this planet",,,,response,1,0,3
437,Jazmin,"Yeah because we're definitely destroying this planet, but I don't think we can live on the moon",,,,response,1,0,3
437,Jazmin,"Because of the atmosphere, but they're trying to see if we can live on Mars",,,,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,Jazmin could you tell me a little bit about the atmosphere,,,140.1,remark,1,0,3
437,Jazmin,"um okay I don't know exactly, but I think that the moon doesn't have like an atmosphere that you know, like",,,140.1,response,1,0,3
437,Jazmin,"That we could that protects us or anything you know, like how we have the ozone layer here that protects us from the sun, well we did until like people are totally destroying it um but that's another story for another day",,,,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,sounds pretty dark,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
437,Jazmin,yeah,,,110.1,response,1,0,3
437,Jazmin,yeah I really am,,,,response,1,0,3
437,Jazmin,"i'm an environmentalist, and so I think that",,,,response,1,0,3
437,Jazmin,everybody's just kind of destroying our planet,,,,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,So how do you think you could tie that into what you read in the article,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
437,Jazmin,I guess that we're looking for water on the moon um,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
437,Jazmin,So that we can,,,,response,1,0,3
437,Jazmin,"Well, I don't know why, but I feel like I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,What was your answer,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
437,Jazmin,That NASA sent a small machine,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,"So NASA sent a small machine, why did they send the machine?",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
437,Jazmin,To look for the water on the moon,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,yeah so maybe just add that to response and then do you think you could also talk about what you were just telling me about being an environmentalist and,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
437,Teacher,What you think the future is going to look like? Why we might need to go to the moon?,,,,remark,1,0,3
437,Jazmin,So I just have to add in,,,,response,1,0,3
437,Jazmin,"To look for water on the moon, and then I can add some sentences about about being an environmentalist okay",,,,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,"All right, and Farrah how about you, what was your answer?",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
437,Farrah,Oh,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
437,Farrah,"yeah I didn't know what my answer was wrong either, I said that scientists, uh no- you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,"Okay, well, do you think you could tell me what the microscope does?",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
437,Teacher,And how it relates to finding water,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
437,Teacher,on the moon?,,,,remark,1,0,3
437,Farrah,"Oh Okay, they use the microscope to look at the water really closely um and how it relates to finding the water um",,,,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,Like Why were they using a microscope to look at the water? What were they were hoping to find?,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
437,Farrah,"Okay, it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at so they needed the scientific tool, called the microscope because the water was microscopic",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,"Right, do you think you could add that to your answer",,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
437,Farrah,Oh yeah that's all I gotta do is just add more sentences? yeah I can I can write down that second part of the sentence in there,,,420.2,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,"And Oliver how about you, what was your answer?",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
437,Chris,Oh,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
437,Chris,"Excuse me teacher, I was just thinking about the equipment, because um",,,,response,1,0,3
437,Chris,"Farrah said the microscope and then Jazmin said, the small machine and I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment, like all oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,So what was your answer the question,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
437,Chris,um that they found craters for water on the moon,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,"yeah So how do you, do you think you could describe some of the equipment they use to get to the moon?",,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
437,Chris,Oh,,,420.2,response,1,0,3
437,Chris,yeah yeah I think I forgot to put I forgot to put that part in there about the equipment,,,,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,"I think you could also talk about your own experience, going to NASA",,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
437,Teacher,Since you have some,,,,remark,1,0,3
437,Chris,I can put that in my answer too?,,,,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,1,0,3
437,Chris,"Oh, I didn't know that, because our last teacher told me that I was writing too much background knowledge, because it wasn't connected to the the question in the text",,,,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,"Well, if you can try and find a way to connect it to what you read in the text, so you have this experience with NASA and learning about the equipment",,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
437,Teacher,"And the article involves the equipment going to the moon, to find water, so you can maybe start with your own experience and not that much just enough to let us know you know about this and then going deeper and talking about the article",,,,remark,1,0,3
437,Teacher,You think you could do that?,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
437,Chris,yeah yeah yeah that's sounds exciting oh yeah i'll add that right now,,,150.1,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,And Oliver,,,,remark,1,0,3
437,Oliver,"yeah i'm sorry teacher, but I was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go so we'll have to see you next time okay",,,,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,"All right, bye everyone",,,,remark,1,0,3
437,Oliver,Bye,,,,response,1,0,3
437,Teacher,Hello everyone,,,,remark,2,0,3
437,Luis,"hi uh teacher, I think I figured it all out now so i'm all good",,,,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,"Okay, what did you figure out",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
437,Luis,"Okay, I heard you telling Jazmin and Chris and Farrah that they can add some of their background knowledge into their answer so i'm just going to do that, and so I think I can go back to my desk",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,What background knowledge do you want to add to your answer? Did you read your answer?,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
437,Luis,"yeah well, I said that scientists use oxygen tanks",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,"Well, can you tell me what they use the oxygen tanks for and how it connects to the rest of the article?",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,Because it's about trying to find water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
437,Luis,"yeah well, I mean they use oxygen tanks to breathe, and so they can't look for water on the moon if they can't breathe up there",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,"Could you tell me a little more about how they're going about looking for water on the moon, and why they're looking for water on the moon?",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher, So um you've established that they need these oxygen tanks to breathe so that they can look for water on the moon,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,Yeah that's true very good point,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
437,Luis,Ah,,,230.1,response,2,0,3
437,Luis,"OK so maybe I didn't like read read the article, you know, so I don't really know",,,,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,"Okay, do you think you could go back and reread the article and then complete your answer?",,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
437,Luis,"yeah yeah Okay, I guess, I can do that",,,120.3,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,"Okay, all right, how did everyone else do with their answers, could you",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,tell me what your new -what your answers say now?,,,,remark,2,0,3
437,Chris,"Oh yeah okay so for mine, I said I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment, including oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,2,0,3
437,Chris,"But they used a small machine and a microscope to look at the water on the moon, because it was microscopic",,,,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher, I like you added all that in there and accessed your background knowledge um,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,Alright that's great,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,"So, now that we you've described what the equipment looks like do you think you could tell me a little bit more about why they were a gathering all this equipment and going to the moon, to look for water in the first place?",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
437,Chris,Oh,,,420.2,response,2,0,3
437,Chris,I don't know if the story told us why they were doing that,,,,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,"Ok, well why do you think they were going there to look for water?",,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
437,Chris,"um I don't know because, at first, I thought it was so that they could like we could live on the moon um but that wouldn't make sense I did I did read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024",,,210.4,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,yeah so maybe you could include that,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,"That maybe they are looking for a way to live on the moon, and having water on the moon would make it easier to survive there",,,,remark,2,0,3
437,Jazmin,"I don't think that we can live on the moon, I don't think that that wouldn't make sense",,,,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,Why wouldn't it make sense?,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
437,Jazmin,"Because like I said about the atmosphere like there isn't an atmosphere around the moon, so we can't like there's nothing that would protect us, we will die",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,"Well what's something that you could bring with you to the moon, so that you might not die?",,,140.1,remark,2,0,3
437,Jazmin,You mean like spacesuits?,,,140.1,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,yeah maybe include that,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,If you had a space suit and you were on a moon base,,,,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,How do you think you would do if you were on the moon?,,,140.1,remark,2,0,3
437,Jazmin,"um well, I mean, I guess, I wouldn't die, but I wouldn't want to like you know, like live in a space suit, like all the time, that would be like really uncomfortable",,,140.1,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,"Oh, Farrah?",,,,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,2,0,3
437,Farrah,yeah i'm still confused,,,,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,"Okay, what are you confused about?",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
437,Farrah,Well okay,,,230.1,response,2,0,3
437,Farrah,"So Chris said that in his answer, it was the small machine and the microscope but I thought that the microscope was the right answer",,,,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,"So were there other things, that the astronauts used to look for water, other than the microscope?",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,To study the water?,,,,remark,2,0,3
437,Farrah,"I have, I had the small machine as my answer, and that one I think was right too",,,,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,Ok so you both said the small machine,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
437,Farrah,"Which one is right, then the microscope or Jazmin's?",,,230.3,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,"they're both right, you need both things",,,110.2,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,Because you need the small machine to find the water and then you need the microscope to study the water,,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
437,Farrah,Oh OK OK,,,130.3,response,2,0,3
437,Farrah,"So, then, I should, I have to put both of them in my answer?",,,,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,Ok,,,,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,"And Oliver, how's your answer doing?",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
437,Oliver,um well i've just been kind of listening to what everybody else was saying um so I haven't changed mine yet um,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
437,Oliver,um,,,,response,2,0,3
437,Oliver,"I guess I don't have as much background knowledge as the rest of them, because you know I don't really like read books about space and stuff like I fly on airplanes but I don't like",,,,response,2,0,3
437,Oliver,"Like read about the moon, or like the environment or anything um so",,,,response,2,0,3
437,Oliver,So yeah I guess um,,,,response,2,0,3
437,Oliver,Uh huh,,,,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,"Well you don't need to necessarily have background knowledge about space, so you read the article",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,Yeah So could you tell me your answer again?,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
437,Oliver,um yeah well I had circled the same thing as Farrah,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
437,Oliver," I circled that last sentence in paragraph three, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,yeah and what do you need to use to find the water and before you study it with the microscope?,,,210.4,remark,2,0,3
437,Oliver,The small machine that Jazmin said,,,210.4,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,yeah so you can include that and then maybe also talk about why why we would need to look for water on the moon,,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,Why we might need to live on the moon,,,,remark,2,0,3
437,Oliver,"Okay, so add in the name, add in the part that Jazmin said, add in why we're looking for water and what was the last thing you said?",,,,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,So why we're looking for water and,,,,remark,2,0,3
437,Teacher,I think there are only those,,,,remark,2,0,3
437,Jazmin,"Maybe living on the moon, is that one of the ones?",,,,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,yeah oh yes you're right why why we need to live on the moon,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
437,Oliver,"Oh, oh OK OK um oh well it's actually it's time for us to go to lunch so i'll have to finish my answer after lunch",,,110.1,response,2,0,3
437,Oliver,"yeah thanks teacher, I am thinking though like I do, I appreciate like how you, you took the time to kind of explain how we can make our ideas, a little bit better, so I at least know what I need to work on next time I come back to class",,,,response,2,0,3
437,Teacher,i'll see you next time,,,,remark,2,0,3
437,Oliver,"Okay, bye",,,,response,2,0,3
438,Teacher,"Hi class, so I just got through looking over your responses and I just wanted to probe a little bit deeper so Farrah look at yours again",,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"You i'm sorry, yes, oh give me one second yes Luis",,,,remark,0,0,4
438,Luis,um yeah um I shouldn't be and this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"Yes, actually i'm in i'm glad that you said that Luis because, looking at your response when you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right um I think that that is a great observation I was wondering where you saw that in the text",,,230.2,remark,0,0,4
438,Luis,um,,,230.2,response,0,0,4
438,Luis,Okay,,,,response,0,0,4
438,Luis,"um well it wasn't really a story, but I just know that if there are scientists like astronauts on the moon I know they have oxygen tanks",,,,response,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"Absolutely, and that I think that that would isn't, I mean everyone else might agree as well that that's an amazing inference right, you can think about",,,110.3,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"Being an astronaut and you're, of course, they have to have oxygen tanks, so in this question or in this particular case, we want to try to use evidence from the text right so that's why I want to do I want you to take a second Luis",,,420.3,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"and go and look back and see if you can find something in the text that relates to how they find the water, because I do agree with you, the oxygen is important right, we need that",,,,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"But we want to also find out how they find the water and circle, something that would let you know that okay",,,420.3,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"That was, and thank you again because I did want to talk about that Luis",,,230.2,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher," Farrah yours, was also really interesting because you talked about the microscope, can you tell me a little bit more about what you found that in the text",,,230.2,remark,0,0,4
438,Farrah,"Oh yeah Okay, well, I found it in part three, where it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,230.2,response,0,0,4
438,Teacher,mm hmm absolutely,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher," So how do we, have you ever used the microscope before",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
438,Farrah,yeah yeah we have them on in our science classroom,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
438,Teacher," So if you thinking about a microscope from where you are right now using that do you think you would be able to see something on the moon like that far away, just like the water on the moon that far away",,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"Yes, I think they're really cool",,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
438,Farrah,From earth no way,,,210.3,response,0,0,4
438,Teacher,Right that's what i'm thinking like maybe maybe not,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher, So what do you think help the scientists,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"And I don't want you to answer it now, I want you to take a second to look through the text again, but what do you think help the scientists be able to see it",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"And with the microscope like I know, for example, when you go into your science class",,,,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher," So what do you think I want you to dig a little bit deeper into the text, what do you think help them to get to the point where they could use the microscope",,,420.3,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"When you have the microscope there you're like okay Now I know exactly what i'm looking at right so, but we have to get to the moon",,,420.3,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,OK,,,,remark,0,0,4
438,Farrah,OK i'll look,,,,response,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"Okay, and Oliver you had something, you have a similar idea as Farrah so, can you tell me what also what brought you to that same conclusion",,,230.1,remark,0,0,4
438,Oliver,"yeah so well, I was thinking on how could you discover something if you can't see it, you need to see it to discover",,,230.1,response,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"Absolutely, that you know what",,,,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"That you're on the right path right, and so I want you to do the same thing as Farrah just looked at that text because again",,,120.3,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"How can you how do you get to the point where you can use the microscope right, because if you're just carrying around a microscope looking for all these small things you're gonna be looking for a long time, so we have to look at the text",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,And then bring it in some right so again same direction as Farrah looking at text and see if you can find out how they were able to get it down narrowed the space down small enough to use the microscope Jazmin,,,420.3,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher, yes ma'am I see your hand,,,420.3,remark,0,0,4
438,Jazmin,So I had a different answer and answer as NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,420.3,response,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"Okay yeah and I want to be, I want to be absolutely clear right",,,,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,The goal is to pro right so similar to my um NASA with the microscope when they have the microscope It means that they're looking at something very specific right,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"you're not in this group, because your answers are necessarily wrong right",,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"But there's a situation there's something that they have to do, prior to that to where it's very broad, so your answer was was",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,you're getting closer,,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,But I want you to just like everyone else,,,,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"I was saying that everyone else, I want you to dig a little bit deeper right right now we're in space we're looking for our water, so how can you be more specific in your answer when you say NASA sent a small machine how",,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"I will, I want you to think about is how can your answer be more specific and what could you find in the text again evidence from that text that's going to give you an opportunity to be even more specific",,,420.3,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,0,0,4
438,Jazmin,i'm gonna try right now I should look again,,,,response,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"and Chris, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon go ahead yeah go ahead i'm listening",,,230.3,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"You can look at, yes I would love for you to look again just take a second there's no pressure",,,120.1,remark,0,0,4
438,Chris,"yeah well so since we're talking about equipment on I wanted to say, I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks, but also um masks and suits",,,230.3,response,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"Yes, absolutely, and so I and that's why i'm so excited to have all of you in this group, because all of you bring such a great",,,110.3,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,Like minds that you bring like i'm you touched on what Luis said about the mask I mean it was said about the oxygen tanks all those things are so important,,,110.3,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,But what I really want you to focus on right now is what's important for the water right because it's true we we like I said when Luis we need those oxygen tanks right if we need to breathe,,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,But we also want to focus,,,,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,so I would kind of pair you a little bit more with Jazmin saying you're on the right track,,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"On that water right, we want to figure out what tools or what equipment, do we use",,,120.2,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"But we want to figure out, we want to be as specific as possible, for example, when you go into your math class right and you say we use a lot of tools for math Okay, but you when you're trying to calculate you don't pull out your ruler right",,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"You want to think about the tool, the most effective for that particular situation so when we're trying to find the water right so look, I want you to take a second to look through the text again as well, and just see if you can find something",,,120.1,remark,0,0,4
438,Chris,"Okay yeah yeah that math example that really make sense, all look again",,,120.1,response,0,0,4
438,Teacher,Farrah and Oliver how's it going as far as you're looking through the text,,,120.4,remark,0,0,4
438,Farrah,"Okay, so um i'm beginning to think that maybe instead of the microscope it's it's the machine i'm that Jazmin was talking about",,,120.4,response,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"Jazmin um How does that sound to you, what do you think",,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
438,Jazmin,"um yeah and then you told me to to add more specific stuff to my answer, so I found a little more, and I would add that the machine is called a lunar orbiter and they use it to investigate",,,130.2,response,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"awesome and Oliver and I know that you and Farrah were working together Oh yes, I see your hand go ahead",,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
438,Oliver,um yeah,,,110.1,response,0,0,4
438,Oliver,"I just looked at the clock and, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch right now um but I know i'm going to do, because this was really, really fun um",,,,response,0,0,4
438,Oliver,"I wanted to say thank you so much for really encouraging us to probe deeper into the text and find more specifics for our answer that was really helpful and also you just made it really fun, so thank you so much",,,,response,0,0,4
438,Teacher,"thank all of you, and I hope you enjoy lunch and have a great rest of your day",,,,remark,0,0,4
439,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,"Good afternoon, everybody i'm Teacher it's very good to see you, thank you for meeting with me I just reviewed your answers to where",,,,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,What equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,"hold on one second even and I noticed that everybody has to work on one specific thing, and that is visualizing the text to make sure that you understand it",,,420.3,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,"Before we begin, I have a question, do you speak Spanish",,,140.1,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,Luis do you speak Spanish,,,140.1,remark,0,,
439,Luis,Well i'm a little bit I can try,,,140.1,response,0,,
439,Teacher,Okay Jazmin do you speak Spanish,,,140.1,remark,0,,
439,Jazmin,"Yes, I do",,,140.1,response,0,,
439,Teacher,Great Jazmin can you teach us the Spanish word for moon,,,140.1,remark,0,,
439,Jazmin,and Spanish word for me is Luna,,,140.1,response,0,,
439,Teacher,"yeah exactly and so today you read a text about the Lunar orbiter and, if you look inside the word lunar where do you see",,,210.4,remark,0,,
439,Luis,So yeah it's got all the Lunar thing in it um but I shouldn't even be in this group I know all about space,,,210.4,response,0,,
439,Teacher,"that's great well, thank you for hanging out with us anyway so we're going to rely on your expertise to help us even thanks so much",,,110.3,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,"cool great so we see the word Luna or moon Thank you Jazmin inside of lunar I also want to think about the word polar craters what word, do you see inside of the word polar",,,210.4,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,"Chris, I see your hand everybody take a look what word, do you see inside of the word polar",,,120.2,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,Great Oliver,,,,remark,0,,
439,Oliver,"And OK, I see the word pole",,,,response,0,,
439,Teacher,"Okay, and when you hear the word pole what does that make you think of Oliver",,,210.4,remark,0,,
439,Oliver,i'm like the North Pole,,,210.4,response,0,,
439,Teacher,"uh huh and so, if we're looking at polar craters on the moon, where are they going to be located",,,210.4,remark,0,,
439,Oliver,Like on the top and the bottom,,,210.4,response,0,,
439,Teacher,"Exactly, so what I want everybody to do now is take a look at the text and we are going to read the first paragraph again together",,,120.3,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,The moon is a desert scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's color craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines,,,120.3,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,"So what I like to do when i'm reading a scientific text is create a visual of what's going on, so I know that I have the moon, and have just told us that the moon has going to have a North Pole and a South pole",,,420.3,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,"So I draw that out, and I draw my craters and then I look at the paragraph again, what is this paragraph, telling us",,,420.3,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,Everybody should look at your paragraph,,,120.3,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,"What is it telling us Chris, I appreciate you so much that your hand shoots up right away",,,210.4,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,Farrah  go for it,,,120.4,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,and then Chris you're going to build,,,130.2,remark,0,,
439,Farrah,"Okay, so this paragraph, it tells us",,,130.2,response,0,,
439,Farrah,"Well, I guess, we learned that the loon has Poles and that that's where the water is in the craters",,,,response,0,,
439,Teacher,"Okay Chris, can you build",,,130.2,remark,0,,
439,Chris,"Oh well, the craters they're dark",,,130.2,response,0,,
439,Teacher,"Okay, and what is inside of the creators Chris",,,210.4,remark,0,,
439,Chris,And the water,,,210.4,response,0,,
439,Teacher,Good now let's look at the second paragraph together NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small,,,120.3,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,What are we learning from this paragraph,,,210.4,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,And I say,,,,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,Go ahead Jazmin,,,,remark,0,,
439,Jazmin,"So this is this is where I found my answer actually to the question we learned that NASA sent a small machine, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,,
439,Teacher,"Okay, so I want you to look back in the paragraph it's not that your answer is wrong it's that it lacks some detail so, what can you add to your answer when you look at that paragraph again",,,430.2,remark,0,,
439,Jazmin,"Okay, well, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,430.2,response,0,,
439,Teacher,"Great so, can you tell me more about what the Lunar orbiter must look like and what it's doing",,,210.4,remark,0,,
439,Jazmin,"Well, I don't really know what it looks like but it sounds like it, it can find that ice in the craters",,,210.4,response,0,,
439,Teacher,Great let's go back to our visualization,,,420.3,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,So who is sending the Lunar orbiter when you look at paragraph two,,,210.4,remark,0,,
439,Chris,Think it's NASA and oh actually I went to NASA and so I know that scientists who they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,210.4,response,0,,
439,Teacher,I mean,,,,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,"NASA as the United States Space Agency, and so in this paragraph Chris you're right and I like that you have that background information, but I want you to look back into paragraph two",,,110.3,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,What is NASA specifically sending in paragraph to,,,210.4,remark,0,,
439,Chris,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,,
439,Teacher,To do what Chris,,,210.4,remark,0,,
439,Chris,"oh well, I think Jazmin said it goes in the craters and finds the the water",,,210.4,response,0,,
439,Teacher,"Good so i'm going to add that, to my visualization I know NASA which Chris knows so much about",,,210.4,remark,0,,
439,Chris,"That I got a shirt with that picture on it, and everything",,,210.4,response,0,,
439,Teacher,amazing and an orbiter which i'm imagining looks something like a rocket into one of the polar craters will find water good let's look at paragraph three together,,,210.4,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,"That means the moon, is still dryer and it's a very fun for",,,120.3,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,The water they found is microscopic hold on i'm going to pause there the water they found who found that water,,,210.4,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,Oliver I appreciate the hand up everybody look back at your paragraph who found that water,,,120.2,remark,0,,
439,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,0,,
439,Luis,So,,,,response,0,,
439,Luis,"I think NASA because that's who's doing this, but also, I just I just looked at our clock and we, we have to go to lunch right now",,,,response,0,,
439,Luis,"But I just wanted to say this was so cool like the drawing you made that really helped me sort of see that text in my mind, and I think, since I love space so much next time I read about space i'm going to do that same thing and draw myself a picture to help me understand it",,,,response,0,,
439,Teacher,"Beautiful Thank you, you bet well, I hope you all have a great lunch",,,,remark,0,,
440,Teacher, Thank you all for sharing,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher, Why don't we start with Oliver and Farrah,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher, Do you have a question for me?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,"Alright, so I heard some great ideas from the class",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher," So I saw some - actually before we get there, Luis you have a hand up",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
440,Luis,yeah well actually I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
440,Teacher, So it's awesome that you already have some background knowledge in this topic,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher, Right now we're just focusing on text based evidence,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,Thank you for the enthusiasm Luis about space,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,Right now we're trying to figure out exactly what piece of equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,"So right now, if everyone has their texts in front of them",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher," Can I get a thumbs up or a yes, if you have your text still in front of you?",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher, Where in the text did you find that scientists need a microscope to look closely at water? Can either Oliver or Farrah read that sentence for us?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher, I saw you guys had some consensus,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,Seeing nods,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher, So why don't we start with Oliver and Farrah,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher," Thank you, thank you",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Farrah,"Yes, I can do that",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
440,Teacher,Thank you Farrah,,,,remark,0,1,3
440,Farrah,"It was in part three, where we found it, it says the water they found us microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it and then it says, our answer you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,1,3
440,Teacher,"awesome Thank you Farrah for reading that out loud, for us, so the question is saying what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,"In the sentence Farrah read, are the scientists, what are they using the microscope for?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,"So, if anyone has thoughts feel free to throw your hand up",,,,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher," Oliver I see you have a hand up, what are you thinking?",,,,remark,0,1,3
440,Oliver,"yeah well since I was thinking the same thing as Farrah, they're using the microscope to be able to see the tiny pieces of ice",,,,response,0,1,3
440,Teacher,Thank you Oliver for sharing your thought process,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher," Do other students in the class agree, disagree, want to push back? Feel free to throw your hand up if you want to share thoughts on what we just heard",,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,Jazmin I see you have a hand up,,,,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher, What are you thinking?,,,,remark,0,1,3
440,Jazmin,So,,,,response,0,1,3
440,Jazmin,"i'm sorry you two, but I disagree, because my answer was NASA sent a small machine",,,,response,0,1,3
440,Jazmin,And I don't understand why that answer is wrong,,,,response,0,1,3
440,Teacher,Can you tell us where in the text Jazmin you found this information?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Jazmin,Let me see the first sentence in Part two,,,230.2,response,0,1,3
440,Teacher,"Okay, and can you read that out loud, for us, please",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
440,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,120.3,response,0,1,3
440,Teacher,Thank you Jazmin for reading from the text,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher, So now we have two ideas on the table: that it was a microscope or this small machine,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher, Um someone can identify what is the name of this small machine? Luis you have a hand up,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher, What is the small machine called? let's give it a name,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
440,Luis,lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
440,Teacher, So now we have microscope and lunar orbiter,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,"Thank you Luis and we got that straight from the text where Jazmin just read, for us",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher, Jazmin was really nice and that she respectfully disagree disagree dwith Farrah and Oliver,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,Jazmin do you want to explain a little more about why you disagree before we hear from other people,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
440,Jazmin,"Okay, well, so the one I picked the",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
440,Jazmin,"lunar lunar orbiter it it had the word investigate it said they use the Lunar orbiter to investigate and investigate is kind of like find, so I thought they had to use the Lunar orbiter to find the water and it says it's in the craters",,,,response,0,1,3
440,Teacher, Do you agree with Jazmin that we can also use the word find or discover for investigate?,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher," Let's see Chris, I haven't heard from you today",,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,Thank you Jazmin for sharing your thought processes,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Chris,Oh yeah oh those words mean pretty much the same thing,,,130.2,response,0,1,3
440,Teacher, Anyone disagree or want to push back on that? Or we all agree that these two words can be used as synonyms?,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,Thank you Chris,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
440,Chris,So can I add something too about equipment?,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
440,Chris,yeah well so actually I went to NASA so I know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,1,3
440,Teacher," So these are tools, people can use",,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher, I wish I could have experienced that,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,"Wow, thank you Chris for sharing that incredible experience",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,So Chris brought up a great point what equipment means,,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,Keep in mind the evidence for this question should come from the text,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher," Our items, did anyone see oxygen tank mentioned anywhere in the text? If you see it feel free to raise your hand if you want to share where that was found",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher, I'm seeing a shake head from Oliver,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,0,1,3
440,Luis,"I don't think that's in here, Chris",,,,response,0,1,3
440,Teacher,Soo it sounds like the two pieces of equipments we heard were microscopes and the lunar orbiter,,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,"So maybe it's not in the text, but it was a brilliant comment, they do use oxygen tanks",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher, But right now we're focusing on what we found in the text,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher," After talking about the word investigate discover and look closely, what do we think the final answer is? what equipment did scientists use? so for this one i'm going to call on Farrah",,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,"Keep in mind the question is, what did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
440,Farrah,"OK, so the stuff about investigate that makes sense",,,120.2,response,0,1,3
440,Farrah,"I can see why the Lunar orbiter is finding because they use the word investigate, but I guess what I was kind of thinking before is, how can they find it if they can't see it yet?",,,,response,0,1,3
440,Teacher,awesome comment from Farrah,,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher," So the question i'm hearing is we kind of agree, yes, that this thing was used to investigate it, but we still need the microscope to look closely at it",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher," But they did need the microscope to look closely at it, but for that first discovery, what did they need?",,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,So Farrah excellent analysis,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
440,Farrah,The orbiter,,,210.3,response,0,1,3
440,Teacher,"So does anyone have questions or want to disagree with that statement? Oliver, you have a hand up what are you thinking?",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
440,Oliver,"Well, actually I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
440,Oliver,"And i'm kind of bummed because this was really fun, but I wanted to say before we go",,,,response,0,1,3
440,Oliver,"Thank you so much for really helping us understand what all the different words in the text, and in the question, what they mean because that really helped me figure out what the best answer was Thank you so much",,,,response,0,1,3
440,Teacher," Hope everyone has a wonderful lunch, and thank you so much Farrah Oliver Chris Jazmin and Luis for your participation in today's class",,,,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher, enjoy your lunch,,,,remark,0,1,3
440,Teacher,Thank you Oliver for keeping track of the clock,,,,remark,0,1,3
442,Teacher,hi everyone,,,,remark,0,0,2
442,Farrah,Oh hi Hello,,,,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher,"So it's really nice to have you all in a small group together, I know you just read your passage on water on the moon",,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher, oh yes Luis,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
442,Luis,um yeah,,,150.1,response,0,0,2
442,Luis,I I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher,"um I think it's good to talk about this what we read together, so we can help us help each other understand it more",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher, Maybe you can share that with us,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher, So it's great that you know a lot about space,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
442,Luis,um yeah I can do that sure,,,110.3,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher,"So um the question, for the first one is",,,,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,let's see,,,,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,How,,,,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,How sorry,,,,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,What equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,Does anybody have any thoughts?,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,Yes Farrah,,,,remark,0,0,2
442,Farrah,"Oh yeah Okay, so I said",,,,response,0,0,2
442,Farrah,That you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher, And what made you think that from the passage?,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,Mm-hmm,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
442,Farrah,"Okay, well, so in part",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
442,Farrah,"In part three, it says that the water they found is microscopic and so you need the microscope if you were going to look at it and see it",,,,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher," But before, before you look at the water closely, how did NASA say that they found they could find the water on the moon?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,Mm-hmm,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,"Can you think of, can you think of a place in the passage where they talked about going to find the location of the water?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
442,Farrah,"Oh well, so I guess what i'm thinking is how could you find it if if you can't see",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher, Yes Jazmin,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,"Right, so I think they needed to find it by exploring different parts of the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
442,Jazmin,"Well, I I had a different answer and maybe will help Farrah so I said that NASA sent a small machine and so and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher,"it's not wrong, maybe let's look at that part together, can you tell us where you saw that in the passage?",,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
442,Jazmin,"Yes, definitely",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
442,Jazmin, I found it in Part two,,,230.2,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher,"mm hmm so let me read that part, the first part, or part two together so NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher, This lunar orbiter will land on the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,So I think we can be a little bit more specific about that small machine,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,Did anyone catch what it was called?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
442,Luis,"Um yeah I got it it said, well, I mean you just read it, it says lunar orbiter that's the name",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher,mm hmm so they use this lunar orbiter to try to investigate and to explore the moon's South pole,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,Does that makes sense?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
442,Oliver, I think I would still pick the microscope,,,150.1,response,0,0,2
442,Oliver, I said the microscope um and so i'm still a little unsure why it's the Lunar orbiter that's the right answer and how I would how I would have picked that on my own,,,150.1,response,0,0,2
442,Oliver,i'm still a little confused cuz I said the same as Farrah,,,150.1,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher,mm hmm so the miscroscope is the equipment that we might have had more experience with,,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher," You might have seen it or heard of it, so I can see why you would have picked it out from the passage",,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,Does that help clarify?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher," So that's why it said NASA sent that machine to try to find evidence of water, through the ice craters",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,"But I think, looking at the passage as a whole, we need to look at what, how they even could get that water sample",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
442,Oliver,Yeah so it's like first they get and find the tiny water with the orbiter and then they look at it with a microscope?,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher,right they looked at it with the microscope to look closely and learn more about it,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
442,Oliver,"Oh, okay",,,,response,0,0,2
442,Chris,"Yeah I wanted to say so, actually, I went to NASA and I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher, That's a that's a great connection that you made with the reading,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,yeah wow thanks for sharing that,,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
442,Chris,"yeah it was an amazing trip, we got to see so many different things there",,,110.3,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher,Mm-hmm,,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher, So how about we move on to the second question,,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?,,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
442,Jazmin,"and wait I just so with with my answer about the machine, why what- I still don't get why I was wrong",,,120.2,response,0,0,2
442,Jazmin, I said NASA sent a small machine,,,120.2,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher,"Yes, oh, you did say that yeah so they did send a small machine but there's a lot of different small machines that could have been sent so that's why we want to be specific, when we're answering these questions",,,430.2,remark,0,0,2
442,Jazmin,Oh so and all I had to do was just say the name of it?,,,430.2,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher," But it was a great start, good job Jazmin",,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,Um it would be helpful to elaborate and add more details to your response,,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
442,Jazmin,Oh,,,420.2,response,0,0,2
442,Jazmin,"Okay, great that's helpful for next time, thank you",,,,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher,yeah no problem,,,,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,"Yes, Chris",,,,remark,0,0,2
442,Chris,"So well I just I looked at the clock and actually we, we have to go to lunch now, but I wanted to say before before we go",,,,response,0,0,2
442,Chris,"That we really appreciate how you took the time to really explain the difference between finding the water and looking at the water, because it makes so much more sense, how to find the right answer when you explain that, so thank you so much",,,,response,0,0,2
442,Teacher, Bye,,,,remark,0,0,2
442,Teacher,"you're welcome, thank you for spending time in the small group together, I really enjoyed our discussion Have a nice time at lunch",,,,remark,0,0,2
443,Teacher,"hi Farrah and Jen and Chris and Jazmin he said i'm excited to talk to you today, we were talking about earlier with discovering water on the moon so Chris Oh yes, even What would you like to say",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
443,Luis,"i'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"Oh, that is awesome Luis i'm so glad you are so interested in space, could you help maybe me, and some of your classmates learn a little about how we discover water on the moon, do you know how we do",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
443,Luis,"um yeah Okay, well, we we sent a machine into space and we needed all sorts of equipment and we needed oxygen tanks and we needed a microscope all we needed all sorts of things and they they sent the rocket and it smashed into the moon, and they found little pieces of ice",,,110.3,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"so let's listen why don't you jump in Chris is the would you say the moon is dry, or is the moon wet, what do you think",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,whoa whoa that sounds really exciting that definitely sounds exciting but definitely some you had some great things about there,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
443,Chris,"Well, my answer, my answer is a scientist they found craters full of water on the moon so there's definitely water there",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,Oh okay yeah so you're right you're so right about the craters there's definitely some craters,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"That are there and you're right that they have now very tiny particles of water, they have not found just lots of water in the moon, the moon is one of the driest places in the world",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,Oliver have you been to a really dry place could you tell us about that?,,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
443,Oliver,"yeah yeah my family, we went up on a trip, we went to the grand Canyon and it was really hot there and really sandy on the sand at would blow around and got in your eyes, it was so hot and the sun was beating down, and it was just dry and sand everywhere that you looked",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"Yes, I love that you brought the grand Canyon because that's honestly how I picture the moon, sometimes, because the moon, is very dry dry place but, just like the grand Canyon",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"doesn't mean that there's no water right, so we see on the moon, that there are microscopic water, if you don't use I use a thermometer",,,,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,yeah Farrah what would you like to add?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
443,Farrah,Well i'm i'm a little confused because I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope in order to look really closely for my answer and I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,120.4,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"Oh okay i'm happy to help you out there, so you are right in that you are definitely have to really get really small to figure out that this water because, like we were saying earlier there's not a whole lot of water on the moon",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"When we go there  we dig deep and find kind of the soil and everything to get to that ice, so we can't just use a microscope that had to be some other things for us to be able to get to that place",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,does that help,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
443,Farrah,Oh okay,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
443,Farrah,"Yes, so they need something else first and then they look at that, through the microscope",,,,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"Yes, you're right right, so we just have to have some extra they can't just like you know, maybe you guys have used microscopes in your class before",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"But yeah they had to really, really dig deep to find any particles that they can even look at it, so I love it you like expanded that an understatement That was good",,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
443,Farrah,"That makes sense, thank you",,,310.1,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"you're welcome welcome Oliver we haven't heard from you, I see um",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
443,Oliver,"Well, I was talking about the grand Canyon I was talking about remember",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"Yes, you're so right sorry about that deb Jazmin you're the one I just love to hear from you um, what do you think",,,,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"If you were to go to the moon Jazmin What would you do to try to water there, what would you do Jazmin?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
443,Jazmin,"I would use the small machine that NASA sent, and I would use it to get the samples that you need to find the water",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"Also, yes, you are so right can anybody help right what is that machine call that NASA",,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
443,Luis, ,,,130.2,response,0,1,3
443,Luis,"Oh, we know this, I know this",,,130.2,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,Okay Luis,,,,remark,0,1,3
443,Luis,I got it,,,,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,Luis what was that,,,,remark,0,1,3
443,Luis,yeah it's the Lunar orbiter Jazmin it's right there in the article like right,,,,response,0,1,3
443,Luis,Under your nose it's called the lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"Well, Luis I love that you jumped in thanks for that answer, but again, we don't want to be rude understanding our classmates",,,,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"Here, because sometimes other people know more about other things than us, we want to make sure that we all hear each other out there Jazmin had a great answer and you just expanded on it, so we all get to work together here, which is awesome",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,Chris  what do you have to add?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
443,Chris,I went to NASA and I know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,120.4,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"You are so right Chris yeah so in Houston here we have NASA too, and it is really cool really there",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"and so, with the oxygen tanks let's go why would they need oxygen tanks on the moonso let's go back to Farrah what they need oxygen tanks on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
443,Farrah,"Well, they needed it to breathe",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"Yes, you're right you're right they needed to breathe right because they don't have Like the oxygen like we breathe in the air, they don't have that on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"So that's why they need lots of equipment there, so we talked about, let's go through our list here, so we talked about",,,,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,That they need the Lunar orbiter right and at some point they're going to be the microscope to me I love that you mentioned that and then you guys brought up also that they're going to need some oxygen tanks,,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,Is there anything else they'd need to find that water,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
443,Teacher,Luis what you got to add,,,,remark,0,1,3
443,Luis,"While you, you said they had to dig down really deep, so I don't know if the Lunar orbiter does that or something else does that, but they would need something to get under the soil and find the little teeny tiny, tiny teeny tiny teeny ice",,,,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"Perfect Yes, you are so right they would absolutely need something to do with that so yeah the Lunar orbiter might do that as well, so we're going to take some different places, and I think that would go with it as well help help them dig down yeah, Oliver what do you think",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
443,Oliver,"um yeah i'm so sorry um I just looked up a clock and we actually we have to put a lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand how",,,110.2,response,0,1,3
443,Oliver,"Each one of our answers fit into the process of discovering water on the moon, like, I have a really good picture of all the different steps that they need, and how each equipment works and that was really helpful, so thank you so much",,,,response,0,1,3
443,Teacher,"you're so welcome I really enjoyed my time with you all, and I hope we get to learn more together soon, thank you",,,,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"Alright, students, so we just talked a little bit about the type of machinery they use to discover the water on the moon, and I think we need to- yes Luis",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
444,Luis,"um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
444,Luis, I already know all about space,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
444,Teacher,Okay Luis so we'll definitely be able to use some of your expertise in this conversation,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher, Okay?,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,so you'll be able to use your background knowledge to really help us understand,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,And we also want to just make sure we're really using the text that we have in front of us to support our evidence,,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
444,Luis,yeah okay,,,410.2,response,0,1,3
444,Teacher, Who could give me a quick summary of the text? two to three sentences,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,Alright cool so let's think a little bit more about what we read,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,A Chris,,,,remark,0,1,3
444,Chris,"Okay, well, so to summarize the story, the scientists they found these craters full of water on the moon",,,,response,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"Okay, can you tell me how they found it",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
444,Chris,"Um okay um well, I guess, they had to use some some equipment um like um",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
444,Chris,I think a microscope maybe it said,,,,response,0,1,3
444,Teacher, Great job Chris getting us started with that retell of the passage,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"Alright, so I want us to take a pause",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,I think we just need to take a moment to look back at what we read,,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"So when I say go, you have one minute to review your three little paragraphs and then we'll come back together to talk okay go ahead",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"Alright, about 30 seconds left",,,,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher," Now that we've had a chance to look back at our passage, let's review our question again",,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"All right, come back together team",,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher," Okay? What was the type, what was the name of the machine that supported the scientists in finding the water on the moon?",,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,0,1,3
444,Farrah,"Well um I don't know if you'd call it a machine really but um I I found the same thing that Chris um what he kind of just said, I think it said, you'd need a microscope to look really closely so i'm I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,3
444,Teacher,Okay perfect so let's look closely at that sentence,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher, Farrah where do you see in the story that says it was a microscope? where exactly in the story?,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
444,Farrah,"Okay, so that's in part three, the last part it says the water they found is microscopic and it says, you need a microscope to see it",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
444,Teacher,huh yes so Farrah I just want to shout you out for one second because you were able to zero right in on that sentence,,,,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher," But let's look at it again, it said, the water we found was microscopic",,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,Where you got that answer so she did a really good job of using the text,,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher, Okay?,,,410.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"That means that it was really really small, that you would need a microscope to see it",,,410.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher," It doesn't really tell us, that specific line, what the tool was called that discovered the water",,,410.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher, Did anybody find a different part of the story that gives us information about the tool?,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,So I just want to zero back in on a different part of the story,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"Jazmin, what do you think?",,,,remark,0,1,3
444,Jazmin,"Okay well in part two, they they actually talked about a small machine",,,,response,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"Can you tell us where exactly, that is, you can read the sentence for us",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
444,Jazmin,"Okay, the first sentence in Part Two says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"Okay So here we have two different sentences that we're looking at right? Jazmin is telling us that it's in paragraph two, the Lunar orbiter",,,,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"Farrah is telling us that in paragraph three, there's a microscopic material that you would need a microscope to see",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"I want everybody to think, and then you're going to get a chance to vote: is it a microscope that found the water on the moon, or is it the Lunar orbiter that found the water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,If you think it's the Lunar orbiter raise your hand,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher, if you think it is the microscope raise your hand,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"OK, I see two hands two hands awesome okay you can put your hands down",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,Okay okay put your hand down,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher," So Chris, what are you thinking?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
444,Chris,Well i'm i'm thinking that so actually I went to NASA so I know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,120.4,response,0,1,3
444,Teacher," Could you explain to the group, one of you, why you think that is what it was called?",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"Okay, so remember we want to back up a little bit, we want to ground our answer in the text that we're reading",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,I heard Jazmin I saw Jazmin and Luis raise their hand for the lunar orbiter,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,Go ahead Luis,,,,remark,0,1,3
444,Luis,"Okay yeah, so I think it's the Lunar orbiter because the Lunar orbiter I think it's kind of like this robot",,,,response,0,1,3
444,Luis,And it kind of does everything and then,,,,response,0,1,3
444,Luis,"There isn't like a microscope on the moon, because um microscope it's like a really small, and you can't just walk around the whole moon with a microscope and look at all of it to find the water",,,,response,0,1,3
444,Luis, First you need the robot to tell you where the water is,,,,response,0,1,3
444,Teacher,Mmm good,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,and Jazmin can you just point us back to that sentence that you read in the story and read that for us again,,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Jazmin,"Yes, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,120.3,response,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"awesome so let's come back together right? Luis shared with us his amazing background knowledge, he knows a lot about space and astronauts and when they go up to space",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher, Jazmin pointed us to the exact sentence in the story that told us what the machine was called,,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,He shared that they use these tools and the Lunar orbiter is one of the tools that they use,,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher," Okay, so I want to circle back to Farrah Farrah",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher,Do you now see what the name of that tool was called?,,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Farrah,"yeah yeah This makes this makes a lot more sense now, it makes sense that the the machine the Lunar orbiter they had to use that to to find the water discover it like it says in the question on that makes a lot more sense",,,210.3,response,0,1,3
444,Teacher,mm hmm so let's just think about as a team like What did we do together what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called? Oliver,,,530.1,remark,0,1,3
444,Oliver,"Okay, so what we did is we, we reread, we reread the text and we found both both pieces of equipment, but then we found out what each one does that's different and which one was that best to answer for the question",,,530.1,response,0,1,3
444,Teacher,"Yes, absolutely so sometimes you do have to weigh the actions and figure out what is the best evidence which one really lets me know the answer to this question and helps me understand this text",,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher, Okay?,,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
444,Oliver,"i'm so sorry to interrupt, but I just looked at the clock on and we actually we have to go to lunch now, but I wanted to say thank you so much for really helping us look at the text and understand it and reminding us how to use the text to find the best answer",,,420.3,response,0,1,3
444,Oliver, That was really helpful,,,420.3,response,0,1,3
444,Teacher,Oh no problem,,,,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher, You all were really great students and did a lot of great work in the small time so good job,,,,remark,0,1,3
444,Teacher," what, yes Luis",,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"Alright, good afternoon students, I was just reading over your responses and what I noticed is that you all are doing a really great job answering the question, especially using some of the background knowledge that you know about space and about the moon",,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
444,Luis,yeah um I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,110.3,response,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"Oh that's actually really good that you know a lot about space, but one thing that I was going to say is that i'm noticing that some of our responses are not really pinpointing and answering the question that was asked of us",,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,so let's take a moment to just revisit the question that they asked,,,,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher, everybody just take a look at number one,,,,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"Who would like to share one of theirs, the response that they gave to that question",,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,Go ahead Farrah,,,,remark,1,1,3
444,Farrah,"Okay, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,1,1,3
444,Teacher,awesome so that was a great idea of trying to think about what types of tools scientists use,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher, scientists definitely use microscopes,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher, That was a good connection,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"So what i'm noticing in Farrah's answer and some of our other answers, is that we aren't using the actual text to answer the question of what tool was used to find the water On the moon",,,430.2,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"Okay, so what I want everyone to do now, I want you to revisit the text and find the place in the story that tells us the type of tool that was used to find water on the moon",,,120.1,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,Go ahead,,,,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"Okay, was anyone able to identify the name of the tool that was used to find water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"Oliver, What did you come up with",,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Oliver,"um well, so I said the same thing as Farrah about the microscope um because that's a scientific tool and they talked about in the story",,,120.4,response,1,1,3
444,Farrah,yeah I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,1,1,3
444,Teacher,So Oliver can you read the question again that we're working to answer,,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
444,Oliver,Mhmm yeah,,,120.3,response,1,1,3
444,Oliver,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,response,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"Okay, and Farrah you said it was a microscope can you find a place in the text that tells us it was a microscope that found the water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Farrah,"yeah okay um at the very end, part three, um the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
444,Farrah, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"Okay, so i'm noticing Farrah that you are looking to, you're giving us like the definition of the water that they are finding is really, really small, and that is absolutely right",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"that particular tool, though, is not what found that microscopic water, okay?",,,410.3,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,Is there another place in the story or the text that we found that talks about a scientific tool,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,1,1,3
444,Jazmin,In part two it talks about a small machine and that was my answer,,,,response,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"Okay Jazmin I see you located a specific piece of the text, that was a good a good move,",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,do you see the name of that tool there in the text,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
444,Jazmin,I think it was in there um let me look,,,210.3,response,1,1,3
444,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,1,1,3
444,Teacher, go ahead,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"Okay, so Jazmin just pointed us to a different part of the text that we can investigate",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher, I want everyone to go back to Part two of the text and this time you're reading those first two sentences to see if that is the name of the tool that found the water,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"Okay, so what what did we find out after rereading that portion that Jazmin pointed us to",,,,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,Do we find the name of the tool that found the water on the moon,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"Chris, what do you think",,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Chris,"Well, so um so in there, it talks about that lunar orbiter but I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,120.4,response,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"did you locate the machine that found the water on the moon, the name of that machine, Chris",,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"That is absolutely right and in this question, we are looking for the machine that found the water on the moon,",,,210.1,remark,1,1,3
444,Chris,well I guess it's a lunar orbiter um,,,120.2,response,1,1,3
444,Chris,"Because that's what Jazmin said, and it was in part two",,,,response,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"Okay, Oliver, what do you think",,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Oliver, don't you need a microscope,,,120.4,response,1,1,3
444,Oliver,"yeah well um it's sort of sounding like lunar orbiter's the right answer um, but I still think there's evidence about the microscope um how can you find something if it's too small to see",,,120.4,response,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"That is actually true you do need something that can see really small things on the moon, or any other thing you're working with with your science",,,,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"one thing we want to pinpoint, though, is figuring out what's the difference between the types of tools they're talking about",,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"so one of the tools, like you guys you found is the Lunar orbiter",,,,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher," and then it also talks about, later in the text, the microscope",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"and as Jazmin pointed out, it said they sent the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it landed on the moon and found some ice deposits, where the water was, right",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,So let's think,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher, was the Lunar orbiter the machine that found the water or was it a microscope that found the water,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,1,1,3
444,Luis,"um I think I think it was the Lunar orbiter that found the water um, I think, because they says it's The thing that um looked in the craters and like found it in the first place",,,,response,1,1,3
444,Luis, I don't know how it works like maybe it's some kind of robot but I think it can do it all by itself,,,,response,1,1,3
444,Teacher,hmm um what are you thinking Farrah,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
444,Farrah,"um, well Okay, so it sounds like the Lunar orbiter can find really small things",,,110.1,response,1,1,3
444,Farrah,And then maybe they just look at it with the microscope after they find it,,,,response,1,1,3
444,Teacher, Oliver,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher, so it's just letting us know that it was a small amount that they found,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,and it's and it is saying that the water that they found was really small,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Teacher,"Okay, so you're absolutely right, it does look like it's a lunar orbiter",,,110.4,remark,1,1,3
444,Oliver,yeah i'm so sorry but it's time for us to know,,,110.4,response,1,1,3
444,Teacher,Okay well great job locating the evidence in the in the text and really thinking about your responses today,,,,remark,1,1,3
445,Teacher,Good morning classroom,,,,remark,0,1,2
445,Chris,Oh hi good morning,,,,response,0,1,2
445,Teacher,how's everyone doing today,,,,remark,0,1,2
445,Chris,Oh we're great we're really excited to work with you today,,,,response,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"i'm so excited to work with you, yes, you can you have your hand up",,,,remark,0,1,2
445,Luis,"that'd be yeah so um I shouldn't be and, as a group, I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,2
445,Teacher,Um Luis,,,,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"that's great and I love that you already know a lot about space, but what I think is",,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"it's fun why don't you help your peers, and you can share the information that you know about space, so that we can learn better and it can be a good opportunity for you to teach them what you already know",,,,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,matter,,,,remark,0,1,2
445,Luis,Great yeah that sounds awesome,,,,response,0,1,2
445,Teacher,love the um does anyone else have any questions before we dive into the discussion prompt that you'll have given me answers for Jazmin house and the Farrah are you good,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
445,Farrah,yeah I think we're ready to go,,,150.1,response,0,1,2
445,Teacher,love it,,,,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"um so did all if you read the other three passages, but for the moon, is a desert",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"Yes, okay lovely so our",,,,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,Farrah can you read the question for me,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
445,Farrah,"yeah Okay, so it says what equipment did scientists use to discover",,,120.3,response,0,1,2
445,Farrah,Water on the moon,,,,response,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"so before we dive into the question I want to ask one of you, what is your understanding of the word equipment, what do you think it means give me an example of equipment from maybe your daily lights",,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"Anyone yeah Yes, they go ahead",,,,remark,0,1,2
445,Oliver,"Okay, so um it as like a tool, or something you use to do something i'm so like in math class, sometimes we use a calculator so that would be a equipment",,,,response,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"Very good amazing OK, so now that we have a fair idea of what equipment means let's try to read let's try to figure out the answer this question in context um so before that that me",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"Farrah, can you tell me do you want to read out your answer, maybe we can all decide as a group, we can come up with what the best answer is um so in your answer you thought this equipment was a microscope so Can you help me think why you did that answer what led you to thinking that",,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
445,Farrah,"yeah so okay in part three, it says that will basically it says the water is really small it's they said might grow Scott peck and so you can't see it if you don't have a microscope so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"Okay, very good, and this was a tricky one because micro of microscope also has some US so one could think of it as an equipment, so I completely understand why you may have been confused and if",,,310.1,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,I read that you have the same answer Farrah What was your reasoning was it the same did you have the same reason,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
445,Oliver,I was pretty much the same what caused the question asked what equipment they used to discover the water and I don't think you can discover something if you can't even see it so that's why I was saying to you need the microscope,,,230.1,response,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"now let's try to learn some appeals and see maybe what someone else said, and we can come to the closest answer so Jazmin, can you tell us what your answers and why did you pick that answer",,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"makes sense, I completely understand why you could think that",,,310.1,remark,0,1,2
445,Jazmin,"Okay, I said NASA send a small machine and I picked it from part two, because it says they use the machine to investigate and I thought that sounded kind of close to the question",,,310.1,response,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"Okay amazing our event, so you don't you know a lot about science and space so Can you help me understand why did you pick the arms you did, and what do you think of your peers on so so far",,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
445,Luis,"um yeah so I mean their interests are pretty good, but I was thinking that you'd need an oxygen tank because if there are astronauts and scientists on the moon, they cannot sign anything without oxygen tanks",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"Chris, let me just get back to you quickly",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"lovely and that that makes complete sense, of course, like if we send people to the moon, how will they be able to do that",,,310.1,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"So Luis said, I understand that let's let's go back and read the text just see where can we find this evidence in the text Chris, do you want to add to something before we move up yeah go ahead",,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
445,Chris,"yeah yeah cuz it kind of goes with what Luis said because I went to NASA actually, and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and also masks and suits",,,120.3,response,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"but now Farrah can you give it another try, can you read, can we can you read, part two of the decks",,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"Yes, and these are amazing tools and requirements that they have to be wearing before they go there",,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"For me, loud and maybe you can explain to us again what led you to choosing your answer",,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"And then, as a group, we can have a discussion to find out what we can vote, you can vote amongst each other, what do you think the correct answer is, and, as a group, you can decide, and let me know",,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"Okay, you can get to drive so don't feel don't don't be afraid go ahead yeah Farrah would you like to just read the text for us again",,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"and let's listen keeping the question in mind, the question is what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,Go ahead Farrah,,,,remark,0,1,2
445,Farrah,Okay,,,,response,0,1,2
445,Farrah,NASA Center some more machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small,,,,response,0,1,2
445,Teacher,lovely so can someone tell me what is is made up off,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,Do you know,,,,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"Yes, go ahead",,,,remark,0,1,2
445,Oliver,yeah i'm ice it's the same as water um and I I just I looked at the clock,,,,response,0,1,2
445,Oliver,"And i'm so sorry cuz I really wanted to get to the vote, and all that stuff, but we have to go to lunch right now um, I just wanted to say thank you so much, because you really",,,,response,0,1,2
445,Oliver,"understood why we set our answers and you made us feel like our thinking it really matter and that made this so much easier like we weren't afraid to say, the wrong thing or something like that, so thank you so much",,,,response,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"Of course, the and always remember class is a safe space for all your to learn from each other and that's the point of education it's not about having the right answers it's about learning from mistakes",,,,remark,0,1,2
445,Teacher,"And how can you learn from your mistakes, if you don't get any so just keep it up, have a lot of fun remember you have my you have access to my email address you can email me with any questions you have, and you can meet me at my office hours go have fun have fun at lunch",,,,remark,0,1,2
446,Teacher,Hello Farrah def Chris Jazmin Luis so good to see you how's everybody doing,,,,remark,0,0,2
446,All,we're good we're really excited to work with you today,,,,,0,0,2
446,Teacher,We to what's up Luis,,,,remark,0,0,2
446,Luis,"i'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"That is so awesome that you are telling me how knowledgeable you are now how motivated, you are in terms of subjects, so I can't really I can't wait to hear your response, and in fact I already heard you",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"and you guys are already provide the evidence you guys already circle, the evidence and the text that we can use for the answer the questions so Luis why don't I just start off with you",,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"answering this question, or what equipment is scientists use to discover what water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
446,Luis,Sure sounds great,,,310.1,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"All right, do you have the answer in front of you would you like to share with the whole class",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
446,Luis,yeah so I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,120.4,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,Beautiful do you have a text in front of you as well,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
446,Luis,yeah yeah it's right here,,,150.1,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,awesome now my question to be where'd you get the answer from did you get the evidence to support that did you get a text evidence,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
446,Luis,i'm so um I mean I already,,,230.2,response,0,0,2
446,Luis," if there are scientists on the Moon, they need oxygen tanks",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
446,Luis, know some stuff and,,,230.2,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"Oh, I see, so you are making a prediction there right and you're making connections that is excellent job Luis However, my question here is particularly asking you to find a text evidence from the reading that I gave you so",,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
446,Teacher,I do not see the any paragraph the relative that related to the oxygen tanks so even though that's really reasonable for addiction I don't see that answer here,,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"So how about why don't why don't we carefully look at the number of paragraph two, can you can can Jazmin use that paragraph two, can you read it out loud for us",,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
446,Jazmin,go right ahead,,,120.3,response,0,0,2
446,Jazmin,So NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar greater,,,,response,0,0,2
446,Jazmin,"These ice deposits are very small and so that's where my answer came from actually I said NASA Center small machine, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"You did you're so close, you told me what the machine is and basically you actually circle, the evidence correctly and you gave me the answer, however, you didn't tell me the name of the machine",,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"All the actually says very clear in the second paragraph, can you so if you circle back to the paragraph to as as NASA sent the small machine and what is that called Jazmin",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
446,Jazmin,lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,yeah so that will be the answer,,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
446,Jazmin,Oh so just have to add the name in there too,,,130.3,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"yeah and you found the text evidence as well, you did an excellent job, all right, you did you did either disappear job excellent",,,310.1,remark,0,0,2
446,Jazmin,Thank you,,,310.1,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"awesome are why don't we move on to Chris Chris, would you like to read out loud your answer",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
446,Chris,And you know okay so up I said scientists found critters full of water on the moon,,,120.4,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"Good and that was the outcome right, we now know that they found water and we now know the water actually exist in the moon, which is really fascinating",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"Now you actually gave me the results of it, but the question was what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon alright so so",,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"The question was what equipment, the sciences using not is there and water, the moon, so, so I think next time Chris what you can do you can actually circle, the question statements",,,430.1,remark,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"Or you could actually underlined, a question statements, so that you know what the author is looking for what the question is actually looking for from you all right",,,,remark,0,0,2
446,Chris,yeah well about equipment um so I actually I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"Absolutely I love that you're making connections and that's so fascinating that you've been there and never been to another place, though",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"It is so fascinating i've only been to like I guess i've never been to it, I only been watching YouTube videos about it so Chris Thank you so much for sharing your experience",,,,remark,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"And also that actually ties into Luis's experience Luis knows all about it he's very interested in that's how he made the connection with oxygen tank is that right, even",,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
446,Chris,Oh yeah exactly um I like to watch a YouTube videos,,,230.3,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"Right is really excellent tool all right um Oliveron thank def, thank you for waiting patiently, would you like to go with your answer, do you mind sharing your answer with the whole class",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
446,Oliver,yeah I can share so,,,120.4,response,0,0,2
446,Oliver,same thing so and that is the microscope I think that answer is actually the microscope,,,,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,hard to find an answer from,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
446,Oliver,"um Okay, so it actually talks about a microscope and part three, and because it says on water is really small, so you would need a microscope to look at it really closely",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"yeah yeah and, since you and Farrah you guys are agreeing each other, can I have Farrah read the third paragraph",,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
446,Teacher,yeah or you can chime in,,,,remark,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"All right, go right ahead Farrah",,,,remark,0,0,2
446,Farrah,"That means the moon, is still dryer and the driest desert on earth, the water they found is micro scapa meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it and here's the part I circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"awesome great great great so um is Farrah said, is that the reason why you chose the same answer",,,230.1,remark,0,0,2
446,Farrah,"yeah yeah I found it there, too, because you can't find something if you can't see it, you need the microscope",,,230.1,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,Exactly awesome the reason why the answer is not a microscope because they actually water that they found they actually use the machine to find actually find a machine they use a lunar orbiter,,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"To find water there but they are invest, they are they actually analyzing investigating water",,,,remark,0,0,2
446,Teacher,"microscope Okay, so I do lot love the Oliveron and Farrah you guys are making the connections with microscope because Yes, you are correct because, in order to look at it closely, you need it, you that's the scientific tool that you need go ahead Oliveron",,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
446,Oliver,"um yeah so actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much, I feel like you gave each one of us a strategy to help make our answer better on, and that was really helpful, thank you",,,110.2,response,0,0,2
446,Teacher,Thank you so much for your excellent doozy as to class today I can't wait to see you guys next time and i'll see you guys later have a great lunch,,,,remark,0,0,2

446,Teacher,Good morning Farrah def Chris Jazmin Luis so good to see you,,,,remark,1,0,2
446,Luis,"hi i'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,Oh that's incredible I mean it really shows from your response that you really enjoyed a science and to begin with,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"So yes, would you like to share with your response to begin with",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
446,Luis,yeah,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,go right ahead,,,,remark,1,0,2
446,Luis,"Okay um I don't remember Okay, let me look at my paper, I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks yeah",,,,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"awesome well, I really enjoyed your response Luis because it really displays the most outstanding aspect of background knowledge and",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"I love the how you identify the word equipment, because that was actually the question you were asking so you're halfway there",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"But let's find the paragraph and tech the scientists like sentence and where it corresponds, because the answer was not oxygen tanks and I didn't see that, from the paragraph, so your job is to find a paragraph",,,130.1,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"and give me the actual word with the citing source, then you will get the answer okay okay",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,awesome,,,,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,Great job Luis,,,,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,All right does anybody would like to share the answer,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
446,Chris,"And I think the answer is all, let me see what",,,120.4,response,1,0,2
446,Chris,Scientists found craters for water on the moon,,,,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,awesome,,,,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"So I love, how you a thoroughly enjoy the reading I could see that you understand the text and that really impressed me Chris that are really, really great job",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"My concern was in this responses that you didn't read the question correctly and he didn't read the question a little bit carefully, because the question your question that we asked you right now is that I want you to identify the object we're looking for and by by circling equipment",,,430.1,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"Here and underlined, a sentence where",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,The scientists use the discover water on the moon,,,,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,and,,,,remark,1,0,2
446,Chris,What do you want me to do,,,,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,and i'll underline the sentence where scientists use us to discover water on the moon,,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"So, right now, I want you to identify the object that we're looking for from the question by circling equipment",,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
446,Chris,Okay equipment,,,420.1,response,1,0,2
446,Chris,underlying in the story or underlining the question?,,,,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,underline the last part the scientists us to discover water on the moon,,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,sorry that it that I clarify that question,,,,remark,1,0,2
446,Chris,"Okay, so I circled equipment and I underlined us to discover water on the moon",,,,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,Good so in this question whatever you're looking for Jazmin i'll get back to you in a minute one second okay,,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
446,Jazmin,Okay,,,110.1,response,1,0,2

446,Jazmin,Oh okay well I didn't understand why my answer was wrong,,,,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"What was your answer, can you share that with us again",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
446,Jazmin,yeah I said masses into small machine,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"You actually actually you did excellent job and catching that NASA send a small machine you're correct, however, you just didn't identify what the smallest shane was OK",,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"OK, I see that the best part about your best part about your work, is that you understood the text passage correctly",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"But that you didn't go back to the reading and that's just my assumption I didn't i'm not saying that you didn't do it, but my assumption is that you didn't revisit the text and telling me what the actual machine was so",,,410.2,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"So what you can do my feedback for you is that you could just read every time you read a passage and the questions given to you, I want you to reread the passage again and the corresponding tasks and then tell me",,,420.3,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,The answer by reading and reading that the sentence again okay,,,,remark,1,0,2
446,Jazmin,"And I read it two times I did, because I know",,,,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"Oh, you did",,,,remark,1,0,2
446,Jazmin,"yeah the teacher told us that strategy, you know you read it, you read the question and then you read it again",,,,response,1,0,2
446,Jazmin,I just I forgot to put the name,,,,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"On the machine oh that's Okay, next time, can you please give us a specific name for the machine that's all oh",,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
446,Jazmin,Okay yeah I can do that that's easy,,,420.2,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,awesome great job and telling me but small machine wasn't necessarily a small machine and you did a really great job and showing me how you understood the text okay excellent Chris go right ahead,,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
446,Chris,"yeah I was thinking about equipment, since a circle that in the text and I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,310.1,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,Oh wow you did a superior job like telling me all that background knowledge I love that how you visited there and site and how it made a big impact on you,,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"I really so good good all right now so have you heard about this story before, or is it your first time hearing this about finding water and the moon yeah",,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
446,Chris,"This is my my first time because we we learned about the MARS Rover and, like the",,,230.1,response,1,0,2
446,Chris,"things that go to Mars, but I didn't know about water on the moon",,,,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"Oh, you didn't know about the water and that's incredible well if you actually go back to the passage in the first paragraph",,,120.3,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"Shall we just go back and see together since I didn't go with three other answers, so we could definitely do that so Jazmin, can you tell us what the paragraph, you find the answer from",,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
446,Jazmin,I found the answer in the second paragraph,,,230.2,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"How do you know that, how do you know that the answer actually is, in the second paragraph",,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
446,Jazmin,"um cuz I was looking for equipment right, and so, when I was reading I only saw two places in paragraph two, or they see a small machine and then paragraph three, where they see the microscope",,,230.2,response,1,0,2
446,Jazmin,"But the question and I went back to the question and says to discover water right and then in the second sentence, it says the herbal will look for ice deposit so looking for is the same thing as discovering I think",,,,response,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"excellent job you, you really enjoyed you really, really great you really impressed me with your answer I love, how you",,,110.1,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"yeah I love how you're telling us about the process find any so locate in the US, or perhaps and",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"I love how utilizing all the words from the question sentence and you're trying to find that word and try to revisiting of the paragraph, I really, really great job so you're correct indeed",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"The answer is located in a paragraph two, and it's not too difficult and because it says NASA send a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate right and",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"yeah and then it was confusing at first, because, as you said, it is a small machine",,,210.4,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"That appears in twice in this passage right so that's why it was a little bit confusing, but you did a really great job thoroughly reading an entire paragraph and telling me how it actually works to find water good",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,I read the story,,,,remark,1,0,2
446,Teacher,"yeah i'm so proud of you, you would that really impressed me okay",,,110.1,remark,1,0,2

446,Teacher,"about the previous texts and science class okay all right Farrah I have your response up here would you like to share out loud with the whole class, so we can go ahead, yes Luis?",,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
446,Luis,"yeah excuse me i'm Okay, I think I got this all figured out so i'm all good",,,120.4,response,2,0,2
446,Teacher,"that's awesome he said I love that how you're sharing your answer with us the beginning of the class and really, really appreciate it, and then you also show me how outstanding aspect of background knowledge that you have an insight as class",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,"And I love to hear from two other scholars and you, you can also comment on it, and you can also share your thoughts whenever while you're raising your hands but um",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,yeah but let's hear from Farrah first okay,,,,remark,2,0,2
446,Luis,Okay,,,,response,2,0,2
446,Luis,"Can I go back to my seat, since I I fixed mine",,,,response,2,0,2
446,Teacher,um why don't you um let's just hang tight for a minute okay,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,awesome Farrah go ahead,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2
446,Farrah,Okay yeah um so my answer was that all you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
446,Teacher,"Sure okay I love that you gave the answer, and it will really impressed me was that you capture the word Microsoft scoping from the passage some important key word there,",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,but what did the text makes you think that was the answer,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
446,Farrah,Because I was looking for the keywords equipment oh discover water on the moon,,,310.1,response,2,0,2
446,Farrah,And this one had it had a microscope which is equipment,,,,response,2,0,2
446,Farrah,And then,,,,response,2,0,2
446,Farrah,"It says in the second sentence, the water they found is microscopic and found is kind of like discovered",,,,response,2,0,2
446,Farrah,And then it's also about water on the moon,,,,response,2,0,2
446,Teacher,Right right very important did you get that did you get the answer from which paragraph again?,,,230.2,remark,2,0,2
446,Farrah,from paragraph three,,,230.2,response,2,0,2
446,Teacher,Paragraph three so you got the word microscopic which looks really important right,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,"And then, it looks like a little machine sounds like a little machine and it has a scientific tools, who may just think that it was a scientific tool, the little machine and you also found found verve and water say major think that's the answer but",,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,I really liked that you're sharing your process with us yeah go ahead,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
446,Farrah,"yeah sorry teacher it wasn't that it was a machine, I guess, my science teacher might see that it is, but I was looking for equipment",,,310.1,response,2,0,2
446,Farrah,because that was the word in the question,,,,response,2,0,2
446,Farrah,"And I know microscope is equipment, because that's what we say when we get out the microscopes and science class",,,,response,2,0,2
446,Teacher,yeah you're right right right right okay I love that you're sharing all this thoughts great,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,"so let's start from the beginning, so if you go back to the question I love to have you wide, so why don't you try reading the question again",,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
446,Farrah,Okay um what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
446,Teacher,So I think the most important thing is you already got the most important on the equipment we're going to underline the equipment,,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,"and underline to discover water, the moon right",,,420.1,remark,2,0,2
446,Farrah,Okay yeah I feel like i'm i'm still confused because did I do that in my answer?,,,420.1,response,2,0,2
446,Teacher,so the answer was actually lunar orbiter from a pay a paragraph two,,,130.3,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,"So i'm here what were your what you wrote, I think you you've got the words microscopic and lunar orbiter mixed up on the way on the paragraph two and three,",,,410.3,remark,2,0,2
446,Farrah,"Oh, but, but I did I had all the keywords I had equipment discover water on the moon",,,130.3,response,2,0,2
446,Farrah,I'm still confused,,,,response,2,0,2
446,Teacher,yeah so I love that you're sharing that with us and the water being discovered that is called the microscopic okay,,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,uh huh the machine that we use to find water and the moon is called a lunar orbiter that's why I think I eat mixed up and pay and paragraph two and three,,,130.3,remark,2,0,2
446,Farrah,"Although they also do say microscope in the lessons and the last sentence of paragraph three, how come that's not the equipment",,,130.3,response,2,0,2
446,Teacher,"That I love that question and then what it does, that that's another scientific tool that's another equipment, but they use it to",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,Look things really closely right but not particularly to find water,,,,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,"the scientists in this paragraph, according to the text, they use a lunar orbiter from according to paragraph two that's a small machine and that's called lunar orbiter to find water under surface",,,130.3,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,"And I can tell you that, because it tells you directly in the paragraph to",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,"And the ice deposits become a water and then scientists said that a ton of top layer the moon surface it hold a total about 32 ounces water, so I know that it is water being found in the moon and and they also use it to drink water and stuff like that okay okay okay",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,"All right, go right ahead Chris",,,,remark,2,0,2
446,Chris,"And I was thinking about the water on the moon, and I were reading about them, trying to find it and I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024",,,,response,2,0,2
446,Teacher,Can you can you repeat that again,,,,remark,2,0,2
446,Chris,yeah um I read at home and one of my science books that there could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,,response,2,0,2
446,Teacher,Oh wow that's an incredible information I love that you're sharing the resource with us,,,110.3,remark,2,0,2
446,Teacher,"yeah great Chris Luis do you have any thoughts I know you're all you also have like really enrich background knowledge about this topic, do you have any comments to share on top of the Chris, because you can add on to this",,,130.2,remark,2,0,2
446,Luis,"out while i'm and not so much about the moon base, but I was thinking about what Farrah was saying about it being the microscope and then you were saying Jazmin to answer was right, the Lunar orbiter",,,130.2,response,2,0,2
446,Luis,"And that you know what I thought that they had sent the astronauts to the moon, and the story, but I actually think that maybe it's just the machine and and not the",,,,response,2,0,2
446,Luis,Not the people,,,,response,2,0,2
446,Teacher,So you thought about Jazmin's answer and then,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
446,Luis,"yeah i'm thinking, maybe the Lunar orbiter you know is like the MARS Rover where anybody in the Rover you know it was just the machine itself and maybe that's the Lunar orbiter is too",,,230.3,response,2,0,2
446,Teacher,"yeah oh good good I love that you're giving connections and predictions they're great great I love it all right Oliverin, I would like to circle back oh yeah go ahead",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
446,Oliver,"i'm sorry teacher, but I was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go on, but I did want to say thank you for how are you i'm kept asking our questions to everybody and took time to explain",,,310.1,response,2,0,2
446,Oliver,"Where you thought that they were on track, I guess, and where they were off track, because now i'm thinking about my answer, and maybe, where I was off track i'm not sure, but at least i'm thinking about it right",,,,response,2,0,2
446,Teacher,"i'm a you circle, the same as Farrah so I that yeah this is justin that I gave Farrah actually applies to you Oliveron, so thank you for actually pointing that out great",,,,remark,2,0,2

447,Teacher,"Great Okay, so you guys just read a very short article",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
447,Luis,"um yeah excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,Is space something you're interested in Luis?,,,140.1,remark,0,1,2
447,Luis,Oh yeah oh big time I watch all these videos about space on YouTube and and I really want to go to space camp and go into the zero gravity Chamber oh yeah I really like space,,,140.1,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,that's fantastic that means you have an amazing schema which means you've lots of background information about space and that's going to help us today,,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"But sometimes like in this question they wanted us to find a specific answer in the text so Luis if you look at the answer to your question your answer to the question, can you find that in the text or did you find that appear in your brain, because you knew all about space",,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
447,Luis,"Well, I guess um I guess it was from my brain",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"but Luis can you read the question for us, do you have it",,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
447,Teacher,Which is great i'm so excited that you have so many facts up there in your brain,,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
447,Luis,Oh yeah that's right here um what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,110.3,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,there's a little bit more keep reading,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
447,Luis,I don't see anything,,,120.3,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"It doesn't say circle, the evidence in the text",,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
447,Teacher, That we can use to answer this question,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
447,Luis,I guess I skipped that part,,,120.2,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,Did everybody see that's the whole question okay so Luis if the question would have stopped where you were reading your answer would have been 100% right because you circled information in your brain,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
447,Teacher,Give your brain a kiss,,,,remark,0,1,2
447,Teacher, Say thanks brain,,,,remark,0,1,2
447,Luis,hey thanks brain,,,,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"so once again can Oliver can you read the question, one more time for me",,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
447,Teacher,But we wanted to use the text,,,410.2,remark,0,1,2
447,Oliver,"Okay yeah okay that's what equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon, so all the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question",,,120.3,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"Right so who knows, just in one word what is this question about what is it asking us about",,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,0,1,2
447,Jazmin,asking us about equipment,,,,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,You got it so we're gonna have to find a equipment some type of equipment and what did this equipment do,,,210.2,remark,0,1,2
447,Jazmin,"Well, it discovers the water and i'm i'm a little confused because I don't know why my answer is wrong",,,210.2,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"Okay, so can you share, will you share with the group what your answer was",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
447,Jazmin,"Yes, I said NASA send a small machine",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"Okay you're right good can you read us the sentence, where you where you got that",,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
447,Jazmin,"yeah okay so um it was in part two, and it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,So what was that small machine called,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
447,Jazmin,A lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,So do you think you could add something to your answer Jazmin to make it more complete in more correct,,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
447,Jazmin,"Well, I guess, I could I could just say that name the Lunar orbiter",,,210.3,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,Because what did the Lunar orbiter do,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
447,Jazmin,It it looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"So the lunar orbiter was a piece of equipment that scientist us to discover water on the moon hands up, if you agree with",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
447,Farrah,"Oh well, I had a different piece of equipment, I said the microscope and",,,130.3,response,0,1,2
447,Farrah,I think that that's the piece of equipment it's a tool and we use it in science class sometimes and it helps you look at really small things like the water on the moon,,,,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"Farrah, you are right that the microscope is a piece of equipment, but is the microscope what they use to discover the water on the moon or",,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
447,Teacher,Is the microscope what they you what we use to see,,,,remark,0,1,2
447,Farrah,"Well, I guess, I was thinking, how can you discover it if you can't see it",,,,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,Did you guys watch the movie about how the Lunar orbiter worked,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
447,Teacher,You guys didn't,,,,remark,0,1,2
447,Farrah,No we just we just read this we just read it,,,,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"Okay Okay, so I can see where this is going to be a little bit confusing um so you're absolutely right that the piece of equipment is a microscope but can you read the sentence that has the word microscope in it Farrah",,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
447,Farrah,I circled it and everything,,,120.3,response,0,1,2
447,Farrah,It says you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,Can you read the sentence before that Chris,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
447,Chris,"yeah yeah I can do that right before it says Okay, the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it",,,120.3,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"Okay, so Are they really telling us that we need a microscope that they i'm sorry, are they telling us, we used a microscope or are they telling us that the water was so small, we would need a microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
447,Chris,"It sounds like it sounds like the second one, but also but also I I went to NASA so I know that that scientists they actually use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"They do, but this is asking us specifically from our reading, not from what we know from other places, in this text",,,410.2,remark,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"Right, they want to know what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"So who thinks they can answer that question now what evidence, would you circle",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
447,Teacher,Oliver what are you going to circle,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
447,Oliver,"Okay Well, this is so, I changed my answer so first I said the microscope like Farrah did, but now now, I think, maybe they were just saying that it's really small so",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
447,Oliver,"If you want to look at it like if I wanted to look at it, I would have to use a microscope but now I think first I had to use the Lunar orbiter and um",,,,response,0,1,2
447,Oliver,I just wanted to say I I looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch actually but I,,,,response,0,1,2
447,Oliver,"wanted to say thank you so much for being so patient and really explaining to us how our answers were not quite complete and how we could understand the story, even better, to make our answers even better",,,,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"yeah because you guys were right on the right track, we just had to make that one little jump",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
447,Teacher,and Luis one last thing what was Armstrong Neil Armstrong What did he say when he landed on the moon,,,140.1,remark,0,1,2
447,Luis,That that's one small step for man one giant leap for mankind,,,140.1,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,You guys did one small step towards learning and now we did another giant step towards learning so enjoy lunch thanks for coming,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
447,Luis,By,,,150.1,response,0,1,2
447,Teacher,I take care,,,,remark,0,1,2
447,Teacher,"Good morning class, how are you",,,,remark,1,1,2
447,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: morning we're good today,,,,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,Good,,,,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"So we just shared our answers for the water on the moon, and I was just curious",,,,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"Maybe, starting with Luis Luis could you explain how you came to your answer choice",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
447,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: um well actually I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"Well that's fantastic, can you tell me something you know about space",,,140.1,remark,1,1,2
447,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: yeah Okay, I know they just landed the MARS Rover",,,140.1,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,That is very true,,,,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"And it was pretty cool I got to watch it, but today we're not talking about space in general we're talking specifically about this article that we read having to do with water on the moon",,,,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"So it's fantastic that you already know about space, but for today we're kind of looking at your ability to read and pull out information So could you take a look at your answer Luis",,,220.1,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,And could you tell me,,,,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,How did you get that answer,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
447,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: Well, I know, after our astronauts up on the mound looking for water they definitely are using oxygen tanks",,,120.2,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"whoa Okay, why are they definitely using oxygen tanks",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
447,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: To breathe,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"Oh, so the oxygen tanks are helping the astronauts survive not really helping the astronauts in discovering the water",,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
447,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: Well, I mean I guess you need to breathe to discover water that's kind of what I was thinking",,,210.3,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"And that is very, very true that the astronauts have to be alive in order to be able to discover the water",,,,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"The question though it did ask us, it said what equipment did scientists use and you're talking to be about astronauts,",,,410.1,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"can you tell me a little bit more, what do you think are astronauts and scientists one in the same?",,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
447,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: um astronauts are a type of scientist?,,,210.3,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,Was that a question or a statement?,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
447,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: Not sure,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"Okay, I think you're right that a lot of astronauts have some training in science",,,,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"But I want to take a look, I think, if we look at this question Luis",,,,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,so did you get your answer from the article or did you get your answer somewhere else?,,,230.2,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,it's asking us to answer this question based on what we read in the article,,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
447,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: um I guess it's not really in the story,,,210.2,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,Where is it,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
447,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: In my brain,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"In your brain, because you know so much stuff about space, which is pretty awesome",,,,remark,1,1,2
447,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah,,,,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"But in this case are we looking for information from your brain, or are we looking for information from the article?",,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
447,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: I guess the article,,,210.3,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,So what do you think is something you might need to do right now to check your answer,,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
447,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: and read it,,,210.3,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"read your answer, read the article",,,,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,Article okay so i'm going to keep talking to some other students and i'm going to come back to you to see once you've read the article,,,,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"And I know you've got all that background knowledge in your brain, which is fantastic but help look just at this article to try and figure out the answer does that sound like a plan",,,,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"yeah okay great and then go ahead and change your answer, if you think you need to okay and i'm going to move on to talk to um",,,420.2,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"i'm going to talk to both Oliver and Farrah because you guys had the same answer so yeah Oliver or Farrah, can you tell me how you are can you guys actually talk to each other and i'll listen about how you came up with that answer choice",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
447,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, well, I found it on Oliver in part three, and I circled the part where it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I guess I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
447,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: um yeah I circled that same part Farrah cuz I was thinking that you'd you'd need to be able to see something before you can find it,,,,response,1,1,2
447,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: Yes, we don't understand",,,,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,that's some really good thinking you're absolutely right there Oliver that you need to be able to see it in order to know that you found it,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"Farrah, can you tell me a little bit more What do you mean you don't understand what's confusing you right now",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
447,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: um why isn't the microscope the right answer,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,So what do you know about a microscope,,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
447,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: Oh lets you see things that are really small,,,210.3,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"Okay, have you ever used a microscope",,,140.1,remark,1,1,2
447,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: in science,,,140.1,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"Okay Okay, and so",,,,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"that's I mean you're absolutely both of you are right that it's something that you, you need to use to find something that is very small",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"But if we look, does it say that the water is on the surface of the moon, or that the water is kind of buried underneath",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
447,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: Oh, I remember it's in these craters these craters",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
447,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: way down,,,,response,1,1,2
447,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: Where the sun never shines,,,,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"Very good, so do you think they took a microscope to the moon to like look around like this, to try and find all of that water",,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
447,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: Oh,,,210.3,response,1,1,2
447,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: That sounds really hard,,,,response,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"It does sound pretty hard and it sounds like it would take a pretty long time wouldn't it, so I think you guys are on the right track that a microscope was probably involved,",,,,remark,1,1,2
447,Teacher,"But it's not the Big piece of equipment that we were looking for so, can you to reread the passage and see if you can find a bigger piece of equipment that they would have used",,,430.2,remark,1,1,2
447,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: um yeah I wish we Park, but we actually have to go now um, but I wanted to say thank you so much for working with us today",,,430.2,response,1,1,2

448,Teacher," So before we start can we, oh Luis, did you have a question",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"hi everyone i'm so glad that you were able to come join me at for a small group, so we can talk a little bit more about what you were just reading and talking about related to the moon",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Luis,um yeah I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"You already know all about space that makes me so happy because we're going to be able to use your knowledge as an expert about space to help teach the rest of our group, so i'm going to definitely be relying on you Luis",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher, So thank you for sharing that with me before we get started,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher, Luis can we start with you,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,Thanks Luis,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher, Can you guys quickly share what it is that you were just answering about the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon just in a couple of words,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Luis,"yeah Okay, so I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
448,Teacher," Jazmin, what about you",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,Great thanks,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3

448,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,210.3,response,0,1,3
448,Teacher, It's always a great idea,,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"Chris, what was your answer",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"Oh great, I love that you decided to look back in the text to find out the answer to the question when you weren't sure",,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Chris,I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,310.1,response,0,1,3
448,Teacher,Thanks Chris,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher, Oliver?,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Oliver,um yeah so I circled the same answer as Savanannah and that's a microscope,,,110.1,response,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"Ah, OK so Farrah are you going to share the same answer as Oliver, the microscope too",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Farrah,"um yeah well, so my answer is, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"got it thanks guys, so it tells me that you all really spend some good time examining this article, and looking for answers to this question about the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon",,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher, That would be easy for you to sign and come back to,,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,I love that a lot of you circle that answer in your text,,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"As we were talking, did any of you remember that some of your peers answers came up in the text too? Does that sound familiar",,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
448,Farrah,"Some of them, yeah",,,130.2,response,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"When you guys were reading this, how did it feel, did it feel really easy, kind of in the middle or really difficult to read",,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,Great i'm really glad to hear that so we're going to talk a little bit more about this and ways that we can go even deeper into our text,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,0,1,3
448,Chris,um I think it was pretty easy to read,,,,response,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"Great, Jazmin, what about you",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Jazmin,"I would say that's a kind of medium because well my answer was the small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong, why am I in this group",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"Oh i'm not sure that your answer is wrong,",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"we did not pull you guys together as a group to tell you that you were wrong, we just pulled you together to find out a little bit more about what we're learning sometimes it's",,,,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,easier for us to learn more about what we are learning,,,,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"In a group of small, a smaller group, instead of our whole entire class as one",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"Do you feel like this is a little bit easier to talk to each other, in a small group",,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Jazmin,"Yes, yes",,,140.1,response,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"yeah absolutely and i'm loving that i'm getting to spend some time with just the five of you, and I think we can all really learn from each other, like I mentioned earlier, with Luis",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"So thinking about the tools that the scientists use to discover water on the moon, I know you guys mentioned lots of different equipment the oxygen tanks the lunar orbiter the microscope sometimes they just found it in craters",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,we are going to try to go a little bit deeper into our text today,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"I want you to take just a quick second and read over just the first paragraph of the text again and, if you think of any questions or any parts that seem confusing to you I would love to hear them so just take a minute and scan over just the first paragraph one more time",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,Great job Thank you so I noticed in the first paragraph that it talks about craters that's a difficult vocabulary word does someone know what a crater is,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,Chris do you know wat a crater is?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Chris,yeah so,,,120.4,response,0,1,3
448,Chris,it's sort of like a whole but it's cooling underground it's kind of like on top of the ground,,,,response,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"yeah absolutely a crater is sort of like a whole or a well that might have filled up with water, it sounds like that's what happened in this article",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,It also says that a crater is a dark place where the sun never shines we can learn all of that from just the beginning of our reading about the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"Now that you have a little bit of a better idea of what a crater is, do you think a crater is a piece of equipment that scientists would use to find water?",,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"You can shake your head, yes or no, if you can",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher," Oliver i'm seeing your head shaking no to, why do you think no",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"looks like Chris saying no, it looks like i'm seeing a lot of nos",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Oliver,"Well a crater it's more like um on a piece of nature, I don't know if nature is the right word but it's not like something you use or a tool it's just kind of part of the moon",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"yeah absolutely it's kind of part of the moon, so it is something that caught the water but it doesn't quite answer a question about it being a piece of equipment that the scientists are using Chris, did you have a follow up about that",,,410.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Chris,yeah well because that was my answer it first about the craters,,,410.1,response,0,1,3
448,Chris,I hear what you mean about equipment on and that made me think about how I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use own lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,1,3
448,Teacher,yeah absolutely I love that you made a connection to your own personal experience Chris and you were able to realize,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"let's take a quick look at the second paragraph, and do the same exact thing",,,,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"That your original answer was close but it wasn't quite right, thank you for noticing that on your own",,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"So take a look at the second paragraph, read it over again quickly and then we're going to talk about it again",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"All right, great job thanks guys, I remember that Jazmin shared that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter that lunar orbiter i'm not even sure if I know what that means what words or ideas in the text could we use to figure out what a lunar orbiter is",,,,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"We know it's a small machine, but if my machine could be anything, how can we get a little bit of a better idea of what a lunar orbiter is",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,Luis our space expert Can you help us out,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
448,Luis,"um yeah okay so um lunar you guys lunar means moon so anytime you see lunar it means about the moon, an orbiter is like an orbit it's like it goes around something and it says so, the orbiter at looks for the ice, I think, by going around the moon somehow",,,130.2,response,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"Luis Thank you so much for sharing that Luna does mean moon so when you hear the word lunar it's going to have something to do with the moon,",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,just like now is the Lunar New Year it's the complete cycle of the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"orbiter just like Luis said, has to do with going around",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,so Luis used his knowledge of those two words individually to put them together and figure out more about what a lunar orbiter is,,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"Oliver, can you add on",,,120.1,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"if you look back in your text, you can see that it looks for ice deposits in the crater",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,"Jazmin told us that it was a small machine and Luis added on to that by saying that it has to do with going around the moon,",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
448,Oliver,"Well, actually I looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, right now, but I wanted to say thank you so much for helping us read and understand the text so carefully and really look back at it and use it to answer the question I was so helpful Thank you so much",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
448,Teacher,Thanks Oliver thanks all of you,,,,remark,0,1,3
448,Teacher,Go enjoy your lunch,,,,remark,0,1,3
449,Teacher,So we're still talking about the Lunar orbiter does anybody have any thoughts that we didn't bring up before Luis,,,120.4,remark,0,1,1
449,Luis,um yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,120.4,response,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"Oh, of course, Luis, but we all want to benefit from your expertise, so you know we we like the opportunity to be able to to have you in the Group, so that we can ask you some questions, what did you think about the Lunar orbiter",,,110.3,remark,0,1,1
449,Luis,"um well I guess we'll kind of what I was thinking, because a question was about the equipment",,,110.3,response,0,1,1
449,Luis,"For discovering water on the moon well what I was thinking was actually back on they would need oxygen tanks, because how are you going to breathe up on the moon, to go discover water, if you don't have oxygen tanks",,,,response,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"that's a really good point I you know I wish the article would have talked about that, I guess, I guess, sometimes the",,,110.3,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,The articles forget that that people might be coming to to the article without a knowledge of what NASA does and how they do it,,,,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"um, but I would have loved and maybe it's in a separate article, you know if they would have talked about kind of the space suits and the way that that they do provide I think they call it",,,140.1,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,Life support measures instead of you know they don't just refer to it as oxygen because it's more than just oxygen,,,,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,But but let's go back to talking about the Lunar orbiter because I just thought that was so interesting,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,Oliver did you did you what did you think about the Lunar orbiter because it's just so amazing like Could you imagine the way that this this orbiter is able to reach a part of the moon that we've never been able to reach before I thought that was so interesting,,,120.4,remark,0,1,1
449,Oliver,"yeah it's really, really interesting um and one thing I thought was really kind of especially interesting about it was that on when they found the water, it was so small",,,120.4,response,0,1,1
449,Oliver,"That was it's um it's less water than on the earth and it's drier than the dry desert even but they're still water there, and so, but here's my question is because well",,,,response,0,1,1
449,Oliver,"I wasn't I didn't pick the Lunar orbiter for my answer I picked the microscope because the water so small, so I don't I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"Well, your answer is not wrong Oliver and i'm so i'm so glad that you picked to the microscope so I let as a way to answer your question, I would like one of your classmates to maybe kind of give us kind of a reassessment of how was it that that NASA made this discovery",,,130.2,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,Jazmin could you tell your classmates How was it that they found that there was water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
449,Jazmin,Okay well hey they sent the small machine and it investigated,,,210.4,response,0,1,1
449,Jazmin,The craters that deep polar craters and that's where they found the ice deposits,,,,response,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"And Jazmin did the machine which is called the Lunar orbiter, by the way, did that have a microscope on it",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
449,Jazmin,"Oh, oh i'm not so sure no I don't think I don't think it told us in the story",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
449,Teacher,that's right it didn't so I want all of you to think about this for a moment,,,,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,it's you know I think the the person who wrote the article kind of did us a disservice here because,,,,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"They they kind of gloss over the fact that there's a step between the Lunar orbiter orbiting that part of the moon, making contact with that part of the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"And then later scientists at NASA looking at the the samples that the Lunar lunar orbiter collected under a microscope at a lab back on earth, or on the space station, or perhaps even maybe on",,,,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,Some other sort of space probe but so so think about that and then tell me,,,,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"What what's that step in between so Farrah, can you tell me how is it that that sample is collected and how we get from you know the Lunar lunar orbiter existing and then being able to look at a sample of the moon under a microscope could you go ahead and tell me that Farrah",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
449,Farrah,"Well, I can try it's kind of, I guess, but I guess probably that lunar orbiter it must like take take samples take pieces, maybe of the ice or",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
449,Farrah,"Maybe pictures or or like scans of the moon, somehow, and that it takes that on that what's the word evidence back to the lab and then they use the microscope which makes so much more sense",,,,response,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"that's that's exactly right Farrah The one thing that that you said that I want to clarify, as you mentioned",,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"At one point, I think you mentioned photos and I just want to be clear that a photo would not be enough, but like you said evidence would be enough, so any sort of a sample",,,410.2,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"Dust, particles of some sort you need something to be able to look under the microscope",,,,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"A picture alone is not enough now, I will say, maybe in a future class will look at the way that that sort of evidence, like that samples like that could be used to create photographic samples but but that'll be that'll be another class, but Chris you have a question",,,,remark,0,1,1
449,Chris,"yeah well it's actually a comment on, so I went to NASA actually and I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like Luis said and masks and suits",,,,response,0,1,1
449,Teacher,it's incredible isn't it Chris,,,110.3,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"So you know let's talk about why is it that so just to be clear, because, because I know the article, you know that I think the article could have been",,,,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"If one of you would have written the article, it would have been so much better, because you would have filled in all these blanks but, so we have this lunar orbiter and",,,,remark,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"Why is it called the Lunar lunar orbiter, by the way, why, why is it that it's called that you think no it wasn't an article but Luis",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
449,Luis,yeah well I definitely got this okay lunar means moon and orbiter means it like it goes around because that's what an orbit is,,,210.4,response,0,1,1
449,Teacher,"that's exactly right that's exactly right, so you know we have this lunar orbiter yes Oliver",,,110.1,remark,0,1,1
449,Oliver,"i'm sorry yeah um so actually I just looked at the clock um and we have to go to lunch, but",,,110.1,response,0,1,1
449,Oliver,"On before we go, I wanted to say thank you so much for explaining that missing step and the article, because it makes so much more sense now when they use the orbiter and then how they use the microscope",,,,response,0,1,1
449,Oliver,"And so now, I really understand how how our answers could have been better and how the article could have been better, so thank you so much",,,,response,0,1,1

449,Chris,"edu: I thought it was pretty cool you know, like the idea of finding water on the moon, and then maybe people you know if we if we use all the water on our planet, you know, then, then we could go to the moon, and we could have people drink water and astronauts could have water there so yeah",,,110.1,response,1,1,1

449,Teacher,"You know, being able to leverage and to use the resources on the moon, the natural resources, like the water that was recently found",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
449,Teacher,"really is something that it's going to that's going to be number one very difficult and number two it's going to be a long time, you know the technology and the science does not exist, to be able to do this yet",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
449,Teacher,"Oliver could you help me explain a little bit more to your classmates about why it is that you know the water on the moon, is still too early for Chris's goals",,,130.2,remark,1,1,1
449,Oliver,"edu: yeah cuz in paragraph six, they talk about how it'll take a lot of time and a lot of money and so that means that they don't have the time or the money yet so it's it's clearly not ready yet",,,130.2,response,1,1,1

449,Teacher,that's right i'm really glad that you pointed up paragraph six that's a good point,,,310.1,remark,1,1,1
449,Oliver,"edu: Water scientists need to come up with a plan for extracting are getting it out of the polar craters making this planet tickle at all, so they don't even know how to get the water out",,,310.1,response,1,1,1

449,Teacher,Thanks,,,,remark,1,1,1
450,Teacher,um so we I just asked you the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,3
450,Luis,um yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,120.2,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,that's great Luis I love that you're interested in space Maybe you can share your knowledge with the rest of the students,,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,Uhm what equipment did you find in the texts that scientists used to discover the water on the moon?,,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Luis,Oh wow I know scientists think it was a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,110.3,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,"Does anybody have any other ideas about what equipment, the scientists use? do we",,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher, Farrah yes?,,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,They do the they do use oxygen tanks uhmm,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
450,Farrah,"yeah Okay, so I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,130.2,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,yeah that's great,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher," in the text, they said that the scientists use a microscope because microscopes are used to look at things that are really, really tiny",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,"And the water molecules on the moon were really tiny Jazmin I saw your hand go up earlier, did you have something to add",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Jazmin,um so my answer is NASA sent a small machine,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,can we look in the text and see if you can find what the name of the small machine was,,,420.3,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,yeah they did I remember reading that as well does anybody remember what it was called,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,yeah Luis did you find it,,,,remark,0,0,3
450,Luis,"I found it right there in the middle, it says lunar orbiter",,,,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,Has anybody heard those words before,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,Exactly yeah it's called a lunar orbiter,,,110.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Luis,Oh yeah well I definitely have,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,"Do you know what they mean, you know what lunar means?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Luis,uhm lunar means,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
450,Luis, lunar means the moon,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,"Yes, it does and what what does something do when it orbits",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,Does anybody have any ideas Chris yeah,,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Chris,"yeah, so I think is when something sort of goes around something else",,,120.4,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,Exactly yeah it's when something moves around something else kind of in a in a circle usually yeah Farrah do you have something to add,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Farrah,"Well i'm just wondering, I mean I said the microscope so",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
450,Farrah,I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,"so they first use the Lunar orbiter like we talked about, and they also use the microscope to see the tiny particles of water",,,130.3,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,Does that make sense?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,Your answer is not wrong scientists used lots of different machines to discover the water on the moon,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
450,Farrah,So the answer is just both,,,150.1,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,yeah it is it's both they use both machines both pieces of equipment or tools,,,110.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Farrah,Okay okay so um I guess i'm still just not sure how the microscope and the Lunar orbiter like how they fit together in the same answer?,,,110.4,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,mm hmm that is a great question so if we look at the text that we read it says that the Lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,"So the Lunar orbiter is in space and it uses a telescope or a camera to look for these water particles, but the water particles are microscopic they're really, really tiny, so the scientist has to use the microscope as well, to be able to see them",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Farrah,Oh okay i'm starting to make a little more sense um yeah so,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
450,Luis,"I mean Farrah have to use both because, can you imagine like an astronaut walking around the whole moon was just a microscope just a tiny little microscope? I mean that wouldn't work!",,,,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,"Thanks for adding Luis yeah I don't I think they have to use a bunch of different tools to look and so thank you for contributing your opinion Chris, do you have a question",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
450,Chris,"Well, I just wanted to share I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,110.1,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,that's very cool I have not been to NASA i've always wanted to go that's really cool that you got to go,,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,"But i've seen lots of videos where they use lots of different equipment, like the ones you described and they have to use like space suits and sometimes these satellites to see different things- it's very interesting",,,140.1,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,Does anybody else have any ideas about what other types of equipment scientists use the NASA scientists use?,,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,"yeah, Oliver?",,,,remark,0,0,3
450,Oliver,"Well, I know that down on earth there's people with like on lots of computers and screens on buttons and things",,,,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,yeah that's very true they use a lot of a lot of high tech tools like computers and,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,"buttons and things to control things that are in space, because we can't be in space all the time, so they use them to control telescopes satellites like I said, to see what other things are going on yeah Chris do you have something to add?",,,140.1,remark,0,0,3
450,Chris,"yeah well, I have a question sort of about the story so were there actually any astronauts on the moon looking for the water?",,,140.1,response,0,0,3
450,Chris,because I wasn't quite clear from the story about that,,,,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,"yeah that's a great clarifying question I was a little unclear as well, but from what I understand it sounds like they just use the equipment and to find a water on the moon, and the scientists were controlling it from earth and that so they used",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher,the equipment to find the water,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Teacher," They might have been on the space station, or something that was also in space, but it sounds like the equipment did a lot of the work",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
450,Farrah,"um so I just looked at the clock and it's it's actually time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for being so interested in everything that each one of us had to say it really felt like you valued everybody's contribution, so much so thank you",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
450,Teacher,Start simulation,,,,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,Hello everyone i'm so happy to see you,,,,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,So today we're going to talk about your responses to the reading that we did about NASA,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,1,0,3
450,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be I already know all about space",,,,response,1,0,3
450,Teacher,"Well i'm glad that you're really interested in space, and I think that being a part of this group you'll learn from your",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,"Fellow peers about maybe some other responses and we can build your understanding of the resources that I provided you with the texts that we learned about how to answer a question, using a nonfiction text",,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,"Okay, I think it'll be really interesting because if you know a lot about space i'm sure you really like it, what is your favorite thing about space Luis",,,140.1,remark,1,0,3
450,Luis,"Okay, I love watching like the",,,140.1,response,1,0,3
450,Luis,"Space shuttles take off and go like straight up into space, I always watch some YouTube videos about that and then how the astronauts can like flow, you know",,,,response,1,0,3
450,Teacher,No gravity,,,,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,yeah that's really cool I I think it's really interesting also and such a cool advancement in technology so let's let's talk about the question that you guys responded to which was,,,140.1,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,Farrah do you want to tell me about your answer,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
450,Farrah,"I said that all scientists know I said, you need a scientific to hold a microscope to look really closely",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
450,Teacher,I see how you found the answer in the text you looked for the scientific tool and the text,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,But let's look at the question again let's see what is the key word and the question are using that's really important everybody look at the question on your piece of paper and try and find one or two key words that you think the question that's important and the question,,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,Did you find it Jazmin?,,,,remark,1,0,3
450,Jazmin,"yeah I think equipment is a keyword, and so I wrote about equipment and my answer, so I don't understand my My answer is wrong",,,,response,1,0,3
450,Teacher,What can you tell me about your answer,,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,Why did you choose you see that,,,,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,3
450,Jazmin,"So it says NASA send to small machine cuz I know that the question was asking us to look for equipment that was looking for water, and so, in paragraph two, I thought that that machine was the equipment",,,,response,1,0,3
450,Teacher,yeah the small machine is one of the pieces of equipment that they use,,,110.4,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,do we remember what the small machine was called,,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,"It is, I see how you mean that connection",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,That equipment can,,,,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,Maybe look in your text it says it in the,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
450,Jazmin,lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
450,Teacher,did anybody find another piece of equipment or that they said in their answer,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,yeah lunar orbiter so that's one piece of equipment great,,,110.4,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,yeah Farrah,,,,remark,1,0,3
450,Farrah,yeah,,,,response,1,0,3
450,Farrah,"Because when you had asked me about what was the words in the question, I thought equipment was an important word to",,,,response,1,0,3
450,Farrah,So I I said microscope because that's equipment,,,,response,1,0,3
450,Teacher,yeah I yeah that's very true and the microscope is another piece of equipment that the scientists use,,,110.2,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,"So now we have two pieces of equipment right, so we have the Lunar orbiter that Jazmin talked about and her response and the microscopes man that you talked about in your response",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,deb I think you also mentioned the microscope and your response right,,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
450,Farrah,"yeah yeah I I was looking for equipment, because I thought that was the key word and",,,230.3,response,1,0,3
450,Farrah,"I talked about water, because I thought water was important, a microscope and looking at water in paragraph three so who's right um man Farrah or testament",,,,response,1,0,3
450,Teacher,"whoa you're both right you both made connections and found pieces of equipment and the text, but both of the responses were missing a little bit of detail because",,,,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,"You talked about the microscope but you didn't talk about the Lunar orbiter and Jazmin you talked about the Lunar orbiter but not the microscope and they used a lot of pieces of equipment, because it takes a lot of things to find water on the moon it's a big discovery",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,Okay yeah Chris,,,,remark,1,0,3
450,Chris,yeah I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,1,0,3
450,Teacher,"that's that's really cool i've never been to NASA, but I think that would be a really fun trip What was your favorite part",,,140.1,remark,1,0,3
450,Chris,"it's amazing, you can see, all of these different space shuttles that have gone to into space for like the past 30 and 40 years",,,140.1,response,1,0,3
450,Chris,"And then they have some like little pieces of moon rock that you can you can touch, some of them, and they have all of these other artifacts from space, it is amazing you gotta go",,,,response,1,0,3
450,Teacher,"yeah I definitely want to go soon, so what pieces of equipment, did you talk about in your answer Chris",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
450,Chris,Oh,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
450,Chris,I fogot the equipment part that I didn't say,,,,response,1,0,3
450,Teacher,"Oh well, that's Okay, I see how you got to your answer by talking about what they discovered which was another important part",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,Of the question we use the equipment that we just talked about the Lunar orbiter and the microscope that Farrah and Oliver and Jazmin talked about to discover the water,,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,1,0,3
450,Chris,yeah,,,,response,1,0,3
450,Chris,yeah I did that part but I forgot about the equipment,,,,response,1,0,3
450,Teacher,"Well that's Okay, now we know that the question, the key word was the equipment,",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,so we want to talk about the equipment in our answer,,,420.2,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,so do you see how you could add more to your answer and use the question and the keywords to find what kinds of things we want to use to answer,,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
450,Chris,I guess I could just add the two names of the machines that on today in in in in Jazmin in Oliver said,,,420.2,response,1,0,3
450,Teacher,Do you see them in in the text where it talks about the kinds of equipment,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
450,Chris,"yeah Oliver said it was in paragraph three, and I see Jazmin's in paragraph two",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
450,Teacher,Very good yeah so we can use the text as a resource to find her answers yeah,,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
450,Oliver,i'm sorry to interrupt but it's time for us to go so we'll see you next time okay,,,210.4,response,1,0,3
450,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,3
450,Teacher,"hi everyone, thank you for your thoughtful responses to the question",,,,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,Um Jazmin why don't you tell me why you said that there was convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
450,Jazmin,Okay,,,230.1,response,2,0,3
450,Luis,"Excuse me Okay, I think I got this all figured out so i'm all good",,,,response,2,0,3
450,Teacher,"Luis why don't we listen to our fellow classmates and see what they have to say, and maybe we can learn some new things",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
450,Luis,Okay okay okay,,,150.1,response,2,0,3
450,Jazmin,So I said that um that it would be valuable because,,,,response,2,0,3
450,Jazmin,"Well, water is important because astronauts have can drink the water, I mean it's not like they're on the on the on the ground where they can just like go to the store and buy some water or something so and we need water to survive, so that seems like that's really important",,,,response,2,0,3
450,Teacher,did you find any any convincing evidence in the text to support that it can be valuable,,,230.2,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,yeah I see I see how you came to that conclusion that having water on the moon would be valuable to have for astronauts in space if they can't go by any,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
450,Jazmin,"I found this somewhere, let me see because I thought I underlined it",,,310.1,response,2,0,3
450,Jazmin,Did I,,,,response,2,0,3
450,Jazmin,"Did I miss oh yes it's in the beginning okay and i'm in the paragraph four, it says watering the most valuable to have ways, for example, future astronauts could drink this water",,,,response,2,0,3
450,Teacher,yeah so I see yeah that's perfect evidence in the text to support your statement that water can be valuable,,,110.2,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,and maybe you could look in the text for more supporting evidence to show that it could be valuable,,,420.3,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,i'm concerned that your response doesn't include all of the benefits that water could provide to the astronauts,,,410.2,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,Farrah and Oliver I know you said that it,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,So why don't you look at the text and see if you can find some more evidence,,,,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,"why, why did you say that?",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,There is not convincing evidence,,,,remark,2,0,3
450,Farrah,i'm still kind of confused,,,,response,2,0,3
450,Teacher,So what are you confused about are you confused about the question or the reading?,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher, Okay so we're looking at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,yeah I I understand,,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
450,Farrah,"Well I guess the right answer cuz I thought that I had the right answer because I found it in the text, you know how you said that we have to look for the evidence in the story",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
450,Farrah,"Did because in the last paragraph, it says, making this plan will take a lot of time and money",,,,response,2,0,3
450,Farrah,"They need to study the moon surface and build new equipment, do you think you'll be a good investment you decide so i'm like Okay, a lot of time, a lot of money, my mom always says like that",,,,response,2,0,3
450,Farrah,"No, no, no, it takes too much time, oh no that's too much money so for me, then that means no but then you just told Jazmin that when she said yes, I was right",,,,response,2,0,3
450,Teacher,so Jazmin thought that it could be valuable,,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,"Well, there you at the end of the paragraph, it says you decide so it's your opinion on whether or not you think it's valuable",,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,but I see how you came to your conclusion,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,that it would not be valuable because you said that it takes a lot of time and a lot of money,,,,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,And maybe you don't think that that's a good investment so there can be multiple answers it's all about your opinions as long as you support it,,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,With evidence from the text so if you find evidence like you said to them that there's not enough there's a lot of money and a lot of time then maybe it's not worth it,,,,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
450,Farrah,yeah yeah so I um well I guess so then there's my answer okay,,,,response,2,0,3
450,Teacher,I think i'm I see how you got to your answer,,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,"but i'm concerned that you didn't provide enough evidence and your response, so you can see that you don't think it's valuable, but I would provide some evidence or some examples as to why why you think",,,430.2,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,and revise your response that way okay,,,,remark,2,0,3
450,Farrah,So can I just write down what I told you,,,,response,2,0,3
450,Teacher,"Oliver you, you had a similar response, you said that no it's not not ready yet so maybe",,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,yeah yeah look in the text and find find some evidence as to why you think it would not be valuable,,,420.3,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,yeah tell me why you why you said that,,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
450,Oliver,"Okay, I",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
450,Oliver,"wanted to be in that, so I just need to come up with a plan for constructing or getting it out of the polar craters making this plan will take a lot of time and money",,,,response,2,0,3
450,Oliver,"So you don't have a plan, I am, but you don't even have like the time and the money to make the plan so for me, that means that that's not valuable because I don't even have it and I don't know how to get it",,,,response,2,0,3
450,Teacher,"yeah I see I see how you got to your answer so i'm assuming that the answer you gave me was just no, but the question asks for you to provide some evidence, so I suggest",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,You do what the man is doing and look in the text and find some supporting evidence for why you don't think so what you just told me is that they don't have a plan and they don't have time and they don't have enough money,,,420.3,remark,2,0,3
450,Oliver,OK OK OK,,,420.3,response,2,0,3
450,Teacher,"Chris, what did yes",,,,remark,2,0,3
450,Chris,I was just thinking about what Oliver said about the time and I,,,,response,2,0,3
450,Chris,could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,,response,2,0,3
450,Teacher,"Oh that's really interesting I have not, I have not read that but I see how you could use that maybe as evidence to support your your answer that maybe, yes it is valuable",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,To find it to,,,,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,That water could be used on the moon,,,,remark,2,0,3
450,Chris,it's only that's only a few years away,,,,response,2,0,3
450,Teacher,mm hmm very true,,,,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,So Chris what um,,,,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,What did you say in your your response,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
450,Chris,I said waters heavy so it's good they don't have to carry the ships anymore,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
450,Teacher,"So what do you think, do you think based on what you've heard and read in the text you think finding one on the moon can be valuable",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,mm hmm so let's look at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
450,Chris,yeah definitely um yeah because then they wouldn't have to carry it all the way up there in the space shuttle they could just get it on the moon,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
450,Teacher,"Yes, I see how you found found you got to that",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,response so maybe you could add,,,,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,"Why you got there that you think, yes, it could be valuable and then some other supporting evidence for how",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,The water could be valuable,,,,remark,2,0,3
450,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,0,3
450,Oliver,"Oh yeah teacher, I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you for letting us know what we needed to work on and you gave me some ideas on how I could improve my answer",,,,response,2,0,3
450,Oliver,"Oh yeah me too actually cuz, then I realized that I could add some more details to my auntie to your meeting okay bye teacher",,,,response,2,0,3
450,Bennett,"All right, hey",,,,,2,0,3
452,Teacher,Hello everyone,,,,remark,0,1,3
452,All,Hello,,,,,0,1,3
452,Teacher,How are you doing today,,,,remark,0,1,3
452,Farrah,Oh we're great we're really excited to work with you,,,,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher," i'm here to give you the feedback that, for your responses about the study of water on the moon right so let's begin, are you guys ready to begin?",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher,Oh i'm excited to work with you to my name is Teacher and i'm here to discuss the feedback,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
452,Luis,um excuse me,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
452,Luis, I I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,"Really so let's begin with you, then, what do you know about space",,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
452,Luis,"Okay, well, I know a lot about space, I know all about the different planets and I know stuff about uhm stars that Milky Way the sun kind of all the all the big ones",,,140.1,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,"So so let's start with your response Luis, you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, I wonder what made you see that",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
452,Luis,um so what I was thinking as after scientists like astronauts on the moon trying to discover the water they can't do anything if they don't have oxygen tanks,,,230.1,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher, what does that make?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher,"Oh that's how you thought about it and there was a mention of oxygen in this article again if you guys remember reading the article, the article mentions hydrogen and oxygen",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
452,Luis,Water!,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,"Water yeah that's that makes water so um Chris said that scientists found creators, full of water on moon right is that what you read hi Chris",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
452,Chris,"yeah so they thought there wasn't water but it turns out the craters, they're full of water",,,230.3,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,"full of water, would you like to discuss this statement, whether your partner to make sure that what you're stating is not incorrect?",,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
452,Chris,Oh sure yeah I could do that,,,130.2,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,Who would you like to discuss it with,,,,remark,0,1,3
452,Chris,Oh i'll talk about it with Jazmin,,,,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,yeah sure I have a quick chat with Jazmin,,,,remark,0,1,3
452,Farrah,"um can I share my answer, while they're talking",,,,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,that's a good idea why don't you do that then,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
452,Farrah,"Okay, because I said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,so what kind of a,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher,"I think your answer is very close to what we're looking for, but i'm wondering what made you think that they would be needing a microscope",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher, how did they discover that they'd be requiring a microscope,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher,like how you define what it is microscopic,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher,so maybe you guys can go with the text again and try to find out how they've discovered the water was actually microscopic,,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher, would you want to think deeply about that or maybe,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher," Talk to Dave about it in the meanwhile Jazmin can answer because chip, it seems like Dave also so called the same thing as us",,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher,Coming let's come back to Jazmin then,,,,remark,0,1,3
452,Jazmin, I'm ready,,,,response,0,1,3
452,Jazmin,Okay,,,,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,Oh,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher," Chris, did you discuss your observation with Jazmin do you guys have an answer?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
452,Chris,"yeah okay so uhm Jazmin pointed out that it says, actually, that the ice deposits are really small so, even though I was picturing like these big lakes and pools of water, it sounds like it's not really like that",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,yeah that's that's a good like I really think that was a very fruitful discussion that you had with Jazmin so Jazmin how did you find out about that what What did you read that make you think that the water is not like giant deposits of water and instead it's something different,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
452,Jazmin,"And so I was focusing on paragraph two, because that's where I found my answer, so it says NASA send a small machine and that was my answer and then at the end of the paragraph, it says that the ice deposits are very small",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,"Oh yes, that is where exactly it says that the ice deposits are very small,",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher,so I think that's can take us back to what's Farrah and Oliver have been looking at,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher,"Farrah and Oliver, have found the answer to this entire question by now? would you like to share your answer?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
452,Oliver,"yeah I think we're still a little confused cuz we were thinking, how could you discover something if you can't even see it, why don't you need the microscope and order to find it because it's so small",,,110.1,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,that's a very good observation would anyone else in the class like to contribute to this discussion and like to answer what Oliver just said?,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,0,1,3
452,Luis,"Okay, so I know this because what the Lunar orbiter does it's kind of like a robot uhm and it's like it tells the astronaut where the water is so the don't the Lunar orbiter it doesn't even need to see it because it's a robot and uh yeah I think that's it",,,,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,"What do you guys think that does it sound like a good enough explanation, Farrah and Oliver?",,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
452,Oliver,"um, yeah that makes sense, but it didn't really say that in the story, so I don't think I would have known that if Luis didn't tell me",,,130.2,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,"Would you like to read the passage since we feel like the confusion is still there and let's read it together as a class and see what the passage says, Chris, yes, Chris?",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
452,Chris,"yeah well Actually, I have a comment it's that I, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,120.3,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,"You went to NASA that's really amazing, and I think your contribution is also valuable, but right now let's try to find out the answer to the question that we're looking for",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher,"So maybe if any one of you can volunteer to read passage 2 and as a class, we can try to figure out the answer to this question would like to volunteer for that",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin you can go ahead and do that",,,,remark,0,1,3
452,Jazmin,"Actually i'm really sorry I looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now, but before we go, I just wanted to say, I really appreciate how you asked us to look and explain how we How we found our answers, because that really made me think about how how to use the text to explain my thinking, and I think that's going to really help me in the future, so thank you Thank you so much",,,,response,0,1,3
452,Teacher,  Thank you so much,,,,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher,Thank you for having me today and I just don't want to hold you back so all of you can now it out for lunch,,,,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher,And thank you for sharing observation,,,,remark,0,1,3
452,Teacher,"Well i've reviewed all of your responses in detail and I noticed some very interesting patterns, so the aim of our discussion today is to Oliverelop your responses further oh hi yeah Luis you have a question",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Luis,yeah,,,150.1,response,1,1,3
452,Teacher,Go ahead,,,,remark,1,1,3
452,Luis,"Excuse me teacher ah, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"Oh, you you already know all about space that's really great maybe that's the reason why you should be in this group, because then you can help so many your peers learn so much more about space",,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,don't you think so,,,,remark,1,1,3
452,Luis,Oh,,,,response,1,1,3
452,Luis,yeah okay okay,,,,response,1,1,3
452,Teacher,stick with us and let's see what we can learn from each other as well,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"So, as we proceed with this discussion, I would want you to observe how you're thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay",,,530.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"So i'd like to start by asking some clarifying questions and said, even said that he knows a lot about the space i'd like to start with you Luis I think you had a very interesting thought, but i'd like to understand why you mentioned the use of oxygen tanks in response to this question",,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Luis,"Oh yeah sure Okay, because you know when you go in a space you can't breathe, so if you're thinking about equipment oxygen tanks are the most important ones",,,230.1,response,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"Oh Okay, so you made a connection between equipment and oxygen tanks interesting",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,let's see if we can reset refine your answer further,,,130.2,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"so Chris um tell me a little bit more about your response, what makes you think that the water, the creators are full of water",,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,With the help of your friends,,,,remark,1,1,3
452,Luis,"Because, in the first paragraph, it says scientists phone evidence or water can be found deep within the moon's pool recruiters and I know deep means like a lot of water, because when I go swimming in the deep side of the pool it's got like a lot of water",,,230.1,response,1,1,3
452,Teacher,so Farrah I noticed that you have mentioned microscope as your equipment,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"Oh, so you have made a connection between deep and pools, and then that makes you feel that there is going to be a lot of water on the moon interesting",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,Why did you do that,,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Farrah,"um well cuz um well, I was looking for a name of equipment and I was looking for a section where they're talking about finding water in in",,,230.1,response,1,1,3
452,Farrah,"In a paragraph three, it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it needed a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so that had all of the key words, so I don't understand where my answer is wrong",,,,response,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"Who okay let's figure out if it needs further refinement and I think Oliver you also answered the same as Farrah, so why don't you the three Farrah, Oliver and Chris have a quick chat with each other",,,130.2,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"to figure out what exactly is the quantity of water on the moon and share your response, with the class and then we dig deeper",,,,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,So you have like a quick moment to have a chat with each other and then share like Maybe you can reach a conclusion about the quantity of the water on the moon,,,130.2,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"So, are you guys ready to share back with the class",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,would like to go and answer them okay so,,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
452,Farrah,"um so I I told Chris, but um you hey we need the microscope total closely because there's not a lot of water it's a very little part of it, because it says microscopic",,,120.4,response,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"Chris, so does that clarify the quantity of the water for you",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,So,,,,remark,1,1,3
452,Chris,"I guess it can't be like full of water, since it's do you have to use a microscope to look at",,,,response,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"now let's take deeper Jazmin I really value, how you have made a reference to a machine that was sent to the moon",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"Okay, thank you, that was very gracious of you Farrah and Dave to have this discussion and to clarify this concern",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"so I would want all of you to look at paragraph two, and look for a specific name of the machine and how that machine is use to assess discovery",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,But my concern is that we still don't know its name and how it assisted in the discovery,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"Okay, I think I see it, would you like to share what you see",,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
452,Jazmin,Okay it's called a lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposits,,,120.4,response,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"Okay, so now we have the name of the machine and it looks for ice deposits, and can you make a connection to the microscope now Farrah",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
452,Farrah,Oh,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
452,Farrah,"Well Okay, if the Lunar orbiter looks for ice to pass it and the microscope looks at the water, I guess, they let the ice melt or something and then they look at it in the microscope",,,,response,1,1,3
452,Teacher,And it is at maybe and the deposits are optimized on the size of the deposit is microscopic,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"So, at the end of this entire activity i'd like to know if you feel that you have been able to answer this question in a more in more detail, yes Chris",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Chris,"it's not that question, but I was just thinking about some of the other equipment on the moon, and so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,150.1,response,1,1,3
452,Teacher,because we are right now looking for a very specific equipment in response to a question,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"yeah they definitely use a lot of equipment, though",,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,We perhaps would be focusing a lot more on the text that has been given to us in order to come up with a specific response to that question,,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,but thank you so much for sharing what you know about the equipment that is available at NASA,,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"So do you think all of you have a clear answer now, do you think our response has evolved to we can Can someone summarize the final answer for me in one clear statement",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah go ahead",,,,remark,1,1,3
452,Farrah,Oh okay um,,,,response,1,1,3
452,Farrah,The use of lunar orbiter to look for ice and then I use the microscope to look at the water,,,,response,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"Okay um would anyone, like to add to the response further would anyone like to even further refine savannas response",,,130.2,remark,1,1,3
452,Farrah,"Oh, my mind was going to be different, I was just gonna add on to mine that NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter",,,130.2,response,1,1,3
452,Farrah,To look for ice,,,,response,1,1,3
452,Teacher,"Okay um and how, yes, yes Oliver",,,,remark,1,1,3
452,Oliver,"yeah i'm sorry to interrupt teacher, but I was looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to goal, but thanks for taking time to work with us",,,,response,1,1,3
452,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,how's everyone doing today,,,,remark,2,1,3
452,Luis,um teacher,,,,response,2,1,3
452,Luis,I got this all figured out so i'm all good,,,,response,2,1,3
452,Teacher,yeah you so you feel you're all good,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
452,Luis,yeah yeah can I go,,,110.1,response,2,1,3
452,Teacher,yeah yeah why don't you go first i'd like to know,,,,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"that you have mentioned that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen so I want to understand how this is going to be valuable",,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
452,Luis,"Okay well oxygen you know we need oxygen to breathe like I told you, they can't breathe in space so that's valuable",,,230.1,response,2,1,3
452,Luis,"Hydrogen I don't know I just saw it in the story, and so I figured as important",,,,response,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"Okay, so you didn't does that make make you want to stay and listen to the responses of your friends now just to see if you can learn more about how hydrogen can be useful, and also to refine your answer further",,,220.1,remark,2,1,3
452,Luis,"Okay, I guess, so",,,220.1,response,2,1,3
452,Teacher,Thank you so much for staying um Oliver I read your response and you said no it's not ready yet what makes you say that,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
452,Oliver,"Okay cuz then we're talking about you know how how much it's going to cost and how much time it's going to take, and how they don't have that time so i'm like well",,,230.1,response,2,1,3
452,Oliver,that's not ready,,,,response,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"Oh OK, so I really value, how you have talked you have thought about all the costs that are going to be involved in this exploration, which is an important component in determining the value of any exploration",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,let's see if Farrah has anything different to say,,,130.2,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"so, why now, why do you think that we are not ready for this exploration for a long time",,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
452,Farrah,"On Okay, I mean it's kind of like what Oliver said Oh, but cuz at the end, it says like they need to come up with a plan, and it will take a lot of time and a lot of money, do you think you will be a good investment so i'm like Well, no, because it'll take a long time",,,120.4,response,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"Okay, so thank you so much for sharing your responses, I really value how both of you did until I know you have been able to identify reasons why it might not be a good idea for us to invest",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"In this explorations, but we cannot perhaps you know, come up with a final answer unless we also look at the benefits of water on the moon",,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"And I really value how Chris has talked about water being really heavy and it cannot be carried on ships anymore Chris, would you like it, yes samana",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
452,Farrah,i'm still confused,,,110.1,response,2,1,3
452,Teacher,Would you like to share more about your conclusion,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
452,Farrah,"Well yeah I mean cuz I thought that I answered the question you know where it said, could it be valuable and even at the bottom of the story, it asks do you think it would be a good investment, and so I said no, so I don't I don't understand why that's wrong",,,230.1,response,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"Okay, so i'm i'm going to make a suggestion on how we value investments towards the end of our investigation or discussion today, but I would in the in the meanwhile, I just want you to listen to why Chris and Jazmin have made some differences to the benefits of this",,,130.2,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"This exploration and then let's talk more about what makes an exploration valuable or not, is that okay Farrah",,,,remark,2,1,3
452,Bennett,Okay okay,,,,,2,1,3
452,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,Can you tell us why you have made a reference to the water being heavy and it's too heavy for the ships to begin what what's the benefit bike over here that you're trying to,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,identify,,,,remark,2,1,3
452,Chris,"Well, that was in the story, you talked about how heavy water is and so that they wouldn't have to take them on the on the spaceships anymore so um I mean I guess the benefit is like the spaceship will be lighter",,,,response,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"Okay, so you have identify a bit I identified a benefit that the spaceship would be lighter which is by, it is worth it for us to continue with this exploration",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,And Jazmin has also identified a benefit so let's hear what Jazmin had to say,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"Jazmin, why do you go ahead",,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,What,,,,remark,2,1,3
452,Jazmin,"We I don't remember what I said oh Oh, they can drink the water and stay hydrated yeah so you know we can't survive without water so that's why I think it's a benefit",,,,response,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"Okay, think it's a benefit because there is water on an astronaut's name need water for their hydration",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"So what i'm seeing over here, violence, looking at all the different responses that I have received from this group",,,,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"I really value how some of you have talked about the benefits of this exploration, whereas the other people like Dave and someone I have talked about the costs of this exploration",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"But my concern is that, right now, our responses do not encapsulate the benefits and costs together for us to be able",,,,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"To reach a final conclusion about this, so I would want to discuss the answer for the impairs and see how you can add the aspect of costs are the aspects of benefit to your question",,,430.2,remark,2,1,3
452,Chris,So I read there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so they probably are already spending a lot of money to build that and so,,,430.2,response,2,1,3
452,Chris,It would be probably important for them to have water on the moon base,,,,response,2,1,3
452,Chris,"yeah that sounds good, because then they can read, they could drink the water and they wouldn't have to like carry on the water, because what if they get more thirsty and they don't have enough water than they could like drink it on the moon",,,,response,2,1,3
452,Chris,Okay um,,,,response,2,1,3
452,Chris,I guess,,,,response,2,1,3
452,Chris,Oh yeah it,,,,response,2,1,3
452,Teacher,Was I was just asking,,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"i'm talking to all of you now, if you guys are done with your discussion would anyone like to share the refined response which takes all the costs and benefits into account, while answering the question is there convincing evidence that the water on the moon could be valuable",,,,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,Is anyone ready to share a more refined response,,,,remark,2,1,3
452,Jazmin,"I didn't make a response, yet, but I guess I can try",,,,response,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"Go ahead, why don't you um",,,,remark,2,1,3
452,Jazmin,Okay um,,,,response,2,1,3
452,Jazmin,Is there convincing evidence water,,,,response,2,1,3
452,Jazmin,"Yes, the water could be valuable because astronauts can drink the water, and then they don't have to carry it on the ships, so this",,,,response,2,1,3
452,Jazmin,And so it would be valuable to just have it on the moon,,,,response,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"Oh, the cost part",,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
452,Jazmin,And it's expensive but they're already spending a lot of money to do stuff on the moon anyway,,,230.1,response,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"Okay Thank you so much for sharing your response Jazmin I really value, how you have stated, the costs and benefits and stated your own personal opinion at the end",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"Based on what evidence, you have been able to collect Is there anyone else would like to add to the response that Jazmin has made",,,130.2,remark,2,1,3
452,Teacher,yesterday,,,,remark,2,1,3
452,Oliver,"As well not to add to it, but I was just looking at the clock on it's time for us to go to lunch, but I want to say thank you for",,,,response,2,1,3
452,Oliver,"kind of really making me feel valued with my ideas, because at first, I thought that when you asked her son and Jazmin but you were going to say that man Farrah were wrong, but then you said that we had some ideas, too, and so, how we could kind of you know, put everything together",,,,response,2,1,3
452,Oliver,"Until I give me some ideas on how I can build mice my new answer, even though I don't have it yet",,,,response,2,1,3
452,Teacher,"Okay i'm really glad that my suggestion of building on each other's ideas and evaluating the cost in like you know evaluating this costs and benefits together has been valuable for you, as a group",,,,remark,2,1,3
452,,Oliver,,,,,2,1,3
453,Teacher,hi everybody,,,,remark,0,1,4
453,Farrah,Oh Hello,,,,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Did you guys like the reading about the water on the moon, what did you think about it?",,,140.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,0,1,4
453,Luis,Oh yeah i'm excuse me um I shouldn't be in this group already know all about space,,,,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Do you, what do you, what is your most what's your best fact that you have about space that you want to share with all of us?",,,140.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Luis,"Oh well, my favorite um fact about space is that there used to be nine planets but then they kicked Pluto out of the planet club because he was too small",,,140.1,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,I know I kind of feel bad for Pluto don't you?,,,140.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Luis,yeah me too,,,140.1,response,0,1,4
453,Luis,It pretty much stinks when you're a planet and then you get demoted,,,,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"So maybe Luis, you can kind of help us here, then",,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher," You can maybe be our expert in the group and help the rest of us, what do you think about that?",,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
453,Luis,That sounds awesome,,,110.3,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Okay, great alright, so how about the rest of us, what was the most interesting part of the reading that you guys read?",,,140.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"What did you like the most, Chris?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Chris,"Oh, well I thought it was just amazing how the scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,140.1,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Right there's water on the moon super interesting and what does that mean? Now that they found water on the moon, what can happen up there?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,Or what do scientists think we'll be able to do one day?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Jazmin, what do you think?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Jazmin,"If there's water on the moon,",,,120.4,response,0,1,4
453,Jazmin,Maybe astronauts in the future could drink that water or maybe there could even be life on the moon,,,,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Alright, do you think maybe one day we could live on the moon?",,,140.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Jazmin,I don't know it's kind of amazing to think about,,,140.1,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Chris, you too?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,Luis I know you do right?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,I know,,,140.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher, Do any of you think you would like to one day live on the moon? What do you think?,,,140.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Alright, so can we look at some of the questions that you answered about what you've read about the moon?",,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Okay, so we were asked what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,So what do you think the most important words in that question are? What words are kind of giving us clues as to the answer that they want?,,,420.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Farrah, what do you think?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Farrah,"Okay, well, I thought the most important word would be equipment",,,420.1,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Awesome, yes equipment right",,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher," So now we know that the answer that we're looking for is going to be a piece of equipment, right?",,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Jazmin, what do you think",,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,Okay somebody else tell me what word they thought was really important in that question to kind of give us a clue to what the answer should be,,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Jazmin,"I was thinking, maybe discover",,,120.4,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"And how about you Oliver? What word do you think is real important in that question, to give us that clue to find the right answer?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,Okay yeah discover good,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Oliver,"um well, I thought equipment also um like Farrah did um but I guess another important word would probably be water",,,120.4,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher," What other words, do you think it's going to help us to figure out exactly what the question is asking",,,420.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher, Luis?,,,420.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,Good all right,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"and I can see one other word in that question that gives us a clue as to, or is going to help us figure out what we're looking",,,420.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Luis,um maybe scientists,,,420.1,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Okay scientist, or I can see a better one",,,130.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"What do you think, Luis?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Luis,"Hmm what equipment, ok we had equipment, did scientists use to discover water well I guess really the only good word left is moon",,,120.4,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Okay, so now we have all of these big important words that we need to use to figure out what the answer is going to be so we know the answer is going to be a piece of equipment right and it's the piece of equipment that was used to discover it",,,210.2,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,Is moon right,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,Go ahead Farrah,,,,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Alright, so does anybody want to take a guess after looking at those keywords what we're going to use or what was used to discover?",,,120.2,remark,0,1,4
453,Farrah,"Okay, so um my answer it was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and um I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Well, what okay so let's think about a microscope what do we use a microscope to do Farrah you just said it a minute ago but let's repeat it, what do you",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,What do you use a microscope for,,,,remark,0,1,4
453,Farrah,To look at really small things,,,,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"right to look at really small things, but if we're trying to look at something on the moon right because the moon is huge and we're trying to find it",,,410.3,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"so what might be a better tool to look at the big picture, instead of the little picture that the microscope is going to show us",,,120.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"On the moon, so we don't want to look at the little piece, we want to look at the big piece",,,,remark,0,1,4
453,Farrah,Oh um,,,120.1,response,0,1,4
453,Farrah,"I guess i'm not sure I really thought microscope was the main piece of equipment, since I was looking for equipment",,,,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"but we want to find the look at the big moon to find the water, not the tiny pieces of of water",,,410.3,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"So Chris, what do you think",,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Right, well, I could totally see why you would think that, Farrah, right because you were looking for equipment, something that's going to help us look at water",,,310.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Chris,"Okay, well, I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,120.4,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Okay So did we we read about those things in the paragraphs, though? Did they talk about that in the paragraph?",,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"No, so they definitely use those things but we're trying to find the information from the paragraph, so what other pieces of equipment did they talk about in the paragraph? Jazmin",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Jazmin,yeah so they talked about a small machine and that was my answer,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"A small machine will, what was the name of the small machine",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Jazmin,Oh,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
453,Jazmin,Let me look,,,,response,0,1,4
453,Jazmin, It says lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher, Does anybody think that lunar orbiter might be the right answer or might be the piece of equipment that was needed in order to find the water on the moon?,,,130.2,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,A lunar orbiter,,,130.2,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"Luis, why do you think that's the right answer",,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Luis,"um yeah so I totally agree with Jazmin here as the space expert in the group, and I think it's right because",,,230.1,response,0,1,4
453,Luis,"Well lunar means moon an orbiter means like it goes around and what you were saying about like the big picture of the whole moon if it's an orbiter it would find the water like on the whole thing, and not just on the teeny little pieces under the microscope",,,,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,Right very good,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,Farrah do you understand,,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
453,Teacher,"go ahead Farrah, what were you going to say?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
453,Farrah,"yeah yeah I was gonna say that does make more sense than it did before, but also, I just looked at the clock and",,,150.1,response,0,1,4
453,Farrah,"We actually have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for helping those break this question down into the key words, i'm going to use that next time I have a question like this, so thank you",,,,response,0,1,4
453,Teacher,you're welcome Farrah it was so nice to see you guys Have a nice lunch,,,,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher,Hey everyone,,,,remark,0,1,4
455,Farrah,Hello,,,,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher, Can you remind me which part you and Farrah circled again?,,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"So Oliver, you told me you circled the same answer as Farrah",,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Oliver,Um yeah we both circled the microscope,,,120.4,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,The microscope great,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
455,Luis,"um excuse me, I I have something to say",,,110.1,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"Sure, what do you want to say, Luis?",,,,remark,0,1,4
455,Luis,"Well, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,You know all about space?,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
455,Luis,yeah sure do,,,110.1,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"yeah I see you have great observations and can we think, can we help Farrah and Oliver figure out their answer first?",,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
455,Luis,Oh yeah okay,,,110.1,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"Sure, thank you for your patience",,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"So, Farrah and Oliver, you find out -circled the microscope, right?",,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
455,Oliver,yeah,,,110.1,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,Can you tell me more about how the microscope helped the scientists?,,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
455,Oliver,"um yeah okay so um when they found a water, well the ice actually was frozen water, it was ice",,,230.1,response,0,1,4
455,Oliver," When they found is it was so small, it was tiny and they couldn't see it without the microscope so they needed the microscope to be able to see it",,,230.1,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"So you just told me when the scientists found the ice already, and then they couldn't see it",,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"So our question is what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon, which is how they found it at first, right?",,,210.2,remark,0,1,4
455,Oliver,"Oh, I didn't even realize I said that",,,210.2,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"Yeah, but you know it",,,110.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher, Why do they need to microscope again?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"So let's dive in a little deeper about what exactly do they first use to find it, and then they can use the microscope to see it",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Oliver,"Oh, because the ice is so small",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"Yes, the ice is so small",,,110.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher,So Jazmin you told me that NASA sent a small machine right?,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
455,Jazmin,"Yes, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,110.1,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"I feel you have a great evidence, can you tell me more about this machine?",,,230.1,remark,0,1,4
455,Jazmin,"Oh yeah let me look okay in the story, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,230.1,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,mm hmm so the name of this machine is lunar orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Jazmin,Lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"yeah great and, what is this machine for?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Jazmin,"Well, it says to investigate, so I guess it maybe looks around because that's what investigate means",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"yeah and that's how this little machine, the small machine works right?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Jazmin,"yeah, I guess so, so it looks around the moon and somehow I don't really know how but somehow it finds those those microscopic ice deposits",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,Farrah can you help Jazmin out?,,,130.2,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher,What do you think? How the Lunar orbiter helps to find the little ice deposits?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Farrah,i'm not really sure I didn't really get that part about the Lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
455,Farrah, I guess I was still thinking about the microscope,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher," Chris, can you help us read the sentence about lunar orbiter?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher,Why don't we look at it all together right now,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Chris, This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
455,Chris, These ice deposits are very small,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
455,Chris,"Oh yeah I could do that Okay, so it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"Great, thank you for reading for us",,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher, Um Farrah,,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher," do you have more, a little more idea about lunar orbiter right now?",,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
455,Farrah, Is that right?,,,150.1,response,0,1,4
455,Farrah,So I guess it just it looks in the craters,,,150.1,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,yeah it looks into craters,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher, Why do you think we call it an orbiter?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"Luis, do you know why they call it an orbiter?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Luis,yeah I was just gonna jump in because I definitely know this one,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
455,Luis, Orbiter means like to go around,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
455,Luis,"And so i'm thinking, the orbiter goes around the moon",,,,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,Yeah and we know that the ice are in the polar crater,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher," Chris, what do you want to say?",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Chris,yeah well actually I I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,Great and Luis talked about the oxygen tanks right?,,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
455,Luis,yeah,,,230.3,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,Those are all great knowledge or information about scientists and scientists use a lot of different equipments for different purposes right?,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
455,Luis,"yeah like they need the oxygen tanks, because they can't go find water on the moon without the oxygen tanks or they couldn't breathe",,,210.3,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,So oxygen tanks help the scientists breathe,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher, But what exactly helped the scientists find the water?,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
455,Luis,"um well, I guess I said oxygen tanks because I was kind of thinking it would help them find the water, because it would help them breathe",,,210.3,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"yeah that's part of it, but there's also right now the small machine that we are thinking about right now right?",,,130.1,remark,0,1,4
455,Luis,Right yeah the orbiter,,,130.1,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"If we have oxygen but not this small machine, the Lunar orbiter, can we find the ice?",,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
455,Luis,Oh no no,,,210.3,response,0,1,4
455,Luis,You can't find it without the orbiter,,,,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"yeah, so we need them both",,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher,and the Lunar orbiter is specifically for this purpose right?,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Luis,yeah okay that makes so much sense,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"You got it now, Luis?",,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
455,Luis, I can see why the orbiter is a better answer yeah than the oxygen tanks,,,150.1,response,0,1,4
455,Luis,yeah I got it now,,,150.1,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher,Great work,,,110.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher,"And Chris, what did you just tell me about the -what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon?",,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Chris,"yeah well just listening to what you said to Luis I see how all the cool stuff at NASA it helps the scientists, but it does it do the finding of the water",,,120.4,response,0,1,4
455,Teacher, Oliver,,,110.4,remark,0,1,4
455,Teacher, what do you want to add?,,,110.4,remark,0,1,4

457,Luis,"um yeah well I I shouldn't be in this room, because I already know all about space",,,140.1,response,0,0,
457,Teacher,"You know I know you know about space, I saw your response, about the oxygen tanks, which is awesome because",,,110.3,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"You know the thing that stuck out at me when I think about space room, I remember when I was your age was thoses gold helmets you remember those",,,140.1,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"Like they've got to put a little gold on their helmets and the sunlight doesn't get it, they kind of use all sorts of stuff so",,,,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"um you know today we're just going to have a little conversation and yeah i'd love for you to bring in all that outside knowledge, because",,,150.1,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,so let's take a look at some of your answers Luis and we actually started with you um you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,230.3,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"This is it really is one of my favorite topics, especially when I was your age",,,140.1,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"Is there is there any other equipment, you know off the top of your head that they use",,,120.1,remark,0,0,
457,Luis,"Oh there's tons of equipment well, they have the oxygen tanks and while they have to have a rocket ship if they're going to make it to space they use all sorts of things in that rocket ship, they have to have on the gross astronauts astronaut food there's so much stuff that they use",,,120.1,response,0,0,
457,Teacher,I know that food is pretty gross I want to bring you into Congress and you should with Chris because Chris raised a good point in his,,,130.2,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"answer too, he said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, so they used all the that equipment and the eating that terrible food",,,230.3,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"And they they used all that over a course of you know, probably many months, and they and they somehow found",,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher," I'm curious Chris, do you remember any actual equipment that they use",,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher, Do you remember how they found the water in those craters,,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"Water in those craters which is really exciting, because when I was your age, we didn't even know that there was water in craters on anywhere",,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Chris,Oh well,,,210.4,response,0,0,
457,Chris,"I don't know if i'm a Brit from the reading, but I I went to NASA and so I I also know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,0,0,
457,Teacher,"yeah that's great, in fact, those things, I think, if I remember right they were like 200 pounds or something, but you don't feel it when you're bouncing around on the moon right because the gravity is different",,,140.1,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher," Oliver, can you explain a little bit more about that for me",,,230.1,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,Well let's talk about Farrah's and Oliver's response of what they circled because they were talking about microscopes,,,230.1,remark,0,0,
457,Oliver,um yeah,,,230.1,response,0,0,
457,Oliver," Okay, so when they found the water um well actually what I use, and it was really, really tiny um and so they couldn't see it with just their eyes, they had to see with the microscope",,,230.1,response,0,0,
457,Teacher,"mm hmm that's right and Farrah you are, you are thinking, the same thing right",,,230.1,remark,0,0,
457,Farrah,yeah so I don't understand why our answer is wrong,,,230.1,response,0,0,
457,Teacher,"I don't think your answer is wrong so much as it might be the way I was thinking about so here, so I actually just bought my own kids",,,110.2,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher, Have you ever used the microscope before,,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"Mike, their first microscopes my wife's a scientist and then we bought them their first microscope and watching them using microscopes they have to take something they already have and put it on the slides and then look and look into",,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Farrah,yeah we have them in the science lab oh,,,210.4,response,0,0,
457,Teacher,"yeah awesome so I guess what i'm wondering is, if you have to use the microscope and you, you have that already have something available to put on those slides",,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,And so i'm wondering how did they get that water in the first place that actually maybe brings us to Jazmin,,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"Jazmin, you said that NASA sent a small machine to go get that water",,,230.3,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,And then maybe that's how they brought it back to use the microscopes or maybe they haven't even gotten to that part yet,,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"and do you think Jazmin, can you explain a little bit more about what you were thinking",,,230.1,remark,0,0,
457,Jazmin,yeah so I read in the story that NASA send a small machine,,,230.1,response,0,0,
457,Jazmin,And they used it to go in the craters,,,,response,0,0,
457,Jazmin,and find the water well the ice,,,,response,0,0,
457,Teacher,"that's really interesting I was on the, does everybody have their reading in front of them",,,,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,yeah I want to take a look at that article again that water on the moon article that piece from it says,,,120.3,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"adapted from the New York Times that piece you read, I want you to go back, but I want to see if we can flesh out what Jazmin's talking about here",,,120.3,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"This small machine, so we've talked about other machines, but I think she's thinking about the one that actually like got",,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"The water or identified the water so let's all go back to that text and i'm going to give you just a few few seconds, maybe 30 seconds",,,120.3,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"and see what you can find, see if we can go a little a little deeper okay so see if you can identify that small machine that she's talking about let's get started",,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"Okay, my stopwatch is actually broken, but since you're all looking at me i'm gonna assume you're out then Chris, what did you find when you went back to the text to figure out what this small machine was anf, and how they actually maybe got that water",,,120.4,remark,0,0,
457,Chris,"Okay, so well I looked through the word machine",,,120.4,response,0,0,
457,Chris,Since that's what Jazmin was talking about next to that it says lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,0,
457,Teacher,A lunar orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher," What are those that's a that's a really big well phrase it's two words ,but what what is the Lunar orbiter what do we think that might mean? Luis",,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Luis,"um yeah so lunar means moon, so you guys anytime you see the word lunar it means they're talking about the moon and orbiter as like well an orbit is when something goes around something else so i'm thinking as machine those around them",,,210.4,response,0,0,
457,Teacher,"I think that is, I think that is an excellent definition and that actually makes me think of something different that maybe helps my understanding",,,110.1,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"Maybe this machine, the small machine this lunar orbiter as Chris said wasn't actually going into the crater maybe it was just going around the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,"But that's a little bit of a problem if it's going around the moon, and not actually going in the crater how, how does it find the ice it's in the crater",,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher, Farrah do you have any thoughts on that,,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Farrah,I don't,,,210.4,response,0,0,
457,Farrah,I don't think it explains it in the story,,,,response,0,0,
457,Farrah,"It just said, the Lunar orbiter looks for the deposits in the crater",,,,response,0,0,
457,Teacher,"Oh yeah you're absolutely right i've seen that line, it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits",,,120.3,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,In the large polar crater,,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher, Remember polar is like the top and the bottom just kind of like the North Pole but you're right it actually doesn't talk about at least in that paragraph how the Lunar orbiter works right,,,210.4,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,So i'm wondering i'm wondering at this point i'm,,,,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher," Oliver yeah, thank you",,,120.3,remark,0,0,
457,Teacher,i'm wondering let's go back to that question can somebody read the question that we were supposed to answer again,,,120.3,remark,0,0,
457,Oliver,"um well actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to and valuing all of our answers",,,120.3,response,0,0,
457,Teacher,hi everyone how are you my name is Teacher you can use my first name Is Teacher,,,,remark,1,0,
457,Luis,um excuse me Teacher yeah um I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,"Do I do i'm sure you do, you probably know a lot more about space and idea my son is actually named Luis as well, so I feel like we got that connection already what's um I don't know when I was your age I loved space, so I was particularly excited to read this article",,,110.3,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"Before we get into the nitty gritty I just want to hear your others, how are y'all doing today",,,,remark,1,0,
457,Jazmin,i'm doing good,,,,response,1,0,
457,Oliver,"i'm great thanks thanks I, I want to say, Mr Teacher thanks Teacher",,,,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,yeah you're welcome,,,,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,Farrah how are you yeah,,,,remark,1,0,
457,Farrah,i'm good to it's pretty good day,,,,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,"that's good and Chris it's nice to meet you well let's take a look at the article that we have here again, it is on spaces eaten pointed out, which I find super exciting Luis find super exciting",,,210.4,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,I know we had a question to start us off that was I don't know Can someone read the question that we were trying to answer before we got in this group,,,120.3,remark,1,0,
457,Chris,yeah it was on one equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,Oh great,,,,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"And what do you think are the before we even look at the article again, I know you read the article already",,,,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"But before we even look at the article again and start our discussion, what do you think are the I don't know, maybe two or three keywords in that question things that really got you got you thinking",,,210.2,remark,1,0,
457,Chris,"Oh, I figured it was about like discovering and water on the moon",,,210.2,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,"yeah great so discover's a keyword and waters, the keyword,",,,110.4,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"and I mean we're talking about the moon right we got to know where we're talking about so it's not all of spaces it's about the moon in particular ours is there, maybe one other yes Farrah",,,210.2,remark,1,0,
457,Farrah,I think equipments an important word,,,110.4,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,"I agree, and Jazmin did you want to add to that well",,,110.1,remark,1,0,
457,Jazmin,that's what I was gonna say too,,,110.1,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,Okay awesome so i'm just making a little list here and know if you can see my paper but i'm writing those keywords on the site equipment discover,,,,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,water,,,,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,so who wants to start us off by how they answered this question,,,120.4,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"And moon, so I want to make sure that my answers to those questions incorporate all of those components",,,510.1,remark,1,0,
457,Jazmin,um okay i'll go cuz I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,120.4,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,Okay well sure let's let's um once you give me your answer and we'll talk about it,,,120.4,remark,1,0,
457,Jazmin,"Okay, I said NASA send a small machine and I think that's right",,,120.4,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,"You know I think you're I think you're right on track is there, if you look at the article, do you have the article with you",,,130.1,remark,1,0,
457,Jazmin,ya it's on my tablet,,,130.1,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,"Okay, good if you look at the article, can you point to the spot of the article where it talks about NASA spending, excuse me, sending not spending sending a small machine",,,230.2,remark,1,0,
457,Jazmin,"yeah if the first sentence of the second paragraph, where it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,230.2,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,"Perfect so your answer you wrote down your answer NASA send a small machine, if you are going to level that up like a video game, if you just want to like little extra boost to your answer, how might you get a little bit more clarity there",,,210.3,remark,1,0,
457,Jazmin,More clarity um level it,,,210.3,response,1,0,
457,Jazmin,I guess I can add more and more words make it a longer answer,,,,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,that's true that's true um What if you were to name that machine,,,420.2,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,does that machine have a name,,,210.3,remark,1,0,
457,Jazmin,Oh yeah yeah okay I didn't think about that,,,210.3,response,1,0,
457,Jazmin,I could just put the whole sentence down I could say NASA sent a small machine called the orbiter to investigate,,,,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,"yeah and you know, I think that um you know I wouldn't always put down the whole sentence, but I think in this situation that actually works, because to investigate",,,,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"kind of answers that question right to to discover water on the moon, and then you named it, I think that might be that might be",,,210.2,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"That might be a way to to add, as I was talking about earlier clarity, just to just to make it a little bit",,,,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,I noticed Farrah and it looks like Oliver both of you talked about um,,,,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,Clearer a little bit sharper in terms of understanding what that small machine is because,,,310.1,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"Well, I don't know if i'd call it a machine, but you, you talked about a scientific tool right",,,230.3,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,do you want to tell me a little bit more about that oh,,,230.1,remark,1,0,
457,Oliver,I think it's a machine because it's like a simple machine that has parts to it that work together so I think so,,,,response,1,0,
457,Farrah,yeah I'll go yeah I thought it was the microscope um cuz that's That was the well yeah I don't know if it's a machine either,,,230.3,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,yeah no I think you know I don't know what the technical definition is of a machine,,,,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"But i'm wondering if so let's go back to that question again what equipment, so we want to make sure I answer has equipment discover water great",,,420.2,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"And you talked about equipment, I think a microscope is certainly an equipment,",,,310.1,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"what about that discover component, do you think the microscope would help NASA discover the water like actually find it",,,210.3,remark,1,0,
457,Oliver,"Ah, I guess not",,,,response,1,0,
457,Farrah,oh yeah I guess not,,,310.1,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,hmm because thinking about Jazmin's answer she's talking about lunar orbiter and i'm wondering if what i'd love to hear your thoughts what's the difference between a lunar orbiter and a microscope in terms of what they do for the scientists,,,210.3,remark,1,0,
457,Farrah,Oh,,,210.3,response,1,0,
457,Farrah,well,,,,response,1,0,
457,Farrah,i'm just gonna read it,,,,response,1,0,
457,Oliver,I don't know Farrah so you can,,,,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,Oh yeah that's a good idea,,,310.1,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"Well, where are you looking right now Farrah",,,,remark,1,0,
457,Farrah,um well where Jazmin's answer was in the second paragraph there,,,,response,1,0,
457,Farrah,It says the Lunar orbiter to investigate land up the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits,,,,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,"mm hmm that's true and where's Oliver Do you remember, where the microscope part was",,,230.2,remark,1,0,
457,Oliver,yeah that's in paragraph three um it's they use the microscope to look at the water,,,230.2,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,"Ah, the the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it",,,,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"You wouldn't need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,",,,210.4,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,I totally see where you're coming from on the microscope part I think my um,,,310.1,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"You know I i'm glad you caught the tool component, but i'm a little bit concerned that the i'm not sure that they would have the microscope with them, I think they're saying they wouldn't need it",,,410.3,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,what do you think,,,150.1,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"If if they had it already, but in terms of actually finding it the first time, I think that might go back to that lunar orbiter idea,",,,130.3,remark,1,0,
457,Oliver,um yeah I I could see that yeah I could see that because maybe they don't they don't have it yet,,,150.1,response,1,0,
457,Oliver,"You know I mean I don't know I don't know as much about space as Chris it done, but I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,yeah that's perfect in fact that that brings us over to eton's point in in Chris your point about science is finding craters full of moon on the water,,,110.1,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,um let me talk to first talk to you Chris and i'll get to your point eaten about the oxygen tanks,,,,remark,1,0,
457,Chris,yeah,,,110.2,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,"Chris, when you said in your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon, I think you're totally right they did and that's so exciting right",,,110.2,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"um I mean when I was a boy we didn't think there was water on the moon at all, but now, now we do, how do you um",,,,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,Do you remember that part of the article I wonder if you can go back to the article and find me a spot where they're talking about that process of finding,,,420.3,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,What are your thoughts about how the scientists actually found,,,210.3,remark,1,0,
457,Chris,"Okay, how they found it they found evidence that water can be found craters are dark places NASA sent a small machine",,,420.3,response,1,0,
457,Chris,You know what I don't know case it says that they send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate right,,,,response,1,0,
457,Chris,lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposit,,,,response,1,0,
457,Chris,So I guess,,,,response,1,0,
457,Chris,"I guess the Lunar orbiter is what they use to look for the ice deposits, I mean I can't tell if they found it or not, though",,,,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,huh you know I actually thought that was a little bit strange too I was thinking did they send the Lunar orbiter to find the water or after they already found it,,,,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher, Totally right,,,130.3,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"But the article, at least to me wasn't entirely clear which made me think the best answer would be probably the Lunar the Lunar orbiter because oh hang on just a second Oliver I wanted to talk about Luis's note Luis's answer on the oxygen tanks",,,130.3,remark,1,0,
457,Oliver,"Teacher and I don't mean to interrupt you, but it's time for us to go to lunch",,,130.3,response,1,0,
457,Oliver,oh well yeah we could finish on when we come back from lunch,,,,response,1,0,
457,Teacher,"Oh,",,,,remark,1,0,
457,Teacher,"Okay, that sounds great thanks for reminding me Oliver",,,,remark,1,0,
457,Oliver,you're welcome okay see you later,,,,response,1,0,
457,Jazmin,Teacher Can you see us,,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"No, unfortunately I can't",,,,remark,2,0,
457,Jazmin,"Okay, let me",,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"Oh wait, yes, I can i'm sorry I was looking in the Web browser i'm sorry",,,,remark,2,0,
457,Jazmin,Okay,,,,response,2,0,
457,Jazmin,hi,,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,hi how was lunch,,,,remark,2,0,
457,Jazmin,"It was good, we had lasagne and chocolate chip cookies",,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"Oh, I like that I love chocolate chip cookies well we don't have a lot of time, so let's try to finish this up before the bell rings okay Luis we were chatting with you so Luis yeah do you want to start us off yeah",,,,remark,2,0,
457,Luis,yeah cuz I think I got this all figured out so I'm all good,,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"Okay well well, what did you figure out a bit curious to hear",,,230.1,remark,2,0,
457,Luis,"Okay cuz I heard you tell him i'm Farrah and and mmm that we have to hit all the words in the question, like",,,230.1,response,2,0,
457,Luis,equipment and,,,,response,2,0,
457,Luis,discover and water on the moon,,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"And water on the moon okay i'm go back, could you go back to your first answer for me um when you answer that question, what was the what how did you first answer it",,,120.4,remark,2,0,
457,Luis,I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen thing,,,120.4,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,I just want to make sure that you understand why oxygen tanks might not be the best answer for this question can you explain your thinking a little bit,,,230.1,remark,2,0,
457,Teacher,"yep that's true so you're right in that they do use a lot of equipment and oxygen tanks were mentioned in the text,",,,310.1,remark,2,0,
457,Luis,"Okay, so",,,310.1,response,2,0,
457,Luis,"it's not right, because um equipment",,,,response,2,0,
457,Luis,"discover water, the moon",,,,response,2,0,
457,Luis,"Because it doesn't hit the discovery part but I got the equipment and the water on the moon, I think",,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"yeah I think you're spot on so how might you change your answer the second time if we could scribble that one out and you could write a new answer, what do you think you would say that hits that discover part as well",,,210.3,remark,2,0,
457,Luis,um Jazmin's answer?,,,210.3,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,Oh yeah Jazmin What was your answer again,,,120.4,remark,2,0,
457,Jazmin,um NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,120.4,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"hmm OK OK, I see that um Chris so we'll pick up on your point Luis for just a minute on a table that for a moment here so i'm gonna go back to you, you were talking about how scientists that scientists did find craters full of water on the moon",,,,remark,2,0,
457,Teacher,Tell me a little bit more about that,,,230.1,remark,2,0,
457,Teacher,because we're gonna make sure answer touches not only discover water and lewd but also equipment and my concern is your answer might not including the equipment component,,,410.2,remark,2,0,
457,Chris,What do you want me to tell you,,,230.1,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"Oh, I was wondering if you can tell me a little bit more about how so scientists found craters full of water in the moon",,,120.2,remark,2,0,
457,Chris,"Oh, oh yeah um so",,,120.2,response,2,0,
457,Chris,"When I was looking after we talked about it, I think it's Jazmin's answer too",,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,yeah you see that as well it's a I think let's do this let's take a moment let's take a moment I want you to look at your original answers,,,,remark,2,0,
457,Teacher,"you all have those in front of you right take a look at your original answers, and I want you to make sure see if you can check these boxes off equipment discover water and move",,,420.2,remark,2,0,
457,Teacher,"And if not, which component is missing missing I think even did a really good job of identifying which component was missing from his",,,310.1,remark,2,0,
457,Jazmin,i'm still kind of confused,,,310.1,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"Okay, what are you confused about Jazmin",,,230.1,remark,2,0,
457,Jazmin,"Well, I I thought that I I fixed my answer so now I have everything in it",,,230.1,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,I just want to make sure that you see all four components in there as well,,,120.2,remark,2,0,
457,Teacher,"I think you're right, I think you do,",,,110.4,remark,2,0,
457,Jazmin,Okay,,,110.4,response,2,0,

457,Jazmin,Okay,,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,Okay i'll give you another couple seconds everybody look up when you're done,,,,remark,2,0,
457,Teacher,"Okay i'm not sure if this is possible, but can we talked with elbow partners here i'm going to have one group of two and one group of three so Chris",,,,remark,2,0,
457,Chris,uh huh,,,130.2,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"Oliver and Farrah can the three of you chat for a minute and share, about what you discovered when you looked at your answers and then Jazmin and Luis can you do that as well",,,130.2,remark,2,0,
457,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,
457,Chris,Oh,,,,response,2,0,
457,Chris,I oh I usually talk to Jazmin and Luis if that's okay,,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,i'm sure that's fine,,,,remark,2,0,
457,Chris,"Okay, so um I had y'all I had equipment know I had to discovering in the waterpark but I didn't have equipment",,,,response,2,0,
457,Luis,"oh well um I had um just equipment crates I didn't really read the whole, the whole thing",,,,response,2,0,
457,Jazmin,"And in my answer that I did I I realized that I had all of the parts, but I didn't mention the water",,,,response,2,0,
457,Farrah,"Okay Oh, we have, we have the same answer So what did you get",,,,response,2,0,
457,Oliver,equipment and water and I guess it wasn't discovered because we there was found in our but I guess I didn't really have find in our answer,,,,response,2,0,
457,Farrah,um ya i had the same thing,,,,response,2,0,
457,Farrah,So did you change your answer,,,,response,2,0,
457,Farrah,oh okay well then I didn't I didn't have anything new online either,,,,response,2,0,
457,Oliver,um no not yet,,,,response,2,0,
457,Farrah,me and Oliver are,,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,Okay you all done?,,,,remark,2,0,
457,Teacher,"Okay, great Jazmin and Luis Chris?",,,,remark,2,0,
457,Jazmin,yeah yeah we're done,,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,Okay just humor me just a minute I want you to take one minute I want you to answer the question again so remember the question is what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon go ahead and write your answer down right your new answer down,,,120.1,remark,2,0,
457,Chris,You know I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,120.1,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,That it's pretty amazing,,,110.3,remark,2,0,
457,Luis,That would be pretty cool,,,110.3,response,2,0,

457,Chris,Oh,,,120.2,response,2,0,
457,Jazmin,"Okay, mine was pretty easy",,,,response,2,0,
457,Jazmin,I just had to add one part,,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,Alright Luis it looks like oh hang on just a second i'm sorry Chris I didn't mean to interrupt you did you have a question Chris?,,,,remark,2,0,
457,Chris,i'm not really sure if I did mine right but I'll wait,,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,Okay sounds good we'll just wait till everybody's done,,,,remark,2,0,
457,Farrah,Ya I'm finished,,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,Right Farrah you done now,,,,remark,2,0,
457,Teacher,"Excellent Chris why don't you start us off, how would you answer that question now that we've had a chance to explore it a little bit",,,120.4,remark,2,0,
457,Chris,"Okay, well, I said um scientists found craters for water on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter",,,120.4,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"Okay that's that's an answer, how about you Luis What did you say",,,110.1,remark,2,0,
457,Luis,I just use Jazmin's machine that NASA centers small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the water on the moon,,,110.1,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"Okay Oliver and Farrah sorry, you know both both kind of speaking same time Oliver let's doyou first and then Farrah",,,120.4,remark,2,0,
457,Oliver,"Okay um so I wasn't sure, but I heard Chris and Luis saying that Jazmin's  answer was right, so I I said um NASA sent the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon",,,120.4,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"Okay, and how about you Farrah",,,110.1,remark,2,0,
457,Farrah,"Oh, I said that you need well I kind of cuz I thought that maybe my answer itself was Okay, so I just scratched out the microscope and put in the Lunar orbiter you need a scientific tool, called the Lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon",,,110.1,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"what I want to know is, if we added if we did a completely new question, would you be able to find it in the text so here i'm going to give you a new question if you need to write down the question go ahead and write down the question you ready?",,,520.1,remark,2,0,
457,Teacher,"I think you're on the right track,",,,130.1,remark,2,0,
457,Teacher,Oh okay here's the new question where will this orbiter land,,,,remark,2,0,
457,Teacher,"So go ahead and take a moment take a look at the text, if you need to then go ahead and write your answers down",,,,remark,2,0,
457,Teacher,"And I would say, I would add, try to be as specific as possible",,,420.2,remark,2,0,
457,Oliver,Okay i'm done,,,420.2,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"Okay, great",,,,remark,2,0,
457,Teacher,Everybody can look up when they're done,,,,remark,2,0,
457,Oliver,Uh oh Teacher it's time for us to go to our next class,,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"Okay, thanks for letting me know Oliver is a pleasure working with you",,,,remark,2,0,
457,Oliver,You too hey I wanted to say that I appreciate how are you i'm you kind of like pointed out like what we needed and then asked us to kind of,,,,response,2,0,
457,Oliver,"look back at our enter to figure out what parts, we were missing from the question because I think that actually helped me in Farrah cuz I I wasn't sure, but then I just kind of matched in my answer the words in the question that we talked about",,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,"i'm glad you found that helpful Oliver, thank you",,,,remark,2,0,
457,Oliver,yeah okay bye,,,,response,2,0,
457,Teacher,bye,,,,remark,2,0,
458,Teacher,how's it going guys,,,,remark,0,1,2
458,Farrah,Oh it's going well we're really excited to work with you,,,,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"awesome it's great to see you guys, so you guys just read that article write about water on the moon",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
458,Teacher,Luis you got a question,,,,remark,0,1,2
458,Luis,yeah so um I should be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"Really Okay, so why don't you help us out what can you tell us a couple of things that you read in that article that you might have already known",,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
458,Luis,um okay well so i'm in the article,,,110.3,response,0,1,2
458,Luis,Okay well,,,,response,0,1,2
458,Luis,"I didn't I didn't really finish the article, but I still know the answer to the question because i'm scientists, they need oxygen tanks so they're going to go into space so that's definitely what they needed to find the water, on the one",,,,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,Right exactly can anybody else tell us anything they read in the article,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
458,Chris,"Yes, I can",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,Okay Chris go ahead,,,,remark,0,1,2
458,Chris,"So I read that scientists, the found craters full of water on the moon",,,,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"Oh does anybody know what is water, made up of what types of molecules of water, made up of anybody know",,,140.1,remark,0,1,2
458,Oliver,"Okay yeah I think we learned this, I think we learned this in science, because we learned that water as an H two O, and I know that all is oxygen and the h is hydrogen",,,140.1,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"Yes, exactly Oliver awesome job so they found water on the moon right so there's h2o there's hydrogen and there's oxygen on the moon so kind of giving us what what Luis talked about",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
458,Teacher,Why do we think that it might be important that these astronauts are these people were able to find h2o or water on the moon,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"yeah, of course",,,,remark,0,1,2
458,Jazmin,"not totally sure, but maybe if there's if there's water on the astronauts coudl drink it",,,,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"yeah they could drink it and then like Oliver said there's hydrogen and oxygen right so maybe they can use the oxygen in the water  To get some air, so that they can breathe right",,,230.3,remark,0,1,2
458,Teacher,i'm moving on her from Farrah What did you read in the article anything new that we haven't talked about just yet,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
458,Farrah,"yeah so um I read that Okay, the water is microscopic and so for the equipment, I said I said, you need a microscope to look at it really closely, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"Okay, so your answer may not, that is not necessarily wrong, what did we talk about micro or microscopic that mean what does that mean, can you explain",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
458,Farrah,"Like really, really small",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"really, really, really small, so we do need a special tool and that special tool",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
458,Teacher,That we're going to use is going to be a microscope right to look at it really closely,,,,remark,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"And Farrah the reasons why we wanted to in this group, so that you can bring your expertise to talk about that microscope for us okay",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"So we thank you, we appreciate you for that anybody else have any other information that they read or anything that they got from the article that they want to share with us",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
458,Jazmin,"um yeah so I picked I picked something different from Farrah so i'm wondering, because I said NASA send a small machine and I thought that the small machine seemed really important",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,What did you find important about the small machine,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
458,Jazmin,"Oh well, if said they used it to what was the word investigate",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,um what are some jobs or what are some for some people that usually investigate that we know,,,140.1,remark,0,1,2
458,Jazmin,detectives,,,140.1,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"detectives right and so detected they look for things right, and so that's pretty much what the what NASA wanted to do they wanted to send this small",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"This small machine, so that they can investigate or look around or try to detect things on the moon so that's awesome um anybody else see anything else about this small machine or why they think it may be important",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
458,Teacher,yeah Chris what you got,,,,remark,0,1,2
458,Chris,Well okay um so actually I I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like Luis said and masks and suits,,,,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"yeah definitely they have to use all those things right, why do you guys think it's important for them to wear their masks and their suits when they go to outer space",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
458,Chris,"Well, the astronauts they need to stay safe and the oxygen tanks and the masks it wouldn't it wouldn't stay alive without those",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"right because there's a lack of oxygen up in space right, and if you don't have oxygen and you won't be able to breathe so it'd be really tough for them to go to outer space",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"and go to the moon if there's no oxygen if they don't have a way to breathe right, so that those are some things some really important things that we can get from that article",,,,remark,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"um i'm interested to hear um you know a little bit more about this small machine, why do you think maybe any ideas as to why they sent a small machine instead of a really big one",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
458,Jazmin,Can I answer,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"Well, of course",,,,remark,0,1,2
458,Jazmin,um well that's that's the thing i'm i'm i'm wondering if it was just a small machine were there even astronauts there because I don't think the astronauts could fit on a small machine,,,,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,yeah that's a really good question so there's so much technology in the world that a lot of times we can go to places without actually physically being there right we've seen cameras and we've seen like,,,140.1,remark,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"drones and other types of technology that we can use to go places that we've never been and actually never have to go there are ourselves, you can sit in your living room and explore our space and the moon how cool would that be",,,,remark,0,1,2
458,Luis,"That would be amazing I really want to do that, one day",,,,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"Really Luis some what where else would you explore that's not outer space or maybe actually yeah let's say an outer space what's another planet, that you would explore if you had a really small machine that you could use",,,140.1,remark,0,1,2
458,Luis,"Oh well, okay um I want to look at Jupiter because it's so big and it has that red spot that's like a storm as giant giant hurricane, and I really want to look at that",,,140.1,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"Oh that's cool Farrah what about you Where would you go what planning, would you",,,140.1,remark,0,1,2
458,Farrah,"Well, actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch now",,,140.1,response,0,1,2
458,Farrah,"One I wanted to say thank you so much for really listening and getting to know every one of us and our thoughts and our feelings about space it really felt like you cared about who we are and what we think, and that was that made this class really fun",,,,response,0,1,2
458,Teacher,Great i'm glad to have you guys and it was great to meet you guys have a great lunch,,,,remark,0,1,2
458,Teacher,"Alright guys so, first I want to say thank you for all of your responses",,,,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,And Farrah I was curious with your response,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher, I thank you first for Providing that response and I love that you use scientific language like saying the word scientific and tool and even saying the word microscope,,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,But when we think about the discover the question right what makes you think about or what what pushes you to say microscope with compared to the word discover what kind of lead you there,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
458,Luis,um I have something to say,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"Yes, Luis do you have something real quick",,,,remark,1,1,2
458,Luis,yeah real quick um I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"Okay, why do you feel that you're not or you shouldn't be in this group, because you don't know you already know about space",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
458,Luis,yeah um and so I know about my answers right because I already know about space and I don't need your help,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,Okay What was your answer,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
458,Luis, My answer was Scientists use lots of equipment Like oxygen tanks,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
458,Luis,um,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"cool, How did those oxygen tanks help them to discover that water",,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
458,Luis,"well, i know that if there are scientists up on the moon like astronauts they are definitely 100% using oxygen tanks, while they go around discovering that water",,,230.1,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"Right, what, why do they want to use those oxygen tanks though",,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
458,Luis,to breathe of course,,,210.3,response,1,1,2
458,Luis, they can't survive on the moon without them,,,210.3,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"exactly, right, there's no oxygen for them to breathe on the moon so they need those oxygen tanks",,,,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"So yeah, we could say that's one of the tools that's necessary for them to even go to the moon, are there any other tools",,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"or anyone else can jump in if you'd like, are there any other tools that tou can think about that they might have used outside of their oxygen tanks to help them discover the water? yes, Farrah",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
458,Farrah,"Well yeah and this goes back to the question that you asked me before Luis interrupted um so well I picked the microscope because they said, the water um it's really small and you can't discover something if it's too small to see you need a microscope",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,okay Nice nice So what do we use a microscope for,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
458,Farrah,"um to look at stuff that's really small, so I don't understand why my answer was wrong",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"yeah so your answer is not necessarily wrong I love again how you use the, how you use the word microscope, um can you think of like another instance or another time or another example, when we use a microscope",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
458,Farrah,Oh yeah well we use them in science class and we put these little slides underneath to look at cells,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"yeah so a lot of times, and I love that you're bringing in science class i'm sure you guys have done some really amazing fun stuff in that class",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,um a lot of times when we use a microscope we want to look at one specific really tight area right,,,,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"well, if you think about the moon, the moon is like huge right it's full of these craters like Chris talked about um",,,,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,how do you feel about that,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"it's full of these craters that have the water in them right, but a lot of times if we try to use a microscope maybe we don't maybe there's too many places for us to look right,",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
458,Farrah,Oh um yeah I guess if an astronaut just had a microscope um it would take them like forever to find the water,,,210.4,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,Definitely definitely it kind of brings me,,,,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,Chris um So what did you learn about those craters on the moon,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
458,Chris,"Oh well, the scientists, the found these craters full of water",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,Right right Do you remember okay I love that you're talking about the water because that's ultimately what we're trying to get to right Do you remember,,,110.2,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"or can anyone else help us out, they did find these, They did find these craters right",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,and think about maybe going to a family member's house there's a certain way that you get there,,,210.1,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"Right, how can we discover how can we find these craters that are full of this water what what mechanisms or what machines were really used to help us discover this water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
458,Chris,um well I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,120.2,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"Jazmin I think you talked about a small machine, do you want to add anything here",,,130.2,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,yeah Definitely,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
458,Jazmin,yeah um my answer is NASA sent a small machine,,,130.2,response,1,1,2
458,Jazmin,And I think that's part of what they use to discover the water,,,,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"Right um so yeah NASA they definitely sent the small machine um can we think of the name of that small machine, maybe um",,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
458,Jazmin,"um i think it's in there, um let me look, ok um",,,210.4,response,1,1,2
458,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,can anybody think of another word that they may know of that has the same meaning as investigate,,,210.4,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"I like that, so they sent a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,110.4,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"yeah, Oliver",,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
458,Oliver,um well investigate makes me think of like a detective searching for clues,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,Chris?,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,Right,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
458,Chris,yeah i was gonna say find,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"hmm so investigate right find right are great words, Oliver the same thing that you said, right all of those had that same kind of kind of meaning right",,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher, what tools did the astronauts use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"and let's think back to the question that we, we were asked",,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"so bringing together all the things that we've said, how can we kind of piece together what we're saying about the craters, Chris, about that small machine, Jazmin",,,,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"Oliver, about the investigators, right and Farrah about about the scientific tools about the looking and the searching piece and Luis about all the equipment that we know that astronauts have to use,",,,230.3,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"how can we bring all of that together, to then say what truly right what tool was used so that these astronauts could discover this water on the moon, what are your ideas",,,120.2,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,Jazmin,,,120.4,remark,1,1,2
458,Jazmin," Okay, so the astronauts went to the moon",,,120.4,response,1,1,2
458,Jazmin,ym yeah I can try and put this all together,,,120.4,response,1,1,2
458,Jazmin,"And, of course, they had to have all that stuff Luis and Chris were talking about, oxygen tanks and masks and stuff, but to to actually look for the water they used the Lunar orbiter and the Lunar orbiter helped them find it in the craters and um I think that's everybody",,,,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"yeah and then adding on to what Farrah was telling us about the microscope right once they kind of figured out okay, maybe this is an area, right, where there's definitely going to be water or we think that there's going to be water",,,,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"then Farrah, what do you think they could do once they really find that location where they know that they're really sure that there's probably gonna be some water",,,210.3,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher,Exactly exactly,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
458,Teacher, yeah Oliver go ahead,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
458,Oliver,um i'm really sorry but um it's time for us to go now,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
458,Teacher,"awesome no problem, thank you guys for all your time",,,,remark,1,1,2
459,Teacher,"Hello friends, how are you guys today",,,,remark,0,1,3
459,Farrah,"Oh, oh we're good we're so excited for your class",,,,response,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"Yes, thank you i'm excited to be here as well, so, as I was walking around I noticed",,,,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"Some responses on your questions and I wanted to work with you guys, to see if we could delve a little deeper into understanding the concepts yes Luis",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
459,Luis,"um yeah excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"Luis I am sure you know a lot about space, but I was wondering, we were looking for the answer to the question",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"and can you go ahead and remind me, what did you respond",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,What equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
459,Luis,"Oh yeah well, I said that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"Okay, so even I like the fact that you're identifying a piece of equipment that's scientists used",,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"But I want you to really make sure that you're looking to answer the specific question so Luis if you can go back to the text, and I want you to really look very carefully",,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"To see if you could find the answer which we're looking for, which is in regards to what type of equipment they're using to find water Luis do you think that they are using oxygen tanks to help them find water on the moon",,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
459,Luis,"um well, I mean it's not like it's not like they look with oxygen tanks, but they need the oxygen tanks to breathe when they're on the mooon",,,210.3,response,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"Ah, I see what you're saying interesting I see your perspective in and you're thinking about what scientists might need as part of the equipment that they need to go searching for the water on the moon",,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,that's really observant of you i'm wondering if the specific question is looking for more of the equipment that they're using,,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,would you be able to find in the passage somewhere that actually talks about specific equipment that's been used to help find the water on the moon,,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
459,Luis,um yeah okay um I can go back and look,,,210.2,response,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"Okay, and when you find it go ahead and just circle circle what you think that's speaking to that Okay, and then",,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,Jazmin What did you share what did you find as your response to that question,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
459,Jazmin,"Okay, I said NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"Jazmin no one ever said, your answer was wrong and your answer, I would say right now, your answer is not wrong",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"But I wonder if we can go a little further, I want to see if we can build on your explanation, a little bit so a small machine, would you be able to know what that machine is called, would you happen to know that",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
459,Jazmin,um I think it's in there um NASA sent a machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,420.2,response,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"Okay, so I like the way that you went back to the passage and he looked more closely to see if you could find more information, so there was nothing wrong with your answer before, in that it gave us a hint but",,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"At this point, we want to build upon it and make sure that we're being as specific as possible and I love how, when you went back you're able to find The actual name of that small machine that they sent",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher," so thank you Jazmin just go ahead and build upon your answer with some of them, the information that you found",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"Chris, would you be able to share with us, which you were able to locate",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
459,Chris,yeah oh so I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,120.4,response,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"Okay, thank you for responding Chris so i'm wants to go back and I think it was to see if we could try to make an inference so Chris, if you can look at the third paragraph and I want you to just, would you be able to read for us the first line of the third paragraph Chris?",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
459,Chris,Okay,,,120.3,response,0,1,3
459,Chris,"That means the moon, is still drier than the driest desert on earth okay",,,,response,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"So Chris, actually read the next sentence too",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
459,Chris,"Okay, all the water they found is microscopic meaning wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it okay",,,120.3,response,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"So here's the looking at these two sentences and thinking back to what you wrote about the water filling the crater and do you think that, based upon the clues that this sentence these sentences gave you do, you still think that there is a crater full of water, what do you think",,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
459,Chris,"Well, I guess, I pictured that at first when they said water on the moon, and I was picturing like big pools and lakes, but on that part yeah that part says it's so small, you can't even see it, so I guess I guess what I pictured wasn't quite in",,,210.3,response,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"And you know, sometimes we do that when we're reading text and that's really great when we're visualizing",,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"What the text is saying, but it's always important to go back to the passage and check the words and make sure they match what we're picturing in our minds",,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,i'm so glad that you were using your visualization skills Chris so make sure you go back and revise some of your thinking that you did there okay,,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
459,Chris,yeah I also I can really picture it because I went to NASA and I found out that that scientists use all lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,310.1,response,0,1,3
459,Teacher,Oliver can you share what you how you respond to that question,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"Thank you so much for sharing this sounds like you're a NASA expert will probably come back to you and get some more information, whenever we're looking for some of your expertise, thank you Chris",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
459,Oliver,"Okay um well I I circled the same as Farrah, which was the microscope I think it was a microscope to look really closely about about little water at Chris was just reading about",,,110.3,response,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"yeah so Oliver it's so important in this space for us to know that everyone is doing their own thinking, and I know that you have such a valuable thinking to offer in this space",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"And so, when you mentioned that you'd circled the same as Farrah, it makes me wonder",,,,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"so Oliver, would you be able to tell me what evidence from the text led you to believe that they used a microscope to find the underwater",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"If somehow you looked at Farrah the answers and I don't I don't think that's the case, but I want to make sure you're doing your own thinking in the space",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
459,Oliver,"yeah okay well i'm really That was the part that Chris just read aloud where it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely it's like the next sentence, right after what Chris read",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"mm hmm Okay, so this is actually perfect for both you Farrah and Oliver since you had very similar answers",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"I want us to think very carefully about what question with the question is being asked to us, what is the question that we're trying to find the answer to Farrah",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
459,Farrah,"Oh i'm so sorry I really I really want to keep going, but we have to go to lunch now",,,120.3,response,0,1,3
459,Farrah,"yeah i'm so sorry because this class is so fun and I just wanted to say thank you so much, because you really paid attention to every single one of our answers",,,,response,0,1,3
459,Farrah,"And it was like you could understand why we said that, and you could also help us see the right answer, so thank you so much for teaching us today",,,,response,0,1,3
459,Teacher,"Thank you Farrah and up so encouraging alright friends you guys can enjoy your lunch, it was great working with you by",,,,remark,0,1,3
459,Teacher,simulation,,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"Alright, so where we able to find anything else from the question?",,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,That helps us to see if we were going in the right direction with our answer,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,Luis noticed that in the passage is didn't mention astronauts,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,and so Luis go ahead and share it you're about to share,,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
459,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: um yeah well, I think I thought that's all figured out now so i'm good",,,120.4,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,OK so Luis do you want to share your new thinking what has changed in your thinking,,,530.1,remark,2,1,3
459,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, well, I thought there were astronauts um but now I know there are the astronauts, and so it has to be a different equipment and the ones that they say and what story are the small machine i'm a microscope so now I think those are the answers",,,530.1,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"Okay, so it's possible that it's one of those two pieces of equipment they, thank you for sharing your thinking",,,130.1,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"anyone else were you able to see even from hearing what Luis shared and even from going back into the passage, we can we identify some other words from the actual passage that might give us some clues as to what the",,,130.2,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,What a good response would be yes Jazmin,,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: I found a sentence and and it's the beginning of paragraph two, and it's actually the same one I found originally so it didn't change but it's NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and that's what I said before, and NASA sent a small machine",,,,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,I was concerned that when you set the answer before it wasn't painting the full picture of what the small machine was,,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"so Jazmin is there a way that you can take what you just read and enhance your answer, so that it paints a more fuller picture",,,430.2,remark,2,1,3
459,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: Well, the whole sentence says",,,430.2,response,2,1,3
459,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: NASA Center small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, so I could use the whole sentence",,,,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"Absolutely, you could possibly add a little more information as a way of enhancing your answer",,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,So I think that would be a great idea Jazmin,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,Farrah yes,,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: i'm still kind of confused,,,,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"Okay Farrah Can you help me what is your confusion, is it the question?",,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,Is it's understanding the question or the more about looking for the response,,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah about the response because it sounds like you said Jazmin's answer is the right answer but I don't understand why,,,,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"Ah, good question Okay, so if we look back at the question and i'm going to just going to share something with you all",,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"Really briefly oh sorry I don't have screen share right, I was just going to share with you why you",,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: can describe it to us,,,,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"Yes, I will describe it to you so in with this particular question in order to make sure it's fully answered you want to make sure you're one answering the specific question that's being asked",,,420.1,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"In this context, it looks like the specific question you guys identified some verbs you identified the verb to discover, and there was also this word about equipment used to discover so",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"In this context, it seems like we should be zoning our eyes into the the reading and looking specifically for a tool, or a piece of equipment that's used to do some kind of discovering",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"And so, then, in the case of what Jazmin shared she spoke about the Lunar orbiter does anyone know what",,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,is called know the Lunar Rover I think,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
459,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah that's what it says in the story,,,110.1,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,Okay yeah sorry,,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,The lunar orbiter,,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"Is that the robot that searched on the planet, can you read that whole section again for me",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
459,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the south Pole and look for ice deposit in a large polar crater,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"Thank you, I was getting confused with the MARS Rover there's some noise",,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"Okay, so in",,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: The Mars Rover was so cool,,,,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"Thank you, so if you see with her response what we're looking for is an actual piece of equipment that did the discovery and can you see how Jazmin's",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,The lunar Rover,,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"The lunar orbiter was the equipment that did the discovery, can you see that now, and the response",,,130.3,remark,2,1,3
459,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: um okay so yeah it said that the orbiter looks for the deposits, but the microscope you need to look at the deposits",,,130.3,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"Absolutely Farrah I guess, I want to ask you did the scientists take my microscope up into space",,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
459,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: as well, he then said there's no astronauts so no",,,210.3,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,No so did they use their microscopes to discover the water,,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"Or is a more of once the water is found, then we can say oh it's a microscopic amount, what would you say",,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
459,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah yeah that's beginning to that makes more sense now,,,210.3,response,2,1,3
459,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: Because they can't use the microscope,,,,response,2,1,3
459,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: If there's no astronauts to look through it,,,,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,yeah I love Thank you that's I love the way that you stated that it showed a new thinking Chris yes,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
459,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,310.1,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"Okay, thank you for sharing that Chris now I would love for you to share with me, is there any way that you want to change your answer anything else you want to add to your response to make it more compelling?",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
459,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: Okay well um so we've been talking about equipment on this whole time so I should probably put equipment in my answer,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,I think it's a good idea to use some of the language of the question in your response and then definitely the zone in on piece of equipment found in the in your answer,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,Then Oliver What about you can you go ahead and maybe tell us what's your what might be added to your response,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
459,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah okay um so originally I was thinking,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
459,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: um you put it find something if you don't see it, so you need a microscope",,,,response,2,1,3
459,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: cuz you can't find something you can't see but now i'm thinking that the Lunar orbiter can find it and then the scientists look at it through the microscope like later,,,,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"I think that the progression by which you identify those events was very clear, and it may painted such a clear picture for others, so thank you for restating that",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
459,Teacher,So friends,,,,remark,2,1,3
459,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: Now all we have to go to lunch after lunch time,,,,response,2,1,3
459,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: But I want to say thank you for taking the time to really listen to each one of us, and why we were confused and help each one of us figure out how to move forward with a better answer it really felt like you cared about everybody's thinking Thank you so much",,,,response,2,1,3
459,Teacher,"Thank you, thank you for being a great class i'll see you guys later",,,,remark,2,1,3
460,Teacher,"Alright, so thank you so much for those responses, thank you for the hard work that you put in",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"In in writing those responses, so what I want everybody to do is I want you to read the question, one more time Okay, we oh Luis you have a question go ahead",,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Luis, I already know all about space,,,120.3,response,0,0,3
460,Luis,um yeah well I I shouldn't be in this group,,,120.3,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"Yes, Luis I saw from your response that you really use your background knowledge well and you did a great job using that background knowledge",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"but can you actually read the question out loud, for me, can you read the question",,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Luis,yeah um okay what he did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,310.1,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"Great and there's a second part to that question that says circle, do you see that part",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
460,Luis,"um oh okay yeah there are this circle, the evidence and the text where Oh, that we can use to answer this question",,,150.1,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,awesome so I saw in your answer Luis that you did a great job identifying evidence identifying equipment that scientists use to reach the moon,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher,but did you do that second part where you circled information in the text,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Luis,"i'm not really um but I guess i'd caught up circle, the word scientists, because if there are scientists on the moon, they have oxygen tanks",,,310.1,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"Oh that's true that's true, but what I see you doing Luis is pulling out your background knowledge which is really strong you're doing a great job pulling out that background knowledge",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"But that's keeping you from seeing what's really in the text too, so can you look through one more time and see if you can circle any words that that are words for equipment in the text",,,430.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Luis,Okay yeah I can do that,,,430.3,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher, Use that strong background knowledge you have to find those equipment words,,,420.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher," Thank you, Luis",,,420.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher,awesome,,,420.3,remark,0,0,3

460,Teacher,Can you look back in the text and see if you can find some specific vocabulary for me,,,420.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Jazmin,Oh OK,,,420.3,response,0,0,3
460,Jazmin,OK NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,awesome what did you find in that sentence,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
460,Jazmin,lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
460,Jazmin,and investigate,,,,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,investigate very nicely done,,,,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher," So, what um",,,,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher,What is lunar orbiter what is a lunar orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
460,Jazmin,"Oh well, I guess it's a machine",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,yeah,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher, So do you think adding lunar orbiter to your answer could make your answer even stronger?,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Jazmin,"Yeah, I guess so",,,210.3,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,Tell me why,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
460,Jazmin,well,,,230.1,response,0,0,3
460,Jazmin,I I picked a machine because it sounded like the word equipment,,,,response,0,0,3
460,Jazmin,But maybe if I say lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,0,3
460,Jazmin,And it's a better answer because it's the name of the machine,,,,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"I love that exactly right if we just a machine that it's kinda like the question it's just saying equipment right, but if we bring that name in it tells us specifically great job Jazmin really good work",,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher, oh yes Farrah go ahead,,,,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"Now Chris, can you talk to me",,,,remark,0,0,3
460,Farrah," I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,0,3
460,Farrah,"yeah well, I was kind of hoping, I could go next because now that Jazmin went, i'm kind of confused",,,,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"yeah great question and Oliver, I really want you to pay close attention to what's Farrah and I are talking about and i'd like you to jump into because you had the same answer as Farrah okay",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
460,Oliver,Okay,,,150.1,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,awesome Thank you so let's take a look,,,,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher,Which one of you would like to read the question again out loud for me,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Oliver,"I can do it, um okay equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question",,,120.3,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"Alright, so what is it really asking for, what information does it want to know",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
460,Oliver,um equipment,,,210.2,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"equipment and what else, Farrah can you help out",,,130.2,remark,0,0,3

460,Teacher, There's one more piece to that,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
460,Farrah,um,,,110.1,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"Chris, do you want to jump in? How about Farrah and Oliver? What's it asking for, it's asking for equipment for discovering water, what else is it asking for",,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
460,Chris,"Oh, oh circle evidence in the text",,,130.2,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher, Are we looking for equipment that we can use or equipment that we did use?,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"that's true what kind of equipment, or what kind of equipment that scientists use to discover water are we looking for",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher,Look for those little clues in the text in the question,,,420.1,remark,0,0,3
460,Chris,Oh did,,,420.1,response,0,0,3
460,Chris,Did did scientists use,,,,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher," Farrah and Oliver, you circled the part about the microscope",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher, So let's go back to the text,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"Great john Chris, awesome teamwork everybody",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher,um can you read that part in the text out loud for me,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Farrah,"yeah Okay, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.3,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,Great so what was that part of the text telling us,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
460,Farrah,That you can't see the water without a microscope,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,  Does it say that scientists did use that equipment to discover it on the moon,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"Yes, you can't see the water out of microscope exactly right",,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Farrah,"I guess, I thought that's what it meant, but now that you mentioned it, it doesn't exactly say that",,,210.3,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"I love that critical thinking Farrah I love, looking back at your answer like that awesome so let's as a team has Oliver and Farrah let's as a team go back to the text and i'd like you to, yes Chris",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
460,Chris,"Well, I just wanted to share I went to NASA so I know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like Luis said but also masks and suits",,,310.1,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"That is so true and I love that you brought in that background information Chris that's super important when you're reading a text like this, so great job",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
460,Teacher,"But what was that second part of the question, can you read the second part of the question, Chris",,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Chris,"circle, the evidence in the text we can use to answer this question",,,120.3,response,0,0,3
460,Teacher,yeah so are looking to bring in our answer from outside information for when you went to visit NASA or are we looking somewhere else for our answer,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
460,Chris,Oh,,,210.3,response,0,0,3
460,Chris,So it needs to be from the story,,,,response,0,0,3

461,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,310.1,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"that's so great to hear that we have people here that are interested in space,",,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,so i'm really going to value your opinion Luis,,,110.3,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"I actually chose all of you, because I think all of your insights are very valuable and I really want to hear a lot more about what you're thinking",,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,Can I have somebody tell me,,,,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"Where in the text, they figured out how to answer this question about equipment",,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,1,1,1
461,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: Okay, so I figured it out from paragraph three",,,,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"Okay, and do you have a specific sentence",,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
461,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: Yes, so I circled the part where it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,230.2,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"All right, thank you so much for sharing that Farrah did I see you raise your hand Chris",,,110.1,remark,1,1,1
461,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: yeah I found my answer in the first paragraph,,,110.1,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"Okay, and were you looking at a specific sentence",,,230.2,remark,1,1,1
461,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: mm hmm yeah so where it says on scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar readers,,,230.2,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"can I have a volunteer to read this question out loud, please",,,120.3,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"All right, thank you so much, so what I wanted I want us to do today is to take a step back from the text and take a really close look at the question that we're answering",,,150.1,remark,1,1,1
461,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: I can read it,,,150.1,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,Thank you Jazmin okay,,,,remark,1,1,1
461,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: What equipment did scientists use to discover water, on the moon",,,,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"All right, great job so based on the question that Jazmin just read out to us what should our answer be",,,120.4,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"What is this question looking for is it looking for a person is it looking for a place, what kind of answer do we need to give to answer this question death",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
461,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: it needs to be a thing,,,210.2,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"It does need to be a thing, and what made you say that",,,230.1,remark,1,1,1
461,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab:  The questions asks what equipment i'm i'm so um you know your need to find an equipment to answer that question,,,230.1,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,Great so we know that we're looking for a piece of equipment to answer this question now the next question that I want us to ask right we've just asked what kind of answer do we need,,,110.4,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,Now we're going to ask ourselves is there anything else in this question that helps us know what we should be looking for so def has identified that we are looking for a piece of equipment does this question say anything else about what we should be looking for,,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,1,1,1
461,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: on it, it also says the equipment to discover water",,,,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,Okay equipment to discover water and Jazmin,,,110.4,remark,1,1,1
461,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: And yes, I was going to say the same thing is also that I, I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,110.4,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"Okay, so let's talk about this Jazmin your answer was that NASA sent a small machine right, and I think we can all agree that a small machine is a type of equipment right",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"But, as you and Farrah also pointed out, is that this question is asked me for a piece of equipment and then also a piece of equipment that discovered water on the moon, and so one thing that I am missing from your answer is",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"You know, did this small machine discover water on the moon, I need to know more about this small machine right",,,410.2,remark,1,1,1
461,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: Ok so I have to say NASA sent a small machine to discover water on the moon,,,410.2,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"Well, that would certainly be helpful right, but what we're going to do next is we've asked ourselves the question",,,,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"What this question is looking for we've asked ourselves what other information and the question can help us find our answer The third thing we want to do is go back to the text, so we know that we're looking for a piece of equipment",,,,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"That was used to discover water on the moon, and I want us to take a minute and go through and find a sentence that answers a piece of equipment and equipment that specifically was Hughes to discover water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"Chris, do you have a question",,,,remark,1,1,1
461,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: So I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"That is absolutely true our scientists are using a lot of equipment, which is why it's going to be kind of tricky for us to just narrow it down",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"Right, because this this article talks about so many pieces of equipment, so what we're going to try and do is look for the piece of equipment that talks about being used to discover water specifically right",,,,remark,1,1,1
461,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: Okay,,,,response,1,1,1
461,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: One to discover the water specifically,,,,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"Yes, all right i'm going to give you all 10 more seconds to read over and then let's come back and discuss if we think we've found a sentence that has a piece of equipment that talks about being used to discover water Farrah",,,120.2,remark,1,1,1
461,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: On well, I would still say the same sentence, I said before, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look directly at it",,,120.2,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"You know I think that's a great point Farrah, can I ask you a question",,,,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"Okay, so in your answer you're talking about a piece of equipment right, this is great you've identified a microscope and you say that the microscope helps the scientists look really closely",,,,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"And I want to remind us that we are trying to find an answer that talks about discovering water, so do we think that, looking at water and discovering water are the same, are they different",,,210.2,remark,1,1,1
461,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: Oh,,,210.2,response,1,1,1
461,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: I can see how they might be a little different,,,,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,Okay Oliver,,,,remark,1,1,1
461,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: Look it's time for us to go right now, but thank you so much for teaching us today",,,,response,1,1,1
461,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,1,1,1
461,Teacher,"Alright, everyone, I think that we had just discovered a really valuable piece of information about savannas answer we had determined that microscopes help us look at things which is not quite the same as discovering or looking for something Luis Can you help me oh",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
461,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: yeah well, I think I got this all figured out so i'm",,,230.3,response,2,1,1
461,Teacher,Great can you show me the sentence that you found in the text that we were looking for that made you feel so confident,,,230.2,remark,2,1,1
461,Luis,"Agile Teacher Lab: As well okay I gotta say it's not from the text but you'll have to discover and oxygen tanks, because if there's astronauts on the loan, they are using oxygen tanks when they discover the water",,,230.2,response,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"I definitely agree with you that the scientists are using oxygen tanks, but I really want us to answer this question with something that we found in the text",,,420.2,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,So I know that we spent some time looking at the questions right looking at the sentences and the text Can somebody give me a sentence that stuck out to them that they think answers this question,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,Jazmin,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
461,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: okay,,,120.4,response,2,1,1
461,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,2,1,1
461,Teacher,And what made you pick this particular sentence Jazmin,,,230.1,remark,2,1,1
461,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: Well it's the same sentence I picked before,,,230.1,response,2,1,1
461,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: But I picked it because it has the word machine which is equipment and investigate which kind of reminds me of discover a little bit,,,,response,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"All right, what do we think do we think that investigating is a similar kind of thing to discovering",,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"All right, i'm seeing some nods, so I think we're really onto something here, and I agree, I think this is a phenomenal sentence to us to answer our question can Somebody tell me the two things that this sentence have that our question is looking for",,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,Oliver,,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
461,Oliver,Agile Teacher Lab: And I got this,,,120.4,response,2,1,1
461,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: It has an equipment, because it sounds small machine and that has a word like discover",,,,response,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"Great yes, so we have found a sentence that answers both parts of our question  right it gives us a piece of equipment, the scientists are using and it's telling us that this equipment is used to discover things it's used to investigate to look for something Farrah",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
461,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: okay,,,230.3,response,2,1,1
461,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: i'm still kind of confused,,,,response,2,1,1
461,Teacher,Can you tell me why you're confused,,,230.1,remark,2,1,1
461,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: I understand the Lunar orbiter on because it's a machine to investigate that makes sense, but I still think there's evidence in the text on that it could also be the microscope because that sentence has any equipment and it has a word like look for which is like discover",,,230.1,response,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"that's a great point Farrah, which is why answering these questions can be kind of tricky",,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"The one thing that I want to point out here is that our question is asking for something that helped discover water, which means that before they use the equipment they didn't have the water",,,210.2,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,right they didn't know where it was now in order for us to use a microscope do we if we're using it to look at the water do we already have the water,,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
461,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: Oh well, yeah in science class, we have to put the slide under the microscope and then we look at it",,,210.4,response,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"Okay, so we need the water already if we're going to use the microscope",,,210.4,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,So do we think that the microscope has discovered the water?,,,210.3,remark,2,1,1
461,Farrah,"Agile Teacher Lab: Oh, oh no",,,210.3,response,2,1,1
461,Farrah,Agile Teacher Lab: You can't put it under the microscope if you haven't discovered it,,,,response,2,1,1
461,Teacher,that's a great point Farrah so thank you for pointing out why it can be kind of tricky to answer questions like this,,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,right they're asking for two different things we're seeing a lot of really similar words,,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"But I think we all did a great job really breaking down with this question with asking us for and finding a great sentence that helps us answer this question, so if we want to answer another question",,,310.1,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"i'm Chris, do you have a question I",,,,remark,2,1,1
461,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: mean it's it's a comment,,,,response,2,1,1
461,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: related to the story,,,,response,2,1,1
461,Chris,Agile Teacher Lab: I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,,response,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"that's really fascinating and makes me think that maybe sometime later, we should have a discussion about",,,150.1,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"All the things that we've heard about water on the moon, but I want to stick with what we're talking about before for a little bit, because I know that we answered two questions",,,,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"And so we've done a really great job going over the answers to the first question,",,,110.1,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"and I want us to move on to the second question, and before we do that can Somebody tell me a strategy that we can use well answering the second question",,,120.4,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,2,1,1
461,Luis,Agile Teacher Lab: Okay i'm gonna go with actually reading the story,,,,response,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"This is a great start, we need to read the text right because we're looking for a sentence Jazmin",,,230.3,remark,2,1,1
461,Jazmin,"Agile Teacher Lab: And Okay, so a strategy for this new question I would say, is to really look at the words in the question and find the words",,,230.3,response,2,1,1
461,Jazmin,Agile Teacher Lab: That tell you what the user needs to be,,,,response,2,1,1
461,Teacher,This is a great point Jazmin so even though we've only discussed,,,,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"Question one we can use the same concepts that we talked about right looking at the question to figure out what it's asking for, if we want to answer another question like question two",,,510.1,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"So what I want us to do is take a minute look at Question two right is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable and I want us to do, the first part",,,,remark,2,1,1
461,Teacher,Of the strategy that we just did with Question one and pick out the words in the question that tell us what we should be looking for,,,420.1,remark,2,1,1
461,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: And i'm so sorry, and I just looked up a clock and we, we have to go to lunch, right now, but I want to test say thank you for teaching us this new strategy",,,420.1,response,2,1,1
461,Oliver,"Agile Teacher Lab: Because using the words in the question, like really understanding what discover matt and i'm looking for a sentence with what like similar words, I really do think that's going to help us answer Question to why don't we get to it after lunch",,,,response,2,1,1
461,Teacher,"Well, thank you so much for spending time with me and I hope you have a great lunch time",,,,remark,2,1,1
462,Teacher,Hello everybody,,,,remark,0,0,2

462,Teacher,I thought we could peak to that a little bit and talk about that that story From from what you read,,,,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,"What if you told me a story about how how they how the scientists at NASA figured out that there is water on the moon, which is super exciting What would you tell me if you just were like explaining it to your friend or to a sibling or to your parents, based on what you read what happened to lead them to that discovery",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,yes Chris,,,,remark,0,0,2
462,Chris,"Okay, oh it's it's so cool",,,,response,0,0,2
462,Chris,"Okay, so",,,,response,0,0,2
462,Chris,"We used to think NASA used to think that the moon was totally dry and like a desert, but actually the scientists they found these craters full of water on the moon",,,,response,0,0,2
462,Teacher,"So the exciting thing, and I am equally as excited about this happening, and they just figured this out a little bit ago that yes, they did find",,,,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,"That there's water on the moon, but he only found very miniscule amounts of water and they did you're right they did find that in the craters",,,410.3,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,"On the dark side of the moon, the part of the moon that doesn't see the sun right but it wasn't lots of water it wasn't like the kind of water you go swimming in it, would it would be something that you view with a microscope",,,410.3,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,Farrah you mentioned a microscope right?,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
462,Farrah,"Oh yes, yes, that was my answer, I said I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,410.3,response,0,0,2
462,Teacher,So you're right in that they did use they did use a microscope,,,110.2,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,"But the way that the text that we're looking at the water on the moon, which is from an article in the newspaper right from New York Times",,,,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,"when they said microscope right they didn't use the microscope up in space right, but what they were using the microscope is when they when they collected it and analyzed it, it was the size",,,410.3,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,but they didn't they didn't send a microscope up to space okay,,,410.3,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,What they use to look at it was microscopic does that makes sense,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,"Did anybody get it does anybody know what they sent up in space to figure it out to analyze all this, Jazmin",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
462,Jazmin,"Yes, and I said NASA sent a small machine",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
462,Teacher,"And you are, you are correct was certain extent, but we're going to be even more specific right they sent up a satellite",,,420.2,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,they sent up a satellite with this orbiter that orbits the moon to analyze that hydrogen that they had found right,,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,and hydrogen is part of h2o you heard people talk about h2o,,,140.1,remark,0,0,2
462,Jazmin,"Yes, yes, we have",,,140.1,response,0,0,2
462,Teacher,"Okay, so they had they found that hmm there's there's some H two of those there's hydrogen up there, and maybe it's part of water h2o and that would be exciting right, because if there's water, you know that",,,140.1,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,"That might be exciting for continued exploration on the moon, and have access to water",,,,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,Right you all drink water every day right,,,140.1,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,"So maybe in your site, yes, water is a big part of who you are okay",,,140.1,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,"The story is that when when the satellite went up there, they decided to take part of their rocket and crashed into the moon into a crater and then a big plume Do you know what a plume is",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,The big billow of,,,,remark,0,0,2

462,Teacher,"Right, so they they hypothesized, but if we send this we send a rocket and create a plume, then we can send our we can send",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,Some instruments through to analyze to see if there's h2o to see if there's water and that's exactly what did happen so pretty exciting yes Chris,,,,remark,0,0,2
462,Chris,"Well, so I went to NASA and I know that the scientists they they have to use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like Luis said and and masks and suits",,,,response,0,0,2
462,Teacher,So in this particular experiment they didn't send that they didn't have people go up,,,410.3,remark,0,0,2
462,Teacher,they have a satellite go up right to do all of this,,,130.3,remark,0,0,2

462,Teacher,Think about right now right is how we how we ultimately will get to that answer a little more easily so as you're reading it through by yourselves what kinds of things that you can do to to arrive at that answer,,,,remark,2,0,2
462,Teacher,Right so Luis can you think about for a minute,,,,remark,2,0,2

462,Teacher,"Right, so can we can one of you read the question out loud for me i'll read the question that's great",,,120.3,remark,2,0,2

462,Farrah,harvard,,,,response,2,0,2
462,Teacher,Oh yeah true that's good um so you're going to try to be making some connections,,,,remark,2,0,2

462,Teacher,Right,,,,remark,2,0,2
462,Teacher,"Investigators is the same thing as discover right,",,,130.3,remark,2,0,2
462,Teacher,does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
462,Teacher,so I guess the other strategy that you're going to want to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking right and then you're trying to make some connections between the concepts that you're reading,,,510.1,remark,2,0,2
462,Teacher,Right so they've got them the small small machine,,,,remark,2,0,2
462,Teacher,So,,,,remark,2,0,2
462,Teacher,that's a really good question Farrah and,,,,remark,2,0,2
462,Teacher,let's see,,,,remark,2,0,2
462,Teacher,i'm trying to think what you said about make connections on right,,,120.4,remark,2,0,2

462,Farrah,edu: Is it like on like inference our teacher does say talk about inferences,,,120.4,response,2,0,2
462,Teacher,"Right, so if you're going to if you want to make some inferences if they're talking about investigating, then you might want to go back up to the to the paragraph before it",,,,remark,2,0,2
462,Teacher,To see what they see what they were looking for so let's see if you can look in that first paragraph to find this the phrase that would help you make that connection between what the Lunar orbiter is investigating from the previous paragraph,,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
462,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,2
462,Teacher,uh huh,,,,remark,2,0,2

463,Teacher, I think we can do a little bit better so we're going to push our thinking today,,,150.1,remark,0,,
463,Luis,um yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,150.1,response,0,,
463,Teacher,"But this is not about background knowledge or even knowing about space what we're working on today is we're practicing using text to support our answers, so our group is going to learn how to use text as evidence so that's why we're here today Luis",,,220.1,remark,0,,
463,Teacher,yeah Luis your answer really showed me that you have a lot of background knowledge,,,110.3,remark,0,,
463,Luis,Oh okay that makes sense,,,220.1,response,0,,

463,Farrah,um I found it in part three,,,230.2,response,0,,
463,Teacher,"that's awesome Farrah, can you tell me what the scientists were looking at with the microscope",,,230.1,remark,0,,

463,Teacher, that's awesome Farrah,,,230.3,remark,0,,
463,Teacher,yeah awesome so one of the tools that the scientist used to look at the microscopic water was a microscope,,,230.3,remark,0,,
463,Teacher,did anybody else have a different tool that the scientists used?,,,130.2,remark,0,,
463,Teacher,yeah Jazmin why don't you go ahead and share your answer,,,120.4,remark,0,,
463,Jazmin,"Okay, so I said, my answer was NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,120.4,response,0,,
463,Teacher,So your answer is not wrong Jazmin,,,110.2,remark,0,,
463,Teacher,Which paragraph from the text did you get your answer from?,,,230.2,remark,0,,
463,Jazmin,I found it in Part two,,,230.2,response,0,,

463,Jazmin,"Oh yeah Okay, it says this isn't a small machine called a lunar orbiter",,,210.4,response,0,,
463,Teacher,"awesome so this small machine was called the Lunar orbiter- Jazmin, what did NASA do with that machine?",,,210.4,remark,0,,
463,Jazmin,They used it to investigate,,,210.4,response,0,,
463,Teacher,yeah does anybody know what investigate means?,,,210.4,remark,0,,

463,Chris, Look around for something in particular are sort of like a detective might investigate a certain place for like clues and stuff,,,120.4,response,0,,
463,Chris,So investigate is when you sort of,,,120.4,response,0,,
463,Teacher,yeah awesome Chris and that's exactly what investigate means so NASA used the Lunar orbiter to look around the moon for water,,,210.4,remark,0,,
463,Teacher,All right does anybody else have any other ideas about tools that NASA might have used,,,130.2,remark,0,,
463,Chris,yeah I do,,,130.2,response,0,,
463,Teacher,yeah go ahead Chris,,,,remark,0,,
463,Chris,"Okay, so well actually I went to NASA so I know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like Luis said but also masks and suits",,,,response,0,,
463,Teacher,yeah that's awesome so is that information in our text anywhere Chris,,,230.2,remark,0,,
463,Chris,um,,,230.2,response,0,,
463,Chris," No, not really but I saw them all, when I went to NASA so I know they use them",,,230.2,response,0,,
463,Teacher,"yeah so that's a really great background information have but remember for this question, we need to circle evidence from our text so it's not in the text we can't use it this time it's still really good to know, though",,,410.2,remark,0,,
463,Chris,We have to pick the equipment from the story,,,410.2,response,0,,
463,Teacher,yeah from the story that we read exactly Chris,,,110.1,remark,0,,
463,Teacher,"Oliver I haven't heard from you, yet do you think we've found all of the equipment that they used in this text",,,120.4,remark,0,,
463,Oliver,"yeah well I think we did, but i'm still a little confused about why it's my not the microscope like why that isn't exactly the right answer",,,120.4,response,0,,
463,Oliver," Because I was sort of thinking, how can you discover something if you can't even see it yeah I mean, I guess, I guess they use that small machine, but I still think that microscope is the right answer",,,120.4,response,0,,
463,Teacher,yeah so Oliver you're exactly right there's more than one right answer here so savannas answer about the microscope was correct and Jazmin's answer about the Lunar orbiter was correct,,,110.2,remark,0,,
463,Oliver,"Oh OK, so we could say either one",,,110.2,response,0,,
463,Teacher,"yeah, a really good answer would say both",,,420.2,remark,0,,
463,Oliver,That's party cool,,,420.2,response,0,,
463,Teacher,yeah so we've used evidence from paragraph to hand paragraph three let's take another look at paragraph one and see if there's any other information there that we can use,,,120.3,remark,0,,
463,Teacher,Does someone want to read paragraph one out loud for us?,,,120.3,remark,0,,
463,Luis,yeah I do!,,,120.3,response,0,,
463,Teacher,yeah thanks Luis go ahead and read paragraph one for us,,,120.3,remark,0,,
463,Luis,"Okay, it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moons polar craters and these craters are dark places where the sun never shines",,,120.3,response,0,,
463,Teacher,Thank you Luis so Farrah I haven't heard your voice in a while Farrah does paragraph one talk about any tools or equipment that the scientists used?,,,210.4,remark,0,,
463,Farrah,Oh,,,210.4,response,0,,
463,Farrah, no? No,,,210.4,response,0,,
463,Teacher,yeah exactly right so only in paragraph two or three is any equipment mentioned,,,210.4,remark,0,,

463,Oliver,"From the text and finding evidence from each different paragraph that I think is going to be really helpful next time we have to do a question like this, so thank you so much",,,,response,0,,
463,Teacher,"yeah Thank you guys, for your hard work today that was awesome",,,,remark,0,,

464,Teacher,Okay Hello everyone,,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Farrah,hi Hello,,,,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"Okay, so um you all just shared your responses",,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Luis,"i'm excuse me, I should have been, and this group I already know all about space",,,,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"Well i'm glad you know a lot about space, and it would be really nice if you could contribute some of that expertise to our group conversation",,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
464,Luis,"yeah Okay, I can do that",,,110.3,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,awesome sounds good okay so before we begin does anyone have any questions about why their answer may not have been exactly correct,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Farrah,"Well i'm not sure why my answer is wrong because well, I found the piece of equipment that they used to discover the water",,,,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"so this leads us into a good activity where I want you all to reread the prompt and I want you to circle, the most important word in the process so just take a minute and go ahead and do that",,,420.1,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"Okay, so you identified a piece of equipment right and I like that you started off with that,",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,Is everyone finished,,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"Okay, who wants to share what word they circled in the prompt",,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Oliver,So I picked equipment,,,,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"Okay, good",,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,Jazmin What did you pick,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
464,Jazmin,I chose discover,,,110.1,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,discover that's also a good word,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,So something I want to share with all of you is all of your almost all of your responses had something to do with equipment and Jazmin you're right in that we're talking about the equipment used to discover so,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,um what I want you to do is go back in the text,,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,And I want you to think about equipment and what equipment was used to discover what we talked about,,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,So just go back and read the passage really quick,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Jazmin,"Why, my answer is wrong because I said, NASA sent a small machine and I think that's the machine to discover, so why is my answer wrong I don't understand",,,,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,So we just talked about how equipment and discover are two very important words but what I want you to do is identified the specific piece of equipment that they used,,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
464,Jazmin,"Oh, the small machine",,,150.1,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"So can we as a group, look at our text",,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"So there are small machines mentioned, but the machines have my concern is that the machine has a specific name and that we need to uncover that",,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"So my suggestions are that you go back in the text, and you identify that specific piece of a quick",,,430.2,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
464,Jazmin,I can go look for the name,,,430.2,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,and revise our responses,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"So, yes let's all read and see if we can come up with that specific piece of equipment,",,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"Alright, is everyone ready",,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"Okay, has anyone revised their response",,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Luis,"um Okay, so I said at first, I said oxygen tanks on, but now I also want to add on the Lunar orbiter, which is the thing that Jazmin was talking about, so I think my answer is scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and the Lunar orbiter",,,,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"Okay does anyone else have a response, thank you Luis",,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Farrah,"Well, I know you said that we had to look for the name of the machine so i'm guessing that that's the Lunar orbiter, but I still don't understand why it's not the microscope",,,,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,Okay um So could you explain a little bit more about why you're choosing the microscope over the Lunar orbiter,,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
464,Farrah,yeah so it says the water they found is microscopic and so you can't see something that's microscopic unless you have a microscope so you can't discover it if you can't see it,,,230.1,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"and you're right, it is small, and they do need a microscope but my concern is that your response, need the piece of equipment that made the initial discovery right,",,,420.1,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"I OK, I see how that makes a lot of sense",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"so what lets the scientists, know that the water is there",,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,Go ahead,,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Farrah,"Well, I guess, if that's what the Lunar orbiter does, but I didn't know that that's what it does",,,,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,Okay um,,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"So let's hear from one other person, and then we can talk more about your concern, is that okay?",,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"All right, Chris",,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Chris,"Well, I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"Yes, well i'm glad you're able to connect that personal experience what did you end up revising your response to the initial prompt, though",,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
464,Chris,"Oh, oh okay well at first I didn't say any equipment what it sounds like that's really important because it's a it's a key word like you said so now, I said on my answer is the small machine called a lunar orbiter",,,120.4,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"Okay, so let's go back to the vantage point and let's think about this so",,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,Farrah you say that you still think that the microscope is the most important part right,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"Yes, okay so",,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,let's think for one moment just in our heads,,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,What does it mean to make something the initial discovery of something,,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,And then,,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,"After you thought, and you have a good solid thought let's share, what does that mean",,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
464,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,1,1,3
464,Oliver,"Oh well, really like to share but it's actually time for us to go now",,,,response,1,1,3
464,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,1,3
465,Teacher,"Alright, everyone, so it seems like we all have sort of different answers to this question, right now, so I want us to take a step back and look back at the text and the question, to see if we can all come to an understanding yes Luis",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
465,Luis,"i'm excuse me, I shut me in this group I already know all about space",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"Well, I, hopefully, you can use what you know about space to answer the question, but I want us to think",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,about what exactly the question is asking us and maybe use some of what we already know about space to answer the question,,,420.1,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,So the first thing that I want us to do we're going to look back at actually what the question is asking us,,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"So, initially, I gave you the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"I want you each to take 30 seconds and just think about what are other words that might mean the same thing as equipment, so what might be a synonym",,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,A word that means the same thing as equipment i'm going to give you 30 minutes 30 seconds right now to just jot down some notes write down some notes about what might be a word that means the same thing as equipment okay go ahead and do that now,,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"Okay, so who can tell me, one of the words that they thought of that means the same thing as equipment anyone have a word that they wrote down",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"Okay, savana what what where did you write down",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
465,Farrah,"Okay, so I thought, a word that meant the same thing as equipment with the tool",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"tool that's a good one yeah so tool, a tool can mean the same thing as equipment for sure nice job Farrah and Chris, I saw your hand went up what's a word that you thought might be the same thing as equipment",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
465,Farrah,Okay well it's not one word but equipment is like a thing that you use to complete a job,,,230.3,response,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"yeah something you use to complete a job and that's really almost like savannas tool right it's a tool, something that we use to complete a job so two different ways of saying equipment there",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,anyone else let's have one more person share what's another word for equipment,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,0,1,3
465,Jazmin,"Oh well, this word is actually from the story and it's machine and that was part of my answer NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer was wrong",,,,response,0,1,3
465,Teacher,So a machine is another word for equipment that's a great,,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"word for what might be a equipment machine right, and if you think about that Jazmin that's very similar to what's being said with tool and almost the same thing as Chris said, with a thing that we use to complete a task or job",,,,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"So just to remind everyone for equipment, we have a tool, a thing we use to complete a job and also a machine so lots of different ways to think about equipment",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"I want us now to spend the same amount of time thinking about what the second half of the question is, which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,So we're going to spend another 30 seconds doing the same thing with the word discover okay so spend 30 seconds writing down other words that might mean the same thing as discover okay go ahead and do that now,,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"Alright, it looks like you're all done",,,,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,Why don't we get three words that you all wrote down that have to do with discover so to someone want to volunteer word that they wrote down that has the same thing as discover Oliver why don't we hear from you first,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
465,Oliver,What did you discover for that I said find,,,120.4,response,0,1,3
465,Teacher,Find that's a really good one right if you're discovering something you're finding it nice thanks and then Luis I saw your hand go up what did you come up with Luis,,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
465,Luis,"um yeah well I also thought find, but I think what's really important is you're finding it for the first time no one else found it before",,,230.3,response,0,1,3
465,Teacher,one more word that someone wrote down for discover anyone have another idea here,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"yeah that's a very good point it's for the first time, so you're finding it for the first time, good thanks Luis in depth, those are really good words to point up",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,0,1,3
465,Chris,"Oh well, I don't know if this one is really good, but when you discover something it's like you uncover it like it was hidden and then you uncover it",,,,response,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"yeah that could be interesting it's hidden maybe you can't find it you're not able to see it, or you don't know if it's there, and you uncover it that's very good yes",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
465,Chris,yeah can I share one more thing,,,230.3,response,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"Yes, of course, Chris go ahead",,,,remark,0,1,3
465,Chris,yeah so I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,1,3
465,Teacher,yeah yeah scientists do need to use a lot of equipment or tools or machines to find and uncover things,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,And here's in brings up a good point that that's exactly what our question is asking us for and what we want to learn from this text what tools are the scientists,,,210.2,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"Okay, so I want you all right now to go back to the text and just underline any tools or machines any equipment that you see in either of those three paragraphs okay Oliver do you have a question",,,420.3,remark,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"At NASA using to find water, how did they uncover water on the moon",,,,remark,0,1,3
465,Oliver,um yeah well that's not a question on I just looked up a clock around we actually have to go to lunch right now i'm so sorry because I really want to do the next part,,,,response,0,1,3
465,Oliver,"Of this activity, and I wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand the question so well, I think I might do that same thing, next time, what writing down similar words that was really helpful, thank you",,,,response,0,1,3
465,Teacher,"Thanks and I  hope you will enjoy your lunch everyone, and I hope to see you all again soon",,,,remark,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"Alright, everyone so it's so interesting to hear all of your responses, because it sounds like i'm hearing a few different things you know, the more everyone seems to have a different response yeah Luis have a question",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
466,Luis,yeah well i'm I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"Really, what did what was your response to this question, can you just remind me",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
466,Luis,"yeah um well, I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,And how do we oxygen take specifically help us find water on the moon,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
466,Luis,"yeah well, so if there's astronauts there's no way they can find the water on the moon if they don't have oxygen tanks to breathe",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,that's really great point,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
466,Teacher,how about the rest of you did what did we say for this question that we'd like to share with the rest of the group,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
466,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,0,1,3
466,Farrah,"Okay, well, I said, actually, that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,Oh awesome and then what paragraph did you find that piece of evidence and,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
466,Farrah,"Okay, I found it in part three",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,Oh awesome he found it in part three,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"Can you read that sentence, do you have it circle in your APP",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
466,Farrah,"yeah OK, so the part I circled is okay, the water you they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"how about let's hear from somebody else anyone else, want to share out there and to our group",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
466,Teacher,awesome great love that detail that you're using,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
466,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,0,1,3
466,Chris,"Okay, well, so I said that scientists, the phone creators, full of water on the moon",,,,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,Like full of like water that we're drinking so like the water in my water bottle,,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
466,Chris,yeah well that's sort of how I pictured it yeah cuz creators they're so big and it's like I was picturing sort of like lakes and pools of water,,,230.3,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,Oh that'd be really cool to find where did you find that in the text,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
466,Chris,"On Okay, so in part it's right at the beginning, so it says, scientists have found evidence that",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
466,Chris,can be found deep within the moon's creator,,,,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,Oh yeah that's really interesting Jazmin do you want to quickly share what you have said,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
466,Jazmin,Yes,,,110.1,response,0,1,3
466,Jazmin,So I said that NASA centers small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,um let's unpack that a bit So what is the small machine do,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
466,Jazmin,investigate,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,What is it investigating for what are we looking for and,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
466,Jazmin,The water well actually ice ice deposits in the craters,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"yeah that's a really great detail, you found so Chris based off of that evidence, are we swimming and large bodies of water, what are we looking for",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
466,Jazmin,"whoa whoa Okay, it sounds like it's not really how I pictured it may be",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,yeah so,,,,remark,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"It might not be like full bodies of water, but we have ice right and what does ice made out of",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
466,Jazmin,water,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,Exactly so that's the kind of water we're looking for,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
466,Jazmin,That make sense,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"yeah and then Jazmin quick quick update with you what part of the reading, did you find that in",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"Oh that's interesting, so we have equipment, both in Part Two and part three So what does that mean, how many pieces of equipment are we looking at",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
466,Jazmin,"Oh, I think there's two pieces of equipment",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"yeah that's a really great point so for each of you what i'm noticing is that, like we may have spoken about one piece of equipment or maybe the other one",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"let's think about how we could you know circle both the civic equipment and not only that, but also think about what each piece of equipment is doing for us",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
466,Jazmin,"um yeah well i'm still not totally sure, because I know me and Farrah we were thinking about the microscope because if the ice is so small, how are you going to find it if you can't even see ya",,,130.1,response,0,1,3
466,Jazmin,"So that's why we thought it would be just on my periscope because you need to see it, and the first place",,,,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"yeah that's a really good point so we know that we're using the microscope once we know that there's water right, but in order to find the location, with the water, what are we using",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
466,Jazmin,Oh so,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
466,Jazmin,Maybe,,,,response,0,1,3
466,Jazmin,The machine does,,,,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"Exactly, so we start with the machine let's go ahead and look for that ice and then we're like oh look this looks like this weird substance kind of looks like something we find and then what",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
466,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,0,1,3
466,Chris,"Oh well, Okay, so it sounds like they use that machine and that finds where is the ice and then they look at it with a microscope and also, I went to NASA actually so I know that scientists they they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"yeah exactly so we take that ice right we take, we find the water particles and we want to use that in the future so that we can go to the moon, and we could stay there long periods of time and and Luis going back to you and how you know so much about",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"Space and all that, what do we need for oxygen takes",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
466,Teacher,Two people to be,,,,remark,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"brief, what do we do that",,,,remark,0,1,3
466,Luis,"Well, the oxygen tanks that's why we use them",,,,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"Yet, so we use the oxygen tanks and then what is water made out of made up of",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
466,Luis,"Oh, I know that's one s H two o",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,And what does the a stamp or what is the O stands for,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
466,Luis,hydrogen and oxygen,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,"Great, so we will eventually use the water deposits and hopefully make that into the oxygen tank so that we can go to the moon and stay there",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
466,Luis,"um I was sorry I I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now, but I just wanted to say, I really appreciated, how you found a way that each of our answers could fit together",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
466,Luis,"But also helped us understand what each piece of equipment dead That was really helpful and learning from each other, you made that so easy Thank you so much",,,,response,0,1,3
466,Teacher,enjoy your lunch,,,,remark,0,1,3
466,Teacher,Start simulation,,,,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"Alright, everyone thanks for joining me and thanks for letting me look at your work",,,,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"Alright, so i'm noticing a lot of different responses and I want us to make sure that we have just a general understanding of the text so everyone has really good specific details and different questions yeah even",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
466,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,150.1,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"yeah I noticed that you have very specific details on oxygen tanks, which is really cool did you just",,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,Know do you just like to read about this on your own,,,140.1,remark,1,1,3
466,Luis,"Well, I watch YouTube and I watched Nova sometime so yeah you know about equipment that scientists use of space",,,140.1,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,awesome I love that you spend time to learn about science outside of class that's really impressive,,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"But I want us to look back at this question and we're going to debrief as a whole group, and then I want you to think about how the advice that i'm giving the whole group applies to your question does that sound good",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
466,Luis,Okay,,,150.1,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"All right back to the question at hand, everyone I want us when we're unpacking a question to look at specific details of what we're looking for",,,420.1,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,So if you're looking at the question we have what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"circle, the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question, so we need to make sure that we identify a specific piece of equipment that scientists used, and then the equipment is used to discover water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,amen so look at your response and then think about like does your the response that you wrote answer both of those two things,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"So when we're answering this, we want to name the equipment and we want to make sure that it's used to find the water",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,Take about 30 seconds,,,,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,alright,,,,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,let's debrief do you think that your response has both of those parts,,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
466,Farrah,"Okay, mine has the equipment, but not the second part",,,120.4,response,1,1,3
466,Farrah,"The second part, but not the first part",,,,response,1,1,3
466,Farrah,"I have both of the parts, so I don't understand why my interest wrong",,,,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,Oh really great point Farrah Farrah with yours on specifically I noticed that you did a really good job naming a piece of equipment and then telling me what it does,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"But one thing I want you to focus on at that you as well, because you to have pretty similar answers I want you to focus on the key action word, so we have that word discover right",,,420.1,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"So a microscope is a piece of equipment that does something, but does it discover so think about that piece of feedback and see how it applies to your work",,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"And then for Chris and Jazmin I noticed that you two have really great you know you either side, you have the first part, the second part that's great now we need to work on adding in that missing part",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"Of the question so look back at the text to fill in that gap that you had missing, you have a really great start",,,120.1,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,How about you Luis,,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
466,Luis,"i'm Okay, I guess, I have that first part two, because I got equipment, but I don't have anything about the water in the Mon",,,120.4,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"Alright, so you have the word equipment, but let's take it one step further, what specific piece of equipment is being used",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
466,Luis,The oxygen tanks,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"All right, what is the oxygen tank being used for",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
466,Luis,to breathe,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,Right and is that what we're looking for is a,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
466,Luis,"lot of equipment that scientists used to just go over water um, I guess, not because now, I guess",,,210.3,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,Right so glad that you were able to pick that up and go back to the question and read it and notice that mismatch between your answer in the question,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,so go back to the text and see try to find the piece of equipment that specifically discovering water on the moon,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
466,Luis,Okay,,,310.1,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,1,1,3
466,Farrah,Okay um so,,,,response,1,1,3
466,Farrah,I think that the the my the microscope,,,,response,1,1,3
466,Farrah,doesn't discover the water,,,,response,1,1,3
466,Farrah,But I don't see discover in the in the story,,,,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,ooh I like that you're looking for that keyword right,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,so you're saying we know we need to discover something so maybe it's a good,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
466,All,"Oh, oh teacher you're frozen, can you see me and hear me",,,310.1,,1,1,3
466,All,teacher,,,,,1,1,3
466,All,Oh,,,,,1,1,3
466,All,i'm,,,,,1,1,3
466,All,"guys, are we frozen or is a teacher frozen",,,,,1,1,3
466,All,On I think the teachers frozen yeah I think the teachers frozen,,,,,1,1,3
466,All,yeah I don't know if she can hear us,,,,,1,1,3
466,All,Maybe somebody should try to write in the chat box,,,,,1,1,3
466,All,Okay i'm gonna write in the chat box,,,,,1,1,3
466,All,Oh nevermind to vanish,,,,,1,1,3
466,All,Jazmin she's gone,,,,,1,1,3
466,Farrah,Okay yeah oh she's back okay um,,,,response,1,1,3
466,Farrah,I don't remember what I was saying no oh,,,,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"yeah sorry about that, let me remind you, so what is another word that means the same thing as discover",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
466,Farrah,Oh um find,,,210.2,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,Fine yeah yeah so to find think about that general idea and see if you could find to go back into the text and find something that's similar so words that are like discover the not necessarily discover,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
466,Chris,"So I found the equipment, because Jazmin told me what it was, but I was thinking you know I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,420.3,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,yeah they do use a lot of equipment for many different things,,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"but once again thinking back to the question itself, what do we want the specific equipment to do",,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,Exactly,,,,remark,1,1,3
466,Jazmin,Okay um so then,,,,response,1,1,3
466,Jazmin,"So I just have to add the water on the moon part for mine case I have the equipment, so I can say NASA send to small machine to discover water on the moon",,,,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"I think that is a great response, but I know that you could go even one step",,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,Beyond right so just by what do you think would make your response one bit higher so you tell me the equipment,,,210.3,remark,1,1,3
466,Jazmin,And I told you,,,210.3,response,1,1,3
466,Jazmin,I said,,,,response,1,1,3
466,Jazmin,What was discovered and I said the were on the moon,,,,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,What was your what,,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
466,Jazmin,And I said the who,,,230.1,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,"The small machine, what is this machine",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
466,Jazmin,lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,There you go,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
466,Jazmin,OK,,,110.1,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,OK so i'll just add that part in,,,,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,1,3
466,Oliver,Excuse me teacher yeah I was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so um thanks for taking time to work with us,,,,response,1,1,3
466,Teacher,yeah of course Thank you,,,,remark,1,1,3
466,Teacher,start simulation,,,,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"Alright, everyone thanks for sharing your responses with the group i'm noticing some things right i'm noticing that we each sort of have different answers, and I have a question to you, why do you think we each have different answers",,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
466,Luis,"guys, we are all different people with different ideas I mean I shouldn't even be in this group I already know all about space",,,230.1,response,2,1,3
466,Teacher,You know all about space so cool,,,110.3,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"do you like like space, do you like to",,,140.1,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,work with it outside of class,,,,remark,2,1,3
466,Luis,wow I mean I I watch a YouTube video was a lot about the space and i'm and I follow you on musk on Twitter,,,,response,2,1,3
466,Teacher,love,,,,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,You on musk such a card all right let's come back to this question up front right so everyone sort of has different answers,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"And everyone has really good parts of answers and some parts that we can work on, so I want to give you a strategy that I think would be really helpful for us to like make our responses more concise and find out what we're looking for",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"cells to do that let's go ahead and look back at the first question, and what I want you to do this is like a really like he tip that would be super helpful and you could use later on to",,,420.1,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"So what I want you to do is first find the most important word in the question, but the question is asking you for you to answer it",,,420.1,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,So look back at the question and then I want you to read it and pick the most important word that will help us answer the question take 10 seconds and then we'll come back,,,420.1,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"All right, what do you think was the most important question or the most important word that the question was asking you",,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
466,Jazmin,"I said equipment, I said equipment to",,,120.4,response,2,1,3
466,Teacher,Farrah What did you say,,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,awesome,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
466,Farrah,I said discover,,,110.1,response,2,1,3
466,Chris,water,,,,response,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"Oh awesome everyone pulled out really interesting words, but I want to highlight Jazmin Luis and Oliver I think y'all were spot on",,,110.4,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"With the word equipment, because that's what we're looking for right, we want to make sure we include a piece of equipment",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"And then Farrah to go to yours, I think that's also a key word because that's telling us the action that the equipment is doing so, we need a piece of equipment that's going to discover and to pull it all together Chris, we need to discover water right",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,So in our response we're going to look for a piece of equipment that specifically us to discover water,,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"So, now that we know exactly what we want to find yes ma'am",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
466,Farrah,"yeah excuse me, I have all those, so I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,150.1,response,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"ooh really great detail with your Farrah I loved how you did all those three steps right, you told me here's a piece of equipment, this is what it does now question to you, does",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"What I want you to look for right, so you pulled out the word of discover does your piece of equipment discover water or does it do something else, is it just one equipment to find it are we using it to discover it think about that",,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
466,Farrah,It looks really closely,,,210.3,response,2,1,3
466,Farrah,looks really closely,,,,response,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"Alright, so might be an option to look at right, but maybe I want you to look back in the text and see if you could find another piece of equipment that's more closely tied to discovering that water amen",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"And then, for the rest of us look back at your response and then see if you have those three things did you name a piece of equipment and does that piece of equipment discover the water on the moon, to take 30 seconds back in your work and see if that does that",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
466,Chris,"Okay, so yeah I didn't have equipment in mind, but I do know cuz I went to NASA that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks and suits",,,420.2,response,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"let's think back to the question right, what do we specifically want our equipment to do",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"Alright, so they definitely use a lot of equipment and it's so cool that you've gone to NASA that's amazing",,,110.3,remark,2,1,3
466,Chris,And to discover the water,,,210.2,response,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"Exactly so in your response, did you name an equipment that discovers water",,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
466,Chris,"No, I forgot to put that part in",,,210.3,response,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"All right, go ahead and look backward in the text, what about the rest of us",,,120.3,remark,2,1,3
466,Chris,"I forgot to put the discovering water part, but I did put the equipment in my answer",,,120.3,response,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"hi Jazmin with your response, I did say that you include a piece of equipment, but I think it could be more specific right, I think you could go back to the text and tell me the specific name of the piece of equipment that you're talking about",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
466,Jazmin,Okay,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
466,Jazmin,Oh it's the Lunar orbiter,,,,response,2,1,3
466,Teacher,Exactly so always more into adding those key details but make sure that you update that information and then add the part that you said you were missing,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
466,Jazmin,"So I can just add in call it a lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon, and then this is a good answer is it right",,,420.2,response,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"yep and then, of course, because we're amazing students, you want to make sure that the last thing we do is we always explain our why, and in this case i'm asking you to highlight where you find that in the text so just make sure that you're highlighting that",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
466,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,1,3
466,Jazmin,"like in paragraph two, I just have to add that right",,,,response,2,1,3
466,Teacher,"Yes, pull out that one",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
466,Jazmin,I found it in paragraph two,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
466,Teacher,awesome OK OK,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
466,Oliver,"i'm teacher, I looked at the clock out it's time for us to go to lunch um, but I do want to say thank you for explaining what strategies we can use to try and",,,110.1,response,2,1,3
466,Oliver,"and have more full answers, because I was listening and now I kind of know that we can add more evidence from the text in our answer and thanks for taking the time that i'm explaining that strategy",,,,response,2,1,3
466,Oliver,Bye bye,,,,response,2,1,3
469,Teacher,"hi everyone Good morning, my name is Teacher and i'll be your teacher today",,,,remark,0,0,3

469,Teacher,Good morning Luis,,,,remark,0,0,3
469,Luis,um so um I I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,maybe even could could we get started looking at your your answer and maybe we can work together to try to see if that worked with the text and we can all learn from each other how's that sound,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"that's great you must read a lot about space, you must learn a lot about it",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
469,Luis,That sounds great yeah let's do it,,,150.1,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,Okay um so Luis your answer was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"Okay, so it sounds like, where did you learn that fact",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
469,Luis,"Oh well, anytime that there are scientists out in space they need to have oxygen tanks that's just like basic space stuff",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"Oh, and why do they need the oxygen tank",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
469,Luis,"Oh well, typically you can't breathe in space without an oxygen tank",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"i'm wondering, could you read the question that we wanted to answer out loud for everybody",,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,that's true okay so that's a very interesting fact,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
469,Luis,"um yeah Okay, so it asked what equipment did scients use to discover water on the moon",,,110.1,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,And the next part of the question,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
469,Luis,"um it says okay circle circle, the evidence and the text that we can use to answer this question",,,120.3,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"Okay, so the question is asking us about discovering water on the moon, and where are we going to find the answer",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
469,Luis,i'm,,,210.2,response,0,0,3
469,Luis,In that text,,,,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,And the text right was the oxygen tank information in the text or was that from from all your knowledge you already have,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
469,Luis,Oh,,,210.3,response,0,0,3
469,Luis,"I guess it doesn't say oxygen tanks, but it says, scientists, so if they're scientists there's oxygen tanks",,,,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"Okay okay well that's it that is good that there's oxygen tanks, but to discover this water they're going to need more than oxygen tanks right probably going to need more",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,So okay i'm wondering if we can maybe move to another student and let's try to see some of their answers and how we can get closer to the answer in the text,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher, Sound good Luis,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
469,Luis,um yeah yeah okay,,,150.1,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"Okay, great, and if you have anything to add in about your background knowledge we'd love to hear it okay",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"Alright, so let's move on um let's see uh Jazmin can you read what your answer was please",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
469,Jazmin,"Okay, so I said yes, I said NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,120.4,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,So Jazmin was that answer directly from the text first,,,230.2,remark,0,0,3
469,Jazmin,yeah yeah it's it's in Part two,,,230.2,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,Part two great thanks for referencing us all to the text so everybody look take a look at your text right paragraph two right NASA send a small machine,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"it's in the text right you're exactly right Jazmin great job connecting directly from the text, so this is what we're looking for when we mean finding directly from the text i'm",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"I am wondering if we could get more specific Jazmin right so small machine, I can think of a lot of small machines right maybe a washing machine right like do you think they used a washing machine to find this",,,430.2,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"Right, so can we get more specific, to help us have a better knowledge base here, do you think that maybe there's more information in the text around that section to help us get specific",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
469,Jazmin,"Okay, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,420.2,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"Okay, is there a name of the specific machine there that you found Jazmin",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
469,Jazmin,lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"Okay, great so can we all see how that gets more specific and now we know some specific science vocabulary right,so that would be something you want to add to your response so just extend that circle Jazmin and I think that would be a much clearer response",,,420.2,remark,0,0,3
469,Jazmin,yeah,,,420.2,response,0,0,3
469,Jazmin,"That makes sense, no washing machine",,,,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"no washing machine, but I mean I don't know how they wash their clothes, but that that would be a different different text right",,,140.1,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"let's move on, so um Chris, could you please read your response out loud",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
469,Chris,"Okay, so I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,120.4,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"Okay, so very good, so this is about you found the part in the text right about them locating the craters and that's the location right that's where was this water right but",,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"let's go back to the question, can you maybe the first",,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"few words of that first question there, please",,,,remark,0,0,3
469,Chris,What equipment do scientists use,,,,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"Okay, good so if there's a question about maybe where or what is it asking us really",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
469,Chris,Okay it's asking what equipment,,,210.2,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher," Okay, and did your answer have anything about the equipment in it",,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,Yeah what equipment,,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
469,Chris,"No, but but I went to NASA actually I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but also have masks and suits",,,210.3,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,that's right yeah so just like Luis was saying there's a lot of equipment when you're out in space,,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"Does anybody have that in the in the question, what was this equipment, helping them to do",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"But the question right is about the purpose there's a specific kind of equipment right that the equipment, what are the equipment, help them do",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher, Farrah yeah,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
469,Farrah,i'm to discover water on the moon,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher, When I discover something right did I know where it was before that,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"Okay, to discover right discover",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
469,Farrah,No,,,210.2,response,0,0,3

469,Teacher,"No yeah Oliver, something to add",,,,remark,0,0,3
469,Oliver,"um well I just looked at the clock and unfortunately it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to each answer on and helping each person all back to the question",,,,response,0,0,3
469,Oliver,"and understand what they needed to work on, you were so specific and helpful Thank you so much",,,,response,0,0,3
469,Teacher,"you're welcome, I look forward to seeing you all again soon",,,,remark,0,0,3

470,Teacher,i'm excited too,,,,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,So um did you all read the text about water on the moon?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,2
470,Luis,"Um yeah we all read it, but I I don't think I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,150.1,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher,So could you please tell us what do you know about space and why do you think it's interesting?,,,140.1,remark,0,0,2
470,Luis, We just know we have our planet and we have the Milky Way but the world could be the universe could be enormous and there could even be life out there,,,140.1,response,0,0,2
470,Luis,"Oh well, space is so cool because it's so mysterious like how big is the universe? we don't even know",,,140.1,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher," So um, do you know what is our question for today?",,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,"yeah definitely definitely agree, so the universe is so mysterious, and there is very large space for us to explore",,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
470,Luis,um yeah it is it's right here it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.3,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher,yeah what equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,So could anyone tell me how do you think about this question so what's your answer to this?,,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,0,0,2
470,Chris,"Oh yeah Okay, well, I can go, so my answer is that scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher,Oh scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,yeah So could you please tell me more like about how you figure dthat out? So where did you find that information in this text?,,,230.2,remark,0,0,2
470,Chris,"yeah, so I think that was what the first part, part one, it says in the very first sentence actually scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters",,,230.2,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher,"yeah yeah I agree that scientists did find some evidence that there was water on the moon, but do you think that the crater the craters are full of water?",,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,"So did you have any other thoughts about it, if we just look at this paragraph, especially the second sentence",,,120.1,remark,0,0,2
470,Chris,"I guess I was I was picturing the really big craters and um like pools or lakes of water, because craters are really big, right?",,,120.1,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher, So what do you think is this ice deposits refer to? Oliver,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher," Okay, so if we can look at the second if we can look at the fourth sentence: this lunar orbiter looks for ice the deposits in a large polar crater",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,"Yeah, yeah definitely",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
470,Oliver,"Okay, well, it says so, the ice deposits are like the water actually, It's frozen water because it's ice and that's that's the water they found and um actually Chris, I think it says it's really small, it's microscopic",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
470,Farrah,"yeah that's why that's why we picked our answer, me and Oliver, we said you'd need the microscope to find the water, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher,yeah just like what Oliver just the said,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,Like the scientists did use the microscope to,,,,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,"yeah we did see this word microscope in this paragraph, like in the lesson is you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,"However, if we take a look a sentence earlier, like the water they found is microscopic",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher," So here, the word microscopic, could you please use another word to replace it? So what which word would you use, Farrah?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
470,Farrah,I would say tiny,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher, So what does this mean is that the water that we can find currently on the moon is really tiny it's really limited,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,tiny yeah that's great so microscopic here means tiny,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,"It doesn't mean that we use the tool named the microscope to find it, but the water we find is very microscopic, which means it is very limited and tiny",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,"So, if we take a step further, to see what kind of equipment scientists use to find water which other answers can you get from this paragraph? Jazmin",,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
470,Jazmin,"Oh well, Okay, I said that NASA sent a small machine",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher," So, oh Chris",,,,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,Machine,,,,remark,0,0,2
470,Chris,I wanted to add to that because I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher,"But here in this paragraph, they just name one, so what is the one equipment, if you look at the first sentence",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,"wow that's so cool so they have a lot of equipments, as you have mentioned, yeah",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher," Luis, could you please read it, for us, the first sentence",,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,but anyone read it out to the whole class,,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
470,Luis,um in part one or part two?,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher,Part one,,,,remark,0,0,2
470,Luis,Okay um scientists have found evidence of water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters,,,,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher,"yeah and um Could you also please read, for us, the first sentence of Part two",,,120.3,remark,0,0,2
470,Luis,Okay okay NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,120.3,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher,yeah Thank you that's great So here we saw the name of a lunar orbiter so could anyone tell me what is a lunar orbiter here in this paragraph? So what is this function?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
470,Jazmin,"Oh, I think I can I can do it",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher,yeah please go ahead,,,,remark,0,0,2
470,Jazmin,"It well, it says, investigate and that means to to search for something and to try and look for it, so I think that the machine is finding where on the moon, the water is",,,,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher,"So here if we go back to the question, what kind of equipment scientists used to find water on the moon, so what is our answer?",,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,"yeah, this is a really good answer, so the machine is used to find where on the moon the water is",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,"and Oliver, could you please tell us?",,,120.4,remark,0,0,2
470,Oliver,"Yeah, yeah well so um it sounds like the right answer is actually the Lunar orbiter and",,,120.4,response,0,0,2
470,Oliver,"I i'm so sorry to do this um but I looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch, but before we go, I wanted to say the way you helped us understand what we were um",,,,response,0,0,2
470,Oliver,"The way you helped us understand what we didn't understand was really helpful because you explained that microscopic didn't mean they had to use a microscope and you helped us find the right machine in the text, so thank you for being so clear with how to use the text",,,,response,0,0,2
470,Teacher,"Oh, thank you all, thank you for your active participation so yeah so the class is over, and you can go for your lunch",,,,remark,0,0,2
470,Teacher,Bye,,,,remark,0,0,2
470,Farrah,Hello,,,,response,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"hi hi everyone so glad to see you, and a very glad to see that you've all contributed valuable thinking towards answering this comprehension question",,,,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,So today what we will do is to probe into this comprehension question and to have a classroom discussion,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"So what we are going to do first is to work, individually and then we will go into free discussion and some elbow exchange",,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"And will also give personalized feedback during this process, and finally, we will reflect on the strategies and thoughts that led us to the revised response",,,220.1,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,So what I want to do now is to circle one or two no more than three key words and phrases that you think the most important in this question so remember it should be something that leads you to your response so let's take a few minutes to do that okay let's start,,,420.1,remark,1,0,2
470,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,420.1,response,1,0,2
470,Teacher,yeah Luis I really appreciate that you have a strong interest in this film and I know from your answer that you're really an expert in this,,,420.2,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"But I will suggest that how about we for now we focus more on the text itself and, like to circle, the key word that you think is the most important in this question and then we can see how your prior knowledge in the universe can help us answer this question better",,,,remark,1,0,2
470,Luis,"Okay, I'll Take a look",,,,response,1,0,2
470,Teacher,Okay that's great,,,,remark,1,0,2
470,Chris,I think we're ready,,,,response,1,0,2
470,Teacher,Great okay so tell me about the word phrase that you just circled,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,Oliver?,,,,remark,1,0,2
470,Oliver,I picked up from the question the word equipment,,,,response,1,0,2
470,Teacher,equipment whoa that's really great,,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"okay so on Oliver, could you please read for me your answer",,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
470,Oliver,yeah okay well I forgot the same answer as Farrah that is um microscope,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"Oh microscope okay i'm okay so, then I have another question for you so that you have a really good observation that equipment is really a key word in this question",,,,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,so could anyone tell me what is the action in this question,,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,But another really important part of his question is the action,,,410.1,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,1,0,2
470,Jazmin,"Oh, I have my hand raised",,,,response,1,0,2
470,Teacher,Oh sorry,,,,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"Go go ahead, please",,,,remark,1,0,2
470,Jazmin,"Okay um yeah it's Jazmin I picked the action that's why I raised my hand and the action and the question is discover, and so my answer was about the small machine and and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"Okay Jazmin I noticed that yeah so first of all, you on finding up the keyword discover is really great",,,210.2,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"Discover is the action verb that we want to emphasize on for answering this question and i've noticed that, on your answer is like really matches what the question is asked about because",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"you notice that it is about the equipment that NASA used, but I also suggest you to be more specific, to do that why don't you take a closer look at the text",,,,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"And the paragraphs from where you extracted your answer, so you should just like give the name of the machine and to be more specific okay",,,430.2,remark,1,0,2
470,Jazmin,"yeah um it's called the moon, let me find it on lunar orbiter",,,430.2,response,1,0,2
470,Teacher,lunar orbiter whoa that's really great yeah it's the name of the equipment,,,110.4,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,so could anyone like to have a dialogue about that,,,150.1,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"so um did anyone have a different answer from Jazmin,",,,130.2,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"I noticed that Farrah and Luis, then they also named the equipment but a different one",,,230.3,remark,1,0,2
470,Chris,yeah um I I have an idea,,,230.3,response,1,0,2
470,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,let's go ahead,,,120.4,remark,1,0,2
470,Chris,Okay well um so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,120.4,response,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"Well, so, as you just said about yourself you're really an expert in this, and I really appreciate that you um",,,110.3,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"That you used your past knowledge to answer this question and I really would encourage you to explore it in more depth, it is your field of interest",,,,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"However, if you focus on the text more closely Luis you can find that the tax not really mentioned the thing in your answer, so the oxygen machine and, in other words",,,,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,You should like make your answer more aligned with what the text is exactly talking about right So could you please tell me the name of the machine that appeared in this text,,,430.2,remark,1,0,2
470,Chris,"Well I gues it's what Jazmin said, maybe",,,430.2,response,1,0,2
470,Teacher,The lunar orbiter right,,,130.3,remark,1,0,2
470,Chris,yeah that wasn't the story,,,130.3,response,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"Okay, so you just me you come up with the answer lunar orbiter, but I also noticed the other people who had different answers so for those who have different from lunar orbiter, could you please tell me how you come up with that answer",,,230.1,remark,1,0,2
470,Farrah,"yeah i'm Oh, this is Farrah so I found my answer in part three, in paragraph three, where they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,230.1,response,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"so Farrah, could you please tell me that in the sentences were in the lines that you found a word microscope where did it specify the function of microscope",,,230.2,remark,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"Okay, so yeah you give a specific answer that included the name of the equipment that's really concrete",,,310.1,remark,1,0,2
470,Farrah,"Who, I really want to keep going but it's time for us to go",,,230.2,response,1,0,2
470,Teacher,"Okay, then we will have a discuss later after we come back",,,,remark,1,0,2
471,Teacher,"All right, you all gave such great responses to this question now, I just want us to all take a look back at the question i'm going to read it, and if you could just follow along yes Luis",,,120.3,remark,0,1,4
471,Luis,Up yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,120.3,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,that's amazing i'm so glad that you're bringing in your background knowledge,,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"But we are just going back over this question, we want to get as much out of this text as possible, even if you already know all about space",,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"they're still lots that we can learn from this passage, I promise, so if we could all just look",,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"At the question i'm going to read it if you could follow along what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon circle, the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question",,,120.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,Can everyone circle one word in the question that you think is the most important word to focus on when answering it,,,420.1,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"All right, would anyone like to share What were they circled",,,120.4,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,0,1,4
471,Chris,So that I circled is all water,,,,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,Water great okay that's a great idea Jazmin,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
471,Jazmin,"Okay, well, I circled discover",,,110.1,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,did anyone circle something different Farrah,,,130.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,Great another great keyword,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
471,Farrah,yeah actually I circled of equipment,,,110.1,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,equipment that's interesting okay so Farrah circled equipment,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"which I think is an awesome keyword because, although discover and water are also great keywords",,,210.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"and equipment is the thing, the object that we're focusing on to try to find evidence for in the passage so",,,,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"let's talk about what Farrah said before she said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's a great point a microscope is a great scientific tool",,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,But did they use a microscope to find the water on the moon,,,210.3,remark,0,1,4
471,Farrah,"Oh well, I guess, I was thinking, yes, because how can you find something if you can't see it",,,210.3,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,Well that's fair yeah that's definitely fair okay,,,110.1,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"um what else could they have used, I think that somebody else yes Jazmin",,,130.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Jazmin,"um yeah so my answer was that NASA Center small machine head, so I don't understand why my answers room",,,130.2,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,can you tell me where in the text you see the word small machine,,,230.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,and it doesn't have to be Jazmin somebody else can help her out if you want just find the line in the text that says that NASA sent a small machine,,,130.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,it's not wrong they definitely did use a small machine,,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Jazmin,"And I can, I can tell you where I found it, I found it in part to the beginning of Part two",,,110.2,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"that's an awesome answer Jazmin, I think, maybe to make it a little bit more detailed, you can include the name of the small machine",,,420.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,Great so it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,120.3,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,And that definitely is part of the equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,110.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,and did you circle that sentence in the text,,,230.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Jazmin,Oh no I just circled small machine,,,110.2,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"Okay, great so that's almost there I think if you had circled that whole sentence and they investigated the Lunar orbiter and then, if we put that together with savannas answer",,,130.1,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,about the microscope both of those two tools together would be exactly what they used to discover water on the moon,,,130.3,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"Oliver what you circle, you said you circle, the same thing as Farrah, can you tell me exactly which part of the text you circled",,,230.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Oliver,Oh yeah well I just supposed to work on my scope i'm i'm still a little confused about why the small machine is there um because I thought it was just a microscope and I don't think I want to pick small machine,,,230.2,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,yeah that's fair does anybody have have some input for Oliver as to why the small machine is also important Luis,,,130.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Luis,"Okay, so Oliver the machine is called a lunar orbiter, and so the orbiter it i'm excited to where the water is because a microscope a microscope is really small like depth, can you picture astronaut walking around the big giant mode like a tiny little less that would take",,,130.2,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,that's a really good point anything I think that's a great explanation does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
471,Oliver,yeah so what they did use a microscope at some point right,,,150.1,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"Absolutely Chris, do you want to clarify that",,,130.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Chris,"Well, I was just going to add since we're talking about all the equipment that I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,130.2,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"actually even said something about that in his answer didn't he that scientists use a lot of equipment, including oxygen tanks, which is totally right",,,230.3,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,yeah that's super true,,,110.3,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"But remember how we circled we did circle equipment, but we also circled the world's water and discover so we're looking for pieces of equipment",,,210.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"That the scientists use to discover water on the moon, and in this case they're not using the oxygen tanks to discover the water they're using them to help them breathe so they're super important but they're not exactly answering the question right",,,410.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,So Oliver are you still wondering about the microscope can we explain that a little better,,,150.1,remark,0,1,4
471,Oliver,are so um yeah i'm still wondering about when they use it,,,150.1,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"yeah does anybody know when they use it, based on the text we can look in part three",,,130.2,remark,0,1,4
471,Oliver,So,,,130.2,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,Well let's see the water they found is microscopic you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so let's see if we can make an inference who can tell me what influences,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,Does anyone know what the differences yeah go ahead Jazmin,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
471,Jazmin,"i'm so sorry for himself when he described it, this when when the text makes you think of something but it's not on the page",,,210.4,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,that's exactly right so an inference is when we use the clues that the text is giving us,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"To come up with something that we think, to be true, but that's not necessarily written there that was great Jazmin so",,,,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"If we know that first they use the Lunar orbiter to investigate and find those ice deposits, they found the water in those craters just like Chris said in his response",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,And then those water particles were so small that you would need a microscope to see them when would they use that microscope,,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
471,Oliver,Oh um maybe like after after the Lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"Absolutely, I think you're exactly right to the end i'm no expert on space exploration, but I think that, from the text we can make an inference that says First they go with the Lunar lunar orbiter and then they go in with the microscope yes",,,210.4,remark,0,1,4
471,Oliver,um well I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i'm going to say thank you so much for helping us use the key words to answer the question,,,210.4,response,0,1,4
471,Oliver,"And also understanding how to make an inference about the best answer I feel like I learned a lot, even in just a few minutes, thank you",,,,response,0,1,4
471,Teacher,Thank you guys so much enjoy your lunch,,,,remark,0,1,4
471,Teacher,"Hello friends Thank you so much for revising your responses to the question what equipment did scientists us to discover water on the moon so Farrah Chris and Luis, thank you for sharing your revised responses um Does anyone want oh yes Luis",,,110.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Luis,um yeah I shouldn't be in this group I already corrected my answer,,,110.1,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,"Well, we are working towards the fullest most correct answers to this question possible together so we're going to try to help each other as a group, come to responses that completely answered the question does that sound okay",,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Luis,um yeah,,,150.1,response,1,1,4
471,Luis,I guess okay,,,,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,Great so Luis now that you're participating already Would you mind telling me what you're thinking was when you went back to try to revise your response,,,530.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Luis,"yeah sure So my first answer once about oxygen tanks, which i'm well, I still kind of think that's true, but you have to use evidence from this story for this question so, then I found the equipment and the story, which is the machine",,,530.1,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,Great that's awesome,,,,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,"Did anyone else use that strategy, when they were going back to revise their answers",,,510.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,I really appreciate how you went back to the text and found evidence to include in your answer,,,310.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,1,1,4
471,Jazmin,"Yes, um I found more evidence in the text when I revise my answer, because it wasn't it didn't have enough information from the text I needed more evidence to make it clearer",,,,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,okay so looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a great strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely,,,510.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,that's a great point,,,310.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,is there anything else did anyone do anything different when they were revising their answer,,,530.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,1,1,4
471,Farrah,"um well Okay, I would say, I did that, too, but what I did more was I reread the question",,,,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,that's a great point Farrah,,,310.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,when you read that question did you circle key words or underline things What was your strategy there,,,230.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Farrah,yeah I looked more at the word discover,,,230.1,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,Great discover what's another important word in the question that we might want to focus on to make sure we're answering it completely,,,210.2,remark,1,1,4
471,Farrah,equipment equipment and discover yeah,,,210.2,response,1,1,4
471,Farrah,that's how I changed my answer,,,,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,that's great,,,110.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,and so i'm savannas answer was scientists use the Lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon do we think that answer the questions completely? Oliver,,,210.3,remark,1,1,4
471,Oliver,um yeah I change my answer too,,,110.1,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,that's awesome do you want to tell me your revised answer,,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
471,Oliver,yeah um,,,120.4,response,1,1,4
471,Oliver,"I cricled lunar orbiter, same thing as Farrah",,,,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,Great and lunar orbiter is the piece of equipment that's one of the key words we circled in the question right,,,,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,I would like everybody to take out,,,,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,"And it's the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon, so I think that's a great full answer Farrah and Oliver that's awesome",,,230.3,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,"A piece of paper or you can use your ipads right in front of you, and think about these questions and write down your answers silently for about 30 seconds",,,,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,"So we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies, the next time we come across a question like this, so",,,510.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,"First you're going to answer I started out thinking blank then you're going to answer, and now I think blank because blank go ahead and take 30 seconds to answer those questions",,,530.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,"Great Okay, now that you have those answers the last part is so next time I see a question asking about a text, I will so go ahead and finish that thinking routine",,,520.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,"Alright, would anyone like to share what they wrote for those questions Chris go ahead",,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
471,Chris,"Well, first, I was wondering, is my new answer okay",,,120.4,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,Absolutely so let's go over your new answer the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic So what did you do when you went back to the text to find this answer what was your strategy,,,230.2,remark,1,1,4
471,Chris,When I read the text again like a,,,230.2,response,1,1,4
471,Chris,"Really carefully on and that's how I found out the water was microscopic which is kind of near the end of the story, and I think when I read it the first time I really focused on the beginning of the story",,,,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,"Okay, great I appreciate how you were looking at the whole story in a really detailed way to pick out that evidence, just like Luis was picking out that evidence and so was Farrah Oliver and Jazmin so",,,310.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,"What else did we do Do you remember when we were talking before about Farrah's strategy, what else did Farrah do to make sure that she was answering the question completely",,,230.3,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,We went back to the text and we looked for evidence right  what else did we look back at to make sure that we were answering,,,230.3,remark,1,1,4
471,Chris,The question,,,230.3,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,"Was yes absolutely Okay, so we picked up some important keywords in that question right",,,230.3,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,Does anyone want to talk about those keywords again who's got a key word for me Luis,,,210.2,remark,1,1,4
471,Luis,"Chris, it's equipment and also discover",,,210.2,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,"yup Chris, do you think there are any other words in the question that you would circle, in addition to those",,,210.2,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,equipment and discover or two great words,,,110.4,remark,1,1,4
471,Chris,yeah I was thinking water,,,210.2,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,"Water great okay so equipment discover and water so keeping in mind those key words and using that evidence from the text, can you look at your revised answer and make sure that you answered the question completely",,,420.2,remark,1,1,4
471,Chris,"Equipment, discover, water, my answer does not have equipment",,,420.2,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,"Great I love how you're reflecting on the keywords in that question and you realize that you were missing a little part of the question, there",,,310.1,remark,1,1,4
471,Teacher,So you can use that strategy we're already using to go back and look at that evidence in the text and then revise your answer to make it a little bit more complete and address every part of the question does that sound good,,,420.2,remark,1,1,4
471,Chris,yeah yeah,,,420.2,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,Great yes def,,,,remark,1,1,4
471,Oliver,And i'm really sorry I wish we could keep going but,,,,response,1,1,4
471,Oliver,We have to go now it's time for us to go,,,,response,1,1,4
471,Teacher,"All right, well, thank you guys so much thanks for rising your answers",,,,remark,1,1,4
472,Teacher, My name is Teacher and i'm excited to be here,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher, So we're talking about this article about water on the moon right?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,hi everyone i'm so excited to meet you,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,yeah Luis,,,,remark,0,0,4
472,Luis,um yeah excuse me um I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"Oh yeah that's great um so Luis i'm glad you're here because we're gonna be talking a lot about space, this is not a group for people that don't know about space, this is a group for people that are excited to learn more about space",,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,But I have a question for you so we're talking about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher, Does anyone know what the word equipment is? or do we want to talk about that a little bit more?,,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,Does anyone know what the word equipment is?,,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"yeah Jazmin, what do you know about the word equipment?",,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
472,Jazmin,"equipment is like a tool, or like something you use to do something",,,210.2,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"yeah exactly so I brought a few examples, so if you were a baker some equipment that you might use would be a whisk",,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"And if you were an artist, maybe some equipment, you would use would be a marker",,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher," So equipment is a tool that you use to do your job, and if you were a scientist, you would be using some equipment to help you discover water on the moon right?",,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
472,Jazmin,yeah,,,210.2,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,So we're thinking about what tools or what equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.4,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher, So Farrah can you remind me what your answer was? what did what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon?,,,120.4,remark,0,0,4
472,Farrah,"Okay, so I said that you'd need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely",,,120.4,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"Oh OK, and then Oliver can you tell me what you said, as your as your answer?",,,120.4,remark,0,0,4
472,Oliver,yeah I circled the same as Farrah,,,120.4,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"Okay, so you would also use a microscope",,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher, So you're right you're both right that a microscope is a tool that scientists use to help them look closer at things,,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"But I'm wondering, Farrah could you read out loud the second paragraph that starts with NASA in the moon is a desert and Oliver while, while she's reading, could you listen for what tool they talk about that helps them discover water?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
472,Farrah,Okay,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher," Go ahead, Farrah",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher, Okay,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"Well, or we could all, so we could all look for what tool NASA uses to help discover",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
472,Farrah, This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit in a large polar crater,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
472,Farrah,"Part two Okay, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
472,Farrah, These ice deposits are very small,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher," What were they doing, what were they using?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,Excellent Farrah Thank you so much,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher," So Oliver, what what kind of tool were they using there? they were they were looking for water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
472,Oliver,In that part they talked about the lunar orbiter I guess,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"yeah, so this is something that-",,,,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,yeah go ahead Jazmin,,,,remark,0,0,4
472,Jazmin," I said that NASA sent a small machine, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,0,4
472,Jazmin,"yeah well with with what Oliver just said, that was actually my answer",,,,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"Oh, your answer is not wrong",,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher, They did send a small machine so that's equipment that they would use,,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"But i'm wondering if we can go even more specific right because this isn't just a tool that an artist uses this isn't just a marker, but this is what kind of marker? what color is this?",,,410.2,remark,0,0,4
472,Jazmin,Red,,,410.2,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,yeah and what - is it-,,,,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,Are there any other words you would use to describe this marker?,,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
472,Chris,I would say it's like a thin marker,,,210.3,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,yeah do you um,,,,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher," So we know that NASA sent a small machine, but what kind of small machine was it?",,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,yeah so there's those are some details that you can use to describe things,,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"Do we know what kind of small machine because, like my my mouse right here is also a small machine, but I don't think that they sent this kind of small machine",,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,What kind of small machine did they send?,,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
472,Jazmin,"Well, it says, I don't know what it looks like or anything but it says it's a lunar orbiter right that's what Farrah read",,,210.3,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,yeah a lunar orbiter yeah so that's the name of it that's getting more specific and more into the details that the the writer used,,,310.1,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,Luis is there anything else? oh Chris yeah do you have a question?,,,,remark,0,0,4
472,Chris,"yeah well it's more of a comment, actually, so I I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"that's true yeah, and so I wonder if",,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,Do you think that they're using those when they're using the small machine?,,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,When they're- Do you think that they're wearing their oxygen masks and wearing the suits?,,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
472,Chris,"yeah well, they would have to to stay alive on the moon",,,210.3,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"Oh right right, so I wonder Chris if they're if they're wearing all those things and they're using their lunar orbiter, then what how did they use the Lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon?",,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"I wonder if you could, I wonder if you could read the the second sentence in paragraph two",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
472,Chris,"yeah I can do that Oh, it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"ooh so we're building our details of what this orbiter could look like and we're kind of, even if we don't know what a lunar orbiter is, we're kind of making some guesses right? So what do you think it's a small, we know it's a small machine and Chris, what else do we know about it now?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
472,Chris,um it can go deep into the crater to find the ice,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"yeah, what do you think what kind of guesses do you have for what it's using to get into the into the crater?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"yeah, Luis",,,,remark,0,0,4
472,Luis,"um well I think it's kind of like a robot, and so it can kind of like go around well it's called an orbiter and so that means it goes around",,,,response,0,0,4
472,Luis,"the moon, and so I think probably they're using like some kind of signal, maybe, and they scan the moon, like a scanner for water, maybe I don't know that's what I think",,,,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"Yeah these are such good guesses right, and that's a great way to use what you already know about the word orbiter to understand what a lunar orbiter is",,,310.1,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"because sometimes readers, even if they don't have all the details, they make a picture in their head and they might update that picture as they keep reading, but they start to form an idea in their head in a picture of what that would look like",,,310.1,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher," Yeah, Oliver",,,310.1,remark,0,0,4
472,Oliver,i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock,,,310.1,response,0,0,4
472,Oliver, that really helped and finding the most specific answer for the question,,,,response,0,0,4
472,Oliver,"And it's time for us to go to lunch, but before we go, I wanted to say thank you so much for really helping us look at and find and think about the details about the Lunar orbiter",,,,response,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"Great, thank you for having me",,,,remark,0,0,4
472,Teacher,"and I want you to look back at the text and circle, the equipment that you found that NASA used we're looking at the part two the second paragraph",,,,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,hi everyone okay so we're going to keep talking about equipment,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,I want you to look for one piece of equipment in just that paragraph and circle it,,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,yeah Luis what's your question,,,,remark,2,0,4
472,Luis,um I think I got this all figured out now so i'm good,,,,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"Oh, could you Luis could you tell me what piece of equipment you circled in Part two",,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
472,Luis,"um well, I mean you said that okay equipment as like a lots of things, because they said equipment not piece of equipment, so I figured you could say everything like lunar orbiter microscope oxygen tanks yep",,,120.4,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"oops I think Luis you told me you're helping me realize I need to change my question here, which is in this in Part Two we're looking for one piece of equipment",,,,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,so go ahead and circle one piece of equipment in paragraph number two,,,420.3,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,Did everyone hear that we're looking for one piece of equipment,,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,Luis What did you circle,,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
472,Luis,"Well, paragraph two that's where they talk about the Lunar orbiter",,,120.4,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,Oh exactly Luis so what made you think that the Lunar orbiter was the piece of equipment they're talking about in paragraph two,,,230.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Luis,"um well they say it's a machine, a small machine and machine can be equipment",,,230.1,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"huh what can someone tell me what what is equipment, I was saying it's my mouse and keyboard and we were talking about our supplies, but what what is equipment to you",,,210.2,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,yeah go ahead Jazmin,,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
472,Jazmin,I say,,,120.4,response,2,0,4
472,Jazmin,it's like something you use to do a task,,,,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"Okay, so Luis would you say that a lunar what is a lunar orbiter what kind of task is a lunar orbiter trying to do",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
472,Luis,"okay so what it says in part two, investigates in the polar craters",,,210.4,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,whoo okay so we're applying what we know about equipment that it's a tool that does something and it's investigating in the polar craters,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,Go ahead Farrah,,,,remark,2,0,4
472,Farrah,i'm i'm kind of confused,,,,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"yeah what what are you confused about, can you tell me, can you tell me",,,230.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Farrah,"yeah well, you told us to look in paragraph two, but what about paragraph three and the microscope",,,230.1,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,Oh okay well let's jump to that one and then we'll come back to number two,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,and why,,,230.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"it says Farrah, can you tell me what piece of equipment you circled in number three",,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
472,Farrah,Okay microscope um because they say the water is microscopic and they can't see it without the microscope,,,120.4,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,So a microscope is a tool that does what,,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
472,Farrah,It lets them see the the tiny ice deposits,,,210.4,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,yeah for sure okay so that's one piece of equipment in number three but since the question is asking for equipment you'll want to look at number two now and see what's the other equipment that they're asking for,,,,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,So if there's if we're looking for two equipments well what would it be,,,430.2,remark,2,0,4
472,Farrah,"Well, I mean it's what Luis said that machine the lunar orbiter",,,430.2,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"Alright, so we've got the Lunar orbiter and the microscope as our equipment",,,130.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"and Chris, I have a question for you",,,,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,how do you know that the that the microscope is equipment and not like the water that they found,,,230.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Chris,They say it's a tool of microscope visit tool and we know on in science class miss Bradley always says okay let's take out the equipment on and so it's like the microscope and the bunsen burner and stuff like that,,,230.1,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"Okay, so you know that microscope is a piece of equipment and you see that in paragraph three Nice",,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"Oliver What about for number two, how do you know that a lunar orbiter is a piece of equipment",,,230.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Oliver,I didn't really get at first that it was because,,,230.1,response,2,0,4
472,Oliver,I thought it was just a microscope,,,,response,2,0,4
472,Oliver,"If you look again, they use the word machine to describe it um and I guess yeah a machine that's like equipment, not because at you design a machine to to do something so it could be an equipment",,,,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,yeah so does what made you change your thinking on that,,,530.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Oliver,I heard i'm Luis talking about the Lunar orbiter and you said to look at part two,,,530.1,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"Okay, and so",,,,remark,2,0,4
472,Oliver,So I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024,,,,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,wow,,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"So what do you think that if people were creating a base on the moon, what kind of equipment let's apply this to our thinking about this future story now like what",,,,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"tool you think, or what tool, do you think astronauts would use, if they are trying to create a base on the moon Oliver?",,,,remark,2,0,4
472,Oliver,They need so much equipment on the moon,,,,response,2,0,4
472,Oliver,"They need to build the base, so they could breathe on the moon all sorts of things",,,,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,mm hmm,,,,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"Do you think they would, how do you think data or no sorry Chris, how do you think that the NASA scientists could use the Lunar orbiter and the discovery of water as a starting point for building a base on the moon",,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Chris,Well,,,140.1,response,2,0,4
472,Chris,People need water,,,,response,2,0,4
472,Chris,They could drink the water,,,,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,yeah and how do you think that would lead to us being able to build a base on the moon,,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Chris,"Well, or if there's water on the moon",,,140.1,response,2,0,4
472,Chris,"People can live there, because I mean they could bring some water but eventually it be gone so they could drink more water from the moon",,,,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"So Chris you're really into early into space, how do you feel about that do you think that",,,,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"that's going to be possible, and what year was it 2024",,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Chris,yeah yes three years away,,,140.1,response,2,0,4
472,Chris,yeah I definitely want to go i'm ready all live on the moon any day,,,,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"Alright, I don't think we've heard from Jazmin so Jazmin, what do you think of the tool that astronauts would use to get ready to have a base on the moon",,,,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,Based on our reading,,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Jazmin,"And since there's water on the moon, maybe because you use equipment like gardening equipment and they could make a moon garden, so that we could grow food",,,140.1,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,What what makes you think that,,,230.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Jazmin,"Well that's a good use of water and if we're going to have a base on the moon, we need some food and sustainable food",,,230.1,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"Okay, I see what you're thinking there",,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Teacher,i'm Jazmin do you think that we'll be able to plant things on the mooon?,,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Jazmin,yeah,,,310.1,response,2,0,4
472,Jazmin,We not be so cool we don't have like a moon greenhouse,,,,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"I wonder if we're missing some pieces, I think we might be missing some pieces for growing things on the moon Jazmin like what about soil",,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
472,Jazmin,Oh,,,210.3,response,2,0,4
472,Jazmin,"yeah I guess the moon dirt it may not work, I don't know we have to try it",,,,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,"Oh yeah we might want, we might want to experiment with that Oliver what were you gonna say",,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
472,Oliver,"Well, I just locked up o'clock now and we have to go to lunch now",,,140.1,response,2,0,4
472,Oliver,"What I want to say thank you so much for really helping us understand the word equipment on and what it means and how to use it on and how to find the different equipment in the text, I feel like I understand that so much better now, thank you",,,,response,2,0,4
472,Teacher,Thank you all have a good lunch,,,,remark,2,0,4
473,Farrah,hi hi hi,,,,response,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"um so earlier today, you read about water on the moon, and then you answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and you need to just circle, the evidence in the text",,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,To to show your response to that question right and then um oh Luis did you have a question,,,,remark,0,0,2
473,Luis,um yeah so um I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,0,2
473,Teacher,I love that and your response was very interesting and we're going to we're going to talk about each one okay,,,110.1,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,so Farrah i'm going to start with you,,,,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"brought up that that the scientific tool they use was called a microscope to look really closely at the water, because on that microscopes do really help us see things up close",,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,I really like um how you,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,and um and I i'm curious if any of you guys um can pinpoint that a little more closer in the text okay so,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"However, there was another machine you guys that they also used",,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"i'm actually Chris, you also had a really great answer to you said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon, and I thought that came really, really close to answering the question as well",,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"Because they sure did, however, the scientist needed a tool to help them and it's a small machine discussed in paragraph two of the text okay",,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"so i'm curious if any of you guys could look over paragraph two, to see if perhaps um any of you want to add to your response uh",,,210.3,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"And then Jazmin you also had a great response, where you had that NASA sent a small machine",,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,On and i'm curious if you could identify what the small machine was called,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
473,Jazmin,yeah well i'm i'm actually i'm i'm wondering I I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,210.4,response,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"Well, in a lot of ways that's right Okay, because the question was what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"And you needed to circle, the evidence in the texts that we can use to answer this question",,,,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,and you had written,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher," NASA send a small machine which is true in paragraph to it describes it as being a small machine, but then right after it says it's a small machine it says called and I feel like we need to focus on that word, because what does NASA call small machine in the paragraph",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,Does anyone remember,,,130.2,remark,0,0,2
473,Jazmin,"Yes, yes",,,130.2,response,0,0,2
473,Jazmin,and NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"Yes, great, and that is really what I was looking for in this response you guys so many of you came so close um but I felt like every all your responses just needed that one extra detail okay um to really help",,,410.2,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,fully answer the question right so um what I was really looking for here was the name of the machine was the Lunar orbiter on to investigate the water yeah Farrah,,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
473,Farrah,Well um I I guess the Lunar orbiter is the right answer but I don't really understand why because,,,130.3,response,0,0,2
473,Farrah,If you if it's so small don't you need to see it before you could discover it,,,,response,0,0,2
473,Teacher,that's a really good point Farrah and I I think what they used the Lunar orbiter for was to investigate where there might be the deposits of water,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,um and then after they got they collected the materials with the orbiter then they were able to put them under a microscope and really analyze it and see that it was made up of water and dirt and other things like that yeah def,,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
473,Oliver,"Oh well, um well, I thought it was the microscope to just like Farrah I circled the same the same the same thing, but what you just said",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
473,Oliver,"It sounded to me like like a metal detector like the Lunar orbiter as kind of like a metal detector and it says, where it is, and then, then you dig out the metal and then you can look at what it is, is it like that?",,,,response,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"Yes, I think that's a really great way of putting it, it is kind of like a detector that discovers where the water might be, and then we can use the of the microscope to analyze it yeah Chris",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
473,Chris,"Well, I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,210.4,response,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"Yes, that is so true and Luis you actually had a great response to where you brought some of that into it right",,,110.3,remark,0,0,2
473,Luis,I sure did,,,110.3,response,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"yeah but um I if we're looking at this question in particular right, we do need to focus on  that the lunar orbiter helped them to investigate where the water was",,,130.3,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"Then yeah all those other cool machines come into play, after the fact, after they're able to find the water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,And what they can use it to create to,,,,remark,0,0,2
473,Luis,"Okay, so you're saying that like it's not the right answer because i'm so oxygen tanks isn't the right answer",,,,response,0,0,2
473,Luis,Because that's not how they find the water,,,,response,0,0,2
473,Teacher,Exactly Luis and um I think what your answer focused on more of is what they could do with the water once they discover it right like there was an interesting video I saw,,,230.3,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"i'm not sure if you guys saw it from NASA where a woman was talking about how someday they hope to live for longer periods on the moon, and if",,,140.1,remark,0,0,2
473,Luis,I definitely want to live on the moon,,,140.1,response,0,0,2
473,Teacher,I know wouldn't it be crazy and if they can discover water than they could turn that into things like oxygen for their oxygen tanks or,,,140.1,remark,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"I forget what else they were talking about using it for, but I think that sounds really neat Oliveron what's your question",,,,remark,0,0,2
473,Oliver,Oh that's okay happens all time,,,,response,0,0,2
473,Oliver,"I looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say before before we go you really helped us understand the different",,,,response,0,0,2
473,Oliver,purposes of the different appointments and why the Lunar orbiter was the right answer for this question and I just wanted to say it was so helpful to work with you today Thank you so much,,,,response,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"You guys I had so much fun talking with you all, and I really appreciate those sentiments stuff you guys have a terrific lunch okay",,,,remark,0,0,2
473,Oliver,Thank you,,,,response,0,0,2
473,Teacher,"Okay, I love that you all brought in so many interesting facts that you read about in the article into your responses",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher, Luis,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"um but after after hearing them, I think that some might be too specific and some may be too general, I think that you're all just slightly off",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
473,Luis,um well I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,150.1,response,2,0,2
473,Teacher,I could tell from your answer and I think that that is really helping you In Olivereloping your response,,,420.2,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"however, I think that we need to instead of using just our background knowledge about space I want us to really start looking for the evidence in the article okay",,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"um and I think Luis although your response was very interesting, I think that we can fine tune it a little to make it even better okay",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
473,Luis,yeah okay,,,150.1,response,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"Okay, so um let's see I also wanted, before we begin, I really wanted to clarify that the word equipment means a necessary item that is used for a specific purpose, such as discovering water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,So um I want us to to just reread our responses to the question um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"and I really want you guys to just circle um in your responses, the equipment that you that you answered in the the question with, okay,",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,because the question's asking what what equipment the scientists used and I want you guys to find that in your response okay so go ahead and circle that,,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"Okay, so now what we're gonna do is um",,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"I want you to so i'm a little concerned that the question you need to answer is asking about the equipment, okay, so we really want to make sure that we can find that equipment in the text um",,,210.2,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"so I want you to let's see reread the text and I want when you're rereading I want you to underline the specific detail, where it says how the scientists discovered where the water was",,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,And I want you to underline what the equipment they used was to when they discovered the water okay um,,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"so go ahead and underline The specific detail, where it says how the scientists discovered the water and what equipment they used okay so underline that right now",,,420.3,remark,2,0,2
473,Jazmin,Excuse me,,,420.3,response,2,0,2
473,Teacher,yeah Jazmin,,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Jazmin,"Oh well, I already circled the equipment, when we answered the question",,,,response,2,0,2
473,Teacher,yeah okay,,,110.1,remark,2,0,2
473,Jazmin,"I said NASA sent a small machine, and so I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,110.1,response,2,0,2
473,Teacher,Jazmin I loved your answer,,,430.2,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"however, I think that you could find a more specific answer okay so um",,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"I want you guys to look in the text, specifically for the name of the machine okay",,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"so um Jazmin you were really close when you said it was a small machine because it for sure was um, but I want you to look for the name of the small machine in the text okay",,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Jazmin,Okay,,,,response,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"And I also want you to think about um if, after looking at the text, if you want to modify your response at all",,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher, does anyone feel like they want to modify their or change their answer,,,210.3,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,Luis?,,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Luis,"um yeah So when I read the story, I found two pieces of equipment and they're a small machine, which, by the way, Jazmin is called a lunar orbiter and and the microscope",,,,response,2,0,2
473,Luis, Those are the two equipments,,,,response,2,0,2
473,Teacher,um does everyone see in the text where it talks about the Lunar orbiter Can someone read me the sentence,,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,Thank you so much for sharing that with the group,,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,Okay yeah in the text ,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher, Chris,,,120.3,remark,2,0,2
473,Chris,I can read it,,,120.3,response,2,0,2
473,Chris,Okay,,,,response,2,0,2
473,Chris, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,2,0,2
473,Chris,It says,,,,response,2,0,2
473,Chris,and I went to NASA actually on so I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,2,0,2
473,Teacher,The sure do they sure do and all of that stuff helps them i'm sure um and I think that it's this part where it says they sent the Lunar orbiter to investigate what do you think they're investigating what does it say they're investigating with that,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
473,Chris,oh the craters that was part of my answer,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"Yes, I love that and what what did they find in the craters when they used that machine",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher, Oliver,,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
473,Oliver,"um they found really, really tiny pieces of ice",,,210.4,response,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"Yes, and Farrah I think you might know the answer to this, but what what did they use to look at the ice",,,210.4,remark,2,0,2
473,Farrah,yeah you need a microscope because it's too small to see without the microscope,,,210.4,response,2,0,2
473,Farrah,um so is that the right answer,,,,response,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"You know, I think that, in combination with what everyone just said um is the best answer",,,130.1,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"Okay, so I think that you guys did a really great job of Combining all of what you found in the text to create the best answer right Luis and Jazmin you guys talked about the small machine called the Lunar orbiter",,,310.1,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,and Oliver and Farrah you guys brought up that there were those ice deposits in the craters and they used the microscope to look at that even closer to discover,,,230.3,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,Chris You helped us really understand that they use that lunar orbiter to investigate the craters,,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,So I think that um do you guys want to modify your response now to make sure that it hat encompasses all that yeah def,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
473,Oliver,"yeah well, we definitely will but right now we have to go to lunch",,,150.1,response,2,0,2
473,Oliver,but yeah I wanted to say before we go,,,,response,2,0,2
473,Oliver,Thank you so much for allowing each of us to share our answers and helping us see how each of our answers were like a piece of the answer and how to work together with them,,,,response,2,0,2
473,Teacher,you guys did a wonderful job today Thank you all so much,,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,  deb Thank you so much for that response you guys did a wonderful job today Thank you all so much,,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,"I love that you guys Thank you so much, and if, when you come back next time, try to reflect a little bit about how you learned from this experience",,,150.1,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher,Oliver Thank you so much for that response,,,,remark,2,0,2
473,Teacher, you guys did a wonderful job today Thank you all so much,,,,remark,2,0,2

474,Teacher,"i'm good, how are you doing oh",,,,remark,0,1,3
474,Farrah,we're good we're really excited to work with you,,,,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,awesome i'm excited to hear about what you understand in these paragraphs,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,0,1,3
474,Luis,"um yeah okay um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,Well i'm excited for you to share all your knowledge with your other classmates,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
474,Luis,Oh yeah I can definitely do that,,,110.3,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,awesome,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,um do you all have some responses that you've prepared about the text that you read about water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
474,Farrah,"On yes, we do um do you wanna do you want to hear them",,,150.1,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"Yes, would anyone like to volunteer to go first",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
474,Farrah,yeah yeah I want to go is that okay,,,120.4,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"Yes, go for it",,,,remark,0,1,3
474,Farrah,"Okay, so I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"Yes, that's awesome and I see you found some great evidence in the text because they do say that, precisely, thank you for sharing",,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"Would anyone else, like to share, you can raise your hand if you're ready",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
474,Oliver,"um yeah well, I would just say i'm actually I circled the same as Farrah",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"awesome, thank you for sharing yeah they do say exactly in the text, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely gov would you want to share oh yeah Luis go for it",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
474,Luis,yeah okay well my answer was actually that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,110.2,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"mm hmm you know I think you're right that scientists do use oxygen tanks, but I don't know that I see that in the text itself",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"Would you mind, did you have any evidence in the texts that you had for that or is that they stand outside knowledge",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
474,Luis,Oh um yeah,,,230.2,response,0,1,3
474,Luis,"I guess it's not really in there, but I just know I know that if there's people on the moon, they need oxygen tanks",,,,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"hmm you know that's really interesting point because it's true that when humans go to the moon, they definitely need oxygen tanks to breathe",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"So that's an awesome point and I think that brings up a really good clarification, which is that",,,,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,I think when they're looking for water on the moon they're actually sending this machine called a lunar orbiter so they're not sending actual human beings are not sending astronauts,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"Maybe because it's too expensive so they're sending these machines called lunar orbiter, so I think and not situation they're actually not using oxygen tanks, but that's a great point event yeah Jazmin",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
474,Jazmin,"Yes, okay well, so my answer was that NASA sent a small machine, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,410.2,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"Well, I think you're right that they did use a small machine but they're also giving us this specific vocabulary, that the machine is called a lunar orbiter",,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"So you're partially right, because it is a small machine but there's lots of different small machines right like a small machine could even be a toaster so they definitely didn't send a toaster",,,410.2,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,they sent a specific one called the lunar orbiter,,,130.3,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"So I love your thinking, but when you see a small machine and you think that could be a few different things, maybe keep hunting and see if there's any specific vocabulary great question Jazmin",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,anyone else have responses yeah Farrah,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
474,Farrah,"yeah so now i'm a little confused because I guess well, I thought it was the microscope but it sounds like maybe Jazmin is correct, so is she right or am I right",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"Well you're actually both right, so they use that machine called the Lunar orbiter to get to the moon, to investigate and see if there was ice",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"And then they did find water and when they found the water, it was such small amounts that they had to use a microscope To look at it, to see the water",,,,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"So you're both right they use a lunar orbiter to get to the moon and define the water, but then, in order to see the water they use a microscope",,,130.1,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,But that's a great clarification yeah Luis,,,,remark,0,1,3
474,Luis,"yeah and I just wanted to add what I know to that clarification, which is because you said, there are no people there on the moon, so, then they had to bring I bet they had to bring like the little ice deposit back to earth and that's when they probably looked under the microscope right",,,,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"yeah, I think, so I actually don't know I think it's possible that the Lunar orbiter maybe had a microscope in it, and then it was all done with robots but that's a great question",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
474,Luis,Robots are awesome,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,awesome I think so too yeah Chris,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
474,Chris,"yeah well actually I went to NASA, so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,110.1,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"mm hmm yeah you're right yeah I think there haven't been astronauts on the moon, for a little while but they definitely NASA does send astronauts, I think, to the international space station regularly",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,And I think they do use those special suits that's really cool did you see anything else there that you thought was interesting oh,,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
474,Chris,We got to see a lot of things like we got to see the whole space suit and I really wanted to try it on but,,,140.1,response,0,1,3
474,Chris,And then we got to see,,,,response,0,1,3
474,Chris,"Parts of rockets and other things, that the astronauts have inside the rockets like likes back, like the packets of the of the space food and stuff",,,,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"He did a space food look like it tasted good or does it look kind of disgusting, what do you think",,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
474,Chris,It looks pretty disgusting really,,,140.1,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,that's really cool that sounds like an awesome trip Paris and thanks for sharing yeah Oliver,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
474,Oliver,Okay um I just want to make extra sure I understand the answer to the question so as there's the right answer both the right answer is like lunar orbiter plus microscope equals right answer,,,110.3,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"does anyone can anyone summarize what those two machines were Oliver, I think you just had it would anyone else, like to build on that",,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"mm hmm yeah so when we're thinking about what kinds of machines, they were using the right answers that they were using two different kinds of machines",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
474,Jazmin,"Yes, can I try and",,,130.2,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,Go for it Jazmin,,,,remark,0,1,3
474,Jazmin,"Okay, so i'm going to change my first answer and i'm going to say NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and then in parentheses, not a toaster and then I would say, and then they had to use a microscope",,,,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,"Yes, perfect and do you remember what they were using the microscope for",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
474,Oliver,Oh yeah I thought that I can add on that you'll start to look really closely at the little ice and i'm I just I just looked at the clock,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
474,Oliver,"And, actually, we have to go to lunch now, but I wanted to say thank you so much for taking all of our answers and showing us how they fit together to make the most complete answer that was really helpful",,,,response,0,1,3
474,Teacher,awesome Thank you all have a good lunch,,,,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,bye bye,,,,remark,0,1,3
474,Teacher,Start simulation,,,,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,hey today,,,,remark,1,1,3
474,Luis,"i'm excuse me teacher, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,,response,1,1,3
474,Teacher,that's awesome well I bet there are a few things that you don't know so i'm excited as you grow your learning today,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,would anyone like to volunteer to go first and start us off by reading your answer,,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,"Alright, we are gonna get started talking about your responses to the question what equipment it's scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
474,Chris,"First Okay, I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon",,,120.2,response,1,1,3
474,Teacher,Chris I I love your thinking that you really found the the theme of the text and you're totally on point with,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,With what the text was about because it's true that scientists did find craters full of water on the moon,,,110.2,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,But one thing that i'm concerned about with your with your response is going back to the question,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,"about the kind of equipment that scientists used, so I think my suggestion would be for you to go back and think about the equipment that scientists were using",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,"To find those craters full of water to expand your answer and include the equipment that they were using to discover the water, thank you",,,,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,Who would like to go next,,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
474,Farrah,i'll go,,,120.4,response,1,1,3
474,Teacher,"All right, go for it",,,,remark,1,1,3
474,Farrah,"Okay um so I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,,response,1,1,3
474,Teacher,hmm Farrah I love your thinking because you're totally right that the article  talk about using a microscope to look at the water,,,110.2,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,"So you're totally right about that, but I want to just go back to the question because i'm concerned that your your answer doesn't totally answer the question",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,Because the question is about the equipment that science scientists use to discover water and then you're talking about the tool that scientists were using,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,To look at the water they discovered so you're totally right that that was in the article but let's think a little bit more deeply about the question,,,420.1,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,"And not discovery process, so my suggestion would be to look at the text and think about how they were discovering the water not looking at it, but finding it in the first place",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,"What anyone else, like to share",,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
474,Jazmin,I don't understand why my answers wrong,,,120.4,response,1,1,3
474,Teacher,hmm yeah could you read your answer for me,,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
474,Jazmin,yeah I said NASA send a small machine,,,120.4,response,1,1,3
474,Teacher,"huh yeah so I just want to say you're right NASA did send a small machine, but I want to push you to expand your answer",,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,Because the article does say a little bit more about what that small machine actually is there's a name for it so,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,"I would encourage you to go back and look in the article to just make your correct answer even stronger because a small machine could be a lot of different things, but we want to make sure we're talking really specifically about the type of small machine, but the scientists were using",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
474,,Teacher,,,420.2,,1,1,3
474,Jazmin,"Oh, oh okay yeah I see that that's it's just it's a lunar orbiter",,,,response,1,1,3
474,Jazmin,"I just have to add that, to my answer and then i'm done oh that's easy okay",,,,response,1,1,3
474,Jazmin,"Well, scientists into small machine called her",,,,response,1,1,3
474,Teacher,Her mm hmm okay,,,110.1,remark,1,1,3
474,Jazmin,"Okay i got it, can I go",,,110.1,response,1,1,3
474,Teacher,On not yet I think we're gonna we're going to talk a little bit more about what Oliver had for his answer,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
474,Oliver,Oh yeah I circled the same thing that Farrah did you,,,150.1,response,1,1,3
474,Teacher,Can you tell me a little bit about your thinking thinking about the the microscope answer,,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
474,Oliver,"yeah I kinda the thought question was asking about equipment what equipment it to us until I was looking in but text for everywhere, they said equipment",,,230.1,response,1,1,3
474,Oliver,And I was looking for where they're finding and water and the moon so but but paragraph paragraph three had all of the keywords in it yeah,,,,response,1,1,3
474,Teacher,I love that you are looking for keywords that's a really strong reading technique,,,510.1,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,But my question for you here is the same thing that I mentioned to Farrah about her answer is,,,,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,so i'd encourage you to go back into the text and and think more about discovery,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,Thinking about discovery so you're right that they were using the microscope to look at the water they found,,,110.2,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,but they they weren't using the microscope to discover the water,,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
474,Oliver,"Okay, I feel like I didn't see the word discovery",,,130.1,response,1,1,3
474,Oliver,On that's what I saw found in paragraph three,,,,response,1,1,3
474,Teacher,"that's good yeah the thing about the thing about reading for keywords and sometimes authors will use synonyms so two words that mean the same thing, so when we're thinking about discovery definitely found or",,,510.1,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,came across or words like that that all mean similar things that's another good strategy to think to think about when you're reading,,,,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,"but thank you for that clarification that's a good point, because I think you're right that they don't use the word discover in the article",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
474,Chris,yeah,,,,response,1,1,3
474,Chris,"Okay um I think i've found the one that Jazmin was talking about, but then I was thinking about equipment, because you said that's the part that was missing in my answer and I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,1,1,3
474,Teacher,"yeah right they do use a lot of equipment, I think my suggestion for you here because you're right that's that signed us and asked us a ton of different kinds of equipment",,,110.2,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,"so, for example, and Luis the answer Luis was talking about using oxygen tanks and it's true that scientists use oxygen tanks, but they did not use oxygen tanks",,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,Is thinking specifically about how they discovered water on the moon,,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,To find water on the moon so thinking about the context of the question in what specific situation or scientists using this kind of equipment and we know that it's using water on the moon so going back into the text,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
474,Teacher,"Looking specifically for that context that's a really great question Chris, thank you",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
474,Chris,yeah thanks teacher okay,,,420.3,response,1,1,3
474,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,1,1,3
474,,Teacher,,,,,1,1,3
474,Oliver,"that's not a question, or an observation I look up a time and I realized that it's time for us to go so on, we will see you later okay",,,,response,1,1,3
474,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,1,1,3
474,,Teacher,,,,,2,1,3
474,Teacher,hi everyone,,,,remark,2,1,3
474,All,hi,,,,,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"hi alright, so today we're going to talk a little bit about your responses to the question about the article, we read about NASA would anyone like yeah Luis",,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
474,Luis,"Excuse me teacher, I don't think I should be in this group biology know all about space",,,150.1,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"Who can you tell me, one thing that you know about space",,,140.1,remark,2,1,3
474,Luis,"yeah okay i'll tell you three things first accidents have to wear spacesuits because it's really cold and they'll like freeze to death, second, they have to wear oxygen tanks, because you can't breathe them space and third there's no gravity there, so they got to wear gravity boots",,,140.1,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,Oh nice it sounds like you know a lot about the equipment that scientists are wearing on their bodies,,,110.3,remark,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"But i'm excited to hear how you connect all that knowledge to what we learned about in the article about the equipment for finding water, do you want to tell me a little bit about your response to the question based on the article, we read",,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
474,Luis,"yeah sure Okay, I said what did I see I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,120.4,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"You also I see how you're connecting your knowledge about astronauts to this article, which is great",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
474,Teacher,But one thing that i'm concerned about is that your response doesn't directly,,,410.2,remark,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"identified the type of equipment that scientists are using to discover the water, but you are talking about what",,,,remark,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"astronauts might be wearing when they go to outer space, so my suggestion to you is to go back into the article and to think a little bit about not what scientists may be wearing but what equipment they might be using",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
474,Luis,Okay okay,,,420.3,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"Would anyone else, like to share well Luis goes back to read the article",,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
474,Chris,I can share my oh answer was scientists phone craters full of water on the moon,,,120.4,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,What did you think was interesting about how they found the water did was there anything that stuck out to you,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
474,Chris,How they found the water,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
474,Chris,I don't think I remember that part of the story,,,,response,2,1,3
474,Chris,Let me see,,,,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"While Chris goes back to read what anyone else, like to share their responses",,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
474,Jazmin,um yeah I don't understand why why my answers wrong,,,120.4,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,hmm could you read your answer for me,,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
474,Jazmin,yeah I said scientists sent a small machine out NASA sent a small machine,,,120.4,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"huh yeah definitely So do you have any ideas about what type of machine they might have sent to you remember that, from the passage",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
474,Jazmin,Let me see i'll call the Lunar orbiter,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"Yes, definitely I see how you're connecting original answer and growing your",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"Your understanding by five day not specific detail in the name of the the equipment, because you're right that they did bring a small machine and you found the name, which was awesome",,,,remark,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"would anyone else, like to share",,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
474,Jazmin,I just have to add that I just have that lunar orbiter to my answer and then it's fine,,,,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"And then, after you're finished i'm curious if you could share, about how you're thinking has changed from your original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote",,,530.1,remark,2,1,3
474,Jazmin,"Well, I added the name, so I had to master some small machine, and now it says NASA said it's a small machine called a lunar orbiter",,,530.1,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,mm hmm so,,,,remark,2,1,3
474,Jazmin,I just I added the name,,,,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,mm hmm and has your thinking changed at all about how they found it,,,530.1,remark,2,1,3
474,Teacher,do you know what a lunar orbiter is,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
474,Jazmin,it's a machine,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
474,Jazmin,That they use to find water,,,,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"mm hmm and let's Maybe you can think a little bit, we can break down that nate, and so do you know what lunar means",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
474,Teacher,The word lunar um,,,,remark,2,1,3
474,Oliver,"about the moon, that means about the moon",,,,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,yeah Thank you you're right yeah and then or better does anyone know what the word orbiter means or the orbit,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
474,Chris,"yeah that's that's the path that you when you go like around something you know, like how",,,210.4,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,So,,,,remark,2,1,3
474,Chris,"We we like the sun, you know, like we go around",,,,response,2,1,3
474,Chris,yeah yeah I have to think for a second like do we call this,,,,response,2,1,3
474,Chris,Week around the sun,,,,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,yeah yeah,,,,remark,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"yeah definitely so Jazmin now using what your classmates have shared about what it is so it's something about the moon and it's something that's going around something else, what do you think a lunar orbiter would be doing on",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
474,Jazmin,um I think it's a machine that goes around,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,yeah and so connecting that back to what you said,,,,remark,2,1,3
474,Teacher,How do you think scientists were using that particular piece of equipment to find water,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
474,Jazmin,Okay you're using this,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
474,Jazmin,To,,,,response,2,1,3
474,Jazmin,"You went around the moon, maybe and looked for water",,,,response,2,1,3
474,Jazmin,"Like flew around the moon, maybe or or or drove around the moon",,,,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,yeah yeah absolutely that's great,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"Alright, what anyone else, like okay okay good yeah would anyone else, like to share",,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
474,Chris,"Before the issue, the response I was just thinking about um the other kinds of equipment that we're talking about with even because I went to NASA into I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,120.4,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,me yeah no you're so right that sounds like a really cool trip to NASA and you're right that scientists at NASA use a lot of different equipment,,,110.3,remark,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"And so, for this question because we're talking about what scientists used to discover water",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
474,Teacher,"That means we're narrowing down, out of all the equipment that scientists use like the oxygen tanks that Luis talked about",,,,remark,2,1,3
474,Teacher,And the special gravity boots and all different kinds of things so that they can survive in outer space we're specifically we're narrowing all that down to what they were using to discover water,,,,remark,2,1,3
474,Teacher,Does that help,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
474,Chris,yeah yeah yeah to kind of think more,,,150.1,response,2,1,3
474,Chris,More with the just what we're talking about in the story,,,,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,yeah exactly,,,,remark,2,1,3
474,Oliver,"Oh, oh teacher it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you for how you were asking questions about our thinking i'm to help with the answers and kind of taking time to explain what we needed to work on, because it gave me some ideas on how I can improve my answer to",,,,response,2,1,3
474,Teacher,Great Thank you all,,,,remark,2,1,3
474,Oliver,bye teacher,,,,response,2,1,3
476,Teacher,"hey also Farrah Chris and Luis have shared some revised responses and will we kind of need to go through them a little bit just as a group, to see where we're at",,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,does anyone with anyone like to go first Luis firsthand what's up,,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
476,Luis,"wow excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, because I already corrected my answer so i'm good",,,120.4,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,awesome so you corrected your answer so we'll take you as a volunteer to go first,,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,let's see so your answer you revised answer Luis was that scientists found is using a small machine Is that correct,,,230.3,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,awesome so um what's what what makes you say that what makes you say that scientists found is using a small machine,,,230.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Luis,Because that,,,230.1,response,1,1,4
476,Luis,Paragraph,,,,response,1,1,4
476,Luis,"Two yeah class that's what it says in paragraph two, it says nasa's into small machine blah blah blah look for ice deposit blah blah blah, and so they found the ice using a small machine",,,,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,You are correct in that they found is using a small machine,,,110.2,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,what's the important word in the question,,,420.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,"However, I want to challenge you to not do the blah blah blah parts and to see if we can actually name we're looking for",,,420.2,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,cool so we've had a couple of comments from you about equipment we've had scientists use a lot of equipment and then we have scientists found the ice using a small machine,,,230.3,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,What is the actual name of the small machine,,,210.4,remark,1,1,4
476,Luis,Oh yeah it's the Lunar orbiter I forgot to put that in there,,,210.4,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,awesome okay yeah I know you were on your way so let's see so now what now that we know so scientists found ice using a lunar orbiter cool,,,110.4,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,um yeah,,,,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,So you found that from the text right,,,230.2,remark,1,1,4
476,Luis,yeah yeah I did,,,230.2,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,"So you use the text to inform your answer, which is great so i'm",,,310.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,i'm concerned about their whereas a lack of specificity and both of your responses today,,,410.2,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,"So, in terms of finding the Lunar orbiter because, first we just talked about equipment and then we just talked about a small machine, so I suggest that the next time you read through some material, you can look for those key specific words that might help you have more rounded out answers",,,520.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Luis,Okay okay,,,520.1,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Luis,"It does, I mean I just like don't like to write, you know I mean I feel like when I get the answer I got it and that's good",,,150.1,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,that's how you feel a great so let's just let's just do like a little thought experiment so even though you don't like writing and maybe that's why you're not being so specific which I can understand,,,310.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,Now that we figured out the full answer what could you do next time so that you don't have to revise and revise and revise,,,520.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Luis,"Okay, next time, I guess, I could just like be specific when i'm writing my answer",,,520.1,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,yeah I think that sounds great I think that a little bit of specificity and putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times,,,510.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,So,,,,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,"Do you want to fill fill out the the the final thinking routine, for me, I used to think",,,530.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,"About a small machine, what did you use to think about this machine yeah",,,,remark,1,1,4
476,Luis,"Okay, I used to think that I just care right small machine or equipment",,,,response,1,1,4
476,Luis,But now I think I gotta always write the name of the thing in my answer,,,,response,1,1,4
476,Luis,Because,,,,response,1,1,4
476,Luis,Because the teacher says that I got to be more specific,,,,response,1,1,4
476,Luis,"So, next time, I guess, I will write more specific names of things when I am writing my answer, so you don't have to revise and revise and revise",,,520.1,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,Okay we'll leave that there Jazmin you have a question or a comment,,,110.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,um yeah well I I changed my answer to,,,110.1,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,You did,,,,remark,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,yeah yeah I did it while i'm while you're talking to Luis,,,,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,"Okay, why don't you share with us",,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,"Okay um so he said, NASA",,,120.4,response,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,Use the machine called the Lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon,,,,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,mm hmm,,,,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,that's your revised answer,,,230.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,yeah,,,230.1,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,"Okay, that sounds great",,,110.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,What I don't recall what your first,,,,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,What was different about your first answer and your second you said,,,530.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,My first answer I just said NASA send a small machine,,,530.1,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,Oh OK OK sorry that's the part I had forgotten,,,,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,"yeah so Okay, so I sort of noticed that, through talking with Luis I mean that you also added some specificity to your answer, do you think that helped you get a more full response",,,510.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,yeah yeah cuz it's got a lot of specificity,,,510.1,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,"Okay, what could you do next time",,,520.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,That you're,,,,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,Maybe coming up with an answer that feels a little bit,,,,remark,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,Short um okay well next next time,,,,response,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,"I could I guess well first off, I know that I was supposed to write the name of it, I guess that's the same as Luis to be more specific, with the name um and then also um what else did I add oh Oh, the why I added",,,,response,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,"Why, though the white part because the teachers that's what the teacher said that I was missing to",,,,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,That sounds like a really good strategy and will probably set you up for success next time we're coming up with a problem,,,310.1,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,and Chris or Farrah do either one of you want to share sure Chris,,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,"yeah yeah I wanted to know if my new answer was okay um the water, the scientists found on the moon was microscopic is that OK",,,310.1,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,So,,,,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,what are you working on in this response,,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,"What I have a question for you, what do you feel like if the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,",,,120.2,remark,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,I forgot again oh man hold on,,,120.2,response,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,I was supposed to be adding in the equipment part,,,,response,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,yeah,,,,response,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,Okay okay I got it now,,,,response,1,1,4
476,Jazmin,"Oh yeah the water scientists found on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter was microscopic",,,120.4,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,yeah let's see do you want to add something,,,120.4,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,"that's right, so we have the name of the Lunar orbiter",,,110.4,remark,1,1,4
476,Oliver,I know teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's actually time for us to go i'm so off to see you later okay,,,120.4,response,1,1,4
476,Teacher,sounds good y'all have fun,,,,remark,1,1,4
476,Teacher,"folks welcome back Chris, I think we were working on your response, so I think we should just pick up right where we left off if if I recall, you had said",,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"You would revise your revisions, so you revise revise that the water found the water scientists found water on the moon, using a lunar orbiter and that the water was microscopic Is that correct",,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
476,All,yeah yeah,,,230.3,,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"Okay, oh answer the water scientists yeah",,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"Okay, great so Luis yes",,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Luis,"I I just I think I got it figured out now, so I think i'm all good",,,,response,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"Well we're still going to go through the rest of everybody else's So if you could help us like us, are thinking and pay attention to the other folks is they waited for you, that would be really great",,,150.1,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,So you might also help us be able to think a little bit deeper,,,150.1,remark,2,1,4

476,Teacher,"yeah so you you clarified response, which is, which is great what helped you find the title of",,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,The small machine,,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Chris,"um okay well i'm Jazmin had had it before, so I remembered that it was in the second paragraph and i'm that well, I was looking for the ice part of it, because at first I didn't realize that was the water, too, and so yeah that was it was pretty easy to find",,,,response,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"Sure, it was easy to find so when you're faced with the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what's what's the important word of that sentence, do you think",,,210.2,remark,2,1,4
476,Chris, Discover,,,210.2,response,2,1,4
476,Chris,Oh,,,210.2,response,2,1,4
476,Teacher,awesome so so when we're reading our sentence and we're looking for our answer,,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,What do you think you could do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking,,,520.1,remark,2,1,4
476,Chris,"I think, but I got a mixture of it i'm",,,520.1,response,2,1,4
476,Chris,Looking at all of the words in the question cuz I missed equipment on my answer,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Chris,and,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Teacher,Look at all the words in the question okay,,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"How did you know, let me ask you following",,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"Okay yeah sure, let me ask you a follow up",,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"So, how did you know that equipment was the most important word in that sentence or question",,,230.1,remark,2,1,4
476,Chris,Oh,,,230.1,response,2,1,4
476,Chris,Okay well cuz when we were talking about our answers before,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Chris,"The teacher kept telling us that that was one of the important because everybody else had equipment, except for me I realized I forgot it and then, when",,,,response,2,1,4
476,Chris,"we're reading the question to me, I heard it again and I realized I forgot it",,,,response,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"Okay, so okay that's awesome so you, you are recognizing",,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"That you had just forgot to to include that in your answer, perhaps",,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"Okay, so you knew it, but you maybe had just forgotten it and so that's pretty simple So what do you think that for next time, if you could set yourself up, I think you did it really great here, where you just sort of said",,,520.1,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"Oh, I forgot that so all included in my answer",,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Chris,Okay well for next time,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Chris,I guess I should check my answer with the question um then to make sure that I I answered all the parts of the question,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"I think that's totally a great strategy for you, I think, if you see the question provide your answer just look over your answer one more time and then make sure it answers matches the question and you'll be good to go",,,510.1,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"Okay, great great",,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,awesome thanks teacher you got it,,,,remark,2,1,4

476,Farrah,Where did I even write it down,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Teacher,Do you remember your first answer,,,120.4,remark,2,1,4
476,Farrah,um yeah my first one was about that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely because I got that one right out of the story,,,120.4,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,"Okay yeah I see where I wrote it down okay um and then for my revised answer, I said that scientists use the Lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of water in craters on the moon",,,,response,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"That feels like a really thorough answer to me, does it feel like a thorough answer to you",,,150.1,remark,2,1,4
476,Farrah,"yeah yeah I wrote a lot more um I mean I wrote a lot more like not words but you know, like from my from my brain i'm in the second answer than because the first answer was from the story",,,150.1,response,2,1,4
476,Teacher,and your answer is scientists use the Lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of water,,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"Right Okay, so we have the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"So we have the Lunar orbiter in there, which is specificity right Luis right Jazmin we were talking about specificity earlier great",,,150.1,remark,2,1,4
476,Farrah,So specificity,,,150.1,response,2,1,4
476,Teacher,nailed it so um,,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"So how can I ask you a question how did you get from your first answer to your second answer what was what was different and how other than just writing more, what do you think your thought process was in shifting your answer",,,530.1,remark,2,1,4
476,Farrah,"um Okay, so I knew that the microscope was the wrong answer",,,530.1,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,Because,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,I realized that I was I had used it because it said it was looking at the water but,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,She was asking about discovering the,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,Water um and then,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,"We already talked about you know, like our supposed to put all of the parts of the question and our answer and I think I did that in my first answer",,,,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,But then,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,I did it,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,"I did it more because, like We keep talking about like adding more details and adding more details, so I guess i'm what different is that",,,,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,"I added more details Oh, I remember, and I use more the words from the question in my answer to",,,,response,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"Okay, great so i'm hearing that you have heard, everyone talk about being more specific and adding more details and so you're like i'm on it that's what i'm going to do, and you tried that and it worked out yeah",,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
476,Farrah,yeah yeah and and I added the words from the question to,,,230.3,response,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"Great yeah I think that's really solid, so I have my concern is that I would like to make sure that you are understanding what the question is asking",,,410.1,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,And that you're providing a response to the question and that you have that you're understanding what the question is asking so,,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"How can you know, to look or how can you how can you see what the question is asking, so that you understand what answer to give other than just putting more words down",,,520.1,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,Do you know,,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Farrah,"Okay yeah yeah no, I think I can i'm Okay, how do I know what the questions asking um Okay, so what I would do is look at all of the words in the question right and then make sure that I, I understand what each of the words means um and then, when I find my answer, try to like",,,,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,Look in match it up between each of the words in my answer in each of the words in the question,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Teacher,"Okay, so that at the end you'll have some some answers that match, and it makes sense for you and for others to understand that sounds pretty solid so let's do let's just do the fill in the blank like we've done before so let's do a little thinking routine about",,,230.3,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,Make it about,,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Teacher,How how you're thinking about the asking a question sorry i'm stumbling over my words so maybe you can start with saying I started to think,,,530.1,remark,2,1,4
476,Farrah,That,,,530.1,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,I started to think that I could just kind of find the words in the story and then that just be the answer,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,"To right, but now I think",,,,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,That,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,I have to make sure that I understand,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,All the words in this question first and then,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Farrah,find the answer and write it in my own words to feel match the question,,,,response,2,1,4
476,Teacher,Oh whoops there's more oh that,,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Farrah,"Was oh no, because if I don't, then I might actually have the wrong answer",,,,response,2,1,4

476,Oliver,"Well, I wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to kind of help us to think about our answers changing cause I was listening and now I have some ideas on on how to think about when I am going to change, like my answer um next time i'm going to enter a question",,,,response,2,1,4
476,Teacher,yeah Thank you to something's,,,,remark,2,1,4
476,Oliver,Okay bye,,,,response,2,1,4
477,Teacher,Okay Thank you everyone for sharing i'm going to ask you to think a little about your answers and i'm going to ask for a little more detail from each of you,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"So if we could start with Jazmin he said NASA send a small machine, could you tell someone",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,group sharing Luis,,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Luis,yeah thanks for Question me,,,,response,0,1,2
477,Luis,I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"All of it, I think we can always learn more",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"and if you have all that knowledge i'd love for you to share it with the rest of us, so I really appreciate you being here yeah",,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
477,Luis,I can tell you anything you want to know,,,110.3,response,0,1,2
477,Teacher,Okay well we'll start with Jazmin and then we'll come to you how does that sound,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
477,Luis,Okay that's fine great,,,150.1,response,0,1,2
477,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"Jazmin you said masters kind of small machine, could you look in take one minute and look in the text and tell me what that small machine was called",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
477,Jazmin,OK,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
477,Jazmin,OK NASA centers machine called a lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,1,2
477,Teacher,The lunar orbiter now does anyone have an idea what the Lunar orbiter is,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Luis,"Okay, so I figured this out because lunar means like moon and orbiter means like around like it goes around and an orbit, and so I think the Lunar orbiter as like this small machine that goes around the moon",,,,response,0,1,2
477,Teacher,Fantastic so I really appreciate coming Luis just did he took little parts of the world to lunar orbit to draw a conclusion from that so we're really looking for small details here,,,510.1,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,So the sent a lunar orbiter and,,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"Chris, what did those scientists fine, could you repeat what you said about what the scientists found with that lunar orbiter",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
477,Chris,"Oh yeah suit the scientists they found these crators, full of water",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"So how much water did they find could use to find in the text, how much water they found",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
477,Chris,"Okay yeah so in part one, it says they found evidence that water can be found deep in the moon's craters",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
477,Chris,Okay there's the part about the Lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,1,2
477,Chris,"Oh, oh oh okay well",,,,response,0,1,2
477,Chris,"I don't know if I got here yeah and part three oh, it says that the water is microscopic",,,,response,0,1,2
477,Teacher,microscopic the me thank you for finding that can anyone tell me what microscopic me,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"Yes, shabana",,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Farrah,"yeah um Well, this is connected to my answer to microscopic means it's really, really small, and so my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and um I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,2
477,Teacher,well remember earlier when I said I wanted to look at small details in the text when you said that originally it's not that always wrong it's just that I didn't know what they're looking closely with so,,,410.2,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"keep everyone should keep in mind when I hear these answers I want to know, like small details from the text so",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,let's go away right and wrong we're just thinking about like how specific can we get,,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,um let's see I don't think I heard from,,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,Oliver could you repeat your answer as well,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
477,Oliver,"um yeah well, I suppose same thing as Farrah",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"Oh, I see okay",,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"could then let's see if you could give me another detail that Farrah hasn't said, yet, could you tell me",,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,Where they're using the microscope again,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
477,Oliver,i'm okay yeah so um they use a microscope to look at a tiny on ice particles and polar craters,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
477,Teacher,Quick does everyone know what a crater is,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,Really sharp raise your hand if you know what a crater is,,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"Okay, great",,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,So it's,,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"Okay, you can put your hands down Thank you just tracking it's Okay, if you don't care we're looking at the little divots or shapes in the moon, yes Chris oh",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
477,Chris,"Well, I know what craters are because I actually went to NASA",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
477,Chris,And I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"that connects to something Luis said earlier, I think about the oxygen tanks, could you tell could Luis could you tell me what type of scientists could use an oxygen tank",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
477,Luis,Oh yeah astronaut,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
477,Teacher,astronaut okay so let's keep that in mind astronaut use oxygen tanks,,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,But something tells me that oxygen that astronauts aren't actually on this mission could someone let's take a minute look in the text tell me why I don't think astronauts are on this mission,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Jazmin,"Well, it doesn't actually say the word astronaut anywhere in the story",,,,response,0,1,2
477,Teacher,So we're missing that detail good,,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"that's a good notice you just said so, even though we might be able to assume astronaut you're somewhere for this for this section, we can only assume what they tell us, but let's keep that in mind, just in case they mention it later yes",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
477,Oliver,"Oh, I just locked up a clock on it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for working with us today and reminding us to really look for small details and add them into one answer that is so helpful Thank you so much i'm",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
477,Teacher,glad I could help you after lunch them,,,,remark,0,1,2
477,Teacher,"Great, thank you for",,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,Something stuck in my throat okay that wasn't cute,,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"Okay, thank you for sharing that with Chris, hopefully",,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,we're seeing how we can use different parts of the text to talk about an earlier part,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,yes Luis,,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Luis,"i'm okay I got this all figured out, so I'm all good",,,,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,What do you mean all figured out,,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
477,Luis,i'm like the answer to the question i'm all set I got it,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,The great thing about reading is that you can always ask more questions and deeper questions,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,I think we can push it a little more,,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,Oliver I wanted to ask you a question,,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,Since you circled the same thing I Farrah did you find something else about microscopes that could help us talk about,,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,Did you find anything else about about the microscope passage that could help us talk about how much water there is,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
477,Oliver,"Okay um well Farrah told us about part of it, but also uses the word microscopic on which it has just like microscope",,,210.4,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,and just to be just to be clear could someone tell me what microscopic means,,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,I like that you found relationship between the words,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
477,Oliver,um yeah yeah that's like super super small,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"Yes, and I really liked how many supers you use because they have to zoom and even though, as Chris said the craters very big the amount of water, they can find is very, very small",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,that's why I want to ask everyone a follow up question,,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,Do you think the water they can find,,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,Sorry,,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher, i'm going to say the question and then i'm going to ask you to do something with your responses,,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"Will the water they find on the moon be valuable and what I want you to ask you to do, while you're thinking of an answer is",,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"so one more time, will the water they find on the moon be valuable to them",,,120.2,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"Find text evidence, just as you were doing in that first part of class to inform this answer",,,120.2,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Farrah,i'm i'm i'm a little confused still,,,,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"On the directions, or something else",,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
477,Farrah,No about the microscope,,,230.1,response,2,1,2
477,Farrah,"Because, is the Lunar orbiter the right answer, or is it the microscope?",,,,response,2,1,2
477,Farrah,I don't get it,,,,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"ooh That was a good question let's pause writing on my second question, so we can all talk about this",,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,So my question was um,,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"Well, actually, let me ask you",,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"Which one, do you think is correct microscopes or lunar orbiters",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
477,Farrah,me or anyone,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,Anyone,,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,that's go with Luis,,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Luis,um well I think it's probably both I mean lunar orbiter I mean that sounds really fancy cool and it sounds like it can like find the location of the water and then microscopes are you can see it so um I think it's probably both,,,,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,Thank you for sharing back does anyone have a different answer than Luis,,,130.2,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,will go Jazmin and then Oliver,,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Jazmin,"And so I I kind of think that, like the Lunar orbiter is like the better answer, not that microscopes is bad, but I think lunar orbiter",,,,response,2,1,2
477,Jazmin,"says the exact thing, like the one thing they used to, like discover the water, like discover like find it like where it is I don't think i'm microscope could do that because, only one microscope won't do a lot on a great big moon",,,,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,And let's go to Oliver before I try to talk to everyone,,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Oliver,"um wow I was gonna say microscope but what Jazmin side as making me think a little bit, but I still don't understand how you can find something that's too small to see how can you even discover it if you can't see it yeah",,,,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"um so let's try to combine some answers So what did they what did they use to get to the moon, in the first place",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
477,Oliver,um well definitely not a microscope,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"Which piece of equipment, did they use if it's not a microscope",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
477,Oliver,Well gotta be the Lunar orbiter,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"So we have the Lunar orbiter but Oliver just said, the Lunar orbiter can't see anything super super tiny so they also need that microscope so it's going to be",,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,So both of those answers as Luis were saying earlier,,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,is something you would use to find water on the moon,,,130.1,remark,2,1,2
477,Oliver,um I also read that there could be a base on the moon by,,,130.1,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,And where did you read that,,,230.2,remark,2,1,2
477,Oliver,i'm online i'm on the site on a science website for kids,,,230.2,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"So if there is a base on the moon,  if we have two pieces of equipment lunar orbiter and microscopes ,which piece of equipment would they not need any more if they have a base on the moon",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
477,Oliver,"Lunar orbiter because, like you're already there",,,210.3,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"Exactly so so before if we didn't have a base on the moon, we need the Lunar order to get there, because we can't just wait chuck microscope at the moon and hope it lands",,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"But if they're already on the moon, they can have the microscopes already there there doesn't need anything to transport the microscope to the place so",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,2,1,2
477,Farrah,"i'm so sorry because this class is so fun i'm learning so much, but we have to go to lunch and I just wanted to say before we go Thank you so much",,,,response,2,1,2
477,Farrah,"You really made me feel like you valued my answer, and I think everybody probably agrees on that and you've really helped us use our thinking to find the best answer, and that was really cool",,,,response,2,1,2
477,Teacher,"i'm glad with We thank you, please, enjoy your second one",,,,remark,2,1,2
479,Teacher,Start simulation,,,,remark,2,0,4
479,Teacher,"Hello i'm happy to be back with you all, and I believe that we left off trying to add some more to Jazmin's response trying to strengthen it, and I know that we talked about we added the name of the machine the Lunar orbiter and I think that we, yes Luis?",,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
479,Luis,"yeah yeah I I did that, so I think I got this all figured out i'm all good",,,230.3,response,2,0,4
479,Teacher,Well Would you mind sharing with us how you would maybe answer this question like?,,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
479,Luis,"yeah, so I think she should just add the name I think she should just say um",,,120.4,response,2,0,4
479,Luis,I don't remember Jazmin What was your answer?,,,,response,2,0,4
479,Luis,"yeah, so I think you can just say nasa's small machine called a lunar orbiter and that's a good answer",,,,response,2,0,4
479,Teacher,"Does anyone have a different feeling about that answer, do you think the Jazmin has included everything she needs to she talked about the WHO or anything else Farrah?",,,130.2,remark,2,0,4
479,Farrah,um no she didn't have the WHO and,,,130.2,response,2,0,4
479,Farrah,I don't remember the other thing that you said we're supposed to have she has what,,,,response,2,0,4
479,Farrah,I saw is it just who and what,,,,response,2,0,4
479,Teacher,Maybe let's just start with the WHO who,,,,remark,2,0,4
479,Farrah,"Will the question says, or what equipment it scientists use, so the scientists are the hoop",,,,response,2,0,4
479,Teacher,so how can we add that into Jazmin's response,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
479,Teacher,"Yes, you're right the scientists were the WHO,",,,110.4,remark,2,0,4
479,Farrah,"um I mean, I guess, we could still use what Luis said Oh well, she said NASA sent a small machine for me, she could say um",,,110.4,response,2,0,4
479,Farrah,I guess NASA,,,,response,2,0,4
479,Farrah,Scientists into small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,,response,2,0,4
479,Teacher,"take a closer look back at the text and it says in the second paragraph NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate so thinking about that, I think that Jazmin might be correct that the who would be NASA at least from reading through that sentence",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
479,Teacher,So as a complete response if Jazmin were to say,,,,remark,2,0,4
479,Teacher,NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,110.1,remark,2,0,4
479,Teacher,Where did they send it to did you include that Jazmin,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
479,Jazmin,No,,,210.3,response,2,0,4
479,Teacher,"Okay, so where did they send this machine to",,,120.2,remark,2,0,4
479,Jazmin,get them on,,,120.2,response,2,0,4
479,Teacher,"Right, so I think that that would give you a more complete or a stronger response",,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
479,Teacher,Does anyone think that she i'm sorry did I interrupt someone,,,,remark,2,0,4
479,Farrah,i'm sorry teacher,,,,response,2,0,4
479,Farrah,i'm still kind of confused,,,,response,2,0,4
479,Teacher,"which part, are you confused about",,,230.1,remark,2,0,4
479,Farrah,"Well, because our teacher said that we're supposed to use the key words in the question um, and so the key word in a question are some equipment scientists discover water moon those are the ones that I underlined so",,,230.1,response,2,0,4
479,Farrah,Does that mean all of those words have to be in the answer too?,,,,response,2,0,4
479,Teacher,"that's a really good question, I think, thinking about the like the keywords that you pulled out, and the key words in the question",,,,remark,2,0,4
479,Teacher,I think it's important to look back at our response and just think about if it matches,,,,remark,2,0,4
479,Teacher,"The question when we're looking for an answer it's important to think about those keywords and it can also be helpful to create our sentence, but I wouldn't say that it necessarily has to be in your response",,,510.1,remark,2,0,4
479,Teacher,Does that help?,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
479,Farrah,yeah yeah that does,,,150.1,response,2,0,4
479,Teacher,Thank you okay so Jazmin do you feel like you've changed your your process for working through text and questions,,,530.1,remark,2,0,4
479,Jazmin,"Okay um so for my process at first, I was just looking for",,,530.1,response,2,0,4
479,Jazmin,The equipment,,,,response,2,0,4
479,Jazmin,"And then you, you said that it had to I had to I should say the name of it um and then you asked if we had the WHO and today, Anna said no, but then she said yeah and you said that NASA could be the WHO",,,,response,2,0,4
479,Jazmin,"And then we added something else, but I don't remember what else we added other than the name",,,,response,2,0,4
479,Teacher,I remember that we added the were,,,,remark,2,0,4
479,Teacher,"So the moon, we said",,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
479,Teacher,Um,,,,remark,2,0,4
479,Chris,"Sorry, I was just thinking when you set the where that are I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so that could be another another thing",,,,response,2,0,4
479,Chris,"I guess, not for your answer, but that's more information about the weird",,,,response,2,0,4
479,Teacher,"Thank you for sharing that with us that's a very interesting fact I didn't know that does anyone else, want to try working through their response or strengthening it",,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
479,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,4
479,Teacher,So,,,,remark,2,0,4
479,Teacher,let's start with you Chris,,,,remark,2,0,4
479,Chris,"Scientists phone crude is for water on the moon, so I have the WHO and I have the weird",,,,response,2,0,4
479,Chris,And I guess the what is the craters,,,,response,2,0,4
479,Chris,"Okay, scientists, is the whole that's the same",,,210.3,response,2,0,4
479,Chris,"Water on the moon, is the same craters oh Okay, the equipment is wrong",,,,response,2,0,4
479,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,4
479,Teacher,Do you see a spot maybe where you could just add that in there,,,210.3,remark,2,0,4
479,Chris,hey oh,,,210.3,response,2,0,4
479,Chris,Scientists,,,,response,2,0,4
479,Chris,sent the Lunar orbiter to find craters for water on the moon,,,,response,2,0,4
479,Teacher,"I I like what you gave me there Let me read the question, one more time and then I can think about your answer a little bit what equipment and scientists use to discover what on and you said oh i'm sorry Oliver, yes",,,120.2,remark,2,0,4
479,Oliver,i'm trying to and I love to teach I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch,,,120.2,response,2,0,4
479,Oliver,"But I wanted, I wanted to say thank you for when you explain what we needed to work on, and you, you help me think about my strategy",,,,response,2,0,4
479,Oliver,"um I didn't even notice about like thinking about like who and what and the were in the question and trying to match it to my answer, so I think that was really useful for me",,,,response,2,0,4
479,Teacher,i'm happy that was helpful for you,,,,remark,2,0,4
479,Oliver,Okay bye teacher,,,,response,2,0,4

479,Luis,um yeah excuse me um I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,0,4
479,Teacher,"Well, maybe you can help us out today I think we're going to need some help as we just take a deeper look at the text",,,110.3,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher, Does that sound good?,,,110.3,remark,0,0,4
479,Luis,"Oh yeah, of course",,,110.3,response,0,0,4
479,Teacher,"Thank you, wonderful so you guys read about scientists and the moon, and can anyone tell me what did they discover?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,0,0,4
479,Chris,yeah it's so cool the scientists they discovered craters full of water on the moon,,,,response,0,0,4
479,Teacher, I didn't know that there was water on the moon before I read the text so that was a very interesting fact to me as well,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,Did anyone else have anything that they found very interesting? Oliver,,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,Very cool,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
479,Oliver,"yeah well, I thought i'm sorry um it was interesting how they said that the water is is really, really small it's actually like a really, really, really small pieces",,,110.2,response,0,0,4
479,Teacher, Does anyone remember what word they use to describe how small the water i? Farrah,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,I think that there's a word for that,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
479,Farrah,"yeah I do because it's it's kind of part of my answer, they use the word microscopic and so that's why I said you'd need a microscope to discover the water, so you can look at it really closely",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
479,Teacher,Very good um as I was looking at all of your answers I noticed that,,,,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,"Oh well, when I was looking at your answers and now as i'm talking to you all i'm noticing that when we're talking we're picking out some of the smaller details",,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,And I think when we're answering questions such as the one of what equipment that the scientists use,,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,"to discover the water on the moon, I think that what will make our answer so much better was if we put in some of those details we just talked about",,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,So what I would like to do is take a minute to think about the WHO and the what and the how so who do we need to focus on?,,,210.2,remark,0,0,4

479,Luis,The scientists,,,210.2,response,0,0,4
479,Teacher,"Yes, very good the scientists",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher," And what did they find? I think we all know, this one",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
479,Chris,yeah that's the water,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
479,Teacher,"Very good, and how did they find it? We know that the water was microscopic, it was very small, but what what type of tool did they use to find it? Farrah mentioned that they used a microscope to see the water, but what what i'm what type of invention, it was it had a really cool name",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,0,0,4
479,Jazmin,"yeah yeah so in my answer, I said something different, I said that NASA sent a small machine, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,0,4
479,Teacher, Does anyone know what paragraph maybe that they named the small machine in?,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,So you mentioned a small machine,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,"Your answer is not wrong, actually, but it could be even better",,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
479,Jazmin,Because that's where I found my answer it's in Part two,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
479,Teacher,"Very good yeah so as i'm looking and i'm reading, part two, or paragraph two, I see that they called it a lunar orbiter",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,"hmm, how do you think we can work a lunar orbiter into our answers? It says that they used it to investigate",,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
479,Jazmin,"I guess I wouldn't be that hard, I mean I could say that the equipment is a small machine and it's called the Lunar orbiter",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
479,Teacher,I would agree,,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher, What do you all think? Do you think that that strengthens Jazmin's answer?,,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,0,0,4
479,Chris,"Well yeah I think it does, because now it kind of makes me imagine what what it looks like when because when you just said, small machine I couldn't really picture it",,,,response,0,0,4
479,Chris,"But also, I wanted to say I kind of know what what these things might look like because I went to NASA actually I went there and I found out that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,0,0,4
479,Teacher,"Thank you for that information, yes, I agree with you, I think it",,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,"It allows you to kind of visualize maybe even if I don't know what a lunar orbiter is it helps me kind of imagine some type of machine, so thank you for that Thank you",,,310.1,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,"um, I also would like to know what you guys circled in the text",,,230.2,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher," I know that you guys have formulated some answers, but what what led you to your answers? Oliver",,,230.2,remark,0,0,4
479,Oliver,yeah okay i'm still i'm a little confused because I circled the microscope um but it sounds like lunar orbit is supposed to be the answer and I don't totally understand why,,,230.2,response,0,0,4
479,Teacher,"Sure, well let's let's think about it",,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher, So what does it mean to discover something?,,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher, So the question asked us what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
479,Oliver,Like to find it for the first time,,,210.2,response,0,0,4
479,Teacher,"And, and so, when I reading paragraph two, it says that they sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher," But we also know that later in paragraph three, paragraph three, it says that, where is it, the water they found was microscopic",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher,So let's think about this,,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
479,Teacher, Do you think that maybe they used both of those things to find the water?,,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
479,Oliver,Oh um that could be it,,,130.1,response,0,0,4
479,Oliver,"Because um you, you find it and then you look at it",,,,response,0,0,4
479,Teacher, What does anyone else-,,,110.2,remark,0,0,4

479,Oliver,But I just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us really listen to and build on each other's answers on and find the right names for the different pieces of equipment in the text just by listening to each other and talking about it,,,,response,0,0,4
479,Oliver, That was really interesting and cool,,,,response,0,0,4

482,Oliver,Luis got me all confused,,,,response,0,1,3
482,Teacher,that's okay,,,,remark,0,1,3
482,Teacher,I was wondering if you could expand or elaborate a little more on what you meant by you circled the same as Farrah,,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
482,Oliver,"Oh yeah okay i'm so sorry I know we both thought about the answer to the question about equipment was on the microscope and since she she started first, so I just said, I circled all the same thing, instead of repeating",,,120.2,response,0,1,3
482,Teacher,"I say and can the two of you both Oliver and Farrah, can you tell me where in the text you",,,,remark,0,1,3
482,Teacher,"You got your answer from did you did you circle, a certain part of the text where their context clues",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
482,Farrah,yeah so I circled the sentence that said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,230.2,response,0,1,3
482,Teacher,"Excellent thanks Farrah and Jazmin Would you mind sharing, can you share what you circled",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
482,Jazmin,"And so I circled small machine, my answer is NASA Center small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
482,Teacher,"Okay, I wouldn't say that your answer is wrong, I actually I don't think anybody's answers are right or wrong, I think that you you all circled a really important parts of the text that allow us to understand the different sorts of equipment that NASA uses to find water on space",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
482,Teacher,I think that you you all circled a really important parts of the text that allow us to understand the different sorts of equipment that NASA uses to find water on space,,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
482,Teacher,"So do you see Jazmin how a Microscope, microscope along with a small machine is used to find water on space",,,210.3,remark,0,1,3
482,Jazmin,"Oh yeah well, I guess, I just thought that the machine is what they use to do the discovering",,,210.3,response,0,1,3
482,Jazmin,And I don't know the microscope maybe they don't use it to discover,,,,response,0,1,3
482,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,0,1,3
482,Teacher,"So space exploration and finding water on space, there are a lot of steps and processes that come with that right and and Jazmin you you touch on a really important part of that, as do Farrah and Oliver",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
482,Teacher,"Now Chris, can you tell us what you you wrote as your response",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
482,Chris,"yeah Okay, well, I said that scientists found creators, full of water on the moon",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
482,Teacher,mm hmm,,,,remark,0,1,3
482,Teacher,That is exactly right and did you see anywhere in the text that told you what sort of equipment allowed them to find the craters,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
482,Chris,"Oh well, I don't know about in the text, but I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
482,Teacher," Luis knows this, correct",,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
482,Teacher,This is all true,,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
482,Luis,yep yep oxygen tanks are my answer to that one Chris,,,140.1,response,0,1,3
482,Teacher,What else do you think are important tools that allow them to look at water,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
482,Teacher,"yep so oxygen tanks small machines microscopes, these are all really important pieces of equipment that allow NASA scientists to look at water on the moon",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
482,Chris,wow hmm maybe they need something to collect the water,,,130.2,response,0,1,3
482,Teacher,"They definitely need something to collect the water that's excellent Chris,",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
482,Teacher,what else how are they traveling to the moon,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
482,Teacher,anybody can raise their hand or shout out,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3

482,Teacher,Anything else that we have,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
482,Luis,"wow the rocket ships landing gear if they're going to go on the moon, they need landing gear um suits and masks, Chris already said that, food, really gross food for them to eat on the trip um",,,130.2,response,0,1,3
482,Luis,I think there's a lot of things really a lot of things,,,,response,0,1,3
482,Teacher,"there's probably a lot of things, I mean when when astronauts are going to space they they're packing for a long time right",,,,remark,0,1,3
482,Teacher,yeah they're not,,,,remark,0,1,3
482,Teacher,Yet we're not taking a day trip to the moon they're they're there for a little while,,,210.1,remark,0,1,3
482,Luis,"yeah if we could take a day trip to the moon, I would have done that already",,,210.1,response,0,1,3
482,Teacher,yeah me to that would be that would be really interesting would anybody else be interested in going to the moon,,,,remark,0,1,3
482,Teacher,show of hands anybody interested in going to the moon Farrah oh alright Oliver Chris,,,,remark,0,1,3
482,Teacher,jas Jazmin you're not so interested in going to the moon,,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
482,Jazmin,I would rather stay here on earth and focus on protecting the earth,,,140.1,response,0,1,3
482,Teacher,I like that answer what How would you plan to protect the earth do you have ideas on that,,,140.1,remark,0,1,3
482,Jazmin,"yeah well, we need to plant more trees to save the forests and we need to protect our oceans, by not dumping trash and by making sure that we recycle",,,140.1,response,0,1,3
482,Teacher," Farrah, why are you interested in going to the moon",,,140.1,remark,0,1,3

483,Teacher,"Alright, so Hello everyone and, as you all know, we just finished reading the water on the moon text talking about the moon, is a desert, and we are all responding to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes Luis",,,120.2,remark,0,0,4
483,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this room, I already know all about space",,,120.2,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,"Oh well, then, would you like to start, do you have an answer to this question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.4,remark,0,0,4
483,Luis,Oh yeah well um I said that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks,,,120.4,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,"that's a really cool insight and I really appreciate that you're bringing all this knowledge to our group, but my question is, is there a place in the text in the reading that we could find how the scientists use what like what Oliverice they used to find the water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
483,Luis,um you mean like in the story?,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,yeah in the story was there a part that maybe some one of your peers can help you find it,,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
483,Teacher,"Was there a spot in the text, talking about what Oliverice things to find the water on the moon?",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
483,Teacher,"Yes, Farrah",,,,remark,0,0,4
483,Farrah,yeah well I said you'd need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely,,,,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,"yeah so that's a really good addition Thank you yeah I see that in paragraph three, it talks about the microscope and that's how they're looking at the water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
483,Teacher,But do we know how they discovered and found the water is there a place in the reading where we know what Oliverice they used to find it,,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
483,Farrah,Is it not a microscope because how how could you discover something if if you can't see it,,,210.2,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,that's a really good question um but let's take a look at paragraph three let's see what it says,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
483,Teacher,"And so it says the water they found is microscopic meaning they wouldn't be able to see it if it were, if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.3,remark,0,0,4
483,Teacher,Maybe someone else could offer something yeah Jazmin,,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
483,Teacher,"So you're right, we do need the microscope to see the water but i'm wondering, maybe, if we take a look at paragraph two is, are there any other tools that the scientists were using",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
483,Jazmin,"Yes, I found my answer in paragraph two, but I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,So do you want to share answer with the group and we can work through it together,,,120.4,remark,0,0,4
483,Jazmin,"Yes, well, I said NASA send a small machine",,,120.4,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,"yeah so um So yes, it definitely is a small machine, but can you tell me where in the text you got the answer",,,230.2,remark,0,0,4
483,Jazmin,The very beginning of Part two,,,230.2,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,Can you read it to the to our group so we're we're on the same page,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
483,Jazmin,yeah,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
483,Jazmin,It says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,"Thank you for reading um yeah so you're right, so it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so you're right, it is a small machine, but what is the tool, called the specific tool used",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
483,Teacher,Maybe someone else can offer something,,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
483,Farrah,So you're saying you're saying it's the Lunar orbiter and not the microscope,,,130.2,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,"Well, what do other people think does anyone else have a suggestion so right now we're thinking is it a microscope Is it the Lunar orbiter what do we think the scientists used to find the water yeah Chris",,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
483,Chris,Oh well,,,130.2,response,0,0,4
483,Chris,"I went to NASA so I know that scientists, he was a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,yeah so that's great you bringing in outside information and love that very exciting and can help us have a bigger picture of what we're looking at,,,110.3,remark,0,0,4
483,Teacher,"However, I want us to take a look at the reading specifically",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
483,Teacher,"Because we want to make sure that What we're talking about everyone has the same basis, understanding and you have outside understanding from NASA which is amazing",,,110.3,remark,0,0,4
483,Teacher,But not everyone else has that but what everyone else does have is the reading that we just did so just to make sure that everyone's on the same page let's take a look back at the reading so again,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
483,Teacher,"yeah so as far as we know, in the reading the tools that we have our microscopes and lunar orbiters and the question we're answering is which tool to the scientists use to discover the water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
483,Teacher,"Oliver Do you have anything, maybe, maybe, an idea",,,,remark,0,0,4
483,Oliver,"Okay yeah well, I suppose, the same as something about the microscope but now Jazmin read that part about the Lunar orbiter and how it investigates so now now i'm really confused I don't know which one it is because they both sound pretty good to me",,,,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,"yeah that they both do sound pretty good and that's why we're talking about it so let's take a look at that sentence, again, the one that Jazmin read aloud",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
483,Teacher,So NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate So what do we think the author meant by investigating what are they looking for,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
483,Oliver,"um well, it sounds like it was it was looking looking for is deposits right little teeny tiny ice",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,yeah yes they're looking for the ice and so we're looking for ice and the question we're answering is about water So what do we think is the Lunar orbiter looking for ice is lunar orbiter looking for water is that the same thing,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
483,Oliver,"Oh yeah yeah it's just water, so I guess if they sent a lunar orbit are looking for ice then then it's really looking for the water",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,yeah yeah so so what what does everyone else thinking so now that we've had this discussion are we thinking that the Lunar lunar orbiter from the water or that the microscope on the water or do you think that they're playing different roles yeah Chris,,,210.3,remark,0,0,4
483,Chris,"Well, I I really like what you just said about playing different roles, and I think it's I think it's that because it sounds like",,,210.3,response,0,0,4
483,Chris,They sent the Lunar orbiter to look for like to discover the the water in the little little ice deposit but then maybe they had to use the microscope to on over to examine it,,,,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,What does everyone else think,,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
483,Teacher,Do people or agree or disagree with what Chris just said that the Lunar orbiter with us to find or discover the water and the microscope was used to actually look at it specifically yeah,,,130.2,remark,0,0,4
483,Oliver,"that's that's really good answer, I agree with Chris about that, but I just I just looked at the clock and i'm so sorry but we we actually have to go to lunch, right now, but I really wanted to say, we really appreciate how you really took your time and",,,130.2,response,0,0,4
483,Oliver,sent us back to look at that text and helped us understand the purpose of each of the tools and which one was the best answer for the question Thank you so much,,,,response,0,0,4
483,Teacher,Thank you all for contributing,,,,remark,0,0,4

484,Teacher,I just wanted to ask you if you could share a little bit about what this machine with this machine was used for,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"Well, your answer is not wrong you're actually really correct NASA did send a small machine",,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
484,Jazmin,"um Okay, so it says they sent it to investigate in craters to find that water",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"yeah exactly they sent these machines into or onto the moon, to see if they could investigate and actually look for the water perfect answer Jazmin do you happen to remember what the small machine was called or do you want to look back into the text, see if you can find some evidence",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
484,Jazmin,Can I look back,,,210.4,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,yeah definitely,,,,remark,0,0,3
484,Jazmin,"Okay, it says NASA send a small machine oh oh it's right here and a lunar orbiter",,,,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,yep exactly Jazmin a lunar orbiter good job,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"alright, so we have had Farrah and Jazmin share their answers, so far, and we have Luis Chris and they've left with either one of you like to volunteer to go next",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
484,Teacher,yeah go for it Oliver,,,,remark,0,0,3
484,Oliver,"um Okay, so I circled the fame of Farrah about the microscope and i'm a little unclear about why the microscope",,,,response,0,0,3
484,Oliver,Is that the wrong answer because you said that Jazmin's answer was a right answer,,,,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"That is a very good question so Jazmin's answer was correct, but your answer is also correct because this question has multiple answers to it",,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
484,Teacher,So remember our question is asking about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,0,3
484,Teacher,And we learned a bit about how this is a really big endeavor so there wasn't just one piece of equipment that scientists use there's actually many pieces of equipment and tools,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"So Jazmin Farrah pointed out one, and then you also pointed out another one similar to Farrah, which was a microscope correct",,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
484,Oliver,yeah yeah we pick that same one,,,230.3,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,Okay perfect sounds good let's see we have Chris and Luis left would either of you like to go okay go for it Chris,,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
484,Chris,"Okay well so two things one for my answer, I said well that scientists be found creators, full of water on the moon, and so actually I went to NASA and I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,120.4,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"yeah you're right they use tons of equipment, like the ones that you mentioned, and you kind of talked about how um they found craters full of water on the moon, can I ask you what makes you say that",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
484,Chris,"Okay, so when part one, they say",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
484,Chris,"That the scientists found evidence that water can be found in the moon's polar creators, so I know that craters are these big score so sort of like holes but above ground and so i'm picturing these critters full of water like lakes of water, because craters are so big",,,,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"yeah they are really been a you're correct, so you had mentioned that you visit a NASA before correct and so out of all",,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"That you got to see there which one of those has been mentioned in this passionate in this passage in which one of those do you believe, help the scientists get to these craters and actually find the water",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
484,Chris,"Oh, like pick one of the ones in the story",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,yeah exactly,,,,remark,0,0,3
484,Chris,"Oh okay um well I think Jazmin sounds really good about the Lunar orbiter I don't know if I saw that one, but I definitely saw other small machines that they launched into space",,,,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"Oh wow did you get a chance to take any pictures, maybe you could bring them to class and show us one day",,,140.1,remark,0,0,3
484,Chris,"Oh yeah my dad took so many pictures, it was actually kind of embarrassing",,,140.1,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"I definitely feel you there my parents used to take a lot of pictures whenever we went anywhere, when I was a kid so I can definitely relate to that embarrassment",,,140.1,remark,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"But thank you so much for your answer Chris, and I think it is now time to move on to Luis are you ready to share your answer Luis",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
484,Luis,"yeah I am so my answer, I said well if kind of like Kara since actually cuz I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,120.4,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"Okay, and what makes you say that they use oxygen tanks",,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
484,Luis,"yeah well if there's astronauts up there on the moon, I know 100% they have oxygen tanks",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"Sorry, can you repeat that one more time Luis",,,,remark,0,0,3
484,Luis,"Oh yeah I said, if there's astronauts on the moon, I know for sure, without a doubt that they have oxygen tanks",,,,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,Exactly and where have you seen that information before,,,230.1,remark,0,0,3
484,Luis,"Oh it's like and anything that space, you say the astronauts with their oxygen tanks",,,230.1,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"Okay, so oxygen tanks is a really important tool, like you had mentioned earlier, obviously, they would not be able to breathe, give me one second okay i'm just gonna ask Luis a quick question",,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"Luis so, can you tell me what other tools or equipment may have been used to discover water so oxygen tanks are used to help the scientists breathe it if they go out to space, but what do you think they use to discover water",,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
484,Luis,And um well i'm I gotta admit I didn't really read this but I listened to the conversation and I heard myself and I heard lunar orbiter,,,210.3,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,Okay sounds good was there a reason you were unable to read this passage or anything that I can assist you with,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
484,Luis,"i'm now, I think I was probably just thinking about my own space and watching videos on YouTube",,,150.1,response,0,0,3
484,Teacher,"Okay sounds good, well, maybe next time we can try and read our passage first and then see if we can come back and spend some time on those extra tasks without sound Okay, so that we can make sure that we're fully in the conversation right",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
484,Luis,uh huh okay,,,150.1,response,0,0,3

484,Teacher,"Friends, how are you doing today",,,,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,1,0,3
484,Luis,I don't think I should be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"Oh yeah I remember our conversation from last time, when you were talking about how much you know about space definitely well",,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"i'm going to go ahead and share the game plan with you for today and then maybe we can talk about why I felt like we should all be talking together in a small group to learn from each other, does that sound okay",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
484,Luis,yeah okay,,,150.1,response,1,0,3
484,Teacher,Thank you Luis for being such a team player,,,,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"Alright, so our plan for today is that I am going to give each of you guys some time to read over your responses to the question that I had originally asked which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,After you guys get some time to think about your responses individually,,,,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,I am going to either pair you up with a partner or speak to you individually about your response and we'll kind of talk about why you wrote that response and maybe some ways that we could improve your response,,,220.1,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"After that we are going to give each of you some time, maybe two or three minutes to revise your response, and then we will share with our small group does that sound like a good plan",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,Can I get a thumbs up yeah yeah okay,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
484,Luis,that's a good plan yeah,,,150.1,response,1,0,3
484,Teacher,Okay sounds good alright so right now I am going to give each of you individually 30 seconds to read over your response and think about what made you write that response,,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"Alright, so our question is, why did you choose to write that response so starting now i'm going to give you about 30 seconds to think about that",,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,Alright perfect now I am going to have Dave and Farrah partner up and talk to each other about what you were just thinking about,,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,okay does that sound good,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"Jazmin and Luis I want you to partner up and do the same and Chris, you and I are going to spend some time together and be partners for today",,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"All right, perfect so Chris, can you go ahead and read your response to me",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
484,Chris,yeah okay um so I wrote down that all,,,120.4,response,1,0,3
484,Chris,Scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,,response,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"Great and what made you write that answer, can you tell me a little bit little bit about that",,,230.1,remark,1,0,3
484,Chris,"yeah our teacher told us to look for kind of the key word so it's looking for scientists and finding and water on the moon, and so that's how I found it in the first paragraph",,,230.1,response,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"Oh, I really like that strategy of looking for keywords I think that that can be really helpful i'm i'm actually really happy that you chose to use that strategy",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,do you think you can rephrase that question and put it in your own words,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"So let's look at the question again, it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
484,Chris,All okay oh wow,,,120.2,response,1,0,3
484,Chris,"Oh, what scientists",,,,response,1,0,3
484,Chris,used to find water,,,,response,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"Great so what what is the question asking for, are they asking for um what was found on the moon, or are they asking for what tools or equipment was used to find water on the moon, what do you think",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
484,Chris,What tools or equipment was us,,,210.2,response,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"so let's think back to your answer, because your answer says that they found craters full of water on the moon",,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"yeah I agree, so I think that that's exactly what the question is asking it says what equipment, did they use",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"And one thing that i'm concerned about is that maybe your response doesn't exactly answered the question, what do you think about that, what are your thoughts",,,410.2,remark,1,0,3
484,Chris,"Well, I mean I went to NASA so I know that um scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,410.2,response,1,0,3
484,Teacher,yeah you're absolutely correct they do use all that equipment,,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"that sound good i'll give you about a few minutes to do that, while I go talk to another okay",,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"I want you to maybe take a minute, while I go speak to some of our other friends and see if you can look over the passage and see what equipment was mentioned in the passage",,,420.3,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"All right, great all right Oliver and Farrah",,,,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,let's hear what you guys have been talking about,,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,0,3
484,Jazmin,I you don't understand why my answers wrong,,,,response,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"Okay, can you give me just one, second, while I talked to Oliver and Farrah maybe you and Luis can talk about why you chose your answers and what you think is different between your answers",,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"All right, i'll be right here all right Oliver and Farrah, how is it going what have you guys been discussing",,,120.4,remark,1,0,3
484,Farrah,"Well, I was talking about",,,120.4,response,1,0,3
484,Farrah,"That I I picked up a microscope because it had all the keywords and not section of all story, and I was saying that um they had equipment and this was the only place where they were really talking about equipment and water",,,,response,1,0,3
484,Teacher,what are some key words,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"Okay, well, I think that it's great that you guys have been looking for keywords when I was speaking with Chris, he also He also mentioned the same thing, and I think that that's a really great strategy",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,That you picked out from the question itself did you guys think about that,,,,remark,1,0,3
484,Oliver,"Oh well, we both said equipment um",,,,response,1,0,3
484,Oliver,"Well, I said equipment to  discover water on the moon umpretty much all of them",,,,response,1,0,3
484,Teacher,yeah I agree it seems like all of the all of the words in the question are really important,,,110.1,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,but i'm going to pick the one that Farrah mentioned about equipment,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,which is a microscope correct,,,230.3,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,So it looks like you guys have come to the understanding that the question is asking what equipment did scientists use,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"and I really value how, in your answer you guys directly talked about a piece of equipment",,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,1,0,3
484,Oliver,yeah yeah yeah we talked about the microscope,,,,response,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"and i'm concerned that the responses that you guys chose, which is a microscope isn't necessarily us to discover water on the moon",,,410.2,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,can either you guys tell me what discover means,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"So the question is also asking um what equipment, do they use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,"Yes, this",,,,remark,1,0,3
484,Oliver,"i'm Okay, I know what discover means um I mean like when you're looking for something and on, you will find it on, but I also I just saw the clock and I just heard that it's time for us to go",,,,response,1,0,3
484,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,3
484,Oliver,bye,,,,response,1,0,3
484,Teacher,bye Thank you,,,,remark,1,0,3
484,Teacher,Okay start simulation,,,,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"All right, everyone, thank you for sharing your responses with our small group we are going to",,,,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"run, one by one i'm going to ask each of you a question, which is what made you say that",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"And after you have shared your answer with me, I am going to have you listened to our other friends responses all right, and I want you to think about their thinking, as well as you're thinking yes Luis",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Luis,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,150.1,response,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Yes, I remember you talking about how much you know about NASA and space and you think you've shared some interesting facts with us last time",,,110.3,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Well, we are going to learn today after our conversation about ways in which all of us can improve our responses so, even though we may know a lot about space there's still room for improvement for all of us, and so that's why we've all been working together on the side all right Luis",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Luis,Okay,,,150.1,response,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Thank you for sharing, though, and thanks for being a team player",,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"All right, Luis actually why don't we have you start off first so your response to our question was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen things can you tell me what made you say that",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Luis,"Well, they may say",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
484,Luis,Yes,,,,response,2,0,3
484,Luis,well,,,,response,2,0,3
484,Luis,"I know they use a lot of equipment, like in order to go to space they gotta breathe in breathe out oxygen tank so that's like good equipment",,,,response,2,0,3
484,Teacher,but one thing that i'm concerned about a bit is that I don't remember oxygen tanks being talked about in the passage,,,410.3,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"I agree yeah oxygen tanks, is an important piece of equipment for astronauts so I really like that you included that in your response",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Alright, so I want you to think about that, while I go ahead and talk to my other friends and I want you to look back into the passage and see if you can underline what equipment you read in the passage",,,420.3,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,All right,,,,remark,2,0,3
484,Luis,Okay okay,,,,response,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Okay perfect Thank you alright Jazmin let's go on to you, so you said that NASA sent a small machine So why did you choose to write about small machine, can you tell me a little bit about that",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Jazmin,"yeah I was looking for the answer and well in the second paragraph, and when I saw machine I know that's like equipment and this one's talking about",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
484,Jazmin,Finding are looking for ice deposit so I figured that was it yeah I don't understand why my answers wrong,,,,response,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Yes, well, I really value that you talked about a small machine and that you went back into the passage to look for evidence that supports your answer because",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Second, paragraph does talk about a small machine that NASA used, but I want you to think about a little bit about how you can make your answer more detailed and specific",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Okay, so, while you work on that i'm going to go ahead and move to our other friends does that sound good Jazmin or do you have any questions",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Alright, so think about adding some more details to your response based off what else is mentioned in passage to",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
484,Jazmin,um so you're saying I just gotta find more details and then add them to my answer,,,420.2,response,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Yes, in response to the question about what equipment was used to discover water",,,120.2,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Thank you Jazmin alright Chris, can you go ahead and read your response to me Chris",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
484,Chris,yeah sure I said um scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,120.4,response,2,0,3
484,Teacher,Great and what makes you say that where did you find that information,,,230.2,remark,2,0,3
484,Chris,In the first paragraph um yeah it's I took it right out of the text says all water can be found deep within the bones bone craters,,,230.2,response,2,0,3
484,Chris,Great,,,,response,2,0,3
484,Chris,And then I kind of put it in my own words,,,,response,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"All right, I appreciate you paraphrasing that and putting it into your own words",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"can you look back at the question and tell me what do you think the question is asking you for if you can tell me, and maybe just two or three words, what is the question asking",,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Chris,For,,,420.1,response,2,0,3
484,Chris,equipment,,,,response,2,0,3
484,Chris,The scientists use,,,,response,2,0,3
484,Chris,equipment that scientists use for water,,,,response,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Great that is completely correct and I want you to focus on two pieces of that question I want you to focus on that first word which is equipment and the second one, which is discover",,,420.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"All right, so equipment and discover now you talked in your response about scientists finding craters on the moon, which is absolutely correct, but I am concerned that your answer doesn't completely align with what the question is asking",,,410.2,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"So, given that we've talked about the two words equipment and discover and we've talked about your answer, I want you to see how you can revise your answer to align with what the question is asking",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,Does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Chris,Okay okay,,,150.1,response,2,0,3
484,Chris,"So, you know as for for well for equipment, I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like",,,,response,2,0,3
484,Chris,oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"you're right they do use all of those pieces of equipment, I want you to not let's not answer out loud, but I just want you to think about",,,110.3,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Are those pieces of equipment that you saw NASA used to discover water on the moon, or they used for a different purpose",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"So I want you to think about that a little bit okay and see if you can use the answer to that question revise your answer, thank you Chris alright if",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Oliver and Farrah I see that you guys had a similar answer right Farrah, you said that you i'm in your answer you talked about a microscope as a scientific tool to look really closely and they've used to that you circled the same thing, for your",,,230.3,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"response, so I want you that can you tell me, I know that in your answer you said you circle, the same as Farrah but can you put the answer to the question in your own words",,,420.2,remark,2,0,3
484,Oliver,"Okay sure um so I say, the answer is okay well I circle this part of the text on the answer is on the equipment, you need as a microscope to look closely at the water",,,420.2,response,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Okay, great Thank you so they've been Farrah what made you guys really focus on the microscope",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Can you tell me a little bit about what you were thinking when you really highlighted or underline the word microscope and included it in your response, either one of you guys can share yeah",,,230.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Oliver,"Well, I can share um Okay, so I was thinking you know um first off",,,230.1,response,2,0,3
484,Oliver,"We have to find a piece of equipment, and so I know when we're in science class the teacher is always like okay",,,,response,2,0,3
484,Oliver,we're going to use some science department to base or remember what you have to do and what sometimes we have goggles and sometimes we use the microscope So when I saw that one I was like okay,,,,response,2,0,3
484,Oliver,Max definitely equipment and then um I was looking for a place on the story where they're talking about,,,,response,2,0,3
484,Oliver,"Scientists using it, and on them discovering water and ballpark right before it says the water they found is microscopic and finding is like discovering and so that's how I came up with I don't know if I sing for you Farrah",,,,response,2,0,3
484,Teacher,What do you think Farrah do you want to share a little bit about your thoughts,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
484,Farrah,"um well I guess yeah that's that's similar for me, because I was looking for equipment and I saw the microscope and arm and I was looking for kind of the water on the moon part of it, and I saw that in um in that paragraph three",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"Great well, I really appreciate how you guys chose to look for a piece of equipment",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,"because that's what the question is asking for it's asking for a piece of equipment Chris, did you have a question",,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
484,Chris,"wasn't a question teacher, I was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch on what I wanted to say thank you for",,,310.1,response,2,0,3
484,Chris,"asking me those questions about my answer and taking some time to kind of explain how my ideas were connected and how they were connected so now, I have some ideas on how to make my answer better",,,,response,2,0,3
484,Teacher,Thank you Chris thanks for sharing that I hope you guys have a good lunch,,,,remark,2,0,3
484,Teacher,bye,,,,remark,2,0,3
484,Chris,bye teacher,,,,response,2,0,3
485,Teacher,hi students,,,,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,I think you just finish answering a really important question about the moon,,,,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,do you have a question Luis,,,,remark,0,0,4
485,Luis,Oh yeah well actually I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"Oh, maybe you can help us a little bit as we think about the question i'm so glad that you already know a lot about space um do you want to share one thing with us?",,,110.3,remark,0,0,4
485,Luis,What,,,110.3,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,Do you want to share one thing with us that you know about space,,,110.3,remark,0,0,4
485,Luis,"Oh Oh yes, I do okay my favorite thing about space is how Pluto it used to be a planet and then, then they like kicked it out of being a planet because it was too small it's like poor pluto too small company",,,110.3,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"that's funny I have heard about that I heard about that, on the news so that's great that you know something about Pluto I think today we'll talk a little bit about water on the moon, because that's what we read about in our article",,,150.1,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,So maybe um I wonder if Oliver could you repeat the question back to us if you have it handy,,,120.3,remark,0,0,4
485,Oliver,"yeah Okay, right here on the question as what equipment that scientists use or discover water on the moon",,,120.3,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,great and so if we think about what we read in the text and we try to consider this word equipment that might give us a little clue for what we're looking for and so,,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,Jazmin I really like how you found the word machine in the text because I find that that word machine is kind of similar to the word equipment,,,210.2,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"So Jazmin Maybe you can look at the text and tell us um what's the machine called that you were looking for, I think it was in the maybe the second paragraph",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
485,Jazmin,Oh,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
485,Jazmin,Let me check okay so NASA such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"that's perfect Thank you Jazmin, so I think part of a great answer for us when we're thinking about what's the equipment that the scientists use is exactly what Jazmin just said she called it a lunar orbiter do you have a question Farrah or maybe something you want to add",,,110.4,remark,0,0,4
485,Farrah,"yeah well um I said, I said that the answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answers wrong",,,110.4,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"Oh, I don't think that that's wrong, I think that you bring up a really good point because you found information in a different paragraph",,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"So what Farrah just said, was in the third paragraph and she's talking about the tool called a microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"So I think if we consider what Jazmin said, and we add what Farrah said, we might get a more complete picture of what scientists need to find water on the moon",,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,Does anyone want to tell me what they think the word microscopic means like what comes to your mind when you hear the word microscopic,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
485,Luis,I got this one I got this one,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,Thanks Luis go for it,,,,remark,0,0,4
485,Luis,yeah okay microscopic means so so so small,,,,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,yeah that's awesome so if we think about what we already know from the text we've got this thing called a lunar orbiter,,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"And then we've got what Farrah said, which was the microscope so these might be different pieces of equipment or tools that scientists are using to find water on the moon",,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"And so, has anyone here ever seen or used a microscope before",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
485,Oliver,Oh yeah we all use them in science class,,,210.4,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"awesome Chris, do you want to tell me like what can you do when you use a microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
485,Chris,"Well, you can you can see things that you couldn't really see without it, you can see bacteria and cells",,,210.4,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"yeah that's awesome thanks Chris, I always think it's kind of fun to consider the fact that, like we use our eyes to see everything around us, but there's so much more in this universe that we can't see without a microscope it's pretty incredible to think about",,,210.4,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,So,,,,remark,0,0,4
485,Chris,"Also Oh, can I add one thing",,,,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,yeah Please go ahead Chris,,,,remark,0,0,4
485,Chris,"Well okay well it's just that I, I went to NASA actually and I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment, like the oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,yeah um I think that you mentioned that,,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,Someone mentioned oxygen tanks in their answer,,,110.1,remark,0,0,4
485,Luis,That was me that was me I also had that same idea,,,110.1,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"yeah, so why do you think that scientists at NASA might want to use something like an oxygen tank when they're going to do their work on the moon",,,230.1,remark,0,0,4
485,Luis,"Well, without oxygen tanks, they wouldn't be able to breathe out in space they couldn't do anything without the oxygen tanks they'd just die",,,230.1,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"yeah, so I think, based on what everyone has shared we realize the scientists need lots of different tools to do their work right",,,110.2,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"So I think the three that we've identified so far, all together, will will lead us to a great answer and I think, specifically when we look at the text two have those specific pieces of equipment are mentioned explicitly in the text Jazmin do you want to say something",,,130.1,remark,0,0,4
485,Jazmin,"yeah well that was that was gonna be my question because I mean I picked the small machine and and I understand also microscope is in there, but I don't think I would have thought to put oxygen tanks because it's not really in the story so am I wrong if I don't say that?",,,130.1,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"No that's a great point Jazmin I don't think you're wrong if you don't say that because, like you said it's not mentioned in the text",,,110.4,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"But I always think it's really nice when you include some background knowledge like Luis did so, if you did, that great if you didn't it's no big deal",,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"Because by looking at what you found in the text, you have answered the question correctly, so we can always update our answers, and we can add more information that we hear our classmates sharing",,,420.2,remark,0,0,4
485,Oliver,"Well i'm i'm i'm really sorry about this, I just looked at the clock",,,420.2,response,0,0,4
485,Oliver,"i'm actually we are, we have to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for letting us know how important our our knowledge is and the things we know and how there's more than one right answer to this question, it was really great to learn that with you today",,,,response,0,0,4
485,Teacher,"Thanks, that it was really nice spending time with you all enjoy your lunch",,,,remark,0,0,4
485,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,hi everyone how are you,,,,remark,1,0,4
485,Chris,i'm good,,,,response,1,0,4
485,Luis,RER: Excuse me,,,,response,1,0,4
485,Luis,I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,1,0,4
485,Teacher,Oh i'm so excited you know a lot about space Luis you know I noticed that,,,110.3,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"In one of your answers for a question we're going to talk about it did seem like you have some great background knowledge of space, so I think that's really going to help the group when we go through these questions together so maybe you can share some of that with us in a minute Luis",,,,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,Okay um so yeah I think the one thing I noticed when I was looking at our answers to today's questions is that I think we've got a little bit of room to expand our understanding of the text,,,150.1,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"So I think if we chat together and put some of these pieces together we're all going to end up with really improved answers, so I think for this first question",,,150.1,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"The first question, I saw was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"and so you all had answers that i'd like to draw on, and I think I want to start with Jazmin Jazmin, can you tell us what you said for this first question",,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
485,Jazmin,yeah I said NASA sent a small machine,,,120.2,response,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"awesome, and so what I really like about what you said Jazmin is this word machine that you mentioned,",,,310.1,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"because I think of machines and equipment and in us in the same way, I think that those words are synonyms um",,,210.2,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"yeah and then I also noticed that Oliver and Farrah you guys took a similar approach when you are looking at the text because I, I think you guys used a different word, maybe Farrah do you mind telling us what you mentioned, for your answer",,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
485,Farrah,yeah I said microscope was the equipment,,,120.4,response,1,0,4
485,Teacher,Oliver you said the same thing?,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
485,Oliver,yeah I think the microscope was the equipment they used,,,120.4,response,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"Great yeah and Farrah when I read your answer you use the word tool to describe the microscope, and so I think that that's another great word when we're thinking of different types of equipment mentioned",,,310.1,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"And so let's just keep those words in our heads, as we talk through this so we've got what type of equipment and Jazmin you mentioned a machine",,,230.3,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,And then Farrah you use that word tool,,,230.3,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"um, so I think if we kind of bring all of these things together, we can get a more full answer",,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"Luis I want to come back to you hun because you mentioned um some other things that you know that scientists might use on the moon, do you want to tell us about what you think scientists may use on the moon",,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
485,Luis,yeah yeah so an important piece of equipment as an oxygen tank like they need those so they can breathe,,,120.4,response,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"yeah, of course, and that's going to come back again later, when we talk about our next question",,,110.1,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"Chris, you mentioned what the scientists were doing on the moon, do you want to tell us what the scientists were doing on the moon",,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
485,Chris,"um so they're looking for water right, and then they find water deep in these craters so like they found a whole bunch of craters with a whole lot of water",,,120.4,response,1,0,4
485,Teacher,yeah Jazmin do you have something to add,,,120.4,remark,1,0,4
485,Jazmin,But I guess I don't understand why my answers wrong,,,120.4,response,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"yeah let's take a look at that um I think if you all have your text in front of you, it might be a great time to take a look at Jazmin's answer and see how we can pull out a specific name of a piece of equipment",,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,If you guys can all look at that second paragraph that starts with the word NASA,,,120.3,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,Jazmin do you mind reading that first sentence out loud,,,120.3,remark,1,0,4
485,Jazmin,RER: NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,120.3,response,1,0,4
485,Teacher,can you tell us now that you just read that sentence again what was the name of that machine,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"Yeah great, so I think Jazmin I liked in your original answer, how you mentioned a small machine",,,310.1,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,yeah great and so um I think of work to put all of these pieces together into a full answer,,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,Chris tells us what the scientists were doing on the moon Luis knows all these different types of equipment that scientists use that maybe aren't mentioned in the text,,,230.3,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,And then Jazmin you just identified for us a specific piece of equipment that the article mentions is us on the moon when scientists are looking for water,,,230.3,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"So that's called our lunar orbiter so we can include that in our answer, and then I also liked what Oliver and Farrah mentioned about the microscope as another piece of equipment another tool that the scientists use so go ahead Chris",,,230.3,remark,1,0,4
485,Chris,To NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks,,,230.3,response,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"Absolutely, I think that we could probably come up with a really long list if we used our brains and thought about every single little thing that they might need a might need",,,110.3,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,They might need tools from a traditional toolbox as well i'm sure they need lots of different things as they do their exploration on the moon,,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"I think it's Nice, though, when we read a text, if we can scan the text for specific pieces of equipment, then that way when we write our answers out If I ever asked you can you tell me what paragraph you found that in you'd be able to point to that exact part of the text",,,510.1,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"so I think Jazmin you did just that, when you just re read that beginning of paragraph two",,,510.1,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"Oliver Maybe you can tell us, can you tell us where in the text you found that word microscope",,,230.2,remark,1,0,4
485,Oliver,yeah that was in paragraph three,,,230.2,response,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"Okay, great um Luis do you want to read that paragraph three, for us, maybe just focusing on the last sentence there",,,120.3,remark,1,0,4
485,Luis,You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,120.3,response,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"yeah and so when we're talking about this specific article in what the scientists need to find water on the moon, it looks like we've got these two different components here the microscope because those water molecules are super duper tiny",,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"And then we've got that lunar orbiter as another piece of equipment, what do you think that they were using that lunar orbiter for",,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,It says this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in the large polar crater,,,120.3,remark,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"Chris that sounds like a little bit of your answer, what do you guys think that lunar orbiter was doing on the moon?",,,210.4,remark,1,0,4
485,Oliver,looks like it's looking for deposit,,,120.3,response,1,0,4
485,Teacher,"yeah absolutely, so I think if you put these two different pieces, together, we have a really complete answer",,,420.2,remark,1,0,4
485,Oliver,yeah i'm sorry teacher but it's time for us to go,,,420.2,response,1,0,4
485,Teacher,Okay okay thanks guys great work,,,,remark,1,0,4
485,Jazmin,bye,,,,response,1,0,4
485,Teacher,let's start simulation,,,,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"Well, thanks for sharing your responses to the second question guys I think again, we have a great opportunity to take a look at the text to share with each other how we're thinking about this question and how we found our responses, using the text",,,220.1,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,So we've got a new question that's is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be invaluable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"And so I think that we've got two folks who said, no one person who said yes and then two people answered by talking through some of the evidence",,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"So maybe if we kind of glue all of this, together, we can come up with a clear answer so, can you raise your hand if you said no, that the water on the moon is not valuable",,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
485,Luis,"teacher Okay, I think I got this all figured out now so i'm all good",,,150.1,response,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"Oh okay um so maybe, could you hold off for one sec Luis",,,110.1,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,because I was wondering if we could raise our hand if we said that no the water was not valuable,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
485,Luis,Okay,,,110.1,response,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"Oliver you said something interesting you said not yet, and I really like that, because it makes me think that maybe there's more to the story, maybe something might happen, where it might be valuable",,,310.1,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"Luis let's come back to you because you mentioned something from the text that's so interesting and I hadn't thought of this before, why do you think that water",,,,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"Well, first of all, can you tell us what you said, what can we do with that water",,,120.4,remark,2,0,4
485,Luis,"I said that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen",,,120.4,response,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"yeah, and so I think that if we consider that this this water might not be ready yet like Oliver and Farrah said what might happen in the future is what Luis just said",,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"and that was in the tax Luis, can you tell me where in the text you found those words hydrogen and oxygen",,,230.2,remark,2,0,4
485,Luis,yeah it's in paragraph five,,,230.2,response,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"yeah great and so I saw that as well, what Luis do you think that, according to the text astronauts might be able to do with the hydrogen and the oxygen",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
485,Luis,"Okay, well, I know that we can breathe oxygen, and so they could breathe it",,,210.4,response,2,0,4
485,Luis,oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel yeah so rocket fuel,,,,response,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"yeah that's great and so that fuel is really necessary Luis I know you know, a ton about outer space, and so you probably know that we need to fuel these rockets to get around outer space and so",,,110.3,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,I think that Luis just identified one of the reasons why Water on the moon might be a valuable resource in the future ,,,110.4,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,Farrah do you have a question,,,,remark,2,0,4
485,Farrah,RER: Yeah well I'm still kind of confused,,,110.4,response,2,0,4
485,Teacher,Still kind of confused okay well let's keep thinking through this um is there anything in particular that's confusing you right now Farrah,,,230.1,remark,2,0,4
485,Farrah,"Well, because if Luis's right, then that will mean that i'm wrong, but I think that I think that I, I came up with a good answer, based on the text too",,,230.1,response,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"yeah and so maybe you can clarify your thinking for us a little bit, why do you think that maybe they're not ready to use the water yet",,,230.1,remark,2,0,4
485,Farrah,"Okay, because they talked about how like it costs a lot of money and it'll take a lot of time, which means that it's going to be a long time before you can do anything with it",,,230.1,response,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"yeah absolutely I agree with you, and you know what you just said Farrah made me think a little bit about like there's deposits of minerals and oil underneath the earth's surface and so",,,140.1,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"The oil just sitting underneath your surface itself might not be valuable and like you mentioned, we need time and we need money to extract those valuable things and so",,,,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,does that make sense Farrah,,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"I think you bring up this good point that, even though it might not be ready now the value might be there in the future",,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,okay cool and then I also saw that Chris you raise a totally different point that's also really important,,,,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,About how heavy water is and the need to carry water on the ships to to the moon and other locations in our universe,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"and so I wonder, can you tell us where he where did you find that part in the text he Chris yeah",,,230.2,remark,2,0,4
485,Chris,"own oh yeah Okay, in paragraph four, it says, for example, was this it could be useful lots of ways, for example, future astronauts could drink this water water is heavy it takes up a lot of Romana spacecraft having water available in the moment me more room on the spacecraft thing",,,230.2,response,2,0,4
485,Teacher,yeah and so kind of tying what Chris read back to what Farrah was asking like why isn't that answer correct that it's not ready to be used yet,,,230.3,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"Chris part of what you read said future astronauts could drink this water, so I think right now we're still in this like hypothetical state where we're thinking",,,210.4,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"Maybe in the future, might this be valuable and so I think if we kind of know",,,,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,yeah maybe we can glue all of these ideas together and come back to this question is there convincing evidence that water could be water on the moon could be valuable,,,120.2,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"has our thinking kind of changed at all, since we started talking through this Chris sorry I saw your hand was up",,,530.1,remark,2,0,4
485,Chris,"When you were talking about the future, I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024",,,120.2,response,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"yeah I mean it's really incredible to think about the progress we could make and all the discoveries, we can make",,,110.1,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"And so, in our first question we were talking about different types of equipment scientists use you all seem to know a little bit about that now",,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
485,Teacher,"And now thinking about like if we do make it back to the moon and we're looking for water, might it be valuable for our future scientists, Oliver go ahead yeah",,,150.1,remark,2,0,4
485,Oliver,"I see that it's almost time for us to go, but I am thinking now okay so like it's not ready yet, but i'm like Chris said, like maybe by 2024 if they build a base on the moon, then they could",,,150.1,response,2,0,4
485,Oliver,Not have to carry the water there by 2024 and then it would be valuable,,,,response,2,0,4
485,Teacher,yeah that's exactly right that's what i'm thinking to face is pretty incredible so we'll have to wait and find out what these scientists come up with,,,110.1,remark,2,0,4
485,Oliver,"Well, I want to say teacher, thank you for when you, you asked us all so many questions to try and",,,110.1,response,2,0,4
485,Oliver,find out what what we're thinking and I,,,,response,2,0,4
485,Oliver,"tell you like you know when you were telling me that my idea was still a good idea, so thank you for that",,,,response,2,0,4
485,Teacher,Thank you guys,,,,remark,2,0,4
486,Teacher,"Okay, so everybody had such great ideas and responses to the question and I loved hearing everybody's",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,Ideas about the articles and about,,,,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Water on the moon, I want us to take a look, though back at the question that was being asked and I want us to think about oh yes Luis",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
486,Luis,um yeah excuse me,,,120.3,response,0,1,3
486,Luis,um I shouldn't be in this group already know all about space,,,,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Oh well, that's great so you can actually help our group and share everything that you know so that that's a great um you are a great addition to the group",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,Now we're going to look at back at the question to think about what is this question asking so can anyone read for me the question that we need to answer,,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,0,1,3
486,Jazmin,"Okay, so the question is what equipment that scientists to use to discover water on the moon",,,,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Okay, so what According to scientists use discover discover water on the moon so what's an important part of that question that we need to what's a specific part of that question that we need to look at and think about",,,420.1,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,0,1,3
486,Farrah,I think an important part of the question is the part about equipment,,,,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Oh OK, so the part about equipment, I agree, I think that is a key part of the question that we might need to dig into to figure out the answers we need to go back to the article",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,um so thinking about equipment that scientists use discover water on the moon um does anyone have an idea of maybe which paragraph we might look to,,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,0,1,3
486,Oliver,um yeah um I found my answer in paragraph three,,,,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Okay, can you explain that a little bit and why you looked at paragraph three",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
486,Oliver,"um yeah so paragraph three, they were talking about a scientific tool, it says that mo story and that's on microscope",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Okay, what did they use what did they say you need a microscope for can you find that in the text",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
486,Oliver,"um yeah that says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Oh OK, so to look really closely at what",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
486,Oliver,I thought tiny teeny tiny water,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,does anyone have any other ideas on where we might,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Okay Okay, so we have a microscope that we can look at to see the teeny tiny water",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"look to paragraph two, or to another paragraph Jazmin",,,,remark,0,1,3
486,Jazmin,"I found some way different def I found my answer from paragraph two, and I said NASA send a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"I would say, maybe let's elaborate a little bit and let's get some other perspectives, so does anyone else",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Okay, so you're actually on the right track um I would not, I wouldn't say your answer is wrong",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,want to build off of either what Jazmin or Oliver said about the equipment remember there when but that scientists use Chris,,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
486,Chris,"Well, so for my answer, I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, but it doesn't new equipment and my answer, but that's how I answered the question",,,130.2,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Okay, thank you, thank you for sharing",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"so I want to go back to what Jazmin said so Jazmin can you read actually the first sentence of paragraph to read the whole sentence, where you found the answer okay",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
486,Jazmin,It says NASA such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate,,,120.3,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Oh Okay, so can you keep going and read the next sentence",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
486,Jazmin,Is lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater,,,120.3,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,Oh okay these ice has a very small So what did we think what did we,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,What do we think of of what Jazmin just read so she said NASA send a small machine and what was the machine can anyone tell me,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,0,1,3
486,Oliver,"Okay, so she found a machine was called the Lunar orbiter",,,,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Ah, OK so lunar orbiter do we think that might be the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Chris, what do you think",,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
486,Chris,"Well, so I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,yeah that's actually I love that you brought that background knowledge with you and we can definitely add that into our answer,,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"But for now we're just looking at the evidence in the text right that we can use to answer the question, but that is great knowledge to have so if I need evidence in the text right, I might use",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Paragraph two, which Jazmin mentioned the Lunar orbiter because that's right there that we just read right",,,,remark,0,1,3
486,Farrah,But what about the microscope,,,,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Ah, OK that's a great point so let's go back to the microscope So what does it say",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"What does it say on paragraph three, about the microscope um can anyone start reading with the sentence that says, the second sentence and paragraph three Farrah",,,120.3,remark,0,1,3
486,Farrah,"Can I read it Okay, the second sentence",,,120.3,response,0,1,3
486,Farrah,mm hmm,,,,response,0,1,3
486,Farrah,The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it,,,,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"Oh OK, so the water they found is microscopic so you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it okay so yeah they use that I guess choose so that is also evidence of the text that we can use to answer this question um",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"So, I guess, they were investigating right with the equipment and they help the microscope the microscope also help them look closely",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
486,Farrah,Oh umso like they're both the answer,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,"um, what do you, what do you all think",,,130.2,remark,0,1,3
486,Teacher,def,,,,remark,0,1,3
486,Oliver,"um well actually I was just gonna say that I just looked at the clock and it's actually time for us to go and i'll watch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us find that important part of the question, because that helps our discussion really",,,,response,0,1,3
486,Oliver,"Help us get to the answer, so thank you so much",,,,response,0,1,3
486,Teacher,you're welcome Thank you all for a great discussion,,,,remark,0,1,3
488,Teacher,hello,,,,remark,1,1,2
488,Chris,Hi teacher,,,,response,1,1,2
488,Teacher,"Now that all of you have shared your responses i'd like for you to sit face to face and have a group discussion of your responses to see whether or not you guys can figure out like which yeah, of course, Luis",,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
488,Luis,"Excuse me teacher, but I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,150.1,response,1,1,2
488,Teacher,"that's pretty cool, then you can you can be the reporter slash facilitator discussion leader, for your small group discussion is that all right",,,110.3,remark,1,1,2
488,Luis,I guess so,,,110.3,response,1,1,2
488,Luis,  Ok guys I'll be the reporter,,,110.3,response,1,1,2
488,Teacher,"Okay Thank you so much, then as i've said you guys can do a small group discussion for one and a half minutes to figure out whether you you'd like to change your response, after the discussion all right",,,,remark,1,1,2
488,Teacher,And the timing starts now,,,220.1,remark,1,1,2
488,Jazmin,"Okay, so Chris, do you want to change your answer or Luis you want to change your answer",,,220.1,response,1,1,2
488,Luis,"Now I think my answer is great, because I, I talked about some equipment, so I don't even know why i'm in this group",,,,response,1,1,2
488,Chris,"I think my answers okay Oh, let me see yeah I talked about the craters full of water oh so and that's in the story, and we were supposed to pull stuff out of the text",,,,response,1,1,2
488,Chris,"So Oh, I think it's fine",,,,response,1,1,2
488,Jazmin,"Well, I mean, I think the mine is right I got my mind was right and we can't all be right, because your answer it's very different Chris and then even we had equipment, but you were talking about oxygen tanks and and i'm just talking about the that small machine that they put on the moon",,,,response,1,1,2
488,Farrah,"Okay, so uh we have the same answer so I guess i'm not sure why our answer will be wrong cuz it is equipment,",,,,response,1,1,2
488,Oliver," Let me see cuz, when I looked in the story yeah we're talking about equipment that's on the moon uh used to find the water and they used a microscope to look at the water, so I mean that sounds like the same thing, I mean I don't know, let me ask the teacher",,,,response,1,1,2
488,Oliver,"ya, ya, it is equipment",,,,response,1,1,2
488,Farrah,"um teacher Oliver and I don't know why our answer is wrong because we think that we, we are right",,,,response,1,1,2
488,Teacher,cool and you guys are just on time,,,110.1,remark,1,1,2
488,Jazmin,Good yeah I don't know why my answers wrong too,,,110.1,response,1,1,2
488,Teacher,"Of course, so as Jazmin has pointed out, you guys have very different answers but um",,,,remark,1,1,2
488,Teacher,"um how about we start with your response Farrah and Oliver, so you guys circled",,,,remark,1,1,2
488,Teacher,"The scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so it's very good that you guys use textual evidence in the text um, but how do you think",,,310.1,remark,1,1,2
488,Teacher,To look really closely is connected to discovering water,,,230.1,remark,1,1,2
488,Oliver,Oh well,,,230.1,response,1,1,2
488,Oliver,"Okay, so when you're like looking for water, you know, and then you gotta look at it once you find it and",,,,response,1,1,2
488,Oliver,What how is looking,,,,response,1,1,2
488,Oliver,"Okay, well, I guess, looking at the water is looking for the water",,,,response,1,1,2
488,Farrah,Oh uh,,,,response,1,1,2
488,Farrah,"huh oh yeah Okay Oliver, I see what you're saying um okay oh",,,,response,1,1,2
488,Farrah,so If you're looking At the water you're looking for okay yeah okay nevermind Those are two different things I I I didn't think about that,,,,response,1,1,2
488,Teacher,"yeah that's very good Farrah so as you just said, you guys are looking for the water, so if you go into the text and find the similar word to looking for or discover it's going to be investigate,",,,210.2,remark,1,1,2
488,Teacher,so you can follow that thread to the correct response,,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
488,Oliver,Okay,,,420.1,response,1,1,2
488,Teacher,You guys have any more questions,,,150.1,remark,1,1,2
488,Luis,"yeah I had that equipment, I said on oxygen tanks, in my answer",,,150.1,response,1,1,2
488,Chris,"um well okay my question, because we were talking about equipment right because Jazmin and Luis had equipment, but I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,1,1,2
488,Teacher,um Luis um,,,420.1,remark,1,1,2
488,Teacher,"I think you're absolutely right that scientists use a lot of equipment to go into the space, but um can you re-read the question to see what it's looking for",,,,remark,1,1,2
488,Luis,um okay it's,,,,response,1,1,2
488,Luis,"asking us what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon, well, I mean like they need oxygen tanks to breathe on the moon so ah, why is that wrong",,,,response,1,1,2
488,Teacher,"Well, you cannot use oxygen tanks to find the water so basically the oxygen tanks are not leading you to the water so um",,,,remark,1,1,2
488,Teacher,"Can you read locate the text and find the Oliverice that leads you lead the scientists to the water, I think that would make more sense with this particular question, but I think you did",,,430.1,remark,1,1,2
488,Teacher,a fantastic job framing the space,,,,remark,1,1,2
488,Luis,"Okay, I guess",,,,response,1,1,2
488,Luis,I didn't really read it before because I felt like I already knew the answer,,,,response,1,1,2
488,Teacher,"Oh yeah, then you should probably read the text more closely before answering a question",,,520.1,remark,1,1,2
488,Jazmin,"Okay well so me and Luis have different types of equipment, and so I feel like when you were telling them to look it over I looked at over again, and I still feel like my answer is the right one",,,520.1,response,1,1,2
488,Teacher,well,,,430.2,remark,1,1,2
488,Teacher,"um Jazmin this think Oh, I think your answer is absolutely on the right track, but",,,,remark,1,1,2
488,Teacher,Could you be more specific about the small machine because,,,,remark,1,1,2
488,Teacher,"If you just say small machine, you could be a lot of different things",,,,remark,1,1,2
488,Jazmin,Oh,,,,response,1,1,2
488,Jazmin,Okay well let's see NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter okay um yeah I could say NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter,,,,response,1,1,2
488,Teacher,"yeah exactly you could specify the small machine and that's a strategy, you can use in response questions",,,510.1,remark,1,1,2
488,Jazmin,Oh,,,510.1,response,1,1,2
488,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,1,1,2
488,Jazmin, Okay well that's easy I can just add that,,,510.1,response,1,1,2
488,Oliver,"um yeah teacher i'm sorry to interrupt, but I just looked at the clock and it's actually time for us to go to lunch um so thanks for everything will see you later okay",,,,response,1,1,2
488,Teacher,bye bye guys,,,,remark,1,1,2
488,Teacher,"Hi Welcome back from lunch so we'll just pick up from where we left it i'm Jazmin as as we talked about earlier in the day, you can use specify specifying techniques in your responses, maybe in the future, yes, Ehtan",,,520.1,remark,2,1,2
488,Luis,"um Okay, so I think I got this all figured out so I'm all good",,,520.1,response,2,1,2
488,Teacher,um how about you just maybe stay with us as a mentor or a specialist,,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
488,Luis,"Specialist okay Okay, I guess, I could do that",,,110.3,response,2,1,2
488,Teacher,yeah Jazmin,,,,remark,2,1,2
488,Jazmin,"Okay, so I added this specific word to my answer so now, is it right",,,,response,2,1,2
488,Jazmin,The NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter yeah,,,,response,2,1,2
488,Teacher,yeah absolutely you're right um NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to discover water and that's your answer right there good job,,,110.4,remark,2,1,2
488,Jazmin,"Oh wait, I have to add that part to this to discover water",,,110.4,response,2,1,2
488,Teacher,"um naturally yes, because well",,,,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,"Well, that makes the response more complete, I guess, in a way",,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
488,Jazmin,"Oh well, cuz you told me that at the name of it, so I just added the name of it, I didn't add anymore after that",,,150.1,response,2,1,2
488,Teacher,Oh that's what you were thinking okay cool um,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,I think you're absolutely right,,,,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,"Well, in this case, adding a name would be sufficient, but I i'm talking more about a strategy of specifying your responses, instead of just like adding into adding a name into it so",,,510.1,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,I think you're confusing this strategy with um just adding the name I guess,,,410.2,remark,2,1,2
488,Jazmin,So I guess cuz I was thinking when you say,,,410.2,response,2,1,2
488,Jazmin,To specify i'm doesn't that mean just saying what the name of the equipment is,,,,response,2,1,2
488,Jazmin,"So, how come you added Okay, I guess what I don't understand is how come you added more you added the discover discover water part to the answer",,,,response,2,1,2
488,Teacher,um,,,,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,"You you, you could always just jot down the information in the text to support a full response so that's how you do that",,,150.1,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,"But if you have any more questions about this, maybe we can talk this talk about this after the session because",,,,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,We should really move on to Chris's response,,,,remark,2,1,2
488,Jazmin,"Okay yeah cuz i'm still kind of confused, so I guess i'll just ask you after okay",,,,response,2,1,2
488,Teacher,yeah Thank you so much Jazmin,,,110.1,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,"so Chris, how do you feel about your response at this point",,,210.3,remark,2,1,2
488,Chris,So I know that Jazmin's answer was the right one um that you um NASA sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter uh to discover water um so I guess i'm trying to think about why,,,210.3,response,2,1,2
488,Chris,Where I went wrong in mine um,,,,response,2,1,2
488,Chris,Because I didn't put any of that stuff in my in my answer,,,,response,2,1,2
488,Teacher,"and I want to go to, why do you think the craters are full of water on the moon",,,230.1,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,um I really appreciate your active reflection and self regulation,,,310.1,remark,2,1,2
488,Chris,"Well, because it says it in the story, it says that um let me see where was that",,,230.1,response,2,1,2
488,Chris,Scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters so um,,,,response,2,1,2
488,Chris,"So, if something is found deep That means that it has to be like you know, like in the pool when you go and you swim in the pool and you go in the deep end and there's like a lot more water on the deep side of the pool then on the shallow side",,,,response,2,1,2
488,Teacher,huh oh wow that's a,,,,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,"that's a really interesting interesting interpretation of the word, deep, but the way we can think about this is that",,,,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,"The surface of the moon is not like the pool it's maybe more like the soil or a farmland, so when you buried the water deep under under the surface it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a huge amount of water",,,130.3,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,"yeah then that's pretty cool it's a some solid individual independent thinking and then, how do you think you could locate that the textual evidence that Jazmin found in the text",,,210.4,remark,2,1,2
488,Chris,Oh,,,210.4,response,2,1,2
488,Chris,"Okay yeah I was trying to figure out why Jazmin tools out when because I was using the words from the from the question in my answer you know, like",,,,response,2,1,2
488,Chris,"I was looking for discover and I didn't see discover in the text so, then I was thinking okay what's like discover",,,,response,2,1,2
488,Chris,"Like finding something so, then I was looking for to find in the text, and I only saw it in two parts, in the first part and in the third part",,,,response,2,1,2
488,Chris,"On that's where y'all came from, and I knew it wasn't the one that i'm no offense Oliver and Farrah but I knew it wasn't the third part cuz",,,,response,2,1,2
488,Chris,"um it was supposed to be like a lot of water in order to find it and that they said you couldn't even see that water, so I guess I don't see like discover or find a in the second part where Jazmin got her answer, so I don't know I don't know how you got that answer Jazmin",,,,response,2,1,2
488,Teacher,Oh that's interesting um do you think you understand the word investigate,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
488,Chris,Oh,,,210.2,response,2,1,2
488,Chris,investigate oh yeah I guess so like like on um on the TV show sometimes they have like a like an investigator who goes to get some information,,,,response,2,1,2
488,Teacher,that's right so,,,,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,investigate can be somewhat equivalent to discovery right,,,210.2,remark,2,1,2
488,Chris,Oh yeah yeah,,,210.2,response,2,1,2
488,Chris,Okay yeah,,,,response,2,1,2
488,Teacher,"But your strategy is absolutely right, you you locate the keywords in the question and you find them in the text,",,,510.1,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,"so I think you're on a good track, but if you look at the passage to you can um yeah find the word investigate",,,420.2,remark,2,1,2
488,Oliver,"um you know what teacher, I I had read that there will be a base on the moon by 2024",,,420.2,response,2,1,2
488,Teacher,mm hmm,,,,remark,2,1,2
488,Oliver,"So Maybe we'd be able to drink water, then by 2024 that's pretty close",,,,response,2,1,2
488,Teacher,but you'd have to be a scientist to figure out how to do that Oliver,,,140.1,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,"By 2024 yeah, that is, but I think it's totally possible",,,110.3,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,well you could be,,,140.1,remark,2,1,2
488,Oliver,Oh yeah and i'm not a scientist i'm i'm just a student,,,140.1,response,2,1,2
488,Oliver," I just looked at the clock and it's actually time for us to go to our next class, but I wanted to say i'm all thank you for helping us to think about",,,,response,2,1,2
488,Oliver,oh oh man,,,,response,2,1,2
488,Oliver,  yeah maybe I could be when I when I'm old,,,,response,2,1,2
488,Oliver,What strategy that we use to get to our answer because um I guess listening to how you were talking to Jazmin and and Chris,,,,response,2,1,2
488,Chris,"yeah actually I appreciated that too, because I, I thought I use the a good strategy, but you kind of explained on how I need to think about what some of the words mean, and so I think that might give me some ideas on improving my answer",,,,response,2,1,2
488,Teacher, See you soon,,,,remark,2,1,2
488,Teacher,"Thank you so much, thank you",,,,remark,2,1,2
488,Chris,we'll we'll see you next time teacher,,,,response,2,1,2
488,Farrah,Bye,,,,response,2,1,2
488,Farrah,hi Hello,,,,response,0,1,2
488,Farrah,Can you can you see us or hear us,,,,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"Oh yeah now, I can see you sorry my Internet was lagging Hello Hello",,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,hi Farrah high Oliver hi Chris hi Jazmin hi Luis So do you guys want to talk about the feedback um know your responses for the question,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
488,Luis,um yeah this is Luis I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,150.1,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"Well, Luis, if that's the case um you can stay and help the rest of us to understand better about this space is that all right",,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
488,Luis,yeah yeah i'd love to hear that,,,110.3,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Farrah,Would you like us to to share our responses,,,,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,yeah absolutely,,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,Do you want to start,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
488,Farrah,"yeah yeah Okay, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
488,Oliver,um yeah,,,,response,0,1,2
488,Oliver,I circled the same the same as Farrah,,,,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,mm hmm,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
488,Chris,My answer is that i'm okay it's,,,110.1,response,0,1,2
488,Chris,That scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,mm hmm,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
488,Jazmin,I said that,,,110.1,response,0,1,2
488,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine,,,,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,They did yeah,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
488,Luis,"Okay, my answer as that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,110.1,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,Interesting okay so,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,um for Farrah and Oliver,,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"um you guys located the information in the text very, very well um",,,310.1,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,For Chris,,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,do you understand what i'm saying,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"you're absolutely right that there's water on the moon inside of the craters, but if you look closely in the text you could see that um these are very small pieces of water, instead of full of water,",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
488,Chris,"Well, craters craters are really big",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"that word means that the water is small and you cannot just directly see it,",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"so the craters are not full of water, they contains water yeah",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"um it's true that create crater is a big, but the water molecules they found is microscopic",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
488,Chris,Okay,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,Okay um,,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,um,,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,For Jazmin,,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Jazmin,yeah,,,,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,you're right that NASA a small machine but,,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"so basicallyNASA sent this small piece of machine called lunar orbiter to find the water, so the part of finding the water is actually quite important to the to the text",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,You have to be more specific than that in the in the answer to the response,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
488,Farrah,"um excuse me, this is Farrah",,,420.2,response,0,1,2
488,Farrah,I I don't understand why my answers are wrong,,,,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,So for you to,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,Well it's true that you need a scientific tool card,,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"To to look into the water, but the scientific tool is not the microscope it's actually called the Lunar orbiter So if you look at the second, the second piece of the text",,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,They said NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so basically the machine they sent is the Lunar orbiter,,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,does that answer questions the one,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
488,Farrah,"um, how can, how can you find something that's too small to see don't need a microscope",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"Well it's true that you need microscope to look really closely, but um",,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,so that the machine necessary is the Lunar orbiter but the scientific tool that they want to use is a microscope So these are two parts of the answer to the question,,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"We are, but we are investigating what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,",,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
488,Chris,"Well hi this is Chris, I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,120.2,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,Absolutely Chris um,,,430.2,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"I believe in NASA they use a lot of tools, but um in this particular response, where we're looking for evidences from the text so you would need to circle, the evidences in the text for, for example, if you",,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"If you decided that they need oxygen tanks to discover the water, you have to find it and located in the text",,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"so Chris, do you see oxygen tanks in this text",,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
488,Chris,"huh oh no, no, they don't talk about that in the story",,,,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,and Luis that I believe that kind of answers your question right,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"yeah absolutely so that's why, in this particular response you don't have to include oxygen tanks",,,210.1,remark,0,1,2
488,Chris,um yeah,,,210.1,response,0,1,2
488,Luis,"but if there are scientists like astronauts on the moon, they are definitely 100% using oxygen tanks",,,,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"Well, I believe you're right but um to answer this question, we will have to find the evidence in the text so we're not really thinking about",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,The real life scenario of the astronauts but rather to comprehend the text and in and try to analyze the information we need within the text,,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,is that all right,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
488,Luis,yeah yeah okay,,,,response,0,1,2
488,Luis,yeah so it's sounding like that aorbiter thing is the answer,,,,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,well,,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,it's true that the Lunar orbiter,,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"could be a part of your answer, but um if we're looking at the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon i'm sure in the text, you can find more than the Lunar orbiter right, you have to use the microscope too so",,,,remark,0,1,2
488,Teacher,um yeah if you if you include both of them in your answer that would be better,,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
488,Oliver,"um this is Oliver um I just I just looked at the clock and unfortunately it's it's time for us to go to lunch, right now, but thank you so much for really helping us use evidence from the text and our answers that's going to be really helpful next time",,,130.1,response,0,1,2
488,Teacher,"Thank you so much, and I hope y'all can use this information in your next assignment, thank you",,,,remark,0,1,2
489,Teacher,hi,,,,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,"Farrah I think your answer is quite interesting, can you explain a little bit?",,,230.1,remark,0,,
489,Luis,"Oh, excuse me, excuse me",,,230.1,response,0,,
489,Teacher,Farrah I just heard that you said,,,,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i'm wondering,,,,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,Why did you give us this answer? where do you find it in the text?,,,230.2,remark,0,,
489,Farrah,yeah I think I think I think Luis has something to say though um and and I'll answer maybe after him,,,230.2,response,0,,
489,Luis,um yeah okay um I I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,,
489,Teacher,"Oh Luis, you know a lot of our space",,,110.3,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,"And so that's a great thing and it's a group work, so I think you might be an expert so give us suggestions in our group work",,,,remark,0,,
489,Luis,yep that sounds great,,,,response,0,,
489,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,0,,
489,Farrah," That's where I found it and it says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so that's where I found it in the text",,,,response,0,,
489,Farrah,"Okay okay Luis I guess that's my turn now Okay, so I found my answer um in part three",,,,response,0,,
489,Teacher,"Yes, and this",,,,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,is actually showing the text but Farrah I want you to read the question more closely,,,120.3,remark,0,,
489,Teacher, So what does the question ask us?,,,120.3,remark,0,,
489,Farrah,"Okay, it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.3,response,0,,
489,Teacher,yeah right so here is a key words is the,,,,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,The equipment is used to discover water right?,,,210.2,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,So and so I think you can get a better answer to something related to discover water,,,120.1,remark,0,,
489,Farrah,Okay,,,120.1,response,0,,
489,Teacher,"Okay, so",,,,remark,0,,
489,Farrah,What should I do next,,,,response,0,,
489,Teacher,"and at the same time I want, i'm wondering, is there any one else have different answers?",,,130.2,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,"I want you to read closely about the paragraphs, the second paragraph,",,,120.3,remark,0,,
489,Jazmin,"Yes, I had a different answer",,,130.2,response,0,,
489,Teacher,hi Jazmin go ahead,,,,remark,0,,
489,Jazmin,"Yes, and so I said that NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,,
489,Teacher,"Oh, your answer is NASA sent a small machine",,,110.1,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,and let's look at the question,,,120.2,remark,0,,
489,Teacher," The question is what equipment is scientists used to discover water on the moon, right?",,,120.2,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,Actually I think it's partially right,,,130.1,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,"So i'm wondering why you say why you locate your answer at the second paragraph, what evidence, do you use to your answer?",,,230.2,remark,0,,
489,Jazmin,"Okay yeah, so I think my evidence is the first sentence in paragraph two where it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and I would say that that's my evidence",,,230.2,response,0,,
489,Teacher,"Okay, good so um, can you tell me like what is lunar orbiter?",,,210.4,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,And and what it's for?,,,,remark,0,,
489,Jazmin,"Yes, I can Okay, a lunar orbiter it sounds like so it sounds like it investigates",,,,response,0,,
489,Jazmin,So that means it kind of looks for and locates where is the water on the moon,,,,response,0,,
489,Teacher,"Okay, very good, very good",,,110.1,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,"So actually, and where did you find this answer?",,,230.2,remark,0,,
489,Jazmin,In part two,,,230.2,response,0,,
489,Teacher,"yeah yeah just in the following sentence, right",,,230.2,remark,0,,
489,Jazmin,yeah exactly,,,230.2,response,0,,
489,Teacher,yeah I think this and very good  strategy like we can use the next time when we found something we just can't quite understand,,,,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,"So actually we can find some information in the following sentences like, and here we found that there is sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and",,,520.1,remark,0,,
489,Teacher," Yes, Chris",,,420.2,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,The following sentence just explain what was the what is lunar orbiter and what is for,,,420.2,remark,0,,
489,Teacher," So yeah Jamines, I think your answer and if your answer can be more specific to the name of the machine and your answer qould be perfect",,,420.2,remark,0,,
489,Chris,yeah so I wanted to say um I I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they actually use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,420.2,response,0,,
489,Teacher,Oh yeah it's so great you've been to NASA,,,110.3,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,And it's true that this NASA scientists will use a lot of tools to,,,110.2,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,find the things that you- they want,,,,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,But the question here is based on the text that we just read,,,410.2,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,"So the next time when you answer this questions so be sure to look for your information, your answers in the text",,,520.1,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,So I think that-,,,,remark,0,,
489,Chris,Ok,,,,response,0,,
489,Teacher,"Yeah, so, can you look at this",,,,remark,0,,
489,Teacher,Go ahead,,,,remark,0,,
489,Chris, I need to find equipment in the story right?,,,,response,0,,
489,Chris, I understand,,,,response,0,,
489,Chris,"Oh, I was just gonna say that makes a lot of sense",,,,response,0,,
489,Teacher,yeah yeah right,,,110.1,remark,0,,
489,Oliver,um excuse me i'm i'm really sorry I don't want to interrupt but actually I just looked at the clock and,,,110.1,response,0,,
489,Oliver,"We have to go to lunch now, but I wanted to say thank you so much for helping us look really specifically in the text and making sure that we had evidence for our answers",,,,response,0,,
489,Oliver, I know that that's going to be really helpful for questions like this next time,,,,response,0,,
489,Teacher,Oh sure,,,,remark,0,,
489,Teacher," Thank you, thank you so much",,,,remark,0,,
490,Teacher,"hi class so i'm Mr Z and you guys are going to work with me today to work with the text about a moon is a desert and we're going to go through the reading together and all here to answer any questions, yes",,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
490,Luis,um yeah Mr see I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,150.1,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"Well, even then, then you can sit with us to help the other students help understand the text a bit more",,,110.3,remark,0,1,1
490,Teacher,can you do that for me Luis,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"All right, thank you alright so again, we have that question about what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,0,1,1
490,Teacher,so Farrah you mentioned that there's a microscope,,,110.1,remark,0,1,1
490,Teacher,And I loved your responses and I just want to know a little bit more about it because i'm looking at the text and i'm a little confused too,,,150.1,remark,0,1,1
490,Teacher,what is a microscope and what does it do for us,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
490,Farrah,"Okay, so a microscope it's something you look through, and when you look through it, it makes really tiny things on So you can see that",,,150.1,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,And Oliveron when adept when we were using the microscope what the scientists want to fight,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
490,Farrah,"Oh, so they wanted to find the water, which was really actually like really tiny pieces of ice",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"Good good and Harry, can you tell me what was that machine that small machine that they used to find the water",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
490,Chris,Oh,,,210.4,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"Okay, maybe we can look at the text a little bit more, I think I saw a little bit of a clue it's a small machine and we can find that in the text can everyone look and see if they can find that sentence of the text, a small machine",,,420.3,remark,0,1,1
490,Teacher,Anyone raise their hand to try and Jason,,,,remark,0,1,1
490,Jazmin,"And so that was actually my answer to NASA send a small machine and I found it in paragraph two, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"Oh you're so well, what does that small machine do can anyone look at paragraph two, and tell me what is that small machine do",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
490,Teacher,I guess even,,,,remark,0,1,1
490,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,1,1
490,Jazmin,Well i'm paragraph to it says it looks for ice in the polar craters,,,,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"hmm very good and why can't the machine just see the ice, because what what was what was a what was what do they need more so just to ask her Jazmin's question, yes, there",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
490,Oliver,"Oh wait, so you said why couldn't they see the ice",,,210.4,response,0,1,1
490,Oliver,I was gonna say because it was too small that's why they need a microscope,,,,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"Yes, that's why they need the microscope very good all right",,,110.4,remark,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"and unless add on a little bit more about this water that they found on the moon So where is this water that they what kind of place do you find this water is in in a very like right place, yes hairs",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
490,Chris,On the crators and I think it says the really dark like the sun never shines there,,,210.4,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"Yes, very good, why is it important that is in a dark place what would happen if it was in a place where the sun is shining what could happen",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"Go ahead, yes",,,,remark,0,1,1
490,Jazmin,"Well, if the sun was shining",,,,response,0,1,1
490,Jazmin,Maybe the ice would not kind of like kind of like global warming,,,,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"Yes, very good and in the ice kind of melted you think the scientists that see can find the water",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
490,Jazmin,Probably not because I think it would melt and then probably a very,,,210.4,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"Very good, so again just I think your answer was right, but we just we were just trying to see if the if the scientists could see it so again it wasn't that your answer is wrong",,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"way to add a little bit more to it, yes",,,420.2,remark,0,1,1
490,Farrah,week so it's the right answer the Lunar orbiter or it's the right answer microscope,,,420.2,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"Well, it could be, both because you need the Lunar orbiter to investigate",,,130.3,remark,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"and then, what do you need to see the the water itself",,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
490,Farrah,"Oh well, the microscope",,,130.3,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"Yes, very good so again, it would be but",,,110.1,remark,0,1,1
490,Farrah,"Oh Oh, I thought you could only have one answer",,,110.1,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"yeah yes Chris, you want to add to that",,,120.4,remark,0,1,1
490,Chris,"yeah so um well Actually, I know that scientists they actually use a lot of equipment on like oxygen tanks and masks and suits because I went to NASA so I know they use a lot of equipment",,,120.4,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"Very good, yes, scientists do use a lot of equipment so again, this is why it doesn't have to be one answer it says what kind of equipment that they use So if you feel that all of these kind of equipment is a part of discovering water and it's all are the answer",,,110.2,remark,0,1,1
490,Chris,Oh whoo so we so my answer could be on that the scientists to use the masks and the oxygen tanks and this be suits and the Lunar orbiter and the microscope,,,110.2,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"yeah if that's what how the scientist goes and discovers water, yes, but again",,,110.1,remark,0,1,1
490,Teacher,With the mask and the,,,,remark,0,1,1
490,Teacher,Endless space suit in in the reading do we see that there are some slots on the moon and they're investigating it,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
490,Chris,Oh,,,210.4,response,0,1,1
490,Chris,I guess it doesn't really talk about astronauts in the story,,,,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,um yeah I don't think there's astronauts in the story so far,,,210.4,remark,0,1,1
490,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,0,1,1
490,Luis,"Oh yeah, so I think it's a custom lunar orbiter it's actually like a type of a robot and it doesn't even need people to go on it, and so there weren't even really people like a string that's on the moon, they just like sent the Lunar orbiter and it went around and and it found the water",,,,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"Yes, very good that's a good answer the Lunar orbiter is a little robot they used to investigate, but if there was people in and they needed to to drive the orbit or maybe they would be an astronaut, yes",,,110.4,remark,0,1,1
490,Oliver,"Well, actually I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now, but before we go, I wanted to say thank you so much for being so welcoming of all of our answers and helping us see that we didn't have to just pick one that there was room for more than one idea Thank you so much",,,110.4,response,0,1,1
490,Teacher,"Yes, you're welcome and enjoy lunch everybody bye",,,,remark,0,1,1
492,Teacher,"All right, so I think you all you all just shared your responses and you all have sparked some thoughts",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher," okay? um so i've heard, so I'm going to review your responses out loud",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher, This is what I've heard,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,Just from hearing just from hearing your responses i've i've been enlightened and i've been thinking about this question and what it's really asking,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Luis,Excuse me,,,150.1,response,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"yeah, hey Luis",,,,remark,0,0,3
492,Luis,Hi,,,,response,0,0,3
492,Luis, yeah so,,,,response,0,0,3
492,Luis,I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"Oh okay wait so sorry, you said you shouldn't be in this group, because you know all about space?",,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Luis,Sure do,,,150.1,response,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"Okay, but what if",,,,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"I guess what, if you could use some of what you know about space and maybe share that with the group?",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"you I bet you could definitely add a lot of a lot of strengths this group, a lot of knowledge to this group",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"And who knows, maybe we could also teach you something as well right? Because really what we're what we're kind of focusing on here at during this time is about how to also understand what the questions are asking you guys, right?",,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,so let's say we are taking a test right and you write down everything you know about space,,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher, But what if it doesn't answer the questions they're asking right?,,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"so we're all here we're going to focus more on making sure that we understand the question that's being asked of us, okay? so we're going to practice, these skills",,,220.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher," Farrah, you said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely right? Okay, Oliver, I think you said you had circled the same as Farrah, right?",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"Okay, thank you Luis um okay so let's start",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"Okay Chris, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon, great",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"And Jazmin, you said NASA sent a small machine",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,And Luis you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Luis,yep definitely true,,,110.1,response,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"All right, that is true",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"Now, these are all true right because you all circled things that were right from the text right",,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"Now, I just want to discuss what made you circle, the answer that you did? okay",,,230.2,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"i'm going to give you a few seconds to kind of think about that all right, and then we're going to go around and talk about it",,,210.3,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"Farrah I see your hand up, Jazmin I see yours up",,,,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,i'll just give you a few more seconds for everyone who's thinking about it okay,,,,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,Okay i'll go ahead and start with Farrah because I saw yours first then Jazmin i'll hear from you okay?,,,,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"All right, Farrah, go ahead",,,,remark,0,0,3
492,Farrah,"So the reason that I picked the microscope is because it says it there in part three, it says the water they found is microscopic so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so it's right there in the story, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"Okay, well, I think",,,,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"that's I, and this is the thing about the question that we're going to get into, which is what is the wrong or right answer in this question because the question just kind of asked us about equipment right?",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,What equipment is used right?,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"And so, if we're thinking about equipment, what piece of equipment is used, based on the answer that you gave?",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
492,Farrah,a microscope,,,210.2,response,0,0,3
492,Teacher," Great job, Farrah",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"mm hmm right so that's partially right it's not a wrong answer but it's a, we could get close, we could get an answer that's more specific right? Okay, so I wouldn't say it's wrong all right, I think you're on the right track for sure",,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"I think you were, you definitely used some great skills on figuring out okay which in which sentence, did they find water right?",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"And you looked at the sentence that said microscopic and thought , oh microscope",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher, Ok? Great job,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,um Jazmin let's hear from you,,,,remark,0,0,3
492,Jazmin,yeah so my answer is NASA sent a small machine and that also it's right in the text at the beginning of Part two,,,,response,0,0,3
492,Teacher,That is true right so it's similar to kind of Farrah's thinking as well right?,,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,so and which equipment did they use?,,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
492,Jazmin,A machine,,,210.2,response,0,0,3
492,Teacher,Right and we know that a machine is the type of equipment okay,,,110.2,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,Right and so that's also getting to part of the answer right,,,130.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"Okay, good job Jazmin",,,110.1,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,awesome Chris let's hear from you,,,,remark,0,0,3
492,Chris,"Ok, well, so actually I went to NASA so I know that astronauts and scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"Oh that's all true right, so you used your personal experience right to know and you saw with your own eyes what they're using right um, can I ask did they, did you see the ma- any of what you saw mentioned in the text?",,,230.2,remark,0,0,3
492,Chris,No they aren't in the story,,,230.2,response,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"Okay they're not in the story Okay, so this is a good, this is a really good point too um so whenever they ask a question right",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"let's go back to the question, which is what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher," Circle, the evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question right? so what part of those instructions kind of help you remember, oh I got to use the text or useful knowledge?",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
492,Chris,"Oh, so the part the circle part because I guess I don't have anything to circle when I talk about the oxygen tanks",,,210.2,response,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"yeah yes that's yes that's right so you've got it Chris, so that's- Now, if the question had asked about your personal experience, then you could mention what you had seen at NASA, that would be very interesting for sure, ok?",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
492,Teacher,"Farrah, you have a question? and Oliver I'll come back to you",,,,remark,0,0,3
492,Farrah,"um yeah well actually it's not really a question, but I just looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch now",,,,response,0,0,3
492,Farrah,But I,,,,response,0,0,3
492,Farrah,wanted to say,,,,response,0,0,3
492,Farrah,Thank you very much,,,,response,0,0,3
492,Farrah,"for helping us see oh yeah you really helped us see how our answers were part of the way there, instead of all of the way there and that really got me thinking about how to use the story to make my answer, even better, so thank you so much",,,,response,0,0,3
492,Teacher," Well, thank you all I enjoyed getting to work with you all thank you enjoy your lunch",,,,remark,0,0,3

493,Teacher,need to,,,,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,"Have you guys read the test, I did you",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
493,Luis,"um yeah so we read it, we read about the water on the moon and i'm thinking I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
493,Teacher,wow,,,,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,"Fantastic, how do you get that knowledge or how do you know about space",,,140.1,remark,0,1,2

493,Teacher,really like space i'm also big fan of space to,,,140.1,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,"Well, so do own to talk about the question",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,I give you since,,,,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,You were a lot about space right,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
493,Luis,"yeah so about the equipment, I was thinking that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
493,Teacher,"oxygen tank, how do you get that from text",,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
493,Luis,On say well sorry,,,230.2,response,0,1,2
493,Luis,"yeah so I was thinking if there's scientists on the moon, they are going to need oxygen tanks if they're gonna be looking around for a water",,,,response,0,1,2
493,Teacher,yeah,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,Does anyone has some different ideas to add them,,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
493,Farrah,"um yes, I I thought, something different, so I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,130.2,response,0,1,2
493,Teacher,a microscope interesting can you talk more about why to send it to use microscope to look at what,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
493,Farrah,"So it said that the water well actually it's ice it's really, really small and you can't see it if you don't have a microscope",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
493,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,that's great,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,"yeah, we can see in the third paragraph to see the eyes is very small, so we need the microscope to look at it",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,Does anyone have more to add on to this question,,,130.2,remark,0,1,2
493,Jazmin,yeah,,,130.2,response,0,1,2
493,Teacher,Go ahead,,,,remark,0,1,2
493,Jazmin,So I said that NASA sent a small machine,,,,response,0,1,2
493,Teacher,A small machine washing machine with that machine called,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
493,Jazmin,"Let me check Okay, it says NASA send a small machine called",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
493,Jazmin,A lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,1,2

493,Jazmin,I think you're frozen I can't see and hear you anymore,,,,response,0,1,2
493,Jazmin,"Oh you're back Okay, thank you, so I just said it's called the Lunar orbiter I found that in the second paragraph",,,,response,0,1,2
493,Teacher,"yeah you do really great job, so the second paragraph is there's no standard small machine on lunar orbiter to investigate and what does the Lunar orbiter fine",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
493,Jazmin,"Well, I guess it finds and that I in the craters",,,210.4,response,0,1,2
493,Teacher,yeah great the Lunar orbiter buying the eyes departed in Apollo crater right,,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,and,,,,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,"Someone mentioned, is that scientist need an oxygen tanks, can you find the oxygen tank in zoos test can anyone tell me about please",,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
493,Chris,"yeah well Okay, so I know Luis talked about the oxygen tanks before and I was thinking something similar of actually because I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and also masks and suits",,,230.2,response,0,1,2
493,Teacher,wow,,,,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,You are awesome you know a lot about the stage and equipment yeah,,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,So you think the side is the need also need oxygen tank mask and suit right,,,230.3,remark,0,1,2
493,Jazmin,i'm,,,230.3,response,0,1,2
493,Teacher,Sure go ahead,,,,remark,0,1,2
493,Jazmin,"So Harris, and I know you like when NASA but it doesn't even say anything about oxygen tanks in the story so is that really a right answer",,,,response,0,1,2
493,Teacher,yeah you did a really great job,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,This this assignment is to lead,,,,remark,0,1,2

493,Teacher,So,,,,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,Does this mention,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,tank or mosque or suit,,,,remark,0,1,2
493,Chris,Can I guess not,,,,response,0,1,2
493,Chris,"So so you're saying that the answer, it has to be in the story",,,,response,0,1,2
493,Teacher,yeah I say we we,,,,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,We can get it on the answer in,,,,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,From your,,,,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,Previous knowledge,,,,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,but let's focus on this test,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,"But you guys did a really, really good job because you have their fantastic knowledge about space and about moon",,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
493,Teacher,Can we look at test again and,,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
493,Oliver,"Excuse me on i'm so sorry I really don't want to interrupt, but I just looked at the clock and",,,120.3,response,0,1,2
493,Oliver,"We actually we have to go to lunch, right now, but I just wanted to say thank you so much, because you really listened to everything we had to say, but you also reminded us that we really needed to use that text and our answer, and that is really, really helpful, so thank you so much",,,,response,0,1,2
493,Teacher,"Thank you, you guys are awesome",,,,remark,0,1,2
495,Teacher,okey dokey,,,,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,Hello Farrah dells Chris Jazmin Luis how are you today,,,,remark,0,,
495,Farrah,Oh,,,,response,0,,
495,Farrah,we're good we're so excited to work with you,,,,response,0,,
495,Teacher,"awesome so I noticed that we answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and all of you had great responses, yes Luis",,,120.2,remark,0,,
495,Luis,um yeah I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,120.2,response,0,,
495,Teacher,"awesome i'm so excited that you know about space, therefore, you can share your knowledge with the class and help us grow",,,110.3,remark,0,,
495,Luis,awesome,,,110.3,response,0,,
495,Luis,alright,,,,response,0,,
495,Teacher,Great so I want us to take in consideration the context of the question and we're all going to analyze our responses and think about how we can improve them or make them stronger or maintain the quality of our responses,,,220.1,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,So y equals did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,when you hear the word equipment what comes to mind Jazmin,,,210.2,remark,0,,
495,Jazmin,"I would say, when you hear the word equipment, it makes me think of a tool",,,210.2,response,0,,
495,Teacher,what about you Farrah,,,120.4,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,A tool,,,110.1,remark,0,,
495,Farrah,i'm like something something you use to do something,,,110.1,response,0,,
495,Teacher,"something you used to do something so let's use our understanding what Jazmin and Farrah gave us a tour, something we used to do something",,,230.3,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,"To help us understand the context of the question, so now i'm going to read the question again and then we're going to keep what Farrah and Jazmin gave us um for us to understand the context of equipment",,,150.1,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,"and I noticed in Farrah knows i'm explanation, she said, a scientific",,,230.3,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,So what equipment is sciences us to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,"So what does that mean in terms of what scientists are using to get water, what does the equipment mean def",,,210.2,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,"tool and Jazmin's explanation, she said some type of machine",,,,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,question,,,,remark,0,,
495,Oliver,Can you,,,,response,0,,
495,Teacher,"so when we think about equipment and we know that scientists used equipment to get water off the moon, what does that mean to you",,,210.2,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,Of course I love that you advocated for yourself in that way,,,310.1,remark,0,,
495,Oliver,"Oh Okay, that means that the astronauts they couldn't do it like just with themselves, they needed something like a machine or a tool to help them do it",,,210.2,response,0,,
495,Teacher,yeah so how did I get the water Chris,,,210.4,remark,0,,
495,Chris,On,,,210.4,response,0,,
495,Chris,me,,,,response,0,,
495,Chris,"i'm not sure how, but I know that they found it in the craters",,,,response,0,,
495,Teacher,so this finding Equator are saying that they found the Quakers answer the contexts are connects back to the context of the question,,,210.3,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,i'm in the craters so let's go back to the context of the question how what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,0,,
495,Chris,"I guess, because we have to talk about equipment right",,,,response,0,,
495,Teacher,Why do you say that,,,230.1,remark,0,,
495,Chris,"Well, because we've been talking about equipment",,,230.1,response,0,,
495,Teacher,"So we know that the scientists used equipment, so now I want us to think about our responses, yet, but Jazmin",,,210.4,remark,0,,
495,Jazmin,"And I was just gonna ask about my response, actually, so my response was NASA said just small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,210.4,response,0,,
495,Teacher,"Okay, what we're going to do we know that so thinking back to the context of the problem, it says what equipment does a small machine connect back to the context of the problem does it tell us exactly what type of machine they use",,,210.3,remark,0,,
495,Jazmin,"I got it right from the text in part two, it says NASA send a small machine",,,210.3,response,0,,
495,Teacher,"that's beautiful I love, how you use that context you use evidence from the reading",,,310.1,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,"however, we can make our explanations even stronger by using more context from the problem",,,420.2,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,"So right now I want Chris deaf and Farrah to turn and talk to your partner and Jazmin and Luis will turn and talk with each other and you're going to answer does your response connect to the context of the question, go ahead and do that for 10 seconds",,,130.2,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,awesome we're gonna come back together Luis What did you learn from Jazmin's response,,,120.4,remark,0,,
495,Luis,um so,,,120.4,response,0,,
495,Luis,Jazmin,,,,response,0,,
495,Luis,"It does connect to the context of that question because, while she talks about NASA and she found my machine and last door",,,,response,0,,
495,Teacher,"awesome okay Chris, what did you talk about",,,120.4,remark,0,,
495,Chris,"Okay, well, I was just telling Farrah and of how I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,120.4,response,0,,
495,Teacher,Beautiful I love that you have that background knowledge now we're going to try and take that back now rock background knowledge and connected to the text,,,110.3,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,"Farrah, do you agree that NASA use a small machine",,,130.2,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,"So Jazmin gave us a really, really awesome response and said that NASA use the small machine",,,230.3,remark,0,,
495,Farrah,well,,,230.3,response,0,,
495,Farrah,yeah I mean,,,,response,0,,
495,Farrah,"Jazmin showed it to us and told us it was in the story, but I still don't know why I should pick that and not the microscope",,,,response,0,,
495,Teacher,"Okay, what do you think about that, why do you say the microscope share your knowledge with the class",,,230.1,remark,0,,
495,Farrah,"Okay well in part three, it says that the water they found was microscopic and you can't see it without a microscope",,,230.1,response,0,,
495,Teacher,You have full so that takes us to the understanding what does microscopic actually mean,,,210.4,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,"It is it's all so you're onto something, but what does microscopic mean",,,210.4,remark,0,,
495,Farrah,"I think it means really, really small",,,210.4,response,0,,
495,Teacher,"You are correct Farrah it does mean really, really small",,,110.4,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,"so with That being said, they need the you say you need a scientific to call a microscope to look really closely, but then does that help us yep does",,,210.3,remark,0,,
495,Oliver,um i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch,,,210.3,response,0,,
495,Oliver,"I wish we could stay i'm really having a rough time um, but I wanted to say before we go to lunch Thank you so much for reminding us to think about the context of the question",,,,response,0,,
495,Oliver,"That is a really, really helpful reminder for this question, but also for other questions, next time, so thank you so much",,,,response,0,,
495,Teacher,You are welcome and you all have beautiful responses remember to think about if your response connects back to the context of the question,,,,remark,0,,
495,Teacher,See you later,,,,remark,0,,
511,Farrah,Hello hi,,,,response,0,,
511,Teacher,I have a question about your response,,,,remark,0,,
511,Teacher,"Oh, you said that",,,,remark,0,,
511,Teacher,That you thought that they need a scientific tool called microscopes look really closely,,,110.1,remark,0,,
511,Farrah,yeah yeah that's what I said,,,110.1,response,0,,
511,Teacher,"Okay, so for that, how would they get the microscope to the moon",,,210.3,remark,0,,
511,Farrah,"Oh, oh i'm not sure I guess on the spaceship probably",,,210.3,response,0,,
511,Teacher,Okay Luis,,,,remark,0,,
511,Luis,um yeah um I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,,
511,Teacher,"So, can you tell me a little bit more about your response",,,230.1,remark,0,,
511,Luis,"um yeah Okay, so I said scientists use a lot of equipment like i'm oxygen tanks, because if there's astronauts on the moon, and are looking for this water they definitely are using oxygen tanks",,,230.1,response,0,,
511,Teacher,"So they might be using oxygen things, but at the same time",,,,remark,0,,
511,Teacher,In the reading I didn't see anything that said anything about oxygen tanks,,,210.3,remark,0,,
511,Teacher,Do you want to try to think about what else they could use?,,,120.1,remark,0,,
511,Luis,um,,,120.1,response,0,,
511,Luis,I saw,,,,response,0,,
511,Luis,Something that's in the story,,,,response,0,,
511,Teacher,yep,,,,remark,0,,
511,Luis,"Oh, I probably need to look at that again",,,,response,0,,
511,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,,
511,Luis,"Okay, so they say small machine and they say microscope and those are both the equipment",,,,response,0,,
511,Teacher,yep,,,,remark,0,,
511,Teacher,So what is the small machine called,,,210.3,remark,0,,
511,Luis,lunar orbiter yep,,,210.3,response,0,,
511,Teacher,Do you think that's what they used to discover water on the moon,,,210.3,remark,0,,
511,Luis,um I mean it sounds like something that could be kind of useful because it says loner and I know that that means moon,,,210.3,response,0,,
511,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,0,,
511,Jazmin,"So that was my answer my answer was NASA sent a small machine, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong",,,,response,0,,
511,Teacher,"your answers not wrong it's just there's multiple parts to it,",,,110.2,remark,0,,
511,Teacher,"so you had the right answer about a small machine, but then after they find the they found the ice deposits, they had to use something else to like look at it more closely",,,210.4,remark,0,,
511,Jazmin,Oh,,,110.2,response,0,,
511,Jazmin,Is that what Farrah was talking about,,,,response,0,,
511,Teacher,yep,,,,remark,0,,
511,Teacher,"So you both had part of the answer you said, to put it together",,,130.1,remark,0,,
511,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,0,,
511,Farrah,um so i'm wondering,,,,response,0,,
511,Farrah,"I, the reason I picked a microscope instead of the machine is, because how can you discover something if it's too small to see",,,,response,0,,
511,Teacher,So that's why they use the microscope so they found,,,,remark,0,,
511,Teacher,"ice deposits in lunar craters, but if it's too small to see with the eyes, they have to go in with that microscope to try to find",,,210.4,remark,0,,
511,Farrah,"Oh so i'm the machine, it can do the finding, even if it can't see it",,,210.4,response,0,,
511,Teacher,yeah that's what the microscopes for,,,210.4,remark,0,,
511,Farrah,"Okay, so um for the answer we just say both",,,210.4,response,0,,
511,Teacher,"yeah it would be both because you would need the two parts, like the small machine when I began to investigate and I noticed ice deposits, but since they were so small, or to look at them, they needed that needed a microscope look at it more closely",,,130.1,remark,0,,
511,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,0,,
511,Chris,yeah I have a comment,,,,response,0,,
511,Chris,So I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,,response,0,,
511,Teacher,yeah they do,,,110.3,remark,0,,
511,Chris,"So, could we put that in our answer too",,,110.3,response,0,,
511,Teacher,"Not for this one only because it's about the equipment they used to discover the water they would use that equipment and other scenarios, but this time it was just the mission and the microscope that we were looking for",,,130.3,remark,0,,
511,Chris,Oh,,,130.3,response,0,,
511,Chris,Okay um why,,,,response,0,,
511,Teacher,"So we were looking for evidence in the text sure they might use that other equipment, but in the text it didn't have anything about that so it's just about being specific this time",,,410.2,remark,0,,
511,Chris,Okay,,,410.2,response,0,,
511,Chris,"Okay, that makes sense",,,,response,0,,
511,Jazmin,I have a question about the story,,,,response,0,,
511,Jazmin,So,,,,response,0,,
511,Jazmin,The story it doesn't say anything about astronauts going in the Lunar orbiter so we're astronauts or do they just do the machine and it does all the work for them,,,,response,0,,
511,Teacher,yeah they actually send up the machine on its own to do the investigation so there's still on earth looking at what they're doing so the machine will go up there and discover the ice deposits and then they also have the microscope up there to help them look at it more closely,,,210.4,remark,0,,
511,Jazmin,"So cool machine can do it all, without any astronauts",,,210.4,response,0,,
511,Teacher,"So there's still people controlling it it's just from earth, so they use computers and stuff to get it to do what it needs to do",,,210.4,remark,0,,
511,Luis,um yeah Jazmin it's like it's kind of like a robot right,,,210.4,response,0,,
511,Teacher,yeah kind of,,,110.1,remark,0,,
511,Chris,"My answer, my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon, is that OK",,,110.1,response,0,,
511,Teacher,So that's what they found by um we were looking for what equipment that they used to discover that on the moon,,,410.1,remark,0,,
511,Teacher,So you just had what they found um so the equipment would be that small machine the Lunar orbiter and then the microscope to look at it more closely Oliver,,,130.3,remark,0,,
511,Oliver,"On I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say",,,130.3,response,0,,
511,Oliver,"Thank you for helping us today, I really appreciate how you helped us use evidence from the text in our answers and reminded us to really use the story and start off just what we knew Thank you so much",,,,response,0,,
511,Teacher,you're welcome,,,,remark,0,,
512,Teacher,so Jazmin I know your answer was that they had small mush oh yes Luis,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"So I put us to sit in this small group, because I really liked you guys's answer, but I wanted us to think more and think about what we read and try to reflect on our answers",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Luis,um yeah so I shouldn't be and that's group I already know all about space,,,150.1,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"I know, but we're just talking about it,",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,and I would love to hear what you think about space,,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
512,Luis,Okay yeah,,,150.1,response,0,1,2
512,Luis,Let me know when you want me to share,,,,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"Okay, well, thank you Luis",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"So Jazmin I know your answer was that they sent small machines, but you know what those machines are called Do you remember",,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
512,Jazmin,"Oh, I think, was in there",,,210.3,response,0,1,2
512,Jazmin,"Okay, it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter",,,,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"Exactly, and do you remember what they do, what do they look for",,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
512,Jazmin,They look for the water on the moon,,,210.3,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"Exactly, and they were like the small ice deposits in the large polar crater",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,Thank you Chris What was your answer again,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
512,Chris,"Okay, so I said that scientists found craters, full of water on the moon",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,They did and so those craters,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,um Do you remember where they were,,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,Do you remember a cool fact that they mentioned,,,140.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Chris,I think they said the really dark,,,140.1,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,It's the part of the moon where the sun never shines,,,,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"They they were Yes, that was mentioned it's where the sun never shines the",,,140.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Chris,ya there's no sun,,,,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,yeah isn't that cool,,,140.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Chris,it's so cool,,,140.1,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,I thought that was an interesting thing to,,,,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"So, you said that you circle, the same answer so vana what answer was that",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
512,Oliver,"Oh yeah we both said for the appointment, we both said i'm microscope",,,120.4,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,yeah Do you remember what a microscope is used for,,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
512,Oliver,"yeah um a microscope it lets you look up things that are really, really small like you can't see them um just in real life, you have to look through the microscope to see them because they're so small",,,210.3,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"Exactly, and do you remember in the article why they needed to use the microscope",,,210.4,remark,0,1,2
512,Oliver,um yeah because well um because the water it's so small,,,210.4,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,Exactly yes Farrah,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Farrah,"um I don't understand why our answer is wrong, why is microscope wrong",,,110.1,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,um it's,,,110.2,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,it's not a wrong answer,,,,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,But it was one of the tools that they use they use the tool to look at the water on the moon,,,,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,um,,,,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"And that's how they discovered the war that's how they were able to see the water, so your answer wasn't wrong you guys had similar answers, but I just wanted to know what you're thinking was when you came up with those answers",,,210.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Farrah,"Oh, oh okay yeah",,,210.1,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,So why did you choose that,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Farrah,"I picked it because, well, I found it in part three in part three, they say, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely",,,230.1,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher, Cuz you answered it,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,Exactly so that's how you know it was a good answer,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Farrah,"Okay, so",,,150.1,response,0,1,2
512,Farrah,we're both right both me and Jazmin,,,,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,ya you guys are both right,,,,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,You and Oliver,,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Farrah,Oh yeah but I mean also Jazmin because she said something different,,,130.1,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"yeah Jazmin had the small machines Jazmin is that, where you were referring to",,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Jazmin,I was referring to the Lunar orbiter yeah,,,230.1,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,yeah so Jazmin was her answer was a little different,,,230.3,remark,0,1,2
512,Jazmin,yeah,,,230.3,response,0,1,2
512,Jazmin,You said they're both right,,,,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,Oh actually Jazmin that wasn't an equipment that they used,,,,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,That was just something that was on the moon,,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
512,Jazmin,Oh okay,,,130.3,response,0,1,2
512,Jazmin,I don't know if I would have known that if you didn't tell me how,,,,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"You know I Sorry, I made a mistake",,,,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"It was it no, it was used to investigate",,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"me her answer was right was correct, as well, so they use",,,,remark,0,1,2
512,Jazmin,Thank you,,,,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"A few small machines, of course, they use a few different small machines and",,,,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"One second Chris, I will get right back to you, and they use a microscope they use the Lunar orbiter to investigate, so there was a couple of different things, yes, Chris?",,,130.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Chris,yeah well sort of about that I went to NASA so I know that scientists date to really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits,,,130.1,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"yeah they do so Chris Chris, I know that you said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon Do you remember how they found them",,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
512,Chris,How they found them,,,210.3,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,yeah Do you remember what they used to find them,,,210.3,remark,0,1,2
512,Chris,"Well, I mean i'm Jazmin just said, the machine",,,210.3,response,0,1,2
512,Chris,And Farrah set the microscope,,,,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,Luis What was your answer,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,exactly they use those to find them on the moon,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Luis,"Oh um mine was kind of like what Chris just said, I said, scientists, they use oxygen tanks",,,110.1,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,They did was that in the reading or was that just something you knew,,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
512,Luis,I I I don't,,,230.2,response,0,1,2
512,Luis,"yeah they didn't say oxygen tanks, like in that story, but I just know ever there are astronauts on the moon, or anywhere in space they need oxygen tanks, they definitely need that",,,,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"yeah they do need oxygen takes, but do you remember something else that was in the reading",,,,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,Because we want to know what good scientists used to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"So from the reading, do you",,,,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"Remember, something else",,,120.1,remark,0,1,2
512,Luis,Ah,,,120.1,response,0,1,2
512,Luis,I am,,,,response,0,1,2
512,Luis,I wasn't really paying attention,,,,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"Oh, you wasn't Well, now we can learn from my friends, because Jazmin said, there was a lunar orbiter Farrah and cab both Oliver sorry both agreed on the microscope",,,,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"So now, you know, two machines that they used in that they mentioned in the article",,,130.3,remark,0,1,2
512,Teacher,Yes Oliver?,,,,remark,0,1,2
512,Luis,That was easy,,,,response,0,1,2
512,Oliver,"um yeah I just looked up a clock and we have to go to lunch, right now, but I really appreciate that you took the time to listen to all of our answers on a really made it feel like you really care what each one of us has to say about the question Thank you so much",,,,response,0,1,2
512,Teacher,"you're welcome Thank you that I did I did I did care about what you guys had to say and thank you for participating and giving me your answers and Luis, thank you for being honest, I hope, next time we can pay attention",,,,remark,0,1,2
513,Teacher,Hello everyone,,,,remark,1,1,3
513,Luis,hi,,,,response,1,1,3
513,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,1,3
513,Luis,"So I was just gonna say cuz I know that this group is to is to help people who are having some trouble with their answers, but I don't think I need to be in this group, because I already know about space",,,,response,1,1,3
513,Teacher,People don't either So even if you don't need help you can still okay tell us some facts about,,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
513,Teacher,Maybe help your friends oh OK,,,110.3,remark,1,1,3
513,Teacher,OK so first let's start with Farrah,,,,remark,1,1,3
513,Teacher,"Farrah, can you tell me what your answer was again",,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
513,Farrah,yeah so basically what I said was that you need a scientific to have a microscope to look really close,,,120.4,response,1,1,3
513,Farrah,Right,,,,response,1,1,3
513,Teacher,"So, in the third paragraph it explains that you would need a microscope to look at the water that's um",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
513,Farrah,that's in the craters,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
513,Teacher,"But is there, another tool yeah find maybe in the second paragraph that um",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
513,Teacher,That explains more of what what,,,,remark,1,1,3
513,Farrah,The last,,,,response,1,1,3
513,Farrah,glass of water last measure,,,,response,1,1,3
513,Teacher,Right okay so that's assumption,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
513,Teacher,Is that the amount of water that,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
513,Teacher,is basically the amount of water that a person drinks a day,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
513,Farrah,So it's not a lot at all,,,210.4,response,1,1,3
513,Farrah,Two ounces which,,,,response,1,1,3
513,Teacher,"yeah so in paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, so the microscope was a really good answer, but the microscope is just looking at the water",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
513,Teacher,"At the bottom of the crater just that little bit, whereas the Lunar orbiter was sent to the moon, to look at it all and investigate everything does that make sense",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
513,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,1,3
513,Farrah,So they're both the answers but,,,,response,1,1,3
513,Teacher,Instead of just the water at the bottom,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
513,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,1,3
513,Jazmin,I just had a quick question is,,,,response,1,1,3
513,Jazmin,"I think my answer was pretty close to that and I know that again we're working together, because our answers right, I guess, it was a little confused on what my answer was wrong",,,,response,1,1,3
513,Teacher,What was your answer again,,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
513,Teacher,"And you were right with that you weren't wrong, but if you could go into more detail about it so in the reading it does explain what that machine was so just to make sure that you give more detail, instead of just saying small machine",,,420.2,remark,1,1,3
513,Jazmin,explain what the small machine was,,,420.2,response,1,1,3
513,Jazmin,called,,,,response,1,1,3
513,Jazmin,yeah,,,,response,1,1,3
513,Jazmin,So is this small machine is it,,,,response,1,1,3
513,Jazmin,"Yes, it is",,,,response,1,1,3
513,Jazmin,good job,,,,response,1,1,3
513,Jazmin,"I have to say, the",,,,response,1,1,3
513,Jazmin,whole thing like I can't just say the small machine,,,,response,1,1,3
513,Teacher,"Right, you need to feel a little more specific, so that they understand because I was looking at it and you said small machine, I might think the microscope because the microscope isn't big it's small",,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
513,Jazmin,So you just want to really be specific about what you're what you're saying,,,410.2,response,1,1,3
513,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,1,1,3
513,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,1,1,3
513,Chris,So I I went to NASA with my dad I mean we go a couple times a year to this dentist space Center and,,,,response,1,1,3
513,Chris,"I, I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoot I was wondering like I didn't see that in the video, and so I thought, like isn't that may be an answer for the equipment that they use",,,,response,1,1,3
513,Teacher,"But you want to base your answer off of the reading you don't want to go off on your own path, just in case it isn't right now, you might have thought it was one thing, but it's not actually what it is, so you want to face what you see in the reading and then put that into your answer",,,430.3,remark,1,1,3
513,Teacher,gotcha,,,,remark,1,1,3
513,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,1,1,3
513,Oliver,Then I wanted to thank you so much for working with us,,,,response,1,1,3
513,Oliver,"In with you can see, thank you",,,,response,1,1,3
513,Teacher,Start simulation,,,,remark,2,1,3
513,Teacher,hi,,,,remark,2,1,3
513,Teacher,Yes,,,,remark,2,1,3
513,Luis,"i'm yet so basically, I think I finally got this all figured out so good now",,,,response,2,1,3
513,Teacher,"Okay, do you want to go first",,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
513,Luis,"yeah absolutely Okay, so my answer is that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen",,,120.4,response,2,1,3
513,Teacher,"you're right no very good job and having it split, how can that help, how is that valuable",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
513,Luis,"You remember, if you look Oh well, it's",,,210.2,response,2,1,3
513,Luis,"yeah it's valuable well okay so it's valuable if you look back in the end they have all this stuff about how Okay, so you can use hydrogen and oxygen you can use",,,,response,2,1,3
513,Luis,"let's see in paragraph five, they say, you can read the oxygen and oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket so that's really useful because you have rocket fuel that you can make like on the moon you don't have to take it with",,,,response,2,1,3
513,Teacher,"You fuel, do you guys know what that is",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
513,Teacher,rocket fuel is how you would how you would move the spaceship so it's like,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
513,Teacher,it's like how i'm gas as for our car,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
513,Teacher,it's the same thing,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
513,Farrah,Oh,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
513,Farrah,"yeah so okay here's what I will see, so I said no, that would not be valuable",,,,response,2,1,3
513,Farrah,Time,,,,response,2,1,3
513,Farrah,yeah I had basically i'm very similar answer but mine was mostly that it wasn't ready yet that you have to,,,,response,2,1,3
513,Farrah,"Do stuff to the water to make it or first, you have to find out how to get it like out of the craters and you got to figure out how to know and, like all that you can't use it, because it's not ready to use yet",,,,response,2,1,3
513,Teacher,"into your own little you put your little twist on it, which was good, but it does say in the text that you can use the water so would be valuable",,,130.3,remark,2,1,3
513,Teacher,"and actually Chris had a good point and his answer Chris, if you want to share",,,130.2,remark,2,1,3
513,Chris,My answer was,,,130.2,response,2,1,3
513,Chris,Water is heavyy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships,,,,response,2,1,3
513,Chris,"which I think would be a really good like the if they didn't they don't need to have any more water, they can just get it on the moon",,,,response,2,1,3
513,Teacher,Right so once they can get the water they won't have to bring water bottles on to their spacecraft which will be nice because it takes up a lot of room and it's heavy so without that they can bring more things and they'll already have water provided Jazmin,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
513,Jazmin,yeah I think you,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
513,Jazmin,And I guess what i'm wondering is like Chris mustang like the water is heavy so they don't have,,,,response,2,1,3
513,Jazmin,They don't have to take it on the spaceship but if they don't have it on the spaceship what will they drink,,,,response,2,1,3
513,Teacher,"Well, once they get to the moon, they would drink the water on the moon, so I mean",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
513,Teacher,I guess,,,,remark,2,1,3
513,Teacher,bringing water in the spaceship,,,,remark,2,1,3
513,Jazmin,How did they survive like when they're they're flying to the moon so,,,,response,2,1,3
513,Teacher,"i'm sure that they bring, maybe a water bottle each a little bit of water each, but I think this is more saying they don't have to bring a whole thing of water, because that's really happy, but you do still need to drink water so i'm sure they bring",,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
513,Jazmin,A little bit each once they get to the moon there'll be enough provided for them to drink where they,,,210.4,response,2,1,3
513,Teacher,won't have to bring say a whole case,,,,remark,2,1,3
513,Jazmin,that makes a lot of sense,,,,response,2,1,3
513,Teacher,Good,,,,remark,2,1,3
513,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,2,1,3
513,Farrah,Oh,,,,response,2,1,3
513,Farrah,Actually,,,,response,2,1,3
513,Oliver,"yeah I was just thinking to myself, like well I read that they were going to make up my moon base by",,,,response,2,1,3
513,Oliver,"Maybe on the moon, and it made me think that maybe they can use the water to make the moon base possible like they could make oxygen and fuel for the moon",,,,response,2,1,3
513,Teacher,Good that's um,,,,remark,2,1,3
513,Teacher,I haven't heard that so that's really interesting and that was that was good that you were like using what you found in this text along with what you already heard before so very interesting,,,110.3,remark,2,1,3
513,Teacher,I didn't I didn't know,,,,remark,2,1,3
513,Teacher,Okay does anyone else have any questions,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
513,Teacher,"No, so the final conclusion is that water is valuable right because it'll help with the fuel for the spacecraft and also help them make room in",,,130.3,remark,2,1,3
513,Teacher,The spacecraft,,,,remark,2,1,3
513,Jazmin,We,,,,response,2,1,3
513,Jazmin,"just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like one of the things that I really wanted to thank you for working with us is like how you helped us to verify what we were",,,,response,2,1,3
513,Jazmin,"Like saying, like you, helped us understand why did we come up with the answer",,,,response,2,1,3
513,Jazmin,And you also listen to ideas which really made me feel valued and I think that everybody had a really good time working with you guys,,,,response,2,1,3
513,Jazmin,"yeah I think everybody really enjoyed it, so thank you so much, it was really fun working with you, thank you",,,,response,2,1,3

513,Oliver,Oh Hello,,,,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"Okay, so",,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"Okay, so we're going to go through and i'm going to ask you guys a little bit more about what you said, for your answers so once again, the question is",,,150.1,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,What equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"Yes, Luis",,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Luis,yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space,,,,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"You do okay well you know what that's good because I don't know all about space and i'm sure some of your friends don't either, so you can be here to help us",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,So,,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"We can start with you to say, you said that um scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"Right Okay, so how did you find that out because I didn't see that in the text, so how to use that",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
513,Luis,"Okay, well, if there are astronauts on the moon looking for water, I know that they would have to have oxygen tanks 100%",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"mm hmm no That was really good using her background knowledge, because it didn't say it in the text, so it was very good",,,310.1,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"um okay also Farrah so, you said that",,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,We would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"Right, so what would we be looking at in the text, what did it say that we would have to be looking at",,,230.2,remark,0,1,3
513,Farrah,"Okay, well, we would be looking at the tiny Oh, what did they call them ice deposits",,,230.2,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"john uh huh and using oh yeah so Luis know Oliveron Oliveron, is it",,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Oliver,Okay yeah,,,,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"Okay, so you said that you circled the same thing as Farrah",,,110.1,remark,0,1,3
513,Oliver,yeah we bought picked a microscope for the appointment,,,110.1,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"Okay, and can you tell me a little bit more why you",,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
513,Oliver,circle,,,230.1,response,0,1,3
513,Oliver,"on yeah so while a microscope lots to see really tiny things on, and if you see something you can discover it so that's why I picked a microscope because, being able to see tiny particles, but overall",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,mm hmm right right and we would need a microscope to look at something we can't see with our own eyes right,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
513,Oliver,yeah yeah exactly,,,210.4,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"Yes, Jazmin",,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Jazmin,um I have a different answer I said NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"Well, yours is correct, but do you remember what the small machine was called in the text",,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
513,Jazmin,"Okay, it says NASA centers for machine called a lunar orbiter",,,210.4,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"Yes, so just to make sure that you do go into more detail about what it is and that's really the only thing, so if you say that it's a small machine",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"I mean it's not really specific so you don't really know exactly what machine, it is, but by saying what is the Lunar orbiter it just makes it more specific so, then you know what exactly it is",,,430.2,remark,0,1,3
513,Jazmin,Oh okay yeah,,,430.2,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,And then Chris Do you remember what you said,,,120.4,remark,0,1,3
513,Chris,"yeah I said that scientists found creators, full of water on the moon",,,120.4,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"Okay, so with that one, I just wanted to make sure that you understood that it wasn't full the critters weren't filled with water so",,,410.3,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,And the paragraph,,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,Okay i'm gonna have to look further after but i'm in the paragraph it doesn't say was filled it just said that it was found in the craters,,,410.3,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"So just to make sure you understand it wasn't like filled to the top, it was just at the bottom they found some water and some of them so that's how they found out there, that there was water on the moon",,,410.3,remark,0,1,3
513,Chris,"Oh Okay, I guess, because we just kind of picture that wrong in my brain",,,410.3,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"that's Okay, I mean it happens",,,,remark,0,1,3

513,Farrah,i'm i'm still kind of confused,,,150.1,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,On what,,,230.1,remark,0,1,3
513,Farrah,"Oh well, so",,,230.1,response,0,1,3
513,Farrah,"You said that Jazmin's answer was right, but what about the microscope",,,,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,yeah so they didn't just use one thing they used,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,A few different things,,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,so they were both right both of your both of your answers,,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,In the beginning that they use a small machine called a lunar orbiter and then,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,Towards the end they were saying that they used a microscope to really look at the,,,210.4,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,Look at the water integrators yes,,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Farrah,"Oh OK, so we were both right",,,,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"Yes, yep you are",,,110.2,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,Chris,,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Chris,"Oh well, I just wanted to share that I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"yeah no exactly, and that was really good that Luis brought up that they use on oxygen tanks, because it didn't say it in the text, but in order to be out in space, you would need an oxygen tank",,,110.3,remark,0,1,3
513,Chris,So I could put that for my answer,,,110.3,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"You could yeah you could say that I would also make sure you say what's in the text, though, because the questions asking mainly what's in the text so just make sure you",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"Talk about what's in the text, and then you can also elaborate on what you know for a fact",,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Chris,Oh so i'm like equipment that was in the story,,,,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"yeah so like how he said i'm phase microscopes they use the Lunar orbiter and then Luis said that he knew using his background knowledge that you also need an oxygen tank out there, so that's why yeah",,,230.3,remark,0,1,3
513,Chris,"yeah okay Okay, so you just want to say one thing from the story, and then you could say some stuff you know too",,,230.3,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,"If you know it's correct if if you're like unsure about it, I wouldn't but um",,,420.2,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,yeah like an oxygen,,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,tank yeah definitely,,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,0,1,3
513,Oliver,"um so I just looked at the clock and actually um, we have to go to lunch now what I just wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to each one of our answers",,,,response,0,1,3
513,Oliver,"and helping us understand how they have different machines worked in space that was a really, really helpful, thank you",,,,response,0,1,3
513,Teacher,know of course thank you guys did very good,,,,remark,0,1,3
514,Teacher,Thank you,,,,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,Hello class all right how's it going guys how we doing,,,,remark,1,0,3
514,Oliver,We are excited to work with you,,,,response,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"Thanks alright, just so for today just for some introductions you guys can call me, Mr tillman or Mr T whichever you prefer How does that sound",,,,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"Good cool all right, so we just read this short excerpt about discovering water on the moon, and so our first question, can I was wondering if someone can remind me Luis you look really excited to answer so if you could please reread the question for us?",,,120.3,remark,1,0,3
514,Luis,"Oh yeah I can but I just wanted to say before I read anything that I don't think I need to be in this group, because I already know, like everything there is to know about space",,,120.3,response,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"Well that's actually really good that you say that Luis so since you actually know a lot about space, hopefully, you can help us in our peers get to the final answer How does that sound?",,,110.3,remark,1,0,3
514,Luis,"yeah, I guess, I can I can do that",,,110.3,response,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"Alright cool that sounds good alright so let's jump back into that first part, do you mind repeating the question for us?",,,120.3,remark,1,0,3
514,Luis,"um Okay, so the question was um what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon",,,120.3,response,1,0,3
514,Teacher,Great so I know you guys had a good mix of answers which is really good because it actually helps us get down to the root of,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,The actual answer that we're looking for right,,,150.1,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,So I see from based off of our answers Farrah Oliver and Luis you guys all did a great job of understanding that you know from our question you know where we're looking for equipment,,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"we're looking for specific equipment that will help us find one on the water right and Jazmin and Chris, I also noticed that you guys did that to",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"Harris, and you did a good job of finding you know what the machine does and the equipment that we're using and then Jazmin for recognizing that you know it's a small machine but we're still missing that key concept of what the action will have seen it right",,,410.1,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,So what i'm suggesting that we should do in order to get to the answer is that we look for some keywords keywords or some context clues that will help us find find it in the question,,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher," Jazmin, you have a question?",,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
514,Jazmin,I was just wondering why my answer was wrong,,,420.1,response,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"yeah so that's what we're going to find out, right now, so based off of your answer it's just it's not that it's wrong it's just that we have pieces missing from the answer, so we got part of it right, but we want to get the whole thing OK",,,130.1,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"cool so going back to our question like Luis said what are some key words or some context clues that will help us get to the answer so what's the main part of the question, what are we looking for, and the question does anyone know",,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"Chris, what do you think",,,,remark,1,0,3
514,Chris,So we're looking for we're looking for equipment what,,,,response,1,0,3
514,Chris,Did they use,,,,response,1,0,3
514,Teacher,Good good Farrah you want to build off that,,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
514,Farrah,Reach Every reader: Oh I just got the same thing,,,130.2,response,1,0,3
514,Farrah,To say that also it was,,,,response,1,0,3
514,Farrah,easy to find water,,,,response,1,0,3
514,Teacher,Nice cool cool good good so with that you know what we're looking for with the equipment can we break that down a little bit more what are some words or some key words that we can relate to equipment that will help us find,,,420.1,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,Luis,,,,remark,1,0,3
514,Luis,"um is it like tools, you know, like it's kind of like a tool that you use",,,,response,1,0,3
514,Teacher, Jazmin you have a different one?,,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,Good yep so that's one word tool that's one that we could use,,,210.3,remark,1,0,3
514,Jazmin,"I'm just thinking that anytime that you're like making something or or taking in something like I will look for words like making or building or taking like you have to use equipment, if you are doing those things",,,210.3,response,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"Right good so using those keywords like using building alright, so we got two parts of their so Luis said",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"tools is another way that we can help us find the word and then Jazmin said that we're also going to look for clues like digging and building, so that we know that we're using the equipment right anybody else anything else",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"Okay, so how about I build off that again So what are we looking for with the equipment that we're using",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,let's go to Oliver first since I haven't heard from you yet,,,,remark,1,0,3
514,Oliver,"So what we're looking for is we're looking for the the water, so that we know that there's water and we're trying to find it",,,,response,1,0,3
514,Teacher,Right good good anyone have a different answer,,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,Go Chris,,,,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,What do you got,,,,remark,1,0,3
514,Chris,"um I guess the only difference that I would add to the answer is, I would add that you might be looking more for ice than actual water because it's ice on the",,,,response,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"so what i'm going to do now, so you guys can help build on that answer more oh before we get started to Chris, you have another question",,,,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"Right yeah because it's cold so good good So these are all great clues that we all help on fighting together,",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
514,Chris,"Well, I was just it was going through my head, because we were talking about the different tools and what news define things and I I know cuz i've been to NASA like data few times that",,,,response,1,0,3
514,Chris,"You know, like astronauts have to wear",,,,response,1,0,3
514,Chris,"spacesuits and like they have oxygen tanks and stuff so I was wondering if, like",,,,response,1,0,3
514,Chris,"Well, I guess, I was wondering, are those tools also",,,,response,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"So they can be types of tools, yes, you know equipment gear all those other things so but for right now, you know we're not primarily focused on you know the tool is used for oxygen and all those other things we're looking for the ones that will help us find the water right",,,410.1,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,That was actually good using background knowledge to make connections,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher, good job Chris,,,310.1,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,good job,,,,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"All right, so in order to so we already have our background information, we know that we're looking for equipment or tools that's going to help us find water on the moon",,,210.2,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,So what I want to do now is split you guys into two small groups so i'm just going to do Chris and death,,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"I mean, excuse me i'm gonna do Farrah and death and then Chris Jazmin eat less or two groups so YouTube and then the other three",,,130.2,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,"And what I want you guys to do is using what we just discovered from the question reread paragraph two, and see if we can find an answer okay so let's take about one to two minutes to do that and so Farrah have a question before we get started",,,210.4,remark,1,0,3
514,Farrah,"You have to go to our next class, but thank you so much, it was really interesting to meet you, Mr T and to talk to you Thank you so much",,,210.4,response,1,0,3
514,Teacher,No problem,,,,remark,1,0,3
514,Teacher,Alright class so let's jump back into where we left off and have you guys in your groups you guys can continue talking and just reread paragraph two okay,,,120.3,remark,2,0,3
514,All,All right,,,120.3,,2,0,3
514,Farrah,"Okay, so let's take a look at their craft and see if there's anything that are like clues that we can use",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Oliver,"Okay, so um alright so let's read it together okay",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Oliver,Nasa send a small machine called lunar orbiter,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Oliver, So what do you think Farrah,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Oliver,Just a very small,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Oliver,"Is there anything in there, that you think could be that cool",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Farrah,"um yeah I think there's a couple options actually up, I think one of the options could be",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Farrah,Because I can see some questions because I can see that one machine is the lunar orbiter,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Farrah,"But like it's possible that that's the answer, but you could also say that the cup that they used to measure the water that's the answer too",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Oliver,"oh I didn't think about that, so it could be the Lunar orbiter or it could be the cup or maybe both like maybe they use both of those kinds of equipment, you know what I mean",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Farrah,yeah that's possible,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Chris,Okay guys so let's talk about what we what we saw,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Jazmin,"Okay, so when we were reading the character and looking at this stuff like I guess what I like to be with the stuff about",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Jazmin,"Like is what jumped out to me was the Lunar orbiter like that's what I thought, what you see what",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Jazmin,I'm still a bit confused about why my answer was wrong because I always thought that it was the lunar orbiter,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Jazmin, Do you guys agree?,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Chris,He basically,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Chris,"Well, I kind of agree, I could see that it's an orbiter, but I also think that there's other equipment that is be left out of the meeting, I think that they use like you know I know that they have to use this other stuff even if it's not",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Chris,"Like satellites at radar and all that stuff to find like were even on the phone to look, so I think that's confusing",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Luis,"right way, like, I feel the same way cuz i'm thinking to myself, like probably they use other stuff as well i'm not really sure",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"All right, let's come back in 321",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"All right, how many activity for us was a good Luis you got some first reaction",,,,remark,2,0,3
514,Luis,"Yes, I got it all figured out good I think i'm ready to go back to my desk",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"Alright, so before we go back to her desk and just a moment let's make sure that we all come to agreement on a on a group answer okay",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"Okay, so how about somebody else in your group tell me what you got to the final answer either Chris and Jazmin",,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"Jazmin I saw your hand First, what do you got",,,,remark,2,0,3
514,Jazmin,"Okay, so the first time that we were getting answers I thought the answer was the Lunar orbiter and I still think that's the answer because that's the small machine that that the scientists set and they're the ones that it says in the reading",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Jazmin,There the one it says they investigate with the Lunar orbiter so that seems like the right answer because that tells me that they were finding,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Jazmin,Finding something,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Jazmin,stuff so that tells me that they found all about the ice,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Teacher,great job,,,,remark,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"Using the context clues that we use before, when we were analyzing the question you know, using words like investigate and seeing that it's a small machine that they use it's a great job",,,310.1,remark,2,0,3
514,Teacher,Chris and you want to build on that?,,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
514,Jazmin,One nice thing to say just just as part of my answer was that I was,,,310.1,response,2,0,3
514,Jazmin,Like why my answer wasn't wasn't right to begin with,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Jazmin,"You know I said it was a small machine, like, I guess, I just wanted like what was missing from my answer",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"we want to make sure that you can combine the park, so you guys can all get the full answer does that make sense",,,150.1,remark,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"Right so in the same way, like how I spoke to eastern before it's not necessarily that your answer was completely wrong you guys just all had parts of the answer correct",,,130.1,remark,2,0,3
514,Jazmin,yeah that makes sense,,,130.1,response,2,0,3
514,Teacher,Okay cool and Chris go ahead,,,120.4,remark,2,0,3
514,Chris,"So I thought, when we were discussing up like I think Jazmin as a really good theory and I I could see how it could be the Lunar orbiter I can I can see that now",,,120.4,response,2,0,3
514,Chris,"Since she explained it, but I still think that the question is saying like you know, like what equipment could it be, and it saying like it could be even more than one piece",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Chris,So Luis and I thought that the fact that they don't mention like satellite radar and even the oxygen tanks and stuff like I think we're still the team that that would be something that they have forgetting to say,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Teacher,Right that's also a good point Chris,,,110.1,remark,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"But I think for this on packages, specifically, you know we're just looking at that one tool that they're using at this moment in time, so there definitely is a lot of more lot more equipment that NASA uses to find a lot of things, but",,,410.2,remark,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"I think, in this specific context and just finding the water at this time, they think the Lunar orbiter is what the main equipped piece of equipment that they use so that's a good that's a good point as well",,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
514,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,2,0,3
514,Chris,Okay gotcha,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"cool and before we wrap up just to make sure that we're on the same page So then, and then, did you have a similar answers to Jazmin or something different",,,130.2,remark,2,0,3
514,Oliver,So i'm Farrah do you want to talk first,,,130.2,response,2,0,3
514,Farrah,So we kind of had a slightly different answer after focusing on the second paragraph we guess that probably,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Farrah,"You wanted us to see that the Lunar orbiter was one of the things, but even then we were still thinking that maybe it was the glass of water that they measured the 32 ounces with because that's equivalent to so we thought, maybe",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Farrah,We keep seeing lots of different like it seems like for other folks that they're able to see that there's other like they're able to guess like what kind of,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Farrah,"US we keep seeing like different pieces, like the microscope and the glass and the Lunar orbiter and we keep thinking they're using all right yeah I keep thinking that they're probably using all those States to do the measurements",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"so also build enough that remember the tool that we're looking for specifically it's supposed to find the water, you know it's supposed to help us collect the water search for the water, and so you guys mentioned the cups",,,210.2,remark,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"Right, those are good, those are good points, both both of you guys",,,110.2,remark,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"But they do, they do, what exactly",,,210.3,remark,2,0,3
514,Teacher,What did you guys say that will,,,,remark,2,0,3
514,Teacher,help you do,,,,remark,2,0,3
514,Oliver,A couple of men are at right,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Teacher,yeah,,,,remark,2,0,3
514,Oliver,So you guys,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"yeah yeah definitely on the right track, hoping to get it to measure it but helping us find it it's the Lunar orbiter",,,130.3,remark,2,0,3
514,Teacher,"All right, Farrah question?",,,,remark,2,0,3
514,Farrah,"Well, I just wanted to say, actually, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch, I really wanted to just say how much we enjoyed working with you and, like in particular",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Farrah,"You really helped us to clarify our thinking about what we were trying to you know, think about in our answers and try to like",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Farrah,"You know, find the best answer that could and you also help this use evidence from the text so we knew that we needed to really prove our weight",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Farrah,And I realized that most of us really except for except for Jazmin we didn't really prove our point because we weren't,,,,response,2,0,3
514,Farrah,"I guess We brought the microscope in but it wasn't the right answer so you helped us find both like what was the answer that we were looking for, and also how to how to prove it so that was pretty cool Thank you so much",,,,response,2,0,3
514,Teacher,No problem Thank you guys for participating,,,,remark,2,0,3
514,Teacher,bye,,,,remark,2,0,3
514,Farrah,Hello hi how are you,,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,Good morning class how's it going how's everybody doing today,,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Farrah,Oh we're great we're so excited to work with you that's great that's great,,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,So I know that we had just recently read a short exit water on the moon right,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,Luis's on that I see you have a question,,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Luis,yeah yeah um so um I shouldn't be and that's already know a lot about that space,,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,"that's great you know it's at times it's actually good that you say that the more that you have knowledge on space, you know I think it's better to help us with",,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,oh how's that sound?,,,150.1,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,"This problem so even if you know you might feel like you don't think you need to be in this group, then maybe we can help some of our peers",,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Luis,sure yeah i'd love to do that,,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,"Alright, so the main question I wanted to help you guys answer today is the first question that we answered some remind me of that question",,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Farrah,"Okay, the question is what equipment at scientists to us to discover water on the moon",,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,"Great all right now let's get some more quiet hands, what did we get what do we have an answer on that first question",,,120.4,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,let's go to Chris and then Jazmin you can jump in now,,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Chris,"Okay, so I said that scientists found craters, full of water on the moon",,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,Good alright so that's good background knowledge understanding what they found,,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,but um let's let's keep building on that right good Jazmin,,,120.1,remark,0,0,3
514,Jazmin,Okay,,,310.1,response,0,0,3
514,Jazmin,I said,,,,response,0,0,3
514,Jazmin,NASA sent a small machine,,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,"Good alright, so we see we have different pieces of the context of what we're trying to find here, so the main part of the question is what equipment, did they use to find the water",,,210.2,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,"And so, as Chris pointed out, they with the equipment that they use they made the craters to find the water and then Jazmin also gave us some context, saying that they use the small machine",,,230.3,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,"so let's build on that, how can we build on that a little bit more?",,,130.2,remark,0,0,3
514,Jazmin,Well it's kind of wondering that because I don't understand why my answer is wrong,,,130.2,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,Well let's take a look back at the passage okay um can I get a volunteer to read a paragraph to just for some context,,,120.3,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,we haven't heard much from you Oliver go ahead,,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Oliver,"Okay, how about you it's not so simple small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar quite a few years, these ice are very small",,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,Good job so based on the context of that on that paragraph Jazmin do you think you want to try it again and tell us the answer,,,120.1,remark,0,0,3
514,Jazmin,well,,,120.1,response,0,0,3
514,Jazmin,It sounds like the small machine,,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,Right so there's more there's more to that What else does it say about the small machine,,,210.4,remark,0,0,3
514,Jazmin,"Okay, a small machine called a lunar orbiter",,,210.4,response,0,0,3
514,Jazmin,And it looks for ice deposits,,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,"There we go yeah good job, so the small machine on that you actually mentioned it's called a lunar orbit",,,130.3,remark,0,0,3
514,Jazmin,And so I just had to say lunar orbiter?,,,130.3,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,"And um I also noticed, you know Chris like how you said that they find the crater so understanding that the Lunar orbiter is what we use to find",,,130.3,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,get into those craters the prime the water,,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Farrah,"um well I I had a different answer I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so um well you just said Jazmin is right, but what about the microscope",,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,"Right, so the microscope is actually great because that is a tool that we do use in science and to help us see things but specifically for this part and finding water on the moon",,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,That is the tool that we use the Lunar orbiter not a microscope,,,130.3,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,"so that's actually a good context to as well, using that background knowledge understanding our tools",,,310.1,remark,0,0,3
514,Farrah,But I guess I don't understand why,,,310.1,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,"Why, the question is wrong or why",,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Farrah,Why why it's not the microscope,,,,response,0,0,3
514,Farrah,Oh,,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,"Well, I mean they just",,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,pause simulation,,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Farrah,Oh no you're doing really well,,,,response,0,0,3
514,Farrah,I just just,,,,response,0,0,3
514,Farrah,I just wanted to know,,,,response,0,0,3
514,Farrah,Why it's the Lunar orbiter,,,,response,0,0,3
514,Farrah,"it's okay it's Okay, if you want to talk to someone else that's Okay, I can work on",,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,"Chris, you have a question",,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Chris,"yeah well actually it's a comment on, yes I I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits",,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,yeah definitely,,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,that's good that you actually went to NASA you actually get to see it in person and that's really cool,,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
514,Chris,yeah it was so cool they had so many things like machines and tools and space suits yeah it was amazing to watch,,,110.3,response,0,0,3
514,Luis,Chris that was kind of like my answer to for the question and my answer was that scientists use oxygen tanks,,,,response,0,0,3
514,Luis,"So I was just that connection, I just wanted to make that connection that to discover the water on the moon, they use oxygen tanks",,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,For sure yeah that's great that's great that's a great connection,,,110.3,remark,0,0,3
514,Teacher,yeah Oliver what do you got for it,,,,remark,0,0,3
514,Oliver,"um well I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for for being so patient with us and giving all of us the chance to share it was really nice to work with you today, thank you",,,,response,0,0,3
514,Teacher,Thank you guys have a good lunch,,,,remark,0,0,3
554,Teacher,Hello good afternoon,,,,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,We've all read the article,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"We've all read this article water on the moon from the New York Times, and now we're trying to answer this this question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon",,,120.2,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,And it seems like there's almost two parts to this question right what tool was used and how was it used What did it do,,,210.2,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"each of you have an answer that hits one of those two parts, and so, for pretty much everyone in this group i'd like to offer some suggestions of how you might get both of those two parts in your answers",,,220.1,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,Are we good to start,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,Luis do you have a question,,,,remark,1,1,3
554,Luis,"um yeah so I already know all about space I don't think I need to be in this group, because I know all this stuff",,,,response,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"sure when and remember this is not really a group for who knows about space and who doesn't this is more just, have we written an answer that completely answers this question",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"And so maybe your answer has one of these two parts, but let's see if we can make it even stronger so actually we can start with you Luis and i'm curious what made you say that scientists need oxygen tanks That was really smart edition",,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
554,Luis,"yeah so I was thinking when I was reading when I was like you're not talking about all the materials that they need like when I watched like space shows on TV they always have oxygen tanks and like suits and stuff like that, so it seems weird that they left that out",,,230.1,response,1,1,3
554,Teacher,yeah and I see how you're answering this question by using your own knowledge rate your own experiences from watching movies and seeing the equipment that's being used,,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"so my suggestion is that you look back at paragraph two, to see if you can name and describe the tool that was used to find the water okay",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"And i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically for how the water was found",,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
554,Luis,Like just for the water,,,410.1,response,1,1,3
554,Teacher,Just for finding that water right,,,,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"So take a look at paragraph two, and see if you can find that tool",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,And now i see Farrah you have a question?,,,,remark,1,1,3
554,Farrah,yeah I I was just wondering,,,,response,1,1,3
554,Farrah,I was confused about like why my answer was wrong,,,,response,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"So, again it's not that your answers necessarily right or wrong there's always a way to make something better though right so let's take a look actually your is end of",,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"Both had this inclusion about the microscope right this detail about the microscope, and so I see how you're providing this specific tool to support your answer",,,310.1,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,i'm concerned that the question is asking for what was used to discover water right and we've only mentioned the tool that's used to see it once you have discovered it,,,410.1,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"So my suggestion for both of you delve, too, is that you reread paragraph two, and maybe some of three and to really understand what tool is being used to first find the water before they use the microscope",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,does that make sense,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,Farrah,,,,remark,1,1,3
554,Farrah,"um, I think it makes sense, but I think that what's confusing to me, is that, like how could they find the water if they can't see the water like you know what I mean like they said that the water was like",,,,response,1,1,3
554,Farrah,What did they say like microscopic so that means like really small right so like how did they find it if they couldn't see it,,,,response,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"so go ahead and take a look at paragraph two, there and see if you can name that tool and describe a little bit of how it works",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,that's a fantastic question and that's why there's another tool that had to be used in order to find it,,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
554,Farrah,Okay i'll check it out,,,420.3,response,1,1,3
554,Teacher,um how about We talk to Chris next do you have a question before I start,,,,remark,1,1,3
554,Chris,"um ya So my question is that like ok so like Luis said that which I think was good, was",,,,response,1,1,3
554,Chris,"That like the scientists use lots of equipment and I've been to NASA, so I know that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that, so I guess, I was like",,,,response,1,1,3
554,Chris,isn't that the answer for like how they found the water,,,,response,1,1,3
554,Teacher,hmm,,,,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,I think that might answer another question of how can they see the water,,,130.1,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"Right, but if we really want to know how did they find it in the first place, there is another tool that we can look for in this in this New York Times passage there right and so actually for you and Jazmin",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,You started to explain how machine was being sent,,,230.3,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,But we didn't specify exactly what that machine was,,,410.2,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"so let's take a look my suggestion, again, is that we take a look at this paragraph two, because there is there's another tool that was used in order to find the water, even before they could see it",,,420.3,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,Is there anyone who thinks they might have found the tool mentioned in paragraph two,,,120.4,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,Jazmin,,,,remark,1,1,3
554,Jazmin,"Yes, my idea was that it was this small machine and I was wondering I wasn't sure like what my answer was wrong, because it seems like this small machine was probably the thing that they used to find the water",,,,response,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"To be honest, i'm not a space astronauts so i'm truthfully not sure we'd have to look again at this article, to see if there's a name for that small machine did you happen to notice if it was called something",,,210.4,remark,1,1,3
554,Jazmin,"Oh yeah like it's the lunar orbiter, is that the answer?",,,210.4,response,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"let's all take a look at that part of paragraph two, there, right at the beginning NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater",,,120.3,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,who thinks that this is answering the question being asked raise your hand,,,150.1,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,I see two hands went up Farrah seems unsure,,,,remark,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"Oliver, why did you say that this this does answer the question",,,230.1,remark,1,1,3
554,Oliver,"So, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but this was really exciting Thank you so much",,,230.1,response,1,1,3
554,Teacher,"Alright, good afternoon",,,,remark,2,1,3
554,Reach Every Reader,hi,,,,,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"So we've just read the article water on the moon by the New York Times, and now we're analyzing this second question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable",,,120.2,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,You might have even noticed in the article there's a title of a section called water is a valuable resource,,,210.4,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,so i'm curious to hear some of the ideas that we've come up with to help explain why water might be valuable there on the moon,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,And let's start with oh sorry can't see my zoom screen there Luis do you have a question?,,,,remark,2,1,3
554,Luis,"um yeah so I I was just gonna say I think I got this all figured out, so I think i'm good",,,,response,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"All right, well i'm going to start with Farrah and then we'll come to your answer and we'll take a minute to take a look at it",,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,and so I noticed for Oliver and Farrah actually,,,,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"Remembering that any answer can be made better but it's not that you have a wrong answer that maybe it's just answering a different question right so let's try and strengthen our answers here,",,,110.2,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"I see how you've answered the question is water valuable because right now there isn't any water there, so you said no, not yet",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"i'm concerned, though, that there is evidence in paragraph four",,,410.3,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"um suggesting that water could be valuable, so my suggestion is that you go back to the paragraph, for both of you and take a look to see if there's some reason, maybe even two reasons why water could be helpful, even if it isn't right now",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,does that sound good,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
554,Farrah,yeah we can do that,,,420.3,response,2,1,3
554,Teacher,Great,,,110.1,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"While, you guys are working on that",,,,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,Jazmin and Chris you both came up with great answers for why water,,,110.2,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"so Chris, you had said waters is heavy so it's hard to bring it up in ships right it's A lot of weight for the spaceship to bring ",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,is relevant to being on the moon right,,,,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,and Jazmin you had said that water is something they can drink to stay hydrated right,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"so let's think about how does this answer the question about is it valuable, is it helpful right um",,,210.2,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"My suggestion is similar to Oliver and Farrah you take a look at paragraph four, and to see why it would be helpful to have it on the moon there",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"Chris You also spoke about paragraph five, so why don't you read both paragraphs to see if you can find and why it wouldn't be helpful to have it in a spaceship",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,Also right now Jazmin Chris reread paragraph four to find out why would it be better on the moon,,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
554,Chris,"Well, cuz I was thinking",,,420.3,response,2,1,3
554,Chris,You don't even need to take it anymore  cuz if it's on the moon you don't even need to bring it with you,,,,response,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"Which ties into what you said before about it being really heavy so it sounds like you're saying it could be valuable to have it on the moon, just so that you can save on the rocket fuel to bring it there",,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,yeah can you take a moment to add that into your response,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,Jazmin you have a question,,,,remark,2,1,3
554,Jazmin,Yes I was just going to say I'm still kind of confused,,,,response,2,1,3
554,Teacher,With your response you had mentioned that astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated that seems really helpful you can't survive without water that's definitely true right,,,110.2,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"Why would it be helpful, though, to have it on the moon, rather than to bring it with them on a space shuttle right Chris was just telling us that it's very heavy",,,210.3,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,So maybe you could add to your answer a bit about how it would be helpful to have it there on the moon ready to go since astronauts need to drink it,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
554,Jazmin,Oh that makes a lot of sense Okay let me change my answer,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"Great and then Luis you've included some great pass knowledge about how water is composed of these two parts, hydrogen and oxygen it's a great time to chemistry that makes sense, with why we need water, we need these perks",,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"I am concerned, though, that the question is asking why are you would want water on the moon",,,410.1,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"Right and we haven't mentioned moon in our answer so my suggestion is that you take a look at either paragraph four or paragraph five, to find at least two reasons why you would want water on the moon",,,420.3,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,does that makes sense,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
554,Luis,"yeah so like you're saying like I should have some reason, like like okay yeah like the water does this, they can do that, like, why is it is that right",,,420.3,response,2,1,3
554,Teacher,Exactly similar to Jazmin you've told us why it's really helpful we just want to add a little bit about why it's helpful to have it on the moon,,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
554,Luis,I can do that,,,420.2,response,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"everyone perfect take a moment, you can add that in",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,Does anyone have an answer that they want to share with their group when they've improved,,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,Oliver?,,,,remark,2,1,3
554,Oliver,yeah so I read that there was going to be a base on the moon by 2024,,,,response,2,1,3
554,Teacher,Is that something you read in the article is that some knowledge that you're bringing to the conversation,,,230.1,remark,2,1,3
554,Oliver,Oh that's a good question um I read it online,,,230.1,response,2,1,3
554,Teacher,So I see how that connects to what we're talking about here,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically about water",,,410.1,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"so my suggestion is that you make sure to mention, in addition to the base being built how it would be really helpful to have water there",,,420.2,remark,2,1,3
554,Oliver,Okay,,,310.1,response,2,1,3
554,Teacher,Any other questions as we're updating our answers,,,150.1,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"Does someone to have a response, they might want to share with the group",,,120.4,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"Farrah, I saw your hand first",,,,remark,2,1,3
554,Farrah,"On Okay, so I thought about some of the ways that it could be valuable and at still like Okay, so I think I might still make the argument that it might not be valuable yet, but maybe it will be valuable once we have the like",,,,response,2,1,3
554,Farrah,I think the word is infrastructure,,,,response,2,1,3
554,Farrah,"Infrastructure and you like, once we have that, like the equipment and stuff on the we could use it a lot",,,,response,2,1,3
554,Farrah,"I still think it's probably in the future, but I did look at what you said in the paragraph, and I could see that there was stuff that would be really valuable like you can use it to drink you can make rocket fuel from it like there's a lot of stuff where certainly eventually, it would be really valuable",,,,response,2,1,3
554,Teacher,And I see how your even mentioning other answers like Jazmin's she mentioned it's needed to be,,,310.1,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,"and you might have also noticed that in paragraph five, it starts with moon water could be useful so you're not wrong that saying",,,110.2,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,for drinking and like Luis had mentioned it can be used to make rocket fuel that's those are great reasons to include in your answer,,,230.3,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,it's not useful yet,,,,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,And it's being Olivereloped ya,,,,remark,2,1,3
554,Teacher,Oliver,,,,remark,2,1,3
554,Oliver,"So, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch",,,,response,2,1,3
554,Oliver,"But before we go to lunch, I just wanted to say that you really helped us and, like I think what was really interesting and really cool",,,,response,2,1,3
554,Oliver,was how you explain like what we needed to work on and then you gave us ideas for like,,,,response,2,1,3
554,Oliver,"not like what the answer was, but like how we could make our answers better i'd like more complete like you agree guys, like, I think that was really fun, so thank you so much, because that was really cool bye",,,,response,2,1,3
554,Teacher,my pleasure nice to meet you,,,,remark,2,1,3
558,Teacher,hi everyone how are you,,,,remark,0,1,2
558,Oliver,Um we're good,,,,response,0,1,2
558,Oliver,just excited to work with you,,,,response,0,1,2
558,Teacher,Great fantastic so you just read water on the moon,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,"Oh yes, Luis",,,,remark,0,1,2
558,Luis,"um so I don't think I need to be in this group, because I already know all about space",,,,response,0,1,2
558,Teacher,Fantastic then you'll be able to contribute in ways that will move the rest of the group Thinking forward i'm glad you're here,,,110.3,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,"Right fantastic Okay, so you read the article water on the moon",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,And you answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,,,120.2,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,"You circled evidence in the text, you can use to answer the question",,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,So i'm just interested in hearing hearing from you what your answers were,,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,Oliver?,,,,remark,0,1,2
558,Oliver,um yeah so I circled the same thing as Farrah,,,,response,0,1,2
558,Teacher,Can you give me a little more detail about what that was what evidence was that,,,230.1,remark,0,1,2
558,Oliver,yeah so okay so survey and I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I think that that group because they talk about different sort of equipment which is a word that I circled and I saw that the equipment that I noticed was the microscope,,,230.1,response,0,1,2
558,Teacher,"Okay, so I see that what you did is when you were looking at the article you identified words that remind you of equipment right, and one piece of equipment is a microscope",,,310.1,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,So what i'm concerned about is that they also mention,,,410.3,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,"Other pieces of equipment right you identified the microscope, which is in paragraph three",,,,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,and Farrah is that right that that's what you had as well,,,230.3,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,I think you might have overlooked some other pieces of evidence so here's what i'm going to suggest for you Oliver,,,,remark,0,1,2
558,Farrah,yeah I had the same answer,,,230.3,response,0,1,2
558,Teacher,"Okay, so this this might work for you to this next suggestion, so what I might do is do a little bit of rereading",,,120.3,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,"Because most of the articles about equipment that they used how they found it, so I would reread and do a little ranking and sorting of the evidence that I find",,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,"So there's more than one piece of equipment, I might look and see like which ones are most important and rank and sort to identify the most important pieces of equipment that the scientists use",,,420.3,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,Can you try to do a little rereading and find some more evidence,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
558,Farrah,yeah that sounds like an interesting like ranking all of the equipment  I think just i'm still a little about why my answer is wrong,,,150.1,response,0,1,2
558,Teacher,"I didn't say that your answer was wrong, I think that you found a piece of evidence from from the article, but I wonder if you could have a stronger answer if you did a little ranking and sorting of other pieces of evidence",,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
558,Farrah,That makes sense,,,420.2,response,0,1,2
558,Farrah,Okay i'm gonna try that,,,,response,0,1,2
558,Teacher,Perfect Thank you,,,,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,So Oliver and Farrah i'm going to ask you to try that suggestion first,,,150.1,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,"Chris, can you tell me what your response was",,,120.4,remark,0,1,2
558,Chris,yeah,,,150.1,response,0,1,2
558,Chris, yeah so basically,,,150.1,response,0,1,2
558,Chris,What I said is that scientists found craters full of water on the moon,,,,response,0,1,2
558,Teacher,"Interesting, can you tell me where you found that in the article",,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,Farrah I see you i'm going to come back to you once i'm done with Chris,,,110.1,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,"Chris, can you show me where you found that in the article",,,230.2,remark,0,1,2
558,Chris,Ya so It says that in the first paragraph up top scientists have evidence that water can be deep within the moon's,,,110.1,response,0,1,2
558,Chris,polar craters and these craters are dark places where the sun never shines so that makes me think,,,,response,0,1,2
558,Chris,That they're probably full off water,,,,response,0,1,2
558,Teacher,Okay,,,,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,So I see that you got your answer from the first paragraph,,,310.1,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,"One of the, a concern that I have is When you're reading nonfiction often they'll give you a little bit of information in the beginning, and then they'll keep elaborating on it later in the article that will give you a fuller picture of what they're talking about",,,410.3,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,"So you Chris took your answer from the first paragraph, but there's more information about how much water there is on the moon later in the article",,,410.2,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,So my suggestion To make your answer stronger is to keep reading and then check,,,420.2,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,I guess check your answer to see if you can't make it stronger and more detailed,,,,remark,0,1,2
558,Teacher,Because there's more details later in the article,,,,remark,0,1,2
558,Chris,"Because I I went to so with like that, so I know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks, masks, and suits",,,,response,0,1,2
