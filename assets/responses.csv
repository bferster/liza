All right that's that's totally correct I think we'd all agree with you that if you had a microscope you would use it to look at water really closely, although let's think about what happens before that point right And Oliver I think you said this, did you say the same thing is that right. awesome so Farrah and Oliver get awesome points for circling the parts in the text prompt because that was the the direction so A+  direction for following points So let's think about before we actually look at water with the microscope what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water they found on the moon, so they use the microscope after they had found it, but what did they use to find it Do you remember hi Jazmin I see you've got your hand. we're going to wait because i'm i'm talking to Farrah and deb because this is specific to the question that they that they asked is that OK OK, I put a pin you i'll come back to you ","As well Okay, you said, what do they use before the microscope and I guess, I guess, I don't really know I don't understand why my answer is wrong."

110.1,Chris,,," They were saying on because I I had kind of known some of it, but not everything"
110.1,Chris,"yeah,that,question","Yeah, that was a big question "," So I guess that's a like you don't use a suit to discover, you'd have to use something else"
110.1,Chris,,,"You could use all of the equipment, but like, specifically, you said to discover"
110.1,Chris,,," Right"

110.1,Luis,,," So I said that water can be split into two parts into hydrogen and oxygen"
110.1,Chris,,," So I know that the scientists use like a lot of equipment that wasn't in the reading"
110.1,Chris,,," But oxygen tanks and masks and suits and things like that"

110.1,Jazmin,,," Is you could use the water to grow things, you could have a garden on the moon, in the craters"
110.1,Jazmin,,,I think it would be valuable because astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and like you can't survive without water
110.1,Chris,"grow,things,rocket,fuel,jazmin,could,drink"," You can use it to grow things  So rocket fuel will be a use and Jazmin, you could drink it ","On yeah I guess I just wanted to say this, like water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and they both are important"

We see where you found it called the Lunar orbiter and paragraph two right? It says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and so that is the question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, not to look at it afterwards, does that make sense ",Oh yeah okay okay so First they find it with the orbiter and then then also it's like they then they like study it they study it with a microscope

130.2,Farrah,"right,that's,very,valuable,astronauts,right,they're,water,also,chris,saying,that,they,wouldn't,have,travel,yeah,oxygen,then,they,hydrogen,water,rocket,fuel,earth,moon,then,i'll,back,right,indices,what's,there,yeah,agree,that,water,valuable,resource,there,convincing,evidence,that,valuable,resource,farrah","Right, and that's going to be very valuable for the astronauts right they're going to use the water  And also, Chris was saying that they wouldn't have to travel with it Yeah, oxygen, and then they can use the hydrogen from the water for rocket fuel From Earth to the Moon, and then I'll back right the indices what's there Yeah, so can we all agree that water is a valuable resource is there convincing evidence that it's a valuable resource Farrah ","I'm still kind of, you know, like I i saw the parts that they were saying where they were like,"
130.2,Oliver,"look,paragraph,passage,might,find,another,machine,reread,paragraph,passage,don't,don't,look,back,oliver,work,together,since,were,same,answer","Look in paragraph two, of the passage to see if you might find another machine reread, paragraph two of the passage Yes, why don't why don't you look back you and Oliver work together since you were you had the same answer ",Okay
130.2,Jazmin,"tell,what,tool,that,what,tools,they","And who can tell me what tool that what tools did they use ",Is it the one that I said that we were just talking about the Lunar Orbiter

130.2,Chris,,,"Okay, so I saw in the first paragraph, where they're talking about the water and the water was found deep within the moon's polar craters"
130.2,Oliver,"let's,talk,oliver,work,together,that,let's,figure,because,oliver,same,answer"," So let's talk with Oliver and see if we can work together on that one Let's see if we can figure it out because Oliver had the same answer is you ","Yeah, in paragraph three, the last one, it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"

130.2,Luis,,," You can detect water using other tools"
130.2,Luis,,," Just like on the question that you're asking is, like, you use lots of equipment and you don't need a microscope to to detect it"
130.2,Luis,,," So what I was thinking"

130.2,Luis,,,Well
130.2,Chris,"many,guys,picked,equipment,discover"," And how many of you guys picked out equipment or discover ",I picked out equipment and discover too
130.2,Luis,"luis,what","Luis what did you get ",I said equipment discover and water
130.2,Chris,"your,answer,that,scientists,found,using,smaller,machines,guys,know,that,water,rightq","Your answer was that scientists found I see using smaller machines  But guys, did we know that ice is water right?q ","Yeah, for, for me, that's why I was I was confused because I was looking for water in the story"

130.2,Chris,"that's,good,guess,chris,what","Not really, but that's a good guess  Chris, what do you got? "," I think that Oliver's guess is pretty good"
130.2,Chris,,,"Um, so I guess like I kind of know a lot about NASA and I know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and like you know like masks and suits and stuff so I don't know"
130.2,Chris,,," Like you could look and say, like the microscopes on like like what if you attached it to the hand of the spacesuit?"
130.2,Jazmin,"question,okay,these,really,good,guesses,still,missing,point,what"," I'm Question you Okay, I'm one of these are really good guesses  But we're still missing the point  What do you got? ","What I said was, it, it was a small machine"

130.2,Farrah,,," So I think that he's right about equipment"
130.2,Farrah,,," But I don't think that like I don't think he was I don't think he was reading, ma'am"
130.2,Farrah,,," I think she was just saying stuff like that he knew, like I looked at it and I said like I think it's a microscope"

130.2,Oliver,"what,think,about,that,oliver","What do you think about that, Oliver? ","I mean, I guess it would be fine to grow stuff on the moon, you know, I guess"
130.2,Oliver,,," I mean, I'd probably want to have video games or something up there, I think"
130.2,Chris,"that,point,you've,just,find,there,when,find,something,text,could,know,always,have,that,text,just,pretend,like,don't,know,anything,else,know,that,were,talking,about,small,machine,which,what,equipment,right,yeah,what,chris,think,that,equipment,might,possibly,small,machine,well"," At that point, you've just got to find it in there  When you find something in the text, could you let me know  You always have to dig into that text and just pretend like you don't know anything else  I know that you were talking about a small machine, which is what equipment is right?

130.2,Jazmin,"well,let's,take,look,know,that,found,your,answer,microscope,found,paragraph,three,read,that,real,quick,want,guys,look,says,that,that,means,moon,still,drier,than,driest,desert,earth,water,they,found,microscopic,meaning,wouldn't,able,even,you're,looking,straight,then,they,told,that,you'd,need,scientific,tool,called,microscope,look,closely,that,that,could,find,that,that,nasa,found,moon,that's,what,says,they,there,their,oxygen,tanks,microscope,there,want,everybody,just,look,paragraph,want,read,along,let's,back,little,more,paragraph,okay,these,deposits,very,small,says,nasa,sent,small,machine,called,lunar,orbiter,investigate,lunar,orbiter,looks,deposits,large,polar,crater,that's,paragraph,talk,about,piece,equipment,that,they,used,give,thumbs,agree,you're,quite,sure,thumbs,down,disagree,jazmin,thumbs,middle,guys,that,want,guys,give,that,absolutely,correct","Well, let's take a look  I know a lot of you that found your answer for microscope found it in paragraph three, and I'm going to read that to you real quick  I want you guys to look It says that that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth  The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it, even if you're looking straight at it And then they told you that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look at it closely  That is one way that you could find it  But is that the way that NASA found it on the moon?  That's not what it says Did they go up there with their oxygen tanks and a microscope to see if it was on there  So I want everybody to just look at paragraph two, and I want you to read along with me Let's back up a little bit more to paragraph two, okay  These ice deposits are very small It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater Ok, so that's paragraph two, does it talk about a piece of equipment that they used  Can you give me a thumbs up if you agree  If you're not quite sure, or thumbs down if you disagree with Jazmin  A thumbs in the middle  Can you guys do that  I want you guys to give me That is absolutely correct ","well, we can't quiet do the thumbs, but we could do raised hands if we agree and then no raise hands if we disagree, is that okay?"
130.2,Oliver,"okay,anybody,different,answer,luis,what,anybody,different,answer,luis,farrah,what,oliver","Okay, so the anybody get a different answer for Luis?  What do you get Did anybody get a different answer from Luis  Um, Farrah, what did Oliver ","Yeah, I actually did get a different answer because I was still kind of thinking that it was the microscope"
130.2,Oliver,,," I feel like you know, like, that was really the equipment that they use to find the water"
130.2,Farrah,,,"Okay, so, you know, initially, that's what I thought, too"
130.2,Speaker,"farrah,that,scientists,part","So, Farrah, can you add to that Scientists are a part of it "," Did they use the microscope, because it seems like they did use the microscope"
130.2,Speaker,,," So I was trying to figure out, like, was I guess I don't understand why my, my answer was wrong because like was the microscope"
130.2,Speaker,,,"Well, yeah"
130.2,Luis,"what,else,oxygen,hydrogen,could,used,luis,what,else,that,oxygen,hydrogen,could,used","What else does it say the oxygen and hydrogen could be used as? Luis What else is to say that oxygen, hydrogen could be used as ",It sounds like that could be used as rocket fuel

130.2,Chris,,," I was gonna say that, well, I guess what I found was that water can be broken down into two parts"
130.2,Chris,,," So hydrogen and oxygen"
130.2,Chris,,,"Um, yeah, I guess I was thinking like, Well, let's see"
130.2,Chris,,," So I guess I was going to say that, like, yeah, that's stuff that also is useful"
130.2,Oliver,"okay,nasa,sent,small,machine,what,could,somebody,help,jazmin,read,about,that","Okay? NASA sent a small machine What could, Can somebody help Jazmin Did we read about that "," So basically, um, I think that, well, it sounds like the microscope like"
130.2,Oliver,,,Yeah
130.2,Oliver,"what,could,improve,that,response,improve,that,response,because,concerned,think,that,need,read,little,more,have,questions,help,somebody,else,help"," What could we do to improve that response Improve that in response Because I am concerned, I think that you need to read a little bit more And if you have any questions, we can help somebody else can help out ","So yeah, I wasn't sure how to make my answer better"

130.2,Farrah,,," So I'm not really sure like why is my answer, like um not right"
130.2,Farrah,"think,well,water,because,looking,what,what,equipment,used,find,water,there,other,important,words","I think so as well water too because we're looking at what was what equipment was used to to find water there any other important words ",I actually have a question
130.2,Farrah,,," I still don't quite understand why my answer was wrong"

130.2,Oliver,"they,discover,first,before,they,could,microphone,okay,oliver,agree,farrah"," So they had to discover it first, before they could use the microphone Okay, so, and Oliver did you agree with Farrah ","Um, yeah"
130.2,Oliver,,," No, I agree, and I think that makes sense to me"
130.2,Jazmin,"okay,that's,type,equipment,anyone,else,know,about,another,type,equipment","Okay, that's one type of equipment anyone else know about another type of equipment ",We also use it in science class to
130.2,Farrah,"maybe,farrah,think,help,luis"," Maybe, Farrah, do you think you can help out Luis? "," Um, I actually was thinking that the microscope is is probably the the tool that they use to discover water on the moon, but it seems like that answers not right"
130.2,Farrah,,,Um sure
130.2,Farrah,,," I'm a little confused about why"
130.2,Oliver,"anyone,help,farrah,find,paragraph,that,microscope,mentioned,oliver,know,what,paragraph,let's,what,point,microscope,according,article,yeah,that's,really,good,question,lunar,orbiter,wouldn't,need,microscope"," Can anyone help Farrah, find the paragraph that a microscope is mentioned in Oliver  So, do you know what paragraph or But let's see what the point of a microscope is according to the article Yeah, that's a really good question and the Lunar Orbiter, it wouldn't need the microscope "," If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a my first go to look really closely"
130.2,Oliver,,," So the paragraph"
130.2,Oliver,,," Let's see, they say in the last paragraph, paragraph three, and they say that the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it"
130.2,Oliver,,,"Um, yeah"
130.2,Oliver,,," OK"
130.2,Oliver,"yeah,exactly,you're,exactly,right,water,heavy,because,that,water,heavy,would,definitely,benefit,know,astronauts,could,know,what's,already,there,instead,have,take,stuff,spaceships,because,very,heavy,like,said,very,cumbersome,what,think,about,oliver"," So yeah, exactly  You're exactly right  And water is heavy  And because that water is heavy, it would definitely be a benefit if you know astronauts could You know, use what's already there instead of have to take up stuff with him in the spaceships, because it's very heavy and like I said very cumbersome So what do you think about this Oliver "," So basically, my thinking"
130.2,Oliver,,,"Um, okay"
130.2,Oliver,"hear,what,said,luis,yeah,mean,that's,great,there,make,that,again","Did you all hear what I said to Luis? Yeah, I mean, that's a great way to say it So on there, you can make that on so again ",Your said to Luis that he has to restate the question and an answer the question

130.2,Chris,,," And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks"

130.2,Farrah,"does,anybody,remember,name,that,piece,equipment,that,reading,piece,astronauts,went,space,company,called,nasa,sent,piece,equipment,space"," Does anybody remember the name of that piece of equipment  So in that reading piece astronauts went to space and the company called NASA sent a piece of equipment up to space ",I think the equipment was a microscope

Your answer was that NASA send a small machine ","The machine, the microscope?"
130.2,Jazmin,"sure,there,were,actual,astronauts,space,they,would,need,equipment,know,survive,don't,think,that's,what,passage,focusing,alright,have,identified,word,microscopic,question,reread,question,once,more,just,back,heads,next,step,what,equipment,scientists,discover,water,moon,take,moment,look,through,just,which,actually,addresses,question,like,through,which,these,three,paragraphs,actually,addresses,question,anybody,have,ideas,that,there,able,observe,said,water,that's,great,question,when,that,actually,microscope,water,you're,partially,right,entirely,there,you're,very,right,oliver,what,entirely,there,just,well,absolutely,right,track,jazmin,what,have","Oh, I'm sure if there were actual astronauts in space they would need this equipment, you know, to survive, but I don't really think that's what this passage is focusing on Alright, so we have identified the word microscopic  The question is this  Now I'm going to reread the question once more, just so we get it back into our heads Now the next step What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon  Take a moment, look through and see just which one actually addresses the question  I'd like for us to go through is which of these three paragraphs actually addresses the question Anybody have any ideas? But is that all we use to get there and be able to observe said water? That's a great question  When we say that you did actually use a microscope to see the water  You're partially right we're not entirely there, you're very right  Oliver, what you got to add? We're not entirely there just yet Well, we are absolutely on the right track  Jazmin, what do you have to add? "," I think that it's the machine"
130.2,Jazmin,,,"Okay, so like I don't really think that it's the microscope"
130.2,Jazmin,,," And the reason that I think that is that it, it talks about like using that to investigate and that sounds like the like the thing that the question, like discover, what it does"
130.2,Jazmin,,," The Lunar Orbiter"
130.2,Oliver,"okay,think,right,what,discuss,your,neighbor,even,group,kind,talk,about,where,guys,your,answers,what,you'd,like,know,more,about","Okay, so I think right now what we can do is discuss with your neighbor or even the group and kind of talk about where you guys got your answers from and what you'd like to know more about ","Okay, we can do that"
130.2,Chris,"okay,well,let's,what,chris,luis,thought,well","Okay, well let's see what Chris and Luis thought as well "," And when we went to NASA"
130.2,Chris,,," I basically like my dad took me to NASA"
130.2,Chris,,," We went and saw like all of this, like, um like all of these like space suits and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff that like Luis was talking about"
130.2,Chris,,,"Okay, so I'm like, here's the thing"
130.2,Jazmin,"okay,that's,really,good,thought,jazmin,would,like,next,want,hear,your,classmates,then,come,back,together,what,everyone,thinks,about,your,terms","Okay, that's a really good thought  Jazmin, would you like to go next  I want to hear from your classmates and then we're going to come back together and see what everyone thinks about your key terms "," I circled equipment, and then discover, then I looked at the text, I also circled, in paragraph two, investigate"
130.2,Jazmin,,,"I was trying to figure out why my answer was wrong, and when I looked at it"
130.2,Jazmin,,," So the word that I circled I circled keywords in the question"
130.2,Luis,"looks,like,farrah,jazmin,okay,that's,good,let's,hear,luis,what,guys,have,both,talked,about,equipment,we'll,come,together,group,response"," So it looks like so far, Farrah, and Jazmin Okay, that's a good job And so let's hear from Luis and see what he has to say  You guys have both talked about equipment  And we'll come together with a group response "," Absolutely"
130.2,Luis,,," Like I said equipment too"
130.2,Luis,,," So I basically um yeah so what I was looking at when I was looking at the reading was I basically was saying"
130.2,Luis,,," I always like to talk"
130.2,Luis,,," And then I said, like"
130.2,Luis,,,"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
130.2,Chris,"well,know,that,couple,guys,your,hand,raised,since,guys,have,similar,answers,chris,would,like,share,your,your,have,been,reconstructed,maybe,that,help,oliver,words"," Well, I know that a couple of you guys had your hand raised  Since you guys may have similar answers  But Chris, would you like to share how your it's your may have been reconstructed and maybe that will help Oliver with his words ","I wasn't really answering the question, so I ok so my answer now would be like that scientists are found craters full of water on the moon by using the lunar orbiter"
130.2,Luis,"were,talking,about,elements,water,element,periodic,table,okay,where,left,split,water,elements,like,said,chris,that,said,that,they,oxygen,tanks,come,what,astronauts,could,water,main"," We were talking about the elements and water in the element periodic table is H2O Okay, so where we left off  If you can split water up into two elements, like you said, how can you and Mr Chris that said that they had to use oxygen tanks come up with what the astronauts could use water on the main for ",Um okay so
130.2,Chris,"water,moon,valuable,using,what,chris,chris,talk,luis,good,your,response,luis,just,wanted,work,together,help,astronauts","Water on the moon be valuable By using what you and Mr Chris and Mr Chris, you can talk to  Luis and see how good your response and Luis just wanted to work together to help astronauts ","Okay, so, so I was talking about the meeting debrief and you said that to Luis And you're talking about them needing to drink on"
130.2,Oliver,"guys,have,guys,were,close,have,chris,history,luis,death","Now, now you guys have not, but you guys were so close  So have Mr Chris and history  Luis out death ","Okay, so, so it sounds that water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and and that it says that I should not breathe oxygen"
130.2,Oliver,,," And that's important"
130.2,Jazmin,"what,other,kinds,equipment,would,guys,that,would,need,find,water,moon,other,than,microscope,okay,looking,those,wouldn't,need,those,space,exploration,anybody,have,ideas,jazmin,there,some,specific,tools,that,were,mentioned,text,remember,back,article","So what other kinds of equipment would you guys say that you would need to find water on the moon, other than a microscope Okay, so looking at those  Yes, you wouldn't need those for space exploration Does anybody have any ideas, Jazmin  There are some specific Tools that were mentioned and the text No if you remember back in the article ","I said  the small machine, but I'm not quite sure why my answer is wrong"

Alright, so lunar orbiter and a microscope, can we find any other tools that scientists use? Think that's it "," Is that right?"

I didn't say it was wrong  Once they found it So, but what did they use to discover the water that, they used a microscope microscope to look at it But what equipment did they use to find it? Go back to the text and look Luis, what do you think? "," Um, well, like when they were on Earth, you know, because that's how you can look from Earth on"
120.4,Luis,,,"Well, I think that because they they really like to have to travel around a lot that they probably use their like their their their like telescopes to look at the water"

120.4,Farrah,,," Like why is my answer wrong"
120.4,Farrah,"okay,tell,your,answer,again","Okay, so can you tell me your answer again "," So basically, my answer was just that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,," Yes"
120.4,Farrah,,,Oh
120.4,Luis,"your,hands,down,good,guys,okay,farrah,agrees,oliver,chris,agree,want,guys,make,sure,that,when,look,always,looking,back,text,because,have,look,that,small,machine,just,like,what,jazmin,said,that,nasa,sent,small,machine,space,right,jazmin,okay,luis,what,create,your,answer"," You can put your hands down  Good job, guys Okay, so, Farrah agrees, Oliver and Chris agree So I want you guys to make sure that when we look, we're off, we're always looking back in the text because we have to look for that small machine just like what Jazmin did  She had said that NASA sent a small machine into space, right, Jazmin? Okay Luis What did you create your answer to? ","Um, so basically what I was saying was that scientists found ice using a small machine"
120.4,Chris,"think,what,need,take,away,that,when,doing,things,really,need,focus,going,back,reading,article,detail,maybe,highlighting,annotating,text,that,understand,detail,what,learning,learning,what,other,questions,have,chris"," I think what we all need to take away is that when we're doing things we really need to focus on going back and reading the article in detail and maybe highlighting it annotating the text so that we can really understand in detail what we're learning  and why we're learning it  Um, what other questions do you have Chris "," And so I i know that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and suit, and I guess I'm wondering, like why that wasn't right"
120.4,Chris,,,I guess like I went to NASA
120.4,Luis,"let's,look,your,answer","Let's look at your answer ","Yeah, I talked about equipment in my answer"
120.4,Jazmin,"what,equipment,used,find,water,moon,about,scientist,repeat,that,please","So who can say what equipment was used to find water on the moon about the scientist Can you repeat that please ","Yeah, I thought it was a small machine"
120.4,Oliver,"remember,that,small,machine,like,went,back,reread,your,text,figure,what,that,machine,actually,called,lunar,orbiter,lunar,orbiter,thanks,sharing,that,your,astronaut,sure,know,there's,always,more,learn,reading,finding,more,details,text,always,learn,more,that's,cool,that,your,astronaut,about,that's,that's,talk,about,scientists,find,water,moon,what,that,small,machine,called,what,piece,equipment,tell"," So you see how if you did remember that it was a small machine and I like how you went back and reread your text to figure out what that machine was actually called a lunar orbiter  It was the Lunar Orbiter Thanks for sharing with us that your dad is an astronaut and I'm sure you do know a lot, but there's always more we can learn by reading and finding more details in the text we can always learn more But that's really cool that your dad is an astronaut about that's that's fun to talk about  Did the scientists use to find water on the moon  What was that small machine called What piece of equipment  Can you tell me "," She said that it was, um, the Lunar Orbiter"
120.4,Oliver,,," I think"
120.4,Oliver,,,"Um, so I saw I listened to Jazmin's answer"

120.4,Luis,,," Well, it's kind of more of like a thought, I guess"
120.4,Luis,,," So I think I'm all good"
120.4,Luis,,,"Um, yeah"
120.4,Luis,"sure,luis,that,your,hand,have,question","Sure and Luis I saw that your hand was up  Do you have a question ","Um, I forgot"
120.4,Farrah,"guys,have,shared,your,responses,that's,been,really,good,liked,that,guys,tried,pull,your,evidence,text,does,anybody,want,volunteer,first,where,kind,critique,through,answers,look,find,maybe,more,detail,support,answer,bits,pieces,that,there,okay,chris,awesome,farrah,first,farrah,want,first"," So you guys have all shared your responses with us and that's been really, really good  I really liked that you guys tried to pull your evidence from the text  So does anybody want to volunteer to go first, where we can kind of critique and go through our answers and look and see how we can find maybe some more detail to support our answer I saw bits and pieces of that in there  For me, okay  Oh, and Chris awesome Farrah, you go first Farrah, you want to go first "," So my answer was basically that you need a scientific microscope to look really close and"
120.4,Farrah,,,Okay
120.4,Farrah,,," So, all right"
120.4,Farrah,"look,original,question,let's,back,decode,that,question,look,says,what,equipment,that,scientists,discover,water,moon,word,here,equipment,hopefully,you'll,remember,talking,about,that,word,here,equipment,discover,alright,let's,look,let's,your,paragraph,three,where,talk,about,discovery,there,farrah,ahead"," So if you look at our original question  Let's go back and Decode that question  But if you look at it, it says what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon  So our key word here is equipment So hopefully you'll remember us talking about that So our key word here is equipment and discover Alright, so let's go look  Let's say at your paragraph three, where does it talk about discovery in there Yes, Farrah go ahead and say it ","Okay, so actually I guess it was really about looking like discover"
120.4,Oliver,"have,something,this,your,hand,raised,maybe,microscope,isn't,what,used,discover","So Def, do you have something to add to this? You had your hand raised  So maybe the microscope isn't what we used to discover it "," I don't quite understand"
120.4,Oliver,,,"No, I was gonna say the same thing as Farrah, but I'm still kind of wondering why our answer is wrong like why the two of us is our answer is wrong"
120.4,Farrah,"okay,well,farrah,just,good,point,repeat,that,oliver","Okay well so Farrah just had a really good point  Can you repeat that for Oliver for me "," Like it doesn't say discovery to we're supposed to match up"
120.4,Farrah,,,"Yeah, so that basically like when you look at it, the third paragraph"
120.4,Jazmin,"find,right,looking,find,something,what,some,those,words,maybe,those,first,couple,paragraphs,through,that,finding,something,jazmin,what,again,again","To find right so if we're looking to find something  What are some of those words, maybe in those first couple paragraphs 1 through 3 that go with finding something Jazmin? What do you say again, can you say again ","Yes, i was going to say investigate"
120.4,Chris,"okay,keep,looking,chris,what,what,help,what,think,know,answer"," Okay, we'll keep looking Chris, what, what can I help you with, what do you think you know the answer "," But I know that they use, you know,"
120.4,Chris,,,"Well yeah, I was gonna say, I went to NASA with my dad and I know that scientists lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and that's not in the reading"
120.4,Chris,"alright,let's,start,jazmin's,group,what,some,things,that,said,make,water,valuable,resource,moon,chris"," Alright, so let's start with Jazmin's group  What are some of the things that it said make water a valuable resource from the moon Chris ","Yeah, okay"
120.4,Chris,,," And it says that"
120.4,Chris,,," So one thing is that water can be broken down into two parts into hydrogen and oxygen"
120.4,Farrah,,,"Yeah, so I was just going to ask like,"
120.4,Luis,"it's,like,finding,something,finding,versus,looking,closely,different,things,question,asking,what,equipment,they,find,water,need,help,getting,started,could,equipment,scientists,used,discover,water,what,then,write,your,response,luis,have,question"," It's like finding something so finding it versus looking at it closely are two different things  So the question is asking what equipment did they use to find the water And if you need help getting started, you could say the equipment and the scientists used to discover water was the what? And then write out your response  Luis Did you have a question? "," Yeah, I just want to remind you that my dad is an astronaut"
120.4,Luis,,,Teacher? Yes
120.4,Oliver,"that's,very,useful,that's,very,good,observation,your,part,chris,then,they,didn't,have,carry,water,they,room,carry,other,things,whether,that's,fuel,other,equipment,more,people,what,your,thoughts,that,that's,certainly,another,great,water,that,could,potentially,grow,your,food,that's,less,things,that,have,carry,that's,great,idea,what,else,think,would,make,water,valuable,oliver"," So that's very useful  So that's a very good observation on your part Chris  And then if they didn't have to carry all the water with and they had room to carry other things whether that's fuel or other equipment or more people  What are your thoughts on that  That's certainly another great use for water is that you could use it to potentially grow your food  And so now that's less things that you have to carry with you That's a great idea What else do you think would make water valuable, Oliver ","Well, I had read the same thing that Farrah was talking about in the last paragraph"
120.4,Chris,"luis,what's,another,that,water,could,valuable,what's,another,thing,they,could,water","OK so Luis what's another way that water could be valuable, what's another thing they could use water for? ","Excuse me, Mr"
120.4,Chris,,," I just thought about something from the story"
120.4,Chris,,," Teacher"
120.4,Chris,,,Water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
120.4,Luis,"broken,down,those,elements,oxygen,hydrogen,break,down,those,elements,then,other,things,yeah,that,that,very,good,answer,you've,probably,heard,water,through,maybe,have,stands,hydrogen,oxygen,what,some,things,oxygen,what,think,luis"," And it can be broken down into those two elements oxygen and hydrogen  And so if you can break it down into those two elements, then you can use it for other things Yeah, that that was a very good answer  You've probably heard water all through maybe have H2O, The H stands for hydrogen and oxygen What are some things you can use oxygen for? What do you think Luis? ",To breathe?
120.4,Farrah,"okay,question,hand,what,equipment,scientist,discover,water,moon,have,thought,about,that,farrah,what,think","Okay, so the question at hand is what equipment to the scientist use to discover water on the moon  So have all you thought about that? Farrah, what do you think? "," It says you need a microscope, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,,"Um, so I think that the um the equipment was the microscope, like in the reading"
120.4,Chris,"what,reading,tell,chris,what,think,they,used,determine,water,moon"," What did the reading tell you? So Chris, what do you think they used to determine the water was on the moon ","Well, so here's the thing, like I kind of thought that, like, um, well I've been to NASA with my dad and like we really"
120.4,Luis,"together,because,just,want,over,things,that,read,article,luis,have,question","Um, and so, yes Together, because I just want to go over a few of the things that we read in the article  Luis Do you have a question ","Oh, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"
120.4,Luis,"know,about,equipment,nasa,uses,ideas,about,they,might,detect,water,from,orbiter","You know a lot about some of the equipment NASA uses Any ideas about how they might detect water on, from the orbiter? "," Now that I've seen a picture of it"
120.4,Luis,,,"Hmm, okay"
120.4,Luis,,," Um, I feel like maybe maybe the camera just kind of look for it"
120.4,Luis,,," And if they see some puddles of water and then that's how they find it"
120.4,Luis,,," Um, I think that, let's see, how would they detect the water"
120.4,Farrah,"luis,mentioned,that,water,puddles,okay,well,microscope,used,look,something,really,closely,because,water,moon,there's,little,it's,small,certainly,water,puddle,know,that,water,moon,water,much,smaller,fact,sample,there,wouldn't,able,without,microscope,it's,very,hard,that's,those,things,because,environment,space,requires,have,been,extra,equipment,right,there's,things,that,they,need,what,want,talk,about,today,what,they,discover,water,moon,then,figure,what,would,value,having,water,moon,thoughts,about,that,well,would,finding,water,moon,useful,what,think,farrah,ahead","and so Luis You mentioned that you can see water puddles Okay, well a microscope is used to look at something really, really closely because the water on the moon is is there's so little of it and it's so small Certainly if you saw a water puddle, you know, that was water on the moon, the water is much smaller  In fact, if you had a sample from there, you wouldn't be able to see it without a microscope  So it's very hard to see That's a use all those things because the environment in space requires him to have been extra equipment right? There's a lot of things that they need to do But what we want to talk about today is, is what they did to discover the water on the moon, and then try to figure out what would be the value of having water on the moon Any thoughts about that? Well, why would finding water on the moon useful  What do you think, Farrah, go ahead ","Well, I was just, I was thinking that you know if I'm, if, if, if the astronauts got, like, you know, thirsty or something, then they could just like drill a hole in the moon, maybe, and then they could drink the water like that maybe"
120.4,Oliver,"certainly,being,able,drink,water,using,other,things,most,part,astronauts,take,water,they,need,them,they,could,find,water,moon,that,would,save,them,having,bring,maybe,brushing,their,teeth,simple,things,like,that,cook,water,very,very,important,have,oliver,what,have","And so certainly being able to drink water and using it for other things  For the most part, astronauts will take the water they need with them, but if they could find a way to get water from the moon, and that would save them having to bring it  Maybe brushing their teeth and simple things like that, or to cook with water, it's very, very important to have So Oliver what do you have ","Well, I was just looking at the clock and I i see about it's time for us to go to lunch"
120.4,Oliver,,," So I just wanted to let you know before we call"
120.4,Farrah,,," And so, do you mind to share with us what your response was,"
120.4,Farrah,,,"Okay, Farrah"
120.4,Jazmin,"think,both,were,were,right,fact,that,they,scientific,tool,just,need,clarify,what,that,tool,guys,really,good,using,your,past,knowledge,microscope,they,different,tool,moon,discover,what,scientists,fine,jazmin,what,what","So I think both of you were, you were right in the fact that they do use the scientific tool, but we just need to clarify what that tool So you guys did a really good job at using your past knowledge on a microscope but they use a different tool on the moon to discover  What did the scientists, fine So, Jazmin, what did  What did you say ",I said that I used to small machine
120.4,Jazmin,"talking,about,convincing,evidence,evidence,means,information,that,supports,statement,being,made,we're,look,evidence,information,that,supports,that,water,moon,could,valuable,astronauts,jazmin,stated,that,there,convincing,evidence,that,correct","So we're talking about convincing evidence  Evidence means information that supports the statement being made  So we're going to look at the evidence, the information that supports That water on the moon could be valuable  It can be of use for the astronauts so Jazmin, you stated that there was not convincing evidence is that correct ","Well, I just, I mean, I do think there's convincing evidence because like they could drink the water and they could stay hydrated and you need water"
120.4,Jazmin,,," So that seems to be convincing the have water"
120.4,Jazmin,"then,jazmin,what,astronauts,could","And then Jazmin, what did you say astronauts could do ",I said they could drink it
120.4,Luis,"teacheralright,luis,without,looking,text,know,answer,that,question","Teacher:Alright, Luis, so without looking at the text, do you know the answer to that question? ","Um, well, I think that they use like oxygen tanks and that they use like space suits and stuff like that"
120.4,Farrah,"right,farrah,what,your,answer,discussion,question","All right, Farrah, and what was your answer to the discussion question ",So my answer was that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
120.4,Chris,"that,great,answer,anyone,help,explain,what,word,discover,means,look,what,question,asking,asking,what,equipment,scientists,discover,water,moon,that,word,discover,really,important"," And that is a great answer  Can anyone help me explain what the word discover means?  But if we look at what the question is asking, it's asking what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon? That word discover is really, really important "," So I think like discover is like how you you find something or you kind of like um like you"
120.4,Chris,,,"Yeah, okay"
120.4,Chris,,," You like find something"
120.4,Jazmin,"once,they,discovered,water,moon,then,scientists,microscope,look,really,closely,that's,what,they,used,discover,alright,jazmin,kind,want,explain,your,answer,okay,what,need,need,back,text,find,what,scientists,used,discover,that,there,water,moon"," And so once they discovered the water on the moon, then the scientists can use the microscope to look at it really closely But that's not what they used to discover it Alright, Jazmin, you kind of want to explain your answer for us?  Okay, so what we need to do is we need to go back in the text and find what the scientists used to discover that there was water on the moon "," So basically what I said was that that NASA used a small machine"
120.4,Jazmin,,,Sure
120.4,Jazmin,,," And that's like the machine that they sent to the moon"
120.4,Jazmin,"then,paragraph,three,goes,talk,about,moon,still,drier,lunar,orbiter,jazmin,small,machine,that,they,sent,looks,deposits,large,polar,crater,these,deposits,very,very,very,small,well,that,means,back,paragraph,what,they,investigate,what,they,investigate,when,investigate,something,normally,discovering,something,what,jazmin"," So then, paragraph three goes on and talk about how the moon is still drier OK, so the lunar orbiter, Jazmin, the small machine that they sent, it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater  Now these ice deposits are very, very, very small Well, that means if we go back to paragraph two, what did they use to investigate  What did they use to investigate?  So when we investigate something, we're normally discovering something What is it, Jazmin ",So they used the lunar orbiter to investigate
120.4,Farrah,"investigate,what,they,discover,when,they,used,that,small,machine,investigate,what,they,discover,farrah,what,they,discover","To investigate and what did they discover when they used that small machine to investigate? What did they discover? Farrah, what did they discover ","They found lots of um, well they found water, they found amounts of water"
120.4,Jazmin,"okay,what,equipment,scientists,discover,water,moon,they,found,very,very,small,amounts,water,those,deposits","Okay, so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? Yes, so they found very, very small amounts of water, those ice deposits "," And so we have to go in just a moment"
120.4,Jazmin,,," But before we went, I just wanted to thank you for"
120.4,Jazmin,,,So they used the Lunar Orbiter to discover water
120.4,Jazmin,"what,believe,they,have,sent,moon"," What do you believe they may have sent to the moon ",So I think they sent a small machine
120.4,Oliver,"second,question,that,asked,about,know,moon,desert,water,valuable,resource,second,question,that,know,second,prompt,that,given,that,there,convincing,evidence,that,water,moon,could,valuable,what,your,answer,that,question","The, the second question that was asked about the you know how the moon is a desert and how water is a valuable resource  The second question that you know the second prompt that was given is is that is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable  What was your answer to that question "," So my answer was no, you know, I'm because I don't think it's ready yet"
120.4,Oliver,,,"Um, OK"
120.4,Farrah,"don't,want,write,down,what,know,about,space,want,each,little,piece,paper,know,what,gave,great,idea,want,each,little,piece,paper,you're,talking,about,space,alright,what,were,talking,about,your,your,article,your,passage,what,equipment,scientists,discover,water,moon,want,share,partner,gonna,have,first,group,farrah,oliver,chris,three,work,together,jazmin,luis,work,share,what,know,about,space,okay,each,other,quietly,okay,y'all,turn,each,other,show,each,other,what,know,about,space,alright,let's,over,okay,let's,over,first,group,farrah,what's,something,that,learn,your,partners"," I don't want you to write down what all you know about space  I want each one of you to get a little piece of paper  You know what you gave me a great idea I want each one of you to get a little piece of paper  You're talking about space  Alright, so what we were talking about your, your article or your passage, it was what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon  I want you to share with a partner, but I'm gonna have the first group, we're going to let Farrah, Oliver and Chris, you get, you three work together and let Jazmin and Luis work and share what you know about space  Okay, with each other, quietly okay so y'all can turn to each other and show each other what you know about space Alright, so let's go over Okay, now let's go over to the first group Farrah, what's something that you learn new from your partners "," And so he was talking about how like in like rocket launches how like the, like, um like, it looks like smoke but it's actually steam comes out of the rocket when it flies up, which is pretty cool"
120.4,Farrah,,,So Pearson was talking about how he went to NASA
120.4,Farrah,,," And he like got to go and visit with his dad"
120.4,Farrah,"there's,dealing,article,because,that's,like,equipment,right,like,read,about,equipment,passage,that,your,answer,refresh,memory,tell,what,your,answer"," And there's a lot dealing with article because that's like equipment right like you read about equipment in the passage that we had  So your answer was, will you refresh my memory and tell me what your answer was? "," My answer was, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
120.4,Farrah,,,Sure
120.4,Luis,"what,equipment,scientists,discover,water,moon","What equipment did the scientists use discover water on the moon ","Okay, so I think that they probably had to use stuff like oxygen tanks and masks and spacesuits and and like, stuff like that, you know,"
120.4,Jazmin,"good,response"," Yes, good response "," And it's called a lunar orbiter"
120.4,Jazmin,,,I think they use the small machine machine
120.4,Jazmin,,," I think that's what they used to discover the water"
120.4,Farrah,"okay,farrah,isn't,that,what,mentioned,you'd,need,scientific,tool,called,what","Okay and Farrah, isn't that what you mentioned? You'd need a scientific tool called a what? ",A microscope

So something that is useful or important already so something that is useful or important Now taking that in mind, I would like to talk about your answers just for a second so Let's see, Farrah and Oliver, you both said, It's not ready yet, or it would take a long time for the scientists to get it and even those both of those things are true They're both true, it doesn't really encompass how water on the moon might be valuable So what are some things all of you that water could be used for on the moon like it says in paragraph four and five Can we look back for some details?

230.3,Luis,"that,have,said,that,scientists,lots,equipment","So I see that some of us have said that scientists use lots of equipment ","I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space"

230.3,Farrah,"both,wrote,that,isn't,that,using,water,isn't,something,that's,happen,anytime,soon,that,right","so you both wrote that this isn't that using this water isn't something that's going to happen anytime soon is that right ",yeah we were thinking that like maybe it's valuable
230.3,Oliver,"yeah,definitely,think,your,answer,telling,where,they,found,tech,where,they,found,water,have,something","yeah definitely and I think your answer is really telling us where they found the tech where they found the water but def I see you have something to say ",yeah so um I just actually looked at the clock and
230.3,Farrah,"think,that,microscope,only,equipment,that,they,discover,water","So you think that the microscope is the only equipment that they use to discover this water ",So I guess it sounds like maybe they have to use both
230.3,Farrah,"focus,word,microscope,that's,something,that,focused"," So you really focus on the word microscope, that's something that you really focused on ","Yeah, because"
230.3,Luis,"luis,don't,actually,start,noticed,that,said,scientists,equipment,like,oxygen,tanks,that,right","And so Luis why don't we actually start with you, I noticed that you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, is that right ",yeah yeah that's my answer
230.3,Oliver,"while,they're,talking,oliver,farrah,noticed,guys,circle,same,thing,that,right","And while they're talking Oliver and Farrah I noticed you guys circle, the same thing is that right ",yeah yeah we saw the same thing on the microscope

230.1,Luis,,,"Um, well, okay"
230.1,Oliver,"oliver,noticed,that,circled,same,thing,what,farrah,choose,that","And Oliver I noticed that you circled the same thing is what Farrah did Why did you choose that ","Yeah, so, um, I said that because on in paragraph three, it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
230.1,Jazmin,"what,confused,about,jazmin","What are you confused about Jazmin ","Well, because if if he got the right answer"
230.1,Jazmin,,," Then I thought that I had the right answer"
230.1,Farrah,"want,know,what,microscope"," And I want to ask you, do you know what we use a microscope for ","I'm like, you know, you use it to like look at small things like in science we look at like bacteria and stuff like that"
230.1,Oliver,"okay,everybody,just,given,their,answers,question,what,equipment,scientists,discover,water,moon,looks,like,text,you're,saying,that,said,same,thing,farrah,circled,same,thing,tell,little,more,about,that,conclusion,farrah,loved,text,good,thinking","Okay, so everybody has just given their answers to our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon  It looks like you dug in the text to you're saying that you said the same thing as Farrah, you circled the same thing  Can you tell me a little bit more about how you got to that conclusion?  And Farrah, I really loved how you dug in the text I see a lot of good thinking ","Um, yeah"
230.1,Oliver,,," So basically, like I circled the same thing, like in the paragraph three, where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
230.1,Farrah,"that,answer"," How did you get to that answer "," Like, I got to the answer, partially by listening carefully to Jazmin"
230.1,Farrah,,,That's a really interesting question
230.1,Farrah,,," And her answer and to our discussions together"
230.1,Jazmin,"what,change,your,answer,jazmin","What did you change your answer to Jazmin "," It was the lunar orbiter, you know what I mean?"
230.1,Jazmin,,,"Basicallt my answer was incomplete, and I was just saying small machine instead of like that"
230.1,Luis,"mention,oxygen,tank,right,mentioned,oxygen,tanks"," Why did you mention oxygen tank All right, you mentioned oxygen tanks ","Um, so the reason that I mentioned it was because I know that like astronauts have to use oxygen tanks when they're going up into space and they have to use, like, stuff like that, in order to walk around"
230.1,Farrah,"okay,what,microscope,look","Okay, what does a microscope look for? how do you use it ","Well, like you use it to like study something"
230.1,Farrah,,," And like look at something really closely, you know what I mean like you, you look at it like like small things"
230.1,Farrah,"well,what,exactly,microscope,help,look,small,thing","Oh, well, what exactly does the microscope do to help you look at small thing ","Um, so I think if I remember it's like you"
230.1,Farrah,,," So in the text is said that, um, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, so like I guess it helps you look at small things"
230.1,Farrah,,," Um, okay"
230.1,Oliver,"there's,something,small,that,they're,looking,water,right,there,anything,else,that,they,could,look,closely,besides,water,microscope"," There's something small that they're looking at is the water All right, is there anything else that they could look closely at besides the water with a microscope? ","Um, well, like, I don't know"
230.1,Oliver,,," Like, what if, like, it's not really in the reading"
230.1,Oliver,,," But like you could look at germs and stuff"
230.1,Chris,"lunar,orbiter,thank,that,great,looking,back,text,tell,where,they,found,water,moon","It is the Lunar Orbiter  Thank you for that  Great job, looking back at the text Can you tell me where they found the water on the moon ","Oh, they found it in the craters that were full of water"
230.1,Chris,"they,find,crater","Did they find it in the crater ","I thought that, um, I thought that's what they said"
230.1,Oliver,"that's,right,they,could,drink,water,future,long,time,oliver,farrah,mentioned,that,ready,think,farrah,oliver,that,valuable,teacherso,being,future","That's right, they could drink the water in the future  And no, not for a long time  Oliver and Farrah, you mentioned that it's not ready  Why do you think Farrah and Oliver that it's not valuable yet Teacher:So, with it being in the future ","Um, so I think that's not valuable yet because it seems like it would be really complicated to actually get the water to a place where you're like,"
230.1,Farrah,"that,would,good,thing,going,back,question,what,equipment,didn't,scientists,discover,water,moon,there,come,your,answer","That would be a good thing So going back to the question  What equipment didn't scientists use to discover water on the moon It was, is there How did you come up with your answer "," And so I found it in paragraph three"
230.1,Farrah,,,"Um, well, I saw the question asked about equipment and so I was looking for a paragraph that talks about equipment and water"
230.1,Oliver,"elaborate,little,more,your,answer,what,equipment,scientist,used,discover,water,moon","Can you elaborate a little more on your answer for what equipment did scientist used to discover water on the moon "," So I circled the same things as Farrah"
230.1,Oliver,,,"Um, yeah, I can totally do that"
230.1,Luis,,," And sometimes I'll watch Nova on YouTube"
230.1,Luis,,,"Well, cuz i i know a lot about space, you know i i watched some TV shows"
230.1,Oliver,"explain,your,answer"," It can be  Will you explain your answer for me? "," Yeah"
230.1,Oliver,,,"Yeah, sure"
230.1,Oliver,,," So it doesn't look like they're ready to pick up any of the water from the moon"
230.1,Oliver,,," Last paragraph, they talking about how hard it will be and how it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money"
230.1,Oliver,,," It's not ready yet because"
230.1,Oliver,,," Okay, so, um, I said no"
230.1,Luis,"well,guys,opportunity,review,discussion,question,what,think,question,asking,that's,great,know,comment,would,what,what,think,your,question"," Well, so do you guys had an opportunity to review the discussion question?  What do you think the question is asking you  That's a great you know comment I would ask you, what, what do you think your question ","Wow, okay"
230.1,Luis,,," So, ah, the question is what equipment did like scientists use to discover water on the moon"
230.1,Farrah,"oliverice,that,used,right,right,very,good,look,word,discover,talk,yourself,again,about,word,discover,share,what,means,each,other,right,anybody,wants,share,that,what,that,mean,farrah,right,find,something,agree,that,everybody,what,back,passage,going,look,oliverice,equipment,discover,means,find,something,right,think,microscope,what,they,microscope,used"," So it's a Oliverice that is used right? All right, very good  Now look at the word discover talk to yourself again about the word discover Share what it means, with each other All right, anybody wants to share that  What does that mean yes Farrah? Right, you find something  Do you agree with that everybody  So what are we going to do  We're going to go back to the passage and we are going to look for the Oliverice or the equipment Discover means to find something right You think it's a microscope  Now what did they say the microscope was used for ",I'm like in the reading?
230.1,Farrah,"what,word,what,what,microscope,used"," What does the word what what was a microscope used to do "," You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
230.1,Farrah,,,"Okay, so, um, let's see, in paragraph three, they said the water they found is microscopic me wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it"
230.1,Farrah,"they,microscope,find,water","Did they use a microscope to find the water ","Oh, like like"
230.1,Farrah,"what,made,that,okay,your,answer,you'd,need,scientific,tool,called,microscope,scope,look,closely"," What made you say that Okay, so you your answer, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope scope to look really closely, so I can ","Well, it says, it says in the question that they're looking for the equipment that was used to discover"
230.1,Farrah,,," So I said, Okay, the key word is equipment"
230.1,Luis,"sometimes,they,don't,everything,reading,because,then,would,reading,forever,answered,last,question,we're,move,question,thank,sharing,that,okay,what,think,valuable,means,know,that,there,water,moon,that,scientists,discovered,question,says,there,evidence,that,water,could,valuable,what,think,that,means,this,asking,could,water,moon,useful,okay,awesome,valuable,means,that,useful,think,that,water,moon,could,useful,scientist,think,okay,what,hydrogen,oxygen","Sometimes they don't put everything in the reading because then we would be reading forever So we answered our last question  So we're going to move on to a new question  Thank you for sharing that  Okay, so what do we think valuable means So we know that there is water on the moon that the scientists had discovered it, but our question says, Is there evidence that the water could be valuable What do you think that means  So this is asking could water from the moon be useful Okay, awesome so valuable means that it's useful So do we think that water from the moon could be useful to our scientist You think yes or no Okay, what are you going to use the hydrogen and oxygen for ","Um,"
230.1,Oliver,"okay,what,mean,that","Okay, what do you mean by that "," You have to do all this stuff to to get it and it's like it's in just like these like small amounts you know we were saying from the last question"
230.1,Oliver,,," It's like microscopic"
230.1,Oliver,,,"Um, well, I guess the waters, not like it's not like immediately ready to use like they were saying in the reading"
230.1,Farrah,"okay,what,mean,that","Okay, what do you mean by that ","Well, okay, so you know how they were saying in the reading, kind of like what I've said like they need like all this"

230.1,Oliver,,,"Um, okay"
230.1,Chris,"someone,what,they,brought,don't,ahead,look,paragraph,there,special,machine,that,they,brought,investigate,that,what,they,sent,chris,what,they,investigate,when,they,there"," Can someone see what they brought Why don't we go ahead and look at paragraph two, to see if there was a special machine that they brought to investigate Yes, that is what they sent  And Chris, what did they investigate when they got there?

230.1,Jazmin,"they,microscopes","So why did you say they use microscopes ",Because that's what they used to look for water
230.1,Farrah,"long,time,said,because,long,time"," Why did you say not for a long time  You said no because not not for a long time ","Because it's gonna take a while for us for the astronauts to be able to find out if it's if it is valuable, or not"

230.1,Jazmin,,," Oh, yeah"
230.1,Jazmin,,," Yeah, it'd be good, so that they could drink it"
230.1,Jazmin,,,"Oh, yeah"
230.1,Chris,"chris,talk,about,water,being,heavy,choose,talk,about,that","Chris, you talk to me about water being heavy  Why did you choose to talk to me about that ","Well, all because that was in the"
230.1,Oliver,"okay,find,important,information,where,when,said,that,said,water,heavy,found,that,first,paragraph,want,another,question,where,that,water,when,they,heavy,while,you're,reading,read,that,sentence,again,talk,oliver,read,that,sentence,again,they're,ready,they,said,they're,ready","Okay, so you did find some important information where  When you said that  So you said water is heavy you found that in the first paragraph And I, I want to ask another question Where it is that water at when they say it's heavy  And while you're reading it So read that sentence again for me  I'm going to talk with Oliver  So read that sentence again for me  Why did you say they're not ready yet They you said they're not ready yet "," So, I mean, they don't have all of that stuff yet so so clearly they they are not ready for for getting water off the moon"
230.1,Oliver,,,"Um, well, because at the end, it says, making this plan will take a lot of time and money, they will need to study the moon surface and build new equipment"
230.1,Jazmin,"okay,lands,where","Okay, so it lands where? ",On the moon
230.1,Oliver,"oliver,said,that,your,answer,that's,awesome,tell,what,that,means","So, Oliver, you said that was your answer too, so that's awesome  Can you tell me what that means ","Yeah, I can because they're talking about how you need a microscope to look really closely at the water"
230.1,Oliver,,," And so, and a microscope is basically a scientific tool, but the scientific tools also equipment"
230.1,Oliver,"okay,equipment,what,this,equipment,something,under,microscope,what","Okay, so it is an equipment  What does this equipment do? If I put something under a microscope, what does it do? ",It helps you look at stuff
230.1,Oliver,"okay,well,tell,might,have,chose,that,answer,what,made,that,microscope,stick","Okay, well, can you tell me why you might have chose that answer  What made that microscope stick out to you "," Like I feel like I guess it's just because it's a piece of equipment and I know that, like we're we're working on the small group"
230.1,Oliver,,,I'm not really sure
230.1,Oliver,,," So we can we can kind of get the right answer, but I'm not really sure why my answer is wrong"
230.1,Oliver,"what,were,using,find","Wow, what were you using it to find? ","Um, we were looking at DNA, like we did a, like a like a swab of our cheek and we were looking at like DNA cells"
230.1,Oliver,,," It was really interesting"
230.1,Farrah,"move,down,paragraph,number,three,find,paragraph,number,three,noticed,farrah,that,talked,about,microscope,your,answer,that,right,let's,talk,about,that,just,little,what,made,choose,that,your,answer"," So we're going to move down to paragraph number three  Can you all find paragraph number three So I noticed Farrah that you talked about a microscope in your answer, that right  So let's talk about that just a little bit  So what made you choose that as your answer "," I know his equipment and also I was looking for where they talked about water and in this paragraph, they talk about the microscope"
230.1,Farrah,,,The question was asking about equipment and so I was looking for where the worst equipment and so the microscope
230.1,Luis,"right,probably,have,extensive,knowledge,outer,space,through,know,stuff,this,group,that,focus,suppose,start,that's,main,goal,what,working,together,extracting,information,from,informative,text,said,scientists,equipment,like,oxygen,tanks,tell,what,what,your,your,answer,number,which,says,what,equipment,scientists,discover,water,moon,where,pull,oxygen,tanks,text,them,discovering,water,your,thought,process,answering,that","Right, you, you probably have an extensive knowledge of outer space through you know TV and stuff, but we're in this group so that we can focus on  So I suppose I will start with  So that's the main goal of what we're working on together extracting information from from informative text And you said, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks Will you tell me what what With your with your answer to, number one, which says what equipment did scientists, you discover water on the moon  Where did you pull oxygen tanks from the text for them, discovering water your thought process was for answering that "," And I know that you can't breathe on when you go to the moon"
230.1,Luis,,," So they need oxygen tanks in order to breathe on the moon"
230.1,Luis,,,"Well, well, like you said, you know, I know a lot about space"
230.1,Farrah,"what,made,choose,that,word,like,that,that,wording,scientific,tool,what,made,choose,word,microscope"," What made you choose that word  And I like that you use that wording scientific tool What made you choose the word microscope ","Okay, so I looked at the key words in the question and I thought the key word for equipment and discuss and when I looked at the reading"
230.1,Farrah,,," What I saw was that the microscope was something,"
230.1,Chris,"just,astronauts,that,need,survive,water,need,survive,water,they,don't,have,carry,ships,anymore,right,chris,chris,your,response,says,water,heavy,it's,good,that,true,does,talk,about,water,being,heavy,come,responded,that"," Is it just astronauts that need to survive with water or do we all need to survive with water  They don't have to carry it in ships anymore  All right, Chris Chris you your response says water is heavy  So it's good So that is true  It does talk about water being heavy, how come you responded with that ",So I was thinking when I was looking at it that well
230.1,Chris,,," Okay"
230.1,Chris,,," So I was thinking the waters heavy and you have to take it on the spaceship"
230.1,Oliver,"kind,both,have,very,similar,responses,ready,luis,sorry,oliver,talk,said,need,figure,yours,farrah's,what,mean,that","You kind of both have very similar responses  It's not ready yet  So Luis Oh no, sorry, Oliver, you talk, you said no So we need to figure out yours and Farrah's  So what do you mean by that "," So I when I mean it's not ready yet, like the water that's on the moon isn't really ready for us to do yet"
230.1,Oliver,,," So, um, it's kind of like, it seems like it would be really hard like so they asked if there was convincing evidence"
230.1,Oliver,,,"Um, so I guess it's kind of, it's kind of interesting"
230.1,Farrah,"well,like,that,shared,your,opinion,your,answer,sometimes,hard,students,even,sometimes,teachers,because,scientist,understand,long,takes,them,figure,things,right,that,understand,little,more,because,agree,like,right,ready,like,that,shared,your,opinion,good,there,like,that,shared,your,opinion,next,time,when,share,your,opinion,just,just,told,think,that,correct,that,sometimes,ready,responded,similar,said,long,time,care,kind,explain,your,answer,little,more,there,convincing,evidence,that,water,moon,valuable,responded,long,time","Well, I do like that you shared your opinion in your answer  And sometimes it's hard for us as students and even sometimes as teachers because we're not scientist to understand how long it takes for them to figure out how to get things right  And so that I can understand a little bit more because I do I agree with you  Like right now, it's not ready and I do like that you shared your opinion, good job there And so I do like that you shared your opinion and next time when you share your opinion, just put it just how you told us  I think that you are correct, that sometimes it's not going to be ready You had responded similar and you had said no, not for a long time  Do you care to kind of explain your answer a little bit more?  So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable and you responded with no not for a long time ","Yeah, absolutely"
230.1,Farrah,,," So I, I wish I could unfortunately because you have to go"
230.1,Oliver,"find,that,your,prior,farrah,writing,that,kind,just,copy,that","So did you find that on your own prior to Farrah writing that or did you kind of just copy that? "," Um, but I found it on my own"
230.1,Oliver,,,"Oh, that's a, that's a fair question"
230.1,Chris,"right,everybody,underline,that,sentence,nasa,send,small,machine,called,lunar,orbiter,investigate,come,that,conclusion","All right, everybody, underline that sentence, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate Or how did you come to that conclusion ","Um, so I kind of was like, um,"
230.1,Oliver,"explain,what,mean,that,oliver,said,circled,same,response,farrah"," Can you explain what you mean by that  Now, Oliver, you said you circled the same response as Farrah "," So basically, Farrah, and I both thought that that the microscope was the thing that they used to discover the water"
230.1,Oliver,,,"Um, yeah"
230.1,,"okay,would,they,able,microscope,discover,water,your,opinion","Okay, how would they be able to use a microscope to discover water in your opinion ","Um,"
230.1,Farrah,"well,congratulations,should,very,proud,your,second,question,that,there,convincing,evidence,that,water,moon,could,value,farrah,you've,mentioned,that,will,long,time,think,that","Well, congratulations, you should be very proud of your dad  So the second question that we had was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be value And so, Farrah, you've mentioned that it will be a long time Why do you think that ","Okay, well in the last paragraph"
230.1,Farrah,,," So it sounds like that"
230.1,Farrah,,," They don't have the money and it'll take a long time"
230.1,Farrah,,," It says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money"
230.1,Farrah,"take,long,time,take,large,investment,money,spent,water,other,words,available,right,away,yeah,that's,certainly,very,true,they,could,what,think,after,while,water,evaluable,once,they,were,able"," It will take a long time to do it and will take a large investment, a lot of money will be spent to get the water  In other words, it's not available right away Yeah, and that's certainly very true But if they could get to it  What do you think  And after a while, with the water evaluable once they were able to get to it "," Yeah"
230.1,Farrah,,," So I guess if they could get to it, it would be"
230.1,Farrah,,,"I mean all yeah cuz water, it's definitely important"
230.1,Jazmin,"okay,it'll,just,take,them,while,important,think,that,jazmin,mentioned,that,that,astronauts,would,need,water,drink,stay,hydrated,that,true","Okay, so it'll just take them a while but it'll be important  And why do you think that Jazmin, you mentioned that That the astronauts would need water to drink and to stay hydrated  Why is that true? "," Um, and I feel like I read it in my book I read it in the story where they talked about that they need water to drink"
230.1,Jazmin,,,"Okay, because, well, you know, like we need water to drink"
230.1,Jazmin,"yeah,that,would,make,valuable,right","Yeah, and so that would make it valuable right ",Yeah yeah cuz you need to drink
230.1,Chris,"astronauts,have,carry,space,that's,right,luis,mentioned,that,that,water,very,sorry,chris,actually,mentioned,that,water,very,heavy,that,right,they,could,water,moon,that,would,certainly,viable,think,would,valuable,they,water,moon,rather,than,taking,with,them"," Astronauts have to carry it in space That's right and Luis mentioned that that water is is very -- sorry Chris  And actually, you mentioned that water was very heavy and that right now  But if they could get water on the moon, that would certainly be viable Why do you think it would be valuable if they can get water on the moon, rather than taking it with them? "," Okay, so I said it was heavy"
230.1,Chris,,,How could it be soluble if they could take water on the arm instead of waters
230.1,Oliver,"value,right,certainly,it's,very,expensive,hard,that,able,water,unless,through,that,have,enough,money,have,enough,time,water,moon,would,then,valuable"," It has no value, right  So certainly, if it's very expensive and hard to do that may or may not be able to get to the water and so unless you can get through it Say that we do have enough money  And we do have enough time to get the water from the moon would then it be valuable? ","I mean, yeah"
230.1,Oliver,,," Cuz, cuz you know water is valuable"
230.1,Oliver,,," Yeah, okay"
230.1,Oliver,,," Water is valuable"
230.1,Farrah,"farrah,what,what,mention,terms,ability,find,water,mentioned,would,scientific,tool,called,microscope,would,they,need,microscope,yeah,that,certainly","So, Farrah, what, what did you mention in terms of the ability to find the water  You mentioned you would use a scientific tool called a microscope  Why would they need to use a microscope Yeah, so that was certainly one, one way to do it ","Well, what I mean"
230.1,Farrah,,," Cuz it said that in the story that was like the last sentence of the stories you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
230.1,Oliver,"really,good,stating,that,scientists,found,craters,full,water,moon,what,made,think,that,that,type,equipment,that,they,used"," You did a really good job at stating that scientists found craters full of water on the moon So what made you think that that was the type of equipment that they used ",I'm teacher
230.1,Oliver,,," Thanks for taking my time to work with us"
230.1,Oliver,,," I'm sorry to interrupt, but I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch"
230.1,Oliver,"that's,something,that's,valuable,them,because,have,have,water,stay,hydrated,you're,very,good,drink,what,makes,believe,that,there's,enough,convincing,evidence,that,there,wasn't,enough,convincing,evidence"," And that's something that's valuable to them because we all have to have water to stay hydrated You're very good drink it  What makes you believe that there's not enough convincing evidence  And you say that there wasn't enough convincing evidence ","Um,"
230.1,Oliver,"okay,circle,equipment"," Okay, why did you circle equipment ","Um I circled equipment, because they're asking in the question they're saying what equipment Did the scientists used to discover the water so it seems like the answer would have to be some kind of equipment"
230.1,Farrah,"very,good,looking,deep,your,question,circle,think,when,circle,that,that,helps,bring,back,because,went,even,deeper,because,just,asked,those,words,that,oliver,used,went,deeper,explained,little,more,that,connection,text,helps,when,circled,that,circle,discover","Very good for looking deep into your question and in circle in it Do you think when you circle that that helps you to bring you back, because you went even deeper because I just asked you, those two words that Oliver used went in deeper and explained a little bit more that he had a connection with the text and it helps you when he circled that  And why did you circle discover ",Discover because they were asking like you know what I mean like what they found the water like discovers like something that you like found the first time and asking like what equipment found the water
230.1,Jazmin,"what,makes,think,could,grow,garden,moon"," So, what makes you think you could grow a garden on the moon ","Because they talk about the water and they said, like the astronauts could be able to drink the water eventually and and be hydrated and you can't survive without water"
230.1,Chris,"thought,that,great,idea,know,that,water's,heavy,look,that,glad,looked,that,detail,about,hearing,shoes,because,heavy","I thought that was a great idea to be you How did you know that water's heavy  Look at that  I'm glad you looked at that detail about hearing the shoes, because it's heavy "," And I could tell you that water is like one of the heaviest things they have to carry on a spaceship"
230.1,Chris,,,"Oh well, cuz okay so I actually knew already because, um, well I guess they said it in the reading, but they but like I knew that because I visited NASA and I know all about NASA"
230.1,Luis,"what,know,about,space","What is it you know about space ","Oh man, I know all this stuff like rocket launches and like equipment and like all this stuff that like people would would use to go into space and like, you know what I mean, like, all kinds of stuff"
230.1,Luis,"what,makes,think,that,wouldn't,want,part,this,group,though,okay,luis,think,know,about,space"," So, what makes you think that you wouldn't want to be part of this group, though Okay, so I Luis so you think are you know a lot about space "," Um, so you wanted to talk to us"
230.1,Luis,,,"Well, cuz you know when you're working with us because we we didn't have the right answer"
230.1,Luis,,," So I feel like I kind of know everything"
230.1,Jazmin,"your,answers,jazmin,really,looks,like,you're,onto,something,there,expand,maybe,your,answer,small,machine","Hi, So I saw your answers and, Jazmin, it really looks like you're onto something there Um, can you expand on maybe your answer of a small machine ","Okay, so basically it's like the thing that they sent up to the moon to go in and like to find the water"
230.1,Jazmin,"what,called,okay,what,what,that,thing"," What is it called Okay, so what is, what is that thing ",It's called the Lunar Orbiter
230.1,Luis,"what,know,about,microscopes","What do you know about microscopes ","Um, so microscopes are like these things that you use to like study something closely, like if if something's really small, then you like look at it that way"
230.1,Luis,"used,moon","How is it used on the moon ","Um,"
230.1,Chris,"well,pertain,article","Well, does it pertain to our article? ","Yeah, definitely"
230.1,Chris,"astronauts,water,very,heavy,know,very,cumbersome,astronauts"," The astronauts and so water is very heavy on and how do you know this Or it's very cumbersome for astronauts ","Um, well, I guess I just kind of know that you know what I mean like that that waters really heavy and it, it's really hard to set it in a spaceship because humans need water, and it makes spaceships really"
230.1,Chris,"tell,chose,lunar,orbiter"," Can you tell me why you chose Lunar Orbiter ","Well, it just kind of looked like the, you know, man"
230.1,Chris,,," Like it just kind of looked like the other like the machine, you know, they said, like what equipment"
230.1,Luis,"okay,read,aloud,read,because,know,everything,about,space,already,know,that,phrase,what,know,have,heard,word,lunar,orbiter,before","Okay, so we read it aloud  You read it for us because you know everything about space already  Do you know that phrase And what do you know, have you heard the word lunar orbiter before "," Yeah"
230.1,Luis,,," Yeah, but I know in the lunar orbiter is"
230.1,Luis,,,"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
230.1,Luis,,," Yeah"
230.1,Luis,,," Okay"
230.1,Luis,,," So I just didn't really know what to like what to circle I just figured"
230.1,Luis,"know,what,microscope"," Do you know what a microscope is "," Yeah, it's like what you look in like a like a like a magnifying glass"
230.1,Luis,,," But it's like you look at smaller things"
230.1,Luis,,,Yeah
230.1,Farrah,"think,equipment,most,important,word","Why do you think equipment is the most important word ","Um, because it's like the first noun in the question"
230.1,Chris,"think,water,most,important,question,word"," Why do you think water is the most important question or word ","The whole the whole story is called water on the moon, so"
230.1,Luis,"there's,evidence,water,being,valuable,seeing,everybody's,responses,looks,like,split,between,water,being,valuable,looking,question,what,have,figured"," And if there's evidence for and water not being valuable  I'm seeing everybody's responses and it looks like we are split between water being valuable  So looking at Question two  And what do you have figured out ","Okay, so I read the story and I looked for the evidence and I pulled something right out of the story and not out of my big massive brain"
230.1,Farrah,"what,confused,about","What are you confused about "," But what the story says that I'm"
230.1,Farrah,,," And so if if they're right that it could be valuable"
230.1,Farrah,,,"Well, cuz I found a different answer"
230.1,Oliver,"think,valuable,resource,oliver","Why do you think it is a valuable resource Oliver "," And then rocket fuel seems like pretty important you know you need rocket fuel in order to go to space"
230.1,Oliver,,," I mean, like everybody needs to drink water"
230.1,Oliver,,,Okay cause on the thing that Jazmin said about drinking it
230.1,Chris,"that,would,crazy,there's,moon,base,moon,then,that,means,what,what,think,that,would,mean","That would be crazy if there's a moon base on the moon, then that means what, what do you think that would mean ",That they could use the fuel to like fill up the rocket and then to go back home
230.1,Luis,"tell,facts,story,that,read","Can you tell me some facts from the story that we read? ","Yeah, sure"
230.1,Luis,,," Okay, so like astronauts go to space cuz are looking for water on the moon"
230.1,Luis,"know,what,people,called,when,they,space,like,what,their,title","Do you know what people are called when they go to space, like what is their job title ","Yeah, they're astronauts"
230.1,Oliver,"oliver,what,made,come,your,answer,choice"," Oliver, what made you come up with your answer choice "," So I was looking for a place where they talked about discovering the water"
230.1,Oliver,,," And I know that we have to find equipment"
230.1,Oliver,,,"Well, I know that the question was asking for water"
230.1,Chris,"come,that,answer,chris,when,talk,about,scientists,found,craters,have,water,moon"," How did you come up with that answer Chris, when you talk about scientists found craters will have water on the moon "," Cuz question was asking, you know them, finding the water like like how Oliver said, so I was looking at the text"
230.1,Chris,,,"Yeah, sure"
230.1,Jazmin,"underline,discover"," Why did you underline discover ","And so basically I repeat visits as he like the question say like, what did they use to define the water or like discovered the water so it seems like that would be"
230.1,Oliver,"correct,answer,masterson,small,machine,called,lunar,orbiter,investigate,because,that,specific,piece,equipment,that,scientist,used,discover,water,moon,give,best,answer,that,very,important,highlight,those,keywords,knows,might,even,learn,something,know,quite,maybe,actually,help,teach,other,students,here,responses,oliver,question,just,said,that,sort,same,thing,farrah,explain,also,same,answer","The correct answer is Masterson a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, because that is this specific piece of equipment that scientist used to discover water on the moon  So you can be give the best answer So, that is why it's very important to highlight those keywords And who knows, you might even learn something new, as  You do know quite a lot  So maybe you can actually help me teach the other students here So I saw responses and Oliver  My question for you just, you said that you sort of the same thing is Farrah  So can you explain how you also got the same answer for me "," And the reason why I thought that, and I think it's like"
230.1,Oliver,,,"Um, yeah"
230.1,Oliver,,," So basically what I was thinking about was that, um, you know, like that the microscope was was the tool"
230.1,Luis,"what,that","What do you say that ","Um, yeah"
230.1,Luis,,," I think that why like here's my thinking on this like"
230.1,Luis,,," Well actually it's a really good question"
230.1,Chris,what," In what way ","Well, like it wasn't in the in the meeting, but I was thinking like they had to use it, you know, so like I was thinking maybe that's the answer with the equipment"
230.1,Farrah,"because,lunar,orbiter,helps,right,helps,farrah,come,your,answer,your,responses,question,what,equipment,scientists,discover,water,moon","Because the lunar orbiter helps with the ice right? And the ice helps  Um, Farrah, how did you come up with your answer  So I saw your responses to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","Okay, so I got my answer from paragraph three and I basically was thinking like you have to use the microscope to see the water"
230.1,Farrah,,," How could you discover it without without seeing?"
230.1,Farrah,,," If you were going to like discover it"
230.1,Chris,"your,text,doesn't,there,astronauts,what,thinking","Your text doesn't say if there are astronauts does it  What are you thinking ","Um, so, like, I'm kind of just, I'm kind of thinking"
230.1,Farrah,"okay,start,farrah,farrah,said,need,scientific,tool,called,microscope,really,look,closely,what,made,microscope,farrah","Okay, I'm going to start with Farrah Farrah, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to really look closely, what made you say a microscope Farrah "," And so I was thinking like, you know, if you want to see like the water and it's really small that you could only find it with a microscope, you know what I mean?"
230.1,Farrah,,,So I was thinking about like what equipment like I know about microscopes from like science class
230.1,Luis,"they,need,oxygen,able,breathe,said,that,scientists,equipment,like,oxygen,oxygen,tanks,okay,luis,let's,look,your,answer,know,when,they,space,that,very,true,could,tell,what,made,oxygen,tanks,right,looking,they,found,water,what,equipment,help,them,discover,water,moon,could,tell,what,made,oxygen,tanks"," They need the oxygen to be able to breathe  You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen, oxygen tanks Okay Luis Let's look at your answer  You know, when they are in space  That is very true So could you tell me what made you say the oxygen tanks But right now we're looking to see how they found the water  What equipment, help them discover the water on the moon  So could you tell me what made you say the oxygen tanks "," I think like the astronauts would have to have"
230.1,Luis,,,"Um, yeah, yeah"
230.1,Luis,,," So I was seeking about oxygen tanks, because, like, well, okay, so I was seeing whenever I see like movies with astronauts or whenever I think about like like watching a moon launch or whatever"
230.1,Chris,"said,scientist,found,craters,full,water,moon,could,could,that,let's,look,yours,could,explain,little,more,about,came,that,answer"," You said a scientist found craters full of water on the moon  I could see how you could say that yes  Let's look at yours  Could you explain a little bit more to me about how you came up with that answer ","I was thinking that when they were saying in the reading like they were saying, okay, so there's ice deposits in the polar crater"
230.1,Jazmin,"what,believe,means","What do you believe it means ",It means something that is small
230.1,Farrah,"well,guys,i've,taken,look,answers,that,gave,question,what,equipment,that,scientists,discover,water,moon,want,take,another,look,article,want,either,underline,circle,words,that,similar,question,words,that,think,would,really,important,while,each,really,good,thought,processes,alright,guys,what,words,guys,pick,that,were,important,terms,your,opinion,what,made,choose,those,words"," Well guys, I've taken a look at the answers that you gave to the question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon  I want you to take another look at the article, and I want you to either underline or circle words that are similar to the question or words that you think would be really important And while each of you had really good thought processes Alright guys so What words did you guys pick out that were really important or key terms, in your opinion  So what made you choose those two words ","Um, well, I chose them because I think that that's the equipment that the scientists you use"
230.1,Farrah,,,"  It's the equipment, because it says that the waters microscopic and then you can't see it without the microscope"

210.4,Farrah,,," But, um, I have a question if that's okay"
210.4,Chris,"clarify,maybe,could,have,been,unmanned,mission,they,just,send,machinery,lunar,orbiter,part,bigger,machine,that,discovered,water","It did not clarify, did it?

210.4,Luis,,," Yeah, ice and water"
210.4,Luis,,,"Right, yeah"
210.4,Oliver,"yeah,understand,feel,like,guys,were,around,answer,looking,more,specific,answer,like,farrah,oliver,guys,said,that,needed,scientific,tool,called,microscope,microscope,actually,just,closer,water,because,water,tiny,that,they,couldn't,with,their,eyes,lunar,orbiter,used,find,water,microscope,used,something,different,small,machine,there's,different,machines,equipment,things,that,they,used","Yeah, so I understand  And I feel like you guys were all around the answer, but we are we're looking more for specific answer so like Farrah and Oliver you guys said that you needed a scientific tool called a microscope the microscope was actually to use just to see closer the water because the water was so tiny that they couldn't see it with their own eyes  The lunar orbiter was used to find the water But the microscope was used for something different  The small machine  So there's two different machines and equipment things that they used "," Any other thing was used for something different"

So you had to have both forms of equipment to figure out the answers that we were looking for in this passage So once we investigated the moon, we could then use our tool to discover more about it There's a lot of things that we need to have whenever we go into space  Now that's very fascinating that you were able to visit NASA That's a great cultural experience and it gives you a little insight into having some prior knowledge as you move forward in your science classes Now astronauts and scientists have to use all kinds of equipment and certain materials that they have to wear when they go into space because it's such an unknown area and we want to be as safe as possible So when you got to see all of those things that NASA you were able to see some of the space suits, some of the tools and equipment that they use And that's probably helped you a little bit with reading this passage and being able to connect some of the experiences that you had back to this packet passage  And you might find out that you'll learn some new strategies that might help you with other prompts or stories or questions that might help you in the future Well, we might can look just a little bit closer  Would that be okay? So I think it might be good for you in the group and listen to some of the strategies I want to share with you guys  Hopefully we can find some strategies that work for you and you can use So we're going to look at some of your answers that you have and ways that we could improve some of them and some strengths that many of you did have in your answers So our question that we have first is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon So before we even look into our text we want to look at our question  The question is specifically asking what equipment did scientists use to discover the water  Oh, text evidence is something I wanted to talk to you guys about  We know that we want to look for some sort of equipment and based around water So text evidence is going to support your answers and pull it straight from the text so that you always know that your answers are close or semi correct So, in the very first paragraph  If you all look at your text it says that scientists have found evidence  Did they use to discover water  So we want to find proof to the question of what equipment So evidence is a really important word because it means that there's going to be proof in our passage Okay so Chris, you said in one of your responses that scientists found craters full of water on the moon  So, you are correct on finding where the water is now we just have to look a little deeper and figure out how we discovered where this water is  Does that make sense And you are absolutely right that is straight from the text, they did find water in these craters ","So I did a good job in finding out where the water is I, I gotta find out what what discovered the water"

110.4,Farrah,"that,machine,that,collected,water","That is the machine that collected the water ","Um,"
110.4,Oliver,,,"Water, and water"
110.4,Farrah,"thank,much"," Thank you so much ","Um yeah I wondering like, I think I'm still confused"
110.4,Farrah,,," Like why my answer is wrong"
110.4,Farrah,"that's,they,would,find"," That's how they would find it "," So did they use the microscope"
110.4,Farrah,,," Okay"
110.4,Farrah,,," Yeah"
110.4,Farrah,,," I'm like, it sounds like they used it"
110.4,Farrah,,," Yeah, that makes sense"
110.4,Farrah,,,Okay
110.4,Farrah,,," So I guess"
110.4,Farrah,,," Did they say they had to do something else before they used the microscope"
110.4,Farrah,"absolutely,would,expensive","Oh, absolutely would be expensive ","Um, so, unfortunately, unfortunately, we, we have to go to our next class"
110.4,Farrah,,," But before we go, I really wanted to thank you"
110.4,Luis,,,Ok ok so scientists sent the Lunar Orbiter to the moon
110.4,Oliver,,,"Like, like, yeah, when you find it"
110.4,Chris,"right,jazmin,means,look,right,discover,question,asked","Right, Jazmin means to look for, right, or to discover as as the question asked you, ","Um, yeah, I was just kind of wondering like, so I went to NASA with my dad and we had a chance to like look at all the displays all the rockets and stuff"
110.4,Jazmin,"they,could,breathe","They could breathe it ","And I just, I'm still kind of confused about how to how to structure the answer so that it's a better answer"
110.4,Chris,"there,other,words,that,important","Is there any other words that are important ","Well, I actually have a question"
110.4,Jazmin,"let's,work,together,find,answer,let's,together,let's,looking,some,scientific,terms,remembers,what,term,there's,term,question,that,looking,equipment,terms,equipment,jazmin"," Let's work together to see if we can find this answer OK, let's see if we can put it together  Let's see, we're looking for some scientific terms  Who remembers what term  There's a term  And the question that we're looking for Yes equipment is one of the terms equipment Jazmin ",I was thinking discover
110.4,Chris,,,"Well for me, I was thinking about water seem to be an important word in the question"
110.4,Jazmin,,,Great
110.4,Chris,,,"So, I mean, that feels like that could be like some tools that they would use to somebody equipment, you know,"
110.4,Oliver,"said,definitely,important,have,water,because,they,stay,hydrated,can't,survive,without,water,definitely,can't,that's,good,idea,seen,your,answer,that,very,true,very,valuable,have,water,said,that,heavy,it's,good,that,they,don't,have,carry,ships,anymore,also,where,chris,added,kind,onto,your,answer,explains,hydrogen,oxygen,could,split,apart,they,could,hydrogen,rocket,fuel,also,because,passage,they,water,other,things,like,garden,like,said,very,valuable,guys,giving,good,answers,that"," You said how it was definitely important to have the water because they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water  You definitely can't Yes, that's a good idea and I seen in your answer  That is very true  So it is very valuable to have the water  And he said that it was heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore Also see where Chris, he added, kind of onto your answer  It explains how hydrogen and oxygen could be split apart and they could use hydrogen for rocket fuel  Also, because in the passage And they can use the water for other things like a garden, like you said, so yes So it is very valuable and you guys are all giving me good answers on that "," And it says,"
110.4,Oliver,,,"I was in paragraph one, it says, water is heavy"
110.4,Chris,"need,water,survive,you're,right","Yes, and you need water to survive  Yes, you're right ","Yeah, I also know, like you said that water splits into oxygen and hydrogen"
110.4,Jazmin,"those,tools,that,they,using,discover,water,moon","Those are the tools that they are using to discover water on the moon ",Okay
110.4,Jazmin,,," So I think that's what they said discovered the water"
110.4,Jazmin,,,"That's what, that's what I think cuz is like investigate's like discover"
110.4,Jazmin,,,Which unfortunately we have to go to our next class
110.4,Jazmin,,," Thank you so much"
110.4,Jazmin,,," But before we go, I just wanted to thank you for working with us a lot of fun"
110.4,Chris,,,"I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, and masks, and suits"
110.4,Jazmin,"ahead,read,rethink,about,your,answer,there,says,there,convincing,evidence,what,before,told,that,what,first,part,just,read,there,want,specifically,look,question,you're,right,need,that","Go ahead and read rethink about your answer there for  It says, Is there convincing evidence What did you say before you told me that what was the first part, you just read there And I want to specifically look at the question And you're right we so we do need that ","Um, that future astronauts could drink the water"
110.4,Jazmin,"what,machine,used,find,water,yeah,lunar,orbiter,when,when,answer,questions,like,again,what's,something,that,need,make,sure,when,answering,question","So what machine was used to find the water Yeah, it's the Lunar Orbiter So when we're going to, and when we answer questions like this again, what's something that we need to make sure we do when we're answering the question ","Well, I guess, I'm not sure, I guess think about it"
110.4,Jazmin,"know,they,were,trying,find,that's,what,they,used,investigate,what,were,they,investigating","Do you know they were trying to find  So that's what they used to investigate what were they investigating ",Ice deposits
110.4,Chris,"your,rights,right,there,water,moon,would,valuable,could,something,that,drink,could,something,that,could,stay,clean,chris,good,answering,that,water,valuable,because,heavy,then,astronauts,wouldn't,have,carry,anymore","Your rights right so if there was water on the moon, it would be valuable It could be something that we drink it could be something that we could use to stay clean Chris you did a good job for answering and you say to that water can be valuable because it's so heavy and then astronauts wouldn't have to carry it anymore "," Yeah"
110.4,Chris,,,I have
110.4,Chris,"don't,ahead,circle,that,then,come,back,just,moment,hear,chris,chris,what,were,gonna,machine,lunar,orbiter"," So why don't you go ahead and circle that and then I'm going to come back to you in just a moment  Let me hear from Chris Chris, what were you gonna say OK, so the machine was the Lunar Orbiter "," So like I guess I'm wondering, like, is that I guess that's not the answer, but didn't they have to use that stuff to find the water?"
110.4,Chris,,,"Okay, so basically, I was gonna say, kind of like, I guess, kind of like what Luis said before, like I went to NASA with my dad and like I know that scientists have to use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and all that kind of stuff"
110.4,Luis,"okay,looked,deposits,large","Okay, so it looked for ice deposits in a large ",Crater
110.4,Oliver,"that,excellent,lunar,orbiter,investigated,microscopic,moon"," That is excellent Yes, the lunar orbiter investigated microscopic us on the moon "," Teacher, it's time for us to go to lunch, but wow I really, really appreciate how"
110.4,Oliver,,,"Oh wow, okay"
110.4,Luis,"absolutely,equipment,they,used,discover,water","Absolutely Equipment they used to discover the water ",I'm okay
110.4,Luis,,," It's like when you got a space, you know and and or when you're looking for the telescope and then you see a new a new planet or no star, and you're like, oh wow you know like I discovered her new star, I discovered a new planet like that"
110.4,Jazmin,,,Good split it in two parts
110.4,Chris,,,"Okay, okay"
110.4,Oliver,"passage,read,that,talks,about,nasa,sent,lunar,awesome,that,good,that,what,wanted,look,lunar,lunar,orbiter,investigate,then,look,sentence,right,after,that,says,lunar,orbiter,land,moon's,south,pole,look,deposits,large,polar,crater,which,good,awesome,which,shows,that,equipment,that,used,lunar,orbiter,help,discover,water,moon,awesome","So in the passage you read that it talks about how NASA sent a lunar awesome that is so so good, that is what I wanted you to look for lunar lunar orbiter to investigate and then, if you look at the sentence right after that, it says this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater Which is good awesome which shows that you now the equipment that was used was the Lunar orbiter to help discover the water on the moon awesome "," I was just looking at the time and it's time for us to go"
110.4,Oliver,,,Sorry to interrupt
110.4,Oliver,,," So we'll have to see you later"
110.4,Luis,,,And Ice deposits are frozen water
110.4,Luis,"that,equipment"," So that is the equipment ","Oh, yeah, yeah"
110.4,Jazmin,"yeah,that's,what,looking,your,perfect","Yeah, that's what I was looking for your perfect ","Oh, OK"
110.4,Jazmin,"think,you've,convinced","I think you've convinced me ","That I guess I still don't know how come I'm in the group kiss my answer was right, I got it from the right place"
110.4,Jazmin,"yeah,that,very,true,both,very,specific,evidence,look,text,where,talks,about,jazmin's,response,good,because,does,lead,answering,question,question,what,equipment,they,answers,nasa,sent,small,machine,okay,jazmin's,response,nasa,sent,small,machine,these,small,small,machine,anybody,find,name,small,machine,that,that,know,that,that,that,expectation,maybe,using,more,specific,language,jazmin,would,maybe,like,revise,your,answer,using,words,that,just,discussed,phrases,that,just,discussed,yeah","yeah That is very true you both do use very specific evidence um Now, if we look at the text where it talks about  So Jazmin's response is really good because it does lead us to answering the question, the question was what equipment did they use  And she answers NASA sent a small machine Okay, so Jazmin's response was NASA sent a small machine These small the small machine can anybody find the name of the small machine? So now that we now that we know that that that the expectation is maybe using more specific language Jazmin would you maybe like to revise your answer using one of the words that we just discussed or one of the phrases that we just discussed yeah ",harvard
110.4,Jazmin,,,"edu: Ok, um NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter"
110.4,Jazmin,,,teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
110.4,Jazmin,"yeah,there","Yeah, there you go ",Oh that's it?
110.4,Jazmin,"yeah,that,correct","yeah that is correct ","Okay, that makes sense because"
110.4,Jazmin,"they,find,them,craters,what,part,text,that,find,that,anywhere,specifically,text,about,jazmin,yeah,they,lunar,orbiter","So they did find them in the craters and but what part of the text did you get that one from? Did you find that anywhere, specifically in the text How about you, Jazmin Yeah, so they use the Lunar Orbiter "," It was NASA send a small machine, but I was like why why is my answer wrong"
110.4,Jazmin,,,so my answer with this
110.4,Jazmin,"yeah,nasa,sent,lunar,orbiter,investigate,moon","Yeah, NASA sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon ","OK, so that's what I should say? NASA sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon?"
110.4,Farrah,"already,lunar,orbiter,part","We already had the Lunar orbiter part ",I think I already put evidence in my answer too
110.4,Farrah,"find,water,moon,because,again,farrah,kind,touched,answer","To find water on the moon, and because Again Farrah kind of touched on it and her answer ",To look at the water on the moon?
110.4,Jazmin,"definitely,lunar,orbit,that's,including,lunar,orbiter,answer","Definitely, the Lunar orbit are so that's why we're including the Lunar orbiter in our answer ",Okay
110.4,Jazmin,,," And then the microscopic word?"
110.4,Luis,,,"Yeah,  they need to breathe when they're out there looking for the water"
110.4,Jazmin,"small,machine,lunar"," So the small machine is the lunar ",Lunar Orbiter
110.4,Chris,"right,lunor,orbiter","All right, the lunor orbiter ","Okay, so"
110.4,Luis,"talked,about,small,machine,that,they,used,what,they,that,machine,luis,lunar,orbiter","So you talked about the small machine that they used and what did they use that machine to do  Luis So the Lunar Orbiter ",Says that they they used it to investigate and it looks for ice deposits and a large polar crater
110.4,Oliver,"they,still","They still had to use it "," I just looked at the clock, it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say"
110.4,Oliver,,,"Excuse me, must go on"
110.4,Oliver,"yeah,look,deposits,large,polar,crater","Yeah, look for ice deposits in a large polar crater "," And we actually have to go to lunch now"
110.4,Oliver,,," I just locked up a lot"
110.4,Oliver,,,I'm so sorry
110.4,Luis,,,"Oh, OK, I see that make sense"
110.4,Jazmin,"that's,thing,that,they,send,then,beginning,discover,water,that's,answer,that,looking"," That's the thing that they send and then in the beginning to discover water That's the answer that I was looking for ","Oh, so I just had to say the name"
110.4,Jazmin,"luis,what,what's,what,have,your,mind,then,unfortunately,don't,think,they,oxygen,tank,this,time,chris,your,answer,scientists,found,crators,full,water,moon,don't,think,they,found,like,amount,just,water,liquid,water,they,found,various,little,small,thing,that,cannot,even,seen,human,they,little,jazmin,saying,small,small,machine,particle,then,find,water,moon,they,microsope,machine,microscope,they,find,water,answer,farrah,correct,right","So so Luis what are you what's what you have in your mind, then Oh unfortunately I don't think they use a oxygen tank in this time So Chris so your answer was scientists found the crators full of water in the moon I don't think they found the for like a big amount of just water liquid water, they found various little small thing that you cannot even seen with the human eye So they use a not use a little And as Jazmin was saying, small small machine to see the particle and then find the water in the moon, yes they put the microsope it's not the machine but the microscope, they use to find a water So the answer for Farrah was correct one right ","So, how did they use that machine, though, because they talked about that too didn't they use that to investigate"
110.4,Chris,"think,today,need,microscope,very,small,amount,they,found,water,think","Yes I think we today, you need to see microscope, so it is very small amount they found the water or I think ",Okay well in the part that i've read it said that they found the water deep in the moon's polar craters and when I go swimming in the deep part of the pool there's more water in the deep part of the pool than in the shallow part of the pool
110.4,Farrah,,,"Agile Teacher Lab: Ya there's a sentence It says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's where I found it"
110.4,Oliver,"just,letting,know,that,small,amount,that,they,found,it's,saying,that,water,that,they,found,small,okay,you're,absolutely,right,does,look,like,lunar,orbiter"," so it's just letting us know that it was a small amount that they found and it's and it is saying that the water that they found was really small Okay, so you're absolutely right, it does look like it's a lunar orbiter ",yeah i'm so sorry but it's time for us to know
110.4,Farrah,"yeah,both,they,both,machines,both,pieces,equipment,tools","yeah it is it's both they use both machines both pieces of equipment or tools ",Okay okay so um I guess i'm still just not sure how the microscope and the Lunar orbiter like how they fit together in the same answer?
110.4,Oliver,"what,want"," what do you want to add? ","Um well so actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I want to say this was such a helpful class"

130.3,Farrah,,,"Oh, interesting"
130.3,Farrah,,," So like you would say both"
130.3,Oliver,"discover,water,moon","To discover water on the moon "," So scientists to the question is like how what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon"
130.3,Oliver,,," Oh, okay, yeah"
130.3,Oliver,,,Scientists use the Lunar Orbiter
130.3,Oliver,,," And you say, like right back scientists use the Lunar Orbiter to discover water on the moon"
130.3,Chris,"says,water,they,found,microscopic,meaning,wouldn't,able,were,looking,straight,would,need,microscope,water,tells,paragraph,three,everyone,that,machine,sent,investigate,lunar,orbiter,looks,deposits,they,used,machine,that,you're,talking,about,lunar,orbiter,investigate,water,deposits,that,makes,sense,then,they,used,microscope,look,more,discover,okay,whenever,astronauts,have,space,there's,oxygen,space,they,have,have,oxygen,tank,mask,things,like,that,able,survive,when,they,space,that,make,sense,they're,using,more,survive,while,they're,discovering,those,things,they're,they're,using,mask,things,discover,water","Says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it  So you would need to use a microscope to see the water It tells you in paragraph three, does everyone see that Machine was sent to investigate This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits So they used the machine that you're talking about the Lunar Orbiter to investigate the water and the ice deposits  That makes sense? And then they used the microscope to look more at it, to discover Okay, so whenever the astronauts have to go into space, there's no oxygen in space  So they have to have an oxygen tank and a mask and things like that to be able to survive when they go into space  Does that make sense?  They're using it more to survive while they're discovering those things So they're not, they're not using the mask and things to discover the water ",Okay
130.3,Farrah,"first,they,find,then,they,could,investigate,using,microscope"," So first they had to find it  And then they could investigate using the microscope "," Okay, that, that, that makes a little more sense"
130.3,Farrah,,," Um,"
130.3,Farrah,,,Gotcha
130.3,Farrah,,," I think, I think that makes sense"
130.3,Farrah,"does,that,make,sense,maybe,instead,tool,word,equipment,answer,your,question"," Does that make sense So maybe instead of tool you can use the word equipment to answer your question ","Yeah, I think so"
130.3,Farrah,"lunar,orbiter,correct,that,small,machine,that,they,find,water,microscope,used,look,more,closer,water","So the lunar orbiter was the correct one  That is the small machine that they use to find the water, the microscope was used to look more closer to the water ","Oh, but I guess"
130.3,Farrah,,," So how do you figure that out"
130.3,Farrah,,," Is it just because you're the teacher, you know, you know,"
130.3,Jazmin,"also,important,that,will,help,them,able,survive,because,they,need,that,water"," And you can also say how it's important that it will help them be able to survive because they need that water ",So I would say yes it's valuable because you need water to drink
130.3,Farrah,"okay,yeah,understand,were,close,i've,seen,that,remembered,detail,passage,wasn't,exact,answer,that,question,your,answer,would,have,been,there,scientific,tool,called,microscope,look,closely,water,were,almost,right,machine,itself,that,they,used,called,lunar,orbiter,that's,what,they,used,deposits","Okay, yeah, I understand you were really close I've seen that you remembered a detail from the passage but it wasn't the exact answer that was to the question your answer would have been so there was a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water So, you were almost right, but the machine itself that they used was called a lunar orbiter  And that's what they used to see the ice deposits ","Oh, so like they like found it using the Lunar Orbiter and then they used the microscope like like to see it"
130.3,Jazmin,"like,that,said,because,take,know,time,money,question,water,valueable,question,answered,think,would,good,investment,because,agree,that,maybe,good,investment,have,water,here,earth,want,water,moon,think,water,valuable,that's,time,time,money,teacher,know,don't,have,money,would,want,spend,extra,money,something,already,have,would,agree,that's,good,investment,could,then,guess,would,that,would,good,investment,because,they,would,could,grow,things,side,planet,would,guess,what,kind,space,plant,would,because,earth,plants,need,oxygen,guess,carbon,dioxide,that,give,sure,that's,space,them,grow","I like that you said no because it's going to take a lot you know of time and money  The question was, is water valueable  But the question you answered was do you think you would be a good investment Because I agree with you that no, maybe it's not a good investment  We have a lot of water here on Earth  So why do we want water from the moon and to um  But I do think water is valuable And two, that's a lot of time time and money and as a, as a teacher, and we know we don't have a lot of money  Why would we want to spend extra money on something we already have So I would agree with you say that's not a good investment We could, and then I guess you would say that it would be a good investment because they would could grow things out side of the planet, but Would it be on me, I guess, what kind of space plant would it be because Earth plants need oxygen to or, I guess, carbon dioxide that we give off  So I'm not sure if that's a space for them to grow ","Yeah, that's a good point"
130.3,Jazmin,,," I didn't think of how the heck"

And they use the microscope to look at the small teeny tiny deposit of water that they had  But to find this equipment on the moon, or to find the water on the moon "," which is the lunar orbiter"
130.3,Oliver,,,They use the equipment
130.3,Oliver,,," Oliver, what's up?"
130.3,Farrah,"could,even,like,another,could,that,would,that's,very,good,answer,nasa,scientists,used,lunar,orbiter,investigate,water,moon,that,takes,words,mean,questions,from,senate's,passage"," You could even say like  And or another way you could say that would be, that's a very good answer NASA scientists used the Lunar Orbiter to investigate water on the moon that takes words from our sin  It's am from our end  I mean, from our questions in its and from the Senate's in the passage ",Yeah
130.3,Farrah,"might,have,circled,water,well,think,that,looking,equipment,used,discover,water,think,equipment,discover,have,circled,other,words,well,agree,jazmin","So you might have circled water as well  But I think that we are looking for the equipment used to discover the water  I think a equipment and discover and you may have circled other words as well  And I agree with you, Jazmin ","I did, yeah"
130.3,Chris,"your,response,just,didn't,specifically,answer,question,yeah,maybe,just,little,more,attention,exact,question,were,correct,they,find,craters,water,moon,that's,kind,they,went,space,they,wanted,there,were,water,these,craters,they,discover,that,fact,there,water,craters,want,know,what,they,find,that,water,like,said,we're,looking,specific,question,look,number,article,machine,that,they,what's,called,lunar,orbiter,rather,than,saying,they,found,water,when,back,text,what,machinery,they,find,that,water,like,said,they,find,water,need,look,specifically,other,question,they,found,that,water,machine,called,lunar,orbiter"," And your response to just didn't specifically, answer the question Yeah, maybe just pay a little bit more attention to the exact question, but you were correct They did find craters of water on the moon  And that's kind of why they went up to space  They wanted to see if there were water in these craters  They did discover that, in fact, there are water in the craters  Want to know what did they use to find that water But like I said, we're if we're looking at the specific question is And if we look in number two in the article the machine that they use what's called the Lunar Orbiter So rather than saying they found the water when you do go back into the text and see what machinery they use to find that water But like you said they did find water, but we need to look specifically other question on how they found that water and it was with the machine called the Lunar Orbiter ",Okay
130.3,Jazmin,"there's,other,equipment,that's,talked,about,this,text,specifically,find,water,they,lunar,orbiter,specifically,find,water,they,equipment,called,lunar,orbiter"," Now there's other equipment that's talked about in this text, but specifically to find the water they use the Lunar Orbiter Yet specifically to find the water they use the equipment, called the Lunar Orbiter ",So we have to go to our next class that is so much for working with us
130.3,Farrah,"called,microscopic,because,often,very,small,wouldn't,need,microscope,well,certainly,small,things,microscope,there's,other,ways,measure,things,that,very,very,small,they,were,simply,describing,size,water,being,microscopic,that,makes,sense,case,they,didn't,doesn't,look,like,they,said,they,actually,microscope,there's,other,ways,detect"," And it's called microscopic because often it is very small, and you wouldn't need a microscope to see it Well certainly you can see some small things with a microscope  But there's other ways to measure things that may be very, very small They were simply describing the size of the water as being microscopic  That makes sense?  So in this case, they didn't  It doesn't look like they said they actually use a microscope But there's other ways to detect it ","Oh yeah, that doesn't make sense"
130.3,Farrah,,," So they didn't actually have a microscope on the moon?"
130.3,Jazmin,"jazmin,haven't,spoken,within,second,paragraph,talks,about,nasa,would,send,small,machine,called,lunar,orbiter,investigate","Jazmin, you haven't spoken yet  Within the second paragraph, it talks about NASA would send, a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ","So, is that just what I was missing was just the name of it?"
130.3,Oliver,"first,scoffing,when,write,answer,would,would,what","It was my first scoffing So when we write our answer We would, we would say  What does it do was ",orbiter was arm
130.3,Jazmin,"text,said,nasa,sent,small,machine,called,lunar,orbiter,investigate"," So in the text  It said, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "," I said that NASA since the small machine, but I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
130.3,Jazmin,,,That's close to my idea cuz I said in my answer
130.3,Chris,"like,luis,said,they,equipment,like,oxygen,tanks,moon,able,survive,moon,however,they,small,machine,find,deposits"," So like Luis said they do use equipment like oxygen and tanks to get to the moon and be able to survive on the moon But however they use the small machine to find the ice deposits "," Yeah"
130.3,Chris,,,Yeah
130.3,Jazmin,"that,true,like,that,went,back,text,support,support,your,answer,agree,jazmin,would,like,know,found,your,answer,however,think,that,they,have,plan,water","Yes, that is true  I like that you went back in the text and had some support to support your answer and I do agree with you And Jazmin, would you like to go, let us know how you found your answer However, I think that they have a plan for the water "," See, I said that, yes, that the water would be valuable"
130.3,Jazmin,,," So astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water"
130.3,Jazmin,,,Yes
130.3,Jazmin,,," And the reason that I said that"
130.3,Jazmin,,," Okay"
130.3,Jazmin,,," And so what I was looking at, basically, I wasn't a paragraph four, and they were saying that"
130.3,Farrah,"doesn't,tell,that,they,microscope,what,just,says,that,would,need,scientific,tool,called,microscope,look,really,closely"," It doesn't tell us that they did use the microscope What does, it just says that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look at it really closely ","Okay, so you just needed to see"
130.3,Chris,"well,again,says,that,nasa,sent,small,machine,called,lunar,orbiter,investigate,believe,that,they,sent,astronauts,there,look,time,that,they,just,they,sent,their,small,machine","Well, again, it says that NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate  So, I do not believe that they sent any astronauts up there to look at it at this time that they just as they sent their small machine ",Gotcha
130.3,Chris,,," Okay, so, so was like, like they may be need that stuff, but they didn't like use it necessarily this time"
130.3,Oliver,"yeah,that's,exactly,pause,just,moment,because,both,have,same,answer,have,same,answer,farrah,microscope,actually,water,like,dress,both,same,time,helped,look,back,looking,don't,think,quite,that,that,they,used,order,find,water,just,quickly,read,because,crunching,time,well,first,three,paragraphs,answers,there,somewhere,very,quickly,read,starting,paragraph,follow,along,says,nasa,sent,small,machine,called,lunar,orbiter,investigate,lunar,orbiter,land,moon's,south,pole,look,deposit,large,polar,crater,these,deposits,very,small,scientists,said,that,sorry,layer,moon's,surface,would,hold,total,about,ounces,water,what,guys,believe,what,think,farrah,oliver,answer,there,that,just,partial,answer,there,scroll,look,back,direct,quote,says,nasa,sent,small,machine,called,lunar,orbiter,investigate,read,rest,paragraph,leads,them,water,right,look,back,farrah,oliver,absolutely,microscope,actually,water,were,choose,answer,correct,however,they,lunar,orbiter,actually,physically,there,essence,kind,both,them,correct,that,make,sense,three,would,probably,lunar,orbit","Yeah, and that's exactly why I pause for just a moment because you both do have the same answer  So you have the same answer As Farrah  You do use a microscope to actually see the water  So I'd like to dress you both at the same time helped me look back, I'm looking at  I don't think it quite is But is that all that they used in order to find the water  I'm just going to quickly read because we're crunching on time Well, the first three paragraphs, the answers in there somewhere,  I'm going to very quickly read starting in paragraph two follow along with me It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon's South Pole and look for an ice deposit in a large polar crater These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that up to one ton sorry one ton of top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water  What do you guys believe what do you think Farrah, and Oliver? Is the answer in there, or is that just a partial answer in there  Let me scroll up if you look back direct quote from it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate you read the rest of the paragraph, it leads them to the water right?  If you look back so Farrah and Oliver, yes, you absolutely use a microscope to see to actually see The water But if we were to choose one answer to be correct However, they use the Lunar Orbiter to actually physically get there So in essence kind of both of them are correct Does that make sense you three  I would probably go with the lunar orbit "," Thank you"
130.3,Oliver,,," We really enjoyed working with"
130.3,Oliver,,," But thank you so much for working with us"
130.3,Oliver,,," And I'm unfortunately we have to go to our next class"
130.3,Oliver,,,"Um, so I think that I understand that the equipment like the answer to the question is the Lunar Orbiter, but I think I'm still not quite sure why"
130.3,Farrah,"this,does,everybody,agree,this,that's,what,were,looking,with,your,answer,wrong,look,closely,question,asking,what,tool,that,sample,your,answer,tools,well,right,idea,about,microscope,about,microscopic,water,molecules"," This is the Does everybody agree with this?  That's what we were looking for With your answer is not wrong  But if you look closely at the question, it was asking what the tool was to get that sample,  your answer was the tools to see it Well, you had the right idea about the microscope about the microscopic water molecules ","Yes, they use the Lunar Orbiter to discover it"
130.3,Farrah,,," And then they use the microscope to study, I think, is that right"
130.3,Luis,"maybe,they,could,oxygen,oxygen,tanks","Maybe they could use the oxygen for the oxygen tanks? ",teachtoreacheveryreader@gse
130.3,Luis,,,edu: yeah that makes sense that's okay so then that's that would be helpful
130.3,Luis,,,harvard
130.3,Chris,"yeah,that's,reason,anybody,have,other,reason,that,they,thought,that,water,valuable,resource,they,could,just,pick,moon,then,they,wouldn't,have,bring,with,them,then,they,could,maybe,even,bring,something,else,that,they,liked,maybe,like,favorite,stuffed,animal,something","yeah so that's one reason does anybody have any other reason that they thought that water was a valuable resource? So if they could just pick it up on the moon, then they wouldn't have to bring it with them and then they could maybe even bring something else that they liked maybe like a favorite stuffed animal or something ",harvard
130.3,Chris,,,edu: I don't think the astronauts are bringing stuffed animals they're like grown ups and scientists and stuff

130.3,Oliver,"what,answer,question,that,that,correct,reason,because,people,were,thinking,microscope,what,were,using,find,water,reality,because,using,small,machine,lunar,orbiter,find,water,anyone,have,questions,about,that","So what is the answer to our question? That is, that is correct  So the reason why we did this was because people were thinking, the microscope is what we were using to find the water, but in reality it was because we're using the small machine, the Lunar orbiter to find water  Does anyone have any questions about that? ","No, no, and I, I was, I just want to say aw thanks teacher, it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch"
130.3,Luis,"they,definitely,could,have,where,you're,coming,when,look,back,question,assets,only,asking,specifically,what,machine,they,used,find,water,other,machines,wanted,write,your,answer,that,they,lunar,orbiter,they,many,other,machines,different,things,could,that,would,right,think,just,saying,lunar,orbiter,perfectly,fine","They definitely could have, and I do see where you're coming from, but when we look back at the question its assets only asking specifically what machine they used to find the water, not all the other machines So if you wanted to write as your answer that they use the Lunar orbiter and they use so many other machines for different things you could, and that would be right, but I think just saying the Lunar orbiter is perfectly fine too ",interesting
130.3,Chris,"that's,exactly,what's,word,looking,that,they,have,something,very,similar,that,they,take,space,they,actually,find,that,they,needed,microscope,really,what,like,then,name,it--,lunar,orbiter,then,looks,very,very,close,surface,they,look,deposit,li--,chris,that's,kind,like,little,microscope,it's,basically,microscope,they,deep,picture","Yes, that's exactly what's the word I was looking for But for that, they have something very similar that they take it to the space so they can actually find that  They needed a microscope to really, really see what the ice was like  And then the name for it-- it's lunar orbiter  And then it looks very, very close to the surface, and they look for ice deposit in li-- Chris? So that's kind of like a little microscope So it's basically a microscope so they can see really deep in the picture "," So they didn't need that stuff"
130.3,Chris,,,"Oh, I was just wondering because I've been to NASA with my dad, and we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff"
130.3,Jazmin,"that,true,they,that,second,part,article,number,where,said,nasa,sent,small,machine,called--,you'd,that,text,they,called,lunar,orbiter,investigate,what,they,found,moon,that,just,another,specific,looking,text,what's,happening,like,jazmin,tool,rereading,text,would,have,seen,that,there,name,which,lunar,orbiter,explained,that,they,sent,small,machine","And that is true, they did  And we saw that in the second part of the article, number 2, where it said, NASA sent a small machine called-- and you'd see that in the text, they called it a Lunar Orbiter, to investigate what they found on the moon So that is just another specific way of looking to see in the text what's happening  So like you, Jazmin  But if we use the tool of rereading the text, we would have seen that there was a name for it, which is the Lunar Orbiter  You explained that they sent a small machine "," Yeah, OK, I see that"
130.3,Jazmin,,,Oh Yeah
130.3,Jazmin,,," OK, I see that one right there"
130.3,Luis,"takes,room,spacecraft,mentioned,their,response,could,raise,your,hand,know,what,look,paragraph,sentence,after,says,takes,room,spacecraft,tells,would,good,have,water,moon,luis","takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft  Who mentioned this in their response, could you raise your hand? Do you know what this is look into paragraph for the sentence after it says it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft it tells us why it would be good for us to have water on the moon, yes Luis? ",So yeah
130.3,Farrah,"were,talking,about,paragraph,three,talks,about,question,multiple,parts,let's,like,over,question,what,equipment,scientists,discover,water,moon","You were talking about how, in paragraph three, it talks about the question has multiple parts to it um so let's like go over the question, so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ",okay okay so we're both right
130.3,Jazmin,"that's,okay,reading,referenced,small,machine,called,moon,lunar,orbiter,investigate","that's Okay, so in the reading it referenced i'm the small machine it's called a moon lunar orbiter to investigate ","yeah Okay, I see that right there"
130.3,Jazmin,"yeah,what,what,meant,that,basically,just,want,make,sure,that,you're,stating,information,that's,written,text,instead,saying,like,wrote,nasa,sent,small,machine,next,time,write,nasa,send,small,machine,called,lunar,orbiter,moon,instead","yeah so what I, so what I meant by that, basically, is just you want to make sure that you're stating the information that's written in the text, so instead of saying like you wrote NASA sent a small machine next time you can write NASA send a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to the moon instead ",RER: I have to write more words?
130.3,Oliver,"right,that,know,lunar,orbiter,what,discover,water,moon,answer,question","Right, so now that we know a lunar orbiter is what we use to discover water on the moon, how can we re re answer this question?

130.3,Jazmin,"we're,using,microscopic,part,prove,that,need,lunar,orbiter","we're using the microscopic part to prove that we need a lunar orbiter ","Oh OK OK, I understand okay"
130.3,Chris,"good,full,answer,what,equipment,scientists,discover,water,moon,would,scientists,used,lunar,orbiter,discover,water,moon,microscope,able,microscopic,amounts,water,right,there,were"," So a good full answer to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon would be scientists used the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon and a microscope to be able to see the microscopic amounts of water Right, there were two "," So I also know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too"
130.3,Chris,,,I just wanted to say that I went to NASA
130.3,Chris,"that's,very,smart,that's,very,good,thing,point,there's,more,than,just,those,pieces,equipment,that,scientists,have,astronauts,have,moon,they,pieces,equipment,that,astronauts,absolutely,would,have,question,said,what,they,discover,water,oxygen,tanks,their,suits,that,wouldn't,part,that,answer"," That's very smart  That's a very good thing to point out  There's more than just those pieces of equipment that scientists have to use and the astronauts have to use to get to the moon  But they are pieces of equipment that astronauts absolutely would have to use Our question said, what did they use to discover water? So oxygen tanks and their suits, that wouldn't be part of that answer ","Yeah, OK"
130.3,Farrah,"begin,step,mentioning,lunar,orbiter,step,would,mentioning,microscope,farrah"," So we're going to begin by step one mentioning the Lunar Orbiter and step two would be mentioning the microscope yes Farrah ","Well actually it's it's time for us to go right now, but I wanted to say thank you for reminding us that we have to go back and read the whole thing to make sure that we didn't just pick part of the answer, but we actually find the whole answer"
130.3,Farrah,"yeah,wasn't,just,water,here,earth,might,find,like,giant,lakes,full,water,moon,would,that,your,answer,wasn't,wrong,they,also,machine,called,lunar,orbiter,just,needed,little,more,addition,using,microscope","Yeah so wasn't just water  It was ice  So here on earth you might find like giant lakes, full of water, but on the moon  I would say that your answer wasn't wrong at all  They also use the machine called the Lunar Orbiter You just needed a little bit more so in addition to using a microscope "," So it's both"
130.3,Farrah,,,"Oh, OK"
130.3,Oliver,"that,said,that,we're,reading,text,says,water,they,found,very,microscopic,microscopic,means,small,right,yeah,says,says,will,would,need,scientific,tool,called,microscope,look,very,closely,we're,actually,looking,piece,equipment,that,they,find,water,need,look,that,word,discover,wouldn't,able,water,unless,this,lunar,orbiter,that,would,like,best,answer,ever,think,included,microscope,your,your,answer,lunar,orbiter,want,microscope,important,that,that,have,both,things,thing,that,looking,forward,lunar,orbiter","Yes, it's that so it said that if we're reading the text it says the water they found is very microscopic microscopic means small right? Yeah, so it says  It says it will you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely So we're actually looking for the piece of equipment that they use to find the water So we need to look at that word discover, and you wouldn't be able to get to the water, unless you had this Lunar Orbiter  That would be like the best answer I can ever ask for So I think if you included a microscope in your and your answer with the Lunar Orbiter  And if you want it bad microscope, you can But it's important that we add that we have both things But the thing that we're really looking forward to the Lunar Orbiter ",Okay

130.3,Chris,"believe,then,them,microscope,look,closely,find,water","I believe so, yes And then one of them is a microscope to look at it closely to find a water ","Right yeah because you said, well, that the craters you said they're not full of water, like, I thought right because the water is so small"

130.3,Farrah,"well,could,both,because,need,lunar,orbiter,investigate,then,what,need,water,itself","Well, it could be, both because you need the Lunar orbiter to investigate and then, what do you need to see the the water itself ","Oh well, the microscope"

110.2,Jazmin,"weren't,wrong,they,would,probably,need,microscope,they're,test,water"," So you weren't wrong at all They would probably need a microscope, if they're going to test the water ",But then why is my answer wrong?

110.2,Jazmin,"they,wouldn't,need,that,order,protect,them,while,they're,outer,space,moon"," They wouldn't need all that in order to protect them while they're in outer space or on the moon ","So did they send the astronauts with the machine or did they just send the machine, Chris?"
110.2,Farrah,"what,machinery,needed,locate,find,able,particles,moon,both,correct"," On what machinery is needed to to locate and find and to be able to see the particles from the moon Both of you are correct ","Okay, that makes sense"
110.2,Farrah,"said,think,scientific,tool,called,microscope,look,closely"," So you said you think of the scientific tool is called a microscope to look really closely at it ",Yeah yeah

110.2,Luis,"luis,have,question"," Luis You have a question? "," Like, I know all about space, like, I don't think I should be in this group, because I don't really get answers about space like wrong"
110.2,Luis,,,"Um, yeah, I guess this is kind of a question"
110.2,Luis,,," Um, so here's the thing"
110.2,Luis,"well,that,that's,correct,they,discover,water,moon,because,what,just,described,they,moon,there,other,equipment,that,think,they,used,discover,water,could,look,back,text,think,about,what,they,actually,discovered,water,moon,they,have,have,certain,equipment,moon","Well, that, that's correct But how did they discover water on the moon? Because what you just described is how they got to the moon Was there any other equipment that you think they used to discover water by, could you look back on the text and think about what they actually use to discovered water on the moon  They have to have certain equipment to get to the moon ","I didn't really read it so I can read it, I guess"
110.2,Chris,"also,says,second,paragraph,that,they,they,could,breathe,oxygen,they,those,suits,they,oxygen,tanks,when,they're,moon,when,they're,space,thank,that,added,comment,yeah,you're,exactly,right,here"," And it also says in the second paragraph, um, that they do, they could not breathe oxygen  So they do use those suits and they do use oxygen tanks when they're up on the moon and when they're in space  So thank you for that added comment Yeah, you're exactly right here ","Okay, so I'm reading it now"
110.2,Chris,,," So how can that be the right one, because they don't have discover in this one"
110.2,Chris,,," And the other thing I guess is that I don't see them talking about water in the paragraph about the Lunar Orbiter"
110.2,Chris,,," Oh, I do see look for ice"
110.2,Chris,"microscope,used,there's,more,details,that,answer,show,that,understand,text,chris,your,hand,thank,waiting,there,other,other,equipment,also,used,it's,probably,just,piece,equipment","A microscope was used and there's more details that we can add to our answer to show that we understand the text Chris your hand was up thank you for waiting  There was other some other equipment also used so it's probably not just one piece of equipment ",Yes
110.2,Chris,,," So I was kind of thinking like, um, I was thinking that well, I went to NASA and I know that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and maybe they use know that when they were finding like all that water in the craters"
110.2,Farrah,"that's,great,thing,circle,alright,let's,read,question,what,question"," So that's a great thing to circle Alright, so let's read the question, what does the question say ","Um, what equipment did telling us to discover water on the moon"
110.2,Jazmin,,,RER: The lunar orbiter?
110.2,Farrah,"what,else,what,some,other,benefits","What else, what are some other benefits ",I don't remember
110.2,Farrah,,," The other thing it was the thing that you said Jazmin it's it's it if you if you can get water up there, then you don't have to take it with you, I guess"
110.2,Farrah,"your,answer,needs,little,further"," Do you see now why your answer needs to go a little bit further ","Um, I think I began to see, but I'm still kind of confused because so if they use the Lunar Orbiter to to find it, they couldn't see it without the microscope, like they had to go out and look at the crystals, right?"
110.2,Jazmin,"remind,jazmin,what,your,answer,this,question,eventually,think,should,along,what,oliver,said,don't,think,quite,ready,that,think,that,maybe,long,research,future,that,could,possibility,that,think,that,maybe,long,research,future,that,could,possibility,that","can you remind me, Jazmin, what was your answer to this question  So eventually I think should go along with what Oliver said I don't think we're quite ready for that yet, but I do think that maybe a long, as we research and in the future, that could be a possibility that but I do think that maybe a long, as we research and in the future, that could be a possibility that ",I said that it definitely would be useful because the scientists can drink water and and people can't survive without water

310.1,Jazmin,,," Like when I said like NASA used a small machine like the initial one was was not quite right, because I didn't say orbiters right?"
