Opening	C	Alright students let’s get started. How are you doing today? {S1}	How they're doing
	R+	Good!	Me too!
	R-	OK I guess	Well, this lesson should be fun for you!
	I	Today we are going to learn about (polygons). {S2}	
	C	What are we going to learn about?	
	R+	Polygons!	You betcha!
	R-	Not sure...	It's polygons!
	I	Your goal by the end of the lesson is to tell me what a polygon is, and identify polygons from a list of options. {S3}	Goal
	I	Polygons are an (important) topic in our math class. {S4}	Polygons are important
	I	You will be using polygons for the rest of 4th grade, and into middle school as well.	You'll use them in 4th grade
Review	I	Before we begin, let’s review some important information we learned about earlier this week.{S5}	Review last weeks' lesson
	Q	Look at this shape, what is it? {S6}	What's this shape (triangle)
	R+	A triangle	Yes, that is a triangle. A triangle is a polygon.
	R-	A square	That’s OK, this is a triangle. A triangle has 3 sides. A triangle is a polygon.
	R-	I don't know	That’s OK, this is a triangle. A triangle has 3 sides. A triangle is a polygon.
	Q	Look at this shape, what is it? {S7}	What's this shape? (quad)
	R+	A quadrilateral	Yes, that is a quadrilateral. A quadrilateral is also a polygon.
	R-	A triangle.	That’s OK, this is a quadrilateral. A quadrilateral has 4 sides. A quadrilateral is a polygon too.
	R-	I don't know	That’s OK, this is a quadrilateral.
	Q	Look at this shape. What is it? {S8}	What's this shape? (pentagon)
	R+	A pentagon	Yes, that is a pentagon. A pentagon is a polygon.
	R-	Would you believe a hexagon?	That’s OK. This is a pentagon. A pentagon is also a polygon.
	R-	I don't know	That’s OK. This is a pentagon. A pentagon is also a polygon.
Polygon	I	Now let’s see the definition for polygon. Get your pencils ready to write this down. {S9}	Announce  definition
	I	A polygon is a closed shape with 3 or more straight sides.{S10}	Give polygon definition
	Q	What is a polygon? {S11}	What a polygon is
	R+	A closed shape with 3 or more straight sides.{*Write}	Yes! Great job telling me what a polygon is.
	R-	A closed shape.{*Write}	There's more to it. A polygon is a closed shape with 3 or more straight sides.
	R-	I haven't a clue	No, let’s look at the definition again. A polygon is a closed shape with 3 or more straight sides.
Examples	I	Let’s look at some examples of polygons. See this triangle. This is a polygon {S12}	Give more examples
	W	Why is this a polygon?	Why triangle is a polygon
	R+	Because it is a closed shape, and has 3 straight sides.	Amazing! Yes! Great job using your mathematics language.
	R-	It is round?	No, it is a polygon because the triangle is closed, and has 3 straight sides.
	R-	Not really sure what it is	
	R++	Because it is a closed shape, and has 3 straight sides.	You've got it now!
	W	Why is this an example of a polygon? {S13}	Is hexagon is a polygon
	R+	It is a closed shape and has more than 3 sides.	Yes! Really good – you know your polygons!
	R-	It has some flat sides.	There's more to say, This is a polygon because the hexagon is closed, and has 6 straight sides.
	R-	Not really sure why	No, this is a polygon because the hexagon is closed, and has 6 straight sides.
	R++	It is a closed shape and has more than 3 sides.	Yes! Really good – you have it now!
Nonexamples	I	Let’s look at some (non examples) of polygons. {S14}	Introduce non-examples
	W	Why is this shape not a polygon? {S15}	Why is (circle) not a polygon
	R+	It is round. Polygons have straight sides.	Excellent work
	R-	It is round.	It is round, yes, but there is more to polygons than being straight.
	W	So why isn’t it a polygon? {S16}	Why it isn't
	R+	Because polygons have to have straight sides.	You have it now!
	R-	It is a polygon	No, this is not a polygon. Polygons have straight sides – in a circle the sides are round
	R-	I havent the foggiest	Polygons have straight sides – in a circle the sides are round
	Q	Look at this shape. Is this a polygon? {S17}	Is (open figure) is a polygon
	R+	No	Right, it is not a polygon.
	R-	Yes	No, this is not a polygon. See here the shape has an open side? That means it is not a polygon. Polygons are closed shapes and have 3 or more straight sides
	R-	I don't know	No, this is not a polygon. See here the shape has an open side? That means it is not a polygon. Polygons are closed shapes and have 3 or more straight sides
	W	So why isn’t it a polygon? {S18}	Why it isn't a polygon
	R+	It has an opening. Polygons are closed shapes with straight sides.	Very good
	R-	It doesn't have straight sides	Polygons have straight sides with 3 or more sides
	W	Again,  why is this shape not a polygon? {S19}	Ask again why it isn't a polygon
	R+	It has an opening. Polygons are closed shapes with straight sides.	Very good
	R-	It is not filled in	Polygons have straight sides with 3 or more sides
Close	I	Yes! Great job today. Thank you! {S20}	Close class
Addition	Q	What does 2+2 equal?	
	R+	The answer is 4	
	R-	Would you believe 22?	
	Q	Why? {F59}	
	R+	Because I added them on my fingers	
	R-	I just guessed	
Time	Q	What time is it?	
	R+	Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country	
	R-	I don't know, but thanks for asking	
	Q	Why?	
	R+	I looked on a clock	
	R-	I don't really know how to tell time yet	
LizaTalk	Q	Liza talk	
	R+	Hello, How  are you today?	
	R-	I really don't feel much like talking now	
WhoKnows	Q	Who knows the answer?	
	R+	The answer is of course true!	
	R-	There are no true answers, only questions	
Agree	A	Do you all agree?	
	R+	Yes	
	R-	No	
	Q	Why? {F66}	
	R+	The time is now	
	R-	This land is my land, this land is your land
